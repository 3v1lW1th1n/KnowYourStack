If not, please feel free to close this and direct me in the right direction.\r\n\r\nIs using a SemVer compatible version number a requirement for NuGet packages? [The only documentation I could find on this topic](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/nuget/reference/package-versioning) talks about SemVer for package versions but it also briefly mentions the possibility of having four part versions:\r\n> A zero in the fourth part of the version number\r\n\r\nSo, is it possible to use a version number that consists of four parts for a NuGet package? And if it is possible: Does that come with any disadvantages?\r\n\r\nThe use case is that we are currently working on a database driver and wondered whether we could include the version number of the database in the version of the library to communicate to users which version of the library is compatible with which version of the database. Since the database already has a version number that consists of three parts (like `0.3.0`), a fourth part seems to be necessary to differentiate between versions of the library for the same database version (like `0.3.0.1`, `0.3.0.2`, and so on).\r\n\r\n(Some context: The database in question is [JanusGraph](janusgraph.org) and [we are currently discussing](https://groups.google.com/d/msg/janusgraph-dev/A55fIfpdhhA/HnPgl90ZAAAJ) about how to handle versioning for driver libraries.)"},{"Id":"8385444521","Type":"IssuesEvent","CreatedAt":"2018-10-08T16:43:34","Actor":"jainaashish","Repository":"NuGet/Home","Organization":"NuGet","RawContent":null,"RelatedAction":"closed","RelatedUrl":"https://github.com/NuGet/Home/issues/7283","RelatedDescription":"Closed issue \"Handle signed packages SHA for post restore validation with project lock file\" (#7283) at NuGet/Home","RelatedBody":"Currently we write down SHA of signed packages with the signature file which is different than the original SHA of the same package when it's not signed when we extract a package on disk either as part of install or restore. This will potentially break our SHA validation as part of post restore operation with repeatable build (project lock file) feature because then if a lock file already has a unsgined package SHA and later that package is repo signed by nuget.org, then any further restore validation will fail which will also fail the restore operation.\r\n\r\nSo there are multiple suggestions to solve this issue, such as:\r\n- Write the original SHA of the package avoiding Signature file so that it's consistent with unsigned package. That way we won't need to change at multiple places but the down side is it will break existing 4.6 to 4.8 clients so we'd need to ask customers to clean their NuGet global packages folder before opting into project lock fle.\r\n\r\n- Another option is to create a new SHAFile to keep track of original SHA of the package and use that to validate post restore. This will have the advantage to not break existing clients and not needed to clean global packages folder but the downside is that we'd need to change at multiple places starting the way we figure out if package is coming from global packages folder or not, then extraction of the package, and finally the validation.\r\n\r\n- 3rd option is to continue with the existing code of writing SHA, but change the way we validate SHA of signed packages. So for signed packages, instead of using SHA from the assets file, we use SignUtility apis to get the original SHA and compare that wrt lock file. This will work with existing clients as well as won't need to change at too many places but the downside is to retrieve original SHA of the package specially when package is Author + Repo signed.\r\n\r\n- more options.....\r\n\r\n@anangaur @rrelyea @PatoBeltran @dtivel \r\n"},{"Id":"8385411890","Type":"IssuesEvent","CreatedAt":"2018-10-08T16:37:10","Actor":"nkolev92","Repository":"NuGet/Home","Organization":"NuGet","RawContent":null,"RelatedAction":"closed","RelatedUrl":"https://github.com/NuGet/Home/issues/6780","RelatedDescription":"Closed issue \"Rename DefaultCredentialsCredentialProvider to something more meaningful\" (#6780) at NuGet/Home","RelatedBody":"https://github.com/NuGet/NuGet.Client/pull/2126#discussion_r179299994"},{"Id":"8384173266","Type":"IssuesEvent","CreatedAt":"2018-10-08T13:23:28","Actor":"mattleibow","Repository":"NuGet/Home","Organization":"NuGet","RawContent":null,"RelatedAction":"opened","RelatedUrl":"https://github.com/NuGet/Home/issues/7375","RelatedDescription":"Opened issue \"Differentiating Between Win10 and Nono Server\" (#7375) at NuGet/Home","RelatedBody":"I am not too sure if this is the correct place, but this is not really a problem - more a question.\r\n\r\nI am building a library (SkiaSharp) that does some font subsetting using the FONTSUB.DLL.

Those 30 are projects like data access layers, common objects, primitives, etc.  Some of those projects depend on others in the same solution via project reference, and there are quite a few cases where both the project and the project referenced will result in nuget packages. \r\n\r\nWhen building the solution, via TFS, i have a script the current build number as the file version and informational version for assemblies, as well as in the nuspec files for each project. This script is executed before any compilation.\r\n\r\nGiven a minimal example of a Primitives (mostly interfaces( assembly and a DataRepository assembly that has a project reference on the Primitives assembly., the way I handle the nuget dependency versioning between the two packages is to use a value of SAME in the nuspec for the dependency version. The DataRepository nuspec would look like this...\r\n\r\n```\r\n<id>DataRepo1</id>\r\n<more elements/>\r\n<dependencies>\r\n  <dependency id=\"Primitives\" version=\"SAME\"/>\r\n</dependencies>\r\n```\r\n\r\nThe versioning script script that runs during build will locate these \"SAME\" token values and replace them with the current build number as well. This results in the desired behavior; two packages are produced with only the files each needs and the dependencies are handled correctly.  Using a nuspec also seems to be a necessity as there are usually additional files that just packing against a csproj does not capture, and packing against a csproj has always seemed to produce inconsistent results.\r\n\r\nThis isn't a terribly complicated mechanism to accomplish what is necessary, but I think this is probably a scenario that was considered at some point during the building of NuGet.  Is there an easier way to go about this that does not require partitioning the solution (not going to happen within the next few years) or staged builds (too complicated for this)  and still gets the result?  And will this even be possible if changing to netstandard and the package reference format ?\r\n"}],"ResultType":"GitHubEvent"},"Announcements":{"Events":[{"Id":"8059595751","Type":"IssuesEvent","CreatedAt":"2018-08-02T22:42:29","Actor":"anangaur","Repository":"NuGet/Announcements","Organization":"NuGet","RawContent":null,"RelatedAction":"opened","RelatedUrl":"https://github.com/NuGet/Announcements/issues/30","RelatedDescription":"Opened issue \"Show source repository information for packages on nuget.org\" (#30) at NuGet/Announcements","RelatedBody":"The spec to **Show source repository information for packages on nuget.org** , is ready for **review**:\r\n\r\n|Spec wiki|Discussion issue|\r\n|:----------|:------------------|\r\n|[Show source repository information for packages on nuget.org](https://github.com/NuGet/Home/wiki/Show-source-repository-information-for-packages-on-nuget.org) | https://github.com/NuGet/NuGetGallery/issues/4941 |\r\n\r\n**Note**: This is a short term feature to just light up the repository information on nuget.org using the `<repository>`  metadata in the nuspec.
