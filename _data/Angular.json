To extend webpack configuration, we used below npm module -\r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/meltedspark/angular-builders\r\n\r\nWe updated the angular.json file as per documentation of above module.\r\n\r\nWe were able to successfully use this module to extend webpack config but observed that our loader was run for all html files within project except index.html. Here is our custom webpack config that we used alongside the module -\r\n```js\r\nconst path = require('path');\r\nmodule.exports = {\r\n module: {\r\n    rules: [{\r\n      test: /\\.html/,\r\n      use: [\r\n          '<custom-loader>'\r\n       ]\r\n    }]\r\n }\r\n```\r\nWhile debugging, we found that index.html is handled separately using IndexHTMLWebpackPlugin by CLI which we assume might be the cause of this behavior.\r\n\r\n**Why we need custom loader?**\r\nWe have a large website developed in a federated model and maintained by many teams across different geographic locations. To maintain consistency across all pages for Header/Footer content we have developed it separately as a Preact application. We use this Webpack loader to update index.html with HTML/JS/CSS of our application.\r\n\r\nWe are using Index.html to inject the code to keep Preact application out of Angular context.\r\n\r\n@alan-agius4 I had discussed this with @mgechev during Angular conference last week and he suggested me to file a bug and reach out to you","Url":"https://github.com/angular/angular-cli/issues/14392","RelatedDescription":"Open issue \"Angular CLI not allowing custom webpack loader to run on index.html\" (#14392)"},{"Id":"442388147","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2019-05-09T20:19:54","Actor":"kyliau","Number":"14391","RawContent":null,"Title":"build: fix external block in BUILD files","State":"closed","Body":"external code block should not include deps.","Url":"https://github.com/angular/angular-cli/pull/14391","RelatedDescription":"Closed or merged PR \"build: fix external block in BUILD files\" (#14391)"},{"Id":"442344937","IsPullRequest":false,"CreatedAt":"2019-05-09T17:19:47","Actor":"alexeagle","Number":"14390","RawContent":null,"Title":"Before running a third-party schematic, inform the user","State":"open","Body":"Make sure that users know who to file issues or escalate for help when `ng update` or `ng new` runs third-party code.\r\n\r\nThis should ensure that users don't waste a day having us redirect their issues.","Url":"https://github.com/angular/angular-cli/issues/14390","RelatedDescription":"Open issue \"Before running a third-party schematic, inform the user\" (#14390)"},{"Id":"442202417","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2019-05-09T17:12:23","Actor":"alan-agius4","Number":"14388","RawContent":null,"Title":"fix(@angular/cli): print full error when package is not found","State":"closed","Body":"Before: \r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/17563226/57452250-00627e00-726c-11e9-80fe-3a8a7645d9d9.png)\r\n\r\nAfter:\r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/17563226/57452296-18d29880-726c-11e9-8a55-01c87d352ac9.png)\r\n\r\n","Url":"https://github.com/angular/angular-cli/pull/14388","RelatedDescription":"Closed or merged PR \"fix(@angular/cli): print full error when package is not found\" (#14388)"},{"Id":"442099961","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2019-05-09T17:11:58","Actor":"alan-agius4","Number":"14385","RawContent":null,"Title":"fix(@angular-devkit/build-angular): propagate protractor errors during execution","State":"closed","Body":"","Url":"https://github.com/angular/angular-cli/pull/14385","RelatedDescription":"Closed or merged PR \"fix(@angular-devkit/build-angular): propagate protractor errors during execution\" (#14385)"},{"Id":"441996395","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2019-05-09T17:11:34","Actor":"clydin","Number":"14381","RawContent":null,"Title":"refactor(@angular-devkit/schematics): update rxjs usage in rules","State":"closed","Body":"rxjs has improved over time and this updates the rules to take advantage of improvements where applicable.

Please describe:\r\n</code></pre>\r\n\r\n## Current behavior\r\nIn Angular 5, I was able to use -webkit-line-clamp to limit text to 1 or 2 lines depending on the context.  After upgrading to Angular 6, this stopped working.  I reverted back to v5 and it worked again.  The scss styling I am using is <pre><code>\r\n    -webkit-line-clamp: 1;\r\n    display: -webkit-box;\r\n    overflow: hidden;\r\n    text-overflow: ellipsis;\r\n    -webkit-box-orient: vertical;\r\n</code></pre>\r\n\r\n\r\n## Expected behavior\r\n-webkit-line-clamp should continue to work after upgrading\r\n\r\n\r\n## Minimal reproduction of the problem with instructions\r\nI created a project with Angular CLI for v5, added an element that wraps, then upgraded the project to Angular 6.  The git project can be found here: https://github.com/briantq/ng-line-clamp  I have two branches, v5 and v6.  v5 is Angular 5 and when running 'ng serve' will render correctly.  v6 is the upgrade to Angular 6 and when running 'ng serve', will not truncate. \r\n\r\n\r\n## What is the motivation / use case for changing the behavior?\r\nFor list views, we don't want to render full content, instead only a preview.  Due to responsive design, we don't know how much text we need to render so rely on line-clamp.  Preview renders way too much content and is no longer a manageable. \r\n\r\n## Environment\r\n\r\n<pre><code>\r\nAngular version: 6.X.X\r\n<!-- Check whether this is still an issue in the most recent Angular version -->\r\n\r\nBrowser:\r\n- [ X ] Chrome (desktop) version 66\r\n- [ X ] Chrome (Android) version 66\r\n- [ ] Chrome (iOS) version XX\r\n- [ ] Firefox version XX\r\n- [ ] Safari (desktop) version XX\r\n- [ X ] Safari (iOS) version 11.3\r\n- [ ] IE version XX\r\n- [ ] Edge version XX\r\n \r\nFor Tooling issues:\r\n- Node version: 8.9.4\r\n- Platform:  Windows\r\n\r\nOthers:\r\nNot that I can think of.
