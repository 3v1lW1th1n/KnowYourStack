The idea behind this data structure is to expose information about CSS classes present on a given element.\r\n\r\nTo illustrate it let's consider the following example:\r\n`<div class=\"foo {{exp}}\"\">` where `exp` is initially an empty string (`''`).\r\n\r\nGiven the above we would expect the following:\r\n* `expect(debugElement.classes['foo']).toBe(true)`\r\n* `expect(debugElement.classes['bar']).toBe(undefined)`\r\nand this is the case. \r\n\r\nNow let's assume that `exp` flips to `'bar'` so we can expect the following:\r\n* `expect(debugElement.classes['foo']).toBe(true)`\r\n* `expect(debugElement.classes['bar']).toBe(true)`\r\nand this holds true.\r\n\r\nNow, let's flip `exp` back to `'bar'` to an empty string (`''`):\r\n* `expect(debugElement.classes['foo']).toBe(true)`\r\n* `expect(debugElement.classes['bar']).toBe(???)`\r\n\r\nThe question here is this: what the value of `debugElement.classes['bar']` should be? `undefined` or `false`?\r\n\r\nIn VE the answer was `false` - in other words, VE was tracking not only _presence_ of a given class but also its _state_ in the past. Tracking such state would require a testing-only, mutable data structure.\r\n\r\n### Implementation choices\r\n\r\nThe VE implementation based on debug services was a source of memory leaks and increased complexity so we've decided to change this implementation in ivy. Unfortunately, the side effect of this implementation change is that to support VE semantics we had to resort to usage of `Proxy` [which is not supported in IE10/11](https://caniuse.com/#search=proxy).\r\n\r\nSeems like we are facing a choice here between  IE10/11 support and a breaking change to the data structure returned by `DebugElement.classes`\r\n\r\n### Breaking change\r\n\r\nRemoval of `Proxy` usage would result in a breaking change for the following situation:\r\n* a CSS class is added to an element and then _subsequently removed_;\r\n* a test asserts on the _lack_ of a CSS class in the following way:  `expect(debugElement.classes['bar']).toBe(false)`\r\n \r\nA change in a test is simple (`expect(debugElement.classes['bar']).toBe(false)` => `expect(debugElement.classes['bar']).toBeFalsy()`) but it is a breaking change that might have negligible impact on the existing code.\r\n\r\nAs the additional data point - so far we've decided to go with such breaking change for the similar  `debugElement.attributes` collection (the reasoning being that the \"never present\" vs. \"was there at one point but got removed\" situations should be indistinguishable from a test point of view). \r\n\r\n### Notes on the API design\r\n\r\nWe are having those discussions partly to the API design choices. The `debugElement.classes`, as it stands today, exposes too much implementation details. A better API might look like follows:\r\n`debugElement.hasClass('foo')`\r\n","Url":"https://github.com/angular/angular/pull/34328","RelatedDescription":"Open PR \"refactor(ivy): remove usage of Proxy for IE10/11 compatibility - WIP\" (#34328)"},{"Id":"535779703","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2019-12-10T14:50:14","Actor":"sonukapoor","Number":"34327","RawContent":null,"Title":"fix(docs-infra): convert hard-coded rxjs examples into proper mini-te‚Ä¶","State":"open","Body":"‚Ä¶stable files\r\n\r\nIt also updates some indention issues with the code that is part of inline tables.\r\n\r\nFixes #31024\r\n\r\n## PR Checklist\r\nPlease check if your PR fulfills the following requirements:\r\n\r\n- [X] The commit message follows our guidelines: https://github.com/angular/angular/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md#commit\r\n- [ ] Tests for the changes have been added (for bug fixes / features)\r\n- [X] Docs have been added / updated (for bug fixes / features)\r\n\r\n\r\n## PR Type\r\nWhat kind of change does this PR introduce?\r\n\r\n<!-- Please check the one that applies to this PR using \"x\". -->\r\n\r\n- [ ] Bugfix\r\n- [ ] Feature\r\n- [ ] Code style update (formatting, local variables)\r\n- [ ] Refactoring (no functional changes, no api changes)\r\n- [ ] Build related changes\r\n- [ ] CI related changes\r\n- [X] Documentation content changes\r\n- [ ] angular.io application / infrastructure changes\r\n- [ ] Other...

For example: I have a following component:\r\n\r\n```ts\r\n@Component({\r\n  selector: 'hello',\r\n  template: `<h1>Hello {{name}}!</h1>`\r\n})\r\nexport class HelloComponent  {\r\n  public name: string = \"\";\r\n\r\n  @Input() set firstName(value: string) {\r\n    this.name += value;\r\n  }\r\n\r\n  @Input() set lastName(value: string) {\r\n    this.name += value;\r\n  }\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nIn this case, the`firstName` input setter used to run before the `lastName` input setter as their order is defined in the component class. So no matter in what order users provide values to input properties, it was possible to receive them in our desired order:\r\n\r\n```html\r\n<!--displays Hello JohnDoe-->\r\n<hello firstName=\"John\" lastName=\"Doe\"></hello> \r\n\r\n<!-- still displays Hello JohnDoe as it should-->\r\n<hello lastName=\"Doe\" firstName=\"John\"></hello>\r\n```\r\n\r\n__After Ivy__:\r\n\r\nI realized that input values are set as they are provided in the template, not by the order of their corresponding properties in the class. For example, using the exact same component in Ivy, we get the following result:\r\n\r\n```html\r\n<!--displays Hello JohnDoe-->\r\n<hello firstName=\"John\" lastName=\"Doe\"></hello> \r\n\r\n<!-- displays Hello DoeJohn-->\r\n<hello lastName=\"Doe\" firstName=\"John\"></hello>\r\n```\r\n\r\n## üî¨ Minimal Reproduction\r\n<!--\r\nPlease create and share minimal reproduction of the issue starting with this template: https://stackblitz.com/fork/angular-issue-repro2\r\n-->\r\n\r\nAngular 8: https://stackblitz.com/edit/angular-input-order\r\n\r\nIn Ivy: https://ivy.ng-run.com/edit/cOAOZzmer5154DINiEZT?open=app%2Fapp.component.ts\r\n\r\n<!--\r\nIf StackBlitz is not suitable for reproduction of your issue, please create a minimal GitHub repository with the reproduction of the issue.\r\nA good way to make a minimal reproduction is to create a new app via `ng new repro-app` and add the minimum possible code to show the problem. \r\nShare the link to the repo below along with step-by-step instructions to reproduce the problem, as well as expected and actual behavior.\r\n\r\nIssues that don't have enough info and can't be reproduced will be closed.\r\n\r\nYou can read more about issue submission guidelines here: https://github.com/angular/angular/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md#-submitting-an-issue\r\n-->\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n## üåç  Your Environment\r\n\r\n**Angular Version:**\r\n<pre><code>\r\n<!-- run `ng version` and paste output below -->\r\n<!-- ‚úçÔ∏è-->\"@angular/core\": \"9.0.0-rc.5\" with Ivy\r\n\r\n</code></pre>\r\n\r\n**Anything else relevant?**\r\n<!-- ‚úçÔ∏èIs this a browser specific issue?

Reproduction\r\n\r\nHMR is broken using the package.json created by react-app. I can fix HMR replacing build-angular and cli with regressed versions above.\r\n\r\n## üî• Exception or

references absolute paths (eg. `/index.html`, `/*.css`...).\r\n\r\nIt will work fine if the app is deployed in the root directory (ie. with `<base href=\"/\"`).\r\n\r\nBut it will fails if the app is deployed in a subdirectory (ie. with `<base href=\"/en/\"`), as absolute paths won't take base href into account.\r\n\r\nSuch base hrefs are the default scenario when using the new `--localize` option (CLI will set a different base href for each locale), meaning service-worker and v9 i18n don't work out of the box.\r\n\r\nAs paths in `ngsw-config.json` are part of the `dist` build, ie. from the files impacted by base href, these paths should be relative and not absolute.\r\n\r\n## üî¨ Minimal Reproduction\r\n- create an app with v9, with translations\r\n- `ng add @angular/pwa`\r\n- `ng

Drag-Drop - Object Configuration on attributes","State":"open","Body":"#### Feature Description\r\n\r\nImplementing the possibility of elements with only one attribute and one object passing all the options, is more organized and easier to deploy.\r\n\r\nExample:\r\n```html\r\n<div [DragDropList]=\"{\r\nlistID: 'idlist1',\r\nlistConnectedTo: ['list2', 'list3', 'list4', 'list5'],\r\nlistData:

and more organized changes. could be applicable on any Angular-Drag-Drop.

Having such a function would make the animations much more consistent and beautiful.\r\n\r\n#### Use Case\r\n\r\nWhen CSS animation is enabled it appears incomplete when deleting, adding or moving items.
