Up until now, a single compiler option\r\ncalled \"fullTemplateTypeCheck\" was available to configure the level\r\nof template type checking. However, now that more advanced type checking\r\nis being done, new errors may surface that were previously not reported,\r\nin which case it may not be feasible to fix all new errors at once.\r\n\r\nHaving only a single option to disable a large number of template type\r\nchecking capabilities does not allow for incrementally addressing newly\r\nreported types of errors.

In that case, the template type checker will validate the\r\ncorrectness of the attribute with respect to the directive's declared\r\ntype of the input, which would typically be `boolean` for the `disabled`\r\ninput. Since empty attributes are assigned the empty string at runtime,\r\nthe template type checker would report an error for this template.\r\n\r\nThis commit introduces a strictness flag to help alleviate this\r\nparticular situation, effectively ignoring empty attributes that happen\r\nto be consumed by a directive.","Url":"https://github.com/angular/angular/pull/33273","RelatedDescription":"Open PR \"feat(ivy): strictness flags for template type checking\" (#33273)"},{"Id":"509491875","IsPullRequest":false,"CreatedAt":"2019-10-19T19:34:07","Actor":"sod","Number":"33272","RawContent":null,"Title":"Ivy - ASSERTION ERROR: Expecting LContainer","State":"closed","Body":"Angular Version: 9.0.0-next.12\r\n\r\nI tried ivy with our app and hit an error.

The [default value](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli/blob/e8cdfa6020b8856498f9ea86b1fbbddb3f767975/packages/ngtools/webpack/src/compiler_host.ts#L48) of this option is `false`.\r\n\r\nThe Angular CLI creates an instance of the `AngularCompilerPlugin` and sets this option to `true`, with no way of overriding this behavior.\r\nhttps://github.com/angular/angular-cli/blob/e8cdfa6020b8856498f9ea86b1fbbddb3f767975/packages/angular_devkit/build_angular/src/angular-cli-files/models/webpack-configs/typescript.ts#L94\r\n\r\nSetting this to `true` made sense when there was no way to customize the webpack config. However, now that CLI Builders are [officially supported](https://blog.angular.io/introducing-cli-builders-d012d4489f1b), it will become more common for builders like [`@angular-builders/custom-webpack`](https://github.com/just-jeb/angular-builders/tree/master/packages/custom-webpack) to be used to customize the webpack configuration. But with `directTemplateLoading` being hard-coded to `true`, there is no way to customize the webpack configuration to allow a loader to manipulate a component's template.\r\n\r\n### Describe the solution you'd like\r\n\r\nLet the `directTemplateLoading` option be set in the `angular.json` file. For example:\r\n\r\n```json\r\n\"architect\": {\r\n  \"build\": {\r\n    \"builder\": \"@angular-builders/custom-webpack:browser\",\r\n    \"options\": {\r\n      \"directTemplateLoading\": false,\r\n      \"customWebpackConfig\": {\r\n        \"path\": \"./webpack.config.js\"\r\n      },\r\n      \"etc\": \"etc\"\r\n```\r\n\r\n\r\n### Describe alternatives you've considered\r\n\r\nThis idea has been raised before in a couple of issues, but both were closed with workarounds or hacks. Since CLI Builders are now officially supported, I feel that a proper solution is required.\r\n\r\n#### Use `template` and inline loaders\r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/angular/angular-cli/issues/14855#issuecomment-510592634 suggests using `template` and specifying the loaders in the require statement instead of using `templateUrl`.\r\n\r\n> Hi all, we had a chat around this, and we think that if you want to use webpack specific stuff you can use [ngx-build-plus](https://github.com/manfredsteyer/ngx-build-plus) or otherwise you can update the require statements to include the raw-loader import syntax ie: `require('!raw-loader!./path-to-template.html')` as suggested above.\r\n\r\nManually specifying the same loaders for _every_ component template is not maintainable.\r\n\r\n#### Hack the webpack config\r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/angular/angular-cli/issues/14534#issuecomment-496666971 states that a hack is required to set `directTemplateLoading`:\r\n\r\n> Closing as the above method is a necessary step to augment an existing plugin within a webpack configuration.\r\n\r\nThe \"above method\" is to search through the plugins in the webpack config and find the `AngularCompilerPlugin`, get it's options, change the `directTemplateLoading` value to false, create a new instance of the plugin with the modified options and replace the original plugin in the webpack config. Very hacky.\r\n\r\n#### Use `template` with loaders in the webpack config\r\n\r\nSimilar to the outcome of #14855, you can:\r\n\r\n1. Install `@types/node`.\r\n2. Add `\"node\"` to the `types` property of the tsconfig file.\r\n3. Change `templateUrl: './foo.component.html` to `template: require('./foo.component.html')`\r\n\r\nand the custom loaders specified in the webpack config will be used. _But_ this requires you to make changes to the way the component's template is specified by default, which is easy to forget to do. That's just asking for problems because forgetting to change `templateUrl` to `template` means it won't be passed through the custom loaders.\r\n\r\nIn addition to that, the Angular Language Service complains that _\"Component 'FooComponent' must have a template or templateUrl\"_.  \r\n\r\nGiven the choice between this and hacking the webpack config to recreate the `AngularCompilerPlugin`, I'd choose hacking the webpack config. üòÅ ","Url":"https://github.com/angular/angular-cli/issues/15861","RelatedDescription":"Closed issue \"Allow directTemplateLoading to be set from angular.json\" (#15861)"},{"Id":"508538465","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2019-10-17T17:45:13","Actor":"filipesilva","Number":"15866","RawContent":null,"Title":"fix(@ngtools/webpack): don't set ngprogram to null","State":"closed","Body":"It should be undefined instead: https://github.com/angular/angular/blob/cd7b1992193be85f3317a4ef793b13c03ac2b215/packages/compiler-cli/src/ngtsc/program.ts#L161\r\n\r\nFix https://github.com/angular/angular-cli/issues/15857","Url":"https://github.com/angular/angular-cli/pull/15866","RelatedDescription":"Closed or merged PR \"fix(@ngtools/webpack): don't set ngprogram to null\" (#15866)"},{"Id":"507895035","IsPullRequest":false,"CreatedAt":"2019-10-17T17:45:13","Actor":"filipesilva","Number":"15857","RawContent":null,"Title":"Follow up on @angular-devkit/build-angular spec_large error","State":"closed","Body":"This should really be using Ivy but was getting the error below on every second build.\r\n`ERROR in Cannot read property 'incrementalState' of null`\r\n\r\nSee https://github.com/angular/angular-cli/pull/15847/commits/0a4dd9b209cbaaaabbe25bc09cb538948fa4b148","Url":"https://github.com/angular/angular-cli/issues/15857","RelatedDescription":"Closed issue \"Follow up on @angular-devkit/build-angular spec_large error\" (#15857)"},{"Id":"508528782","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2019-10-17T16:55:57","Actor":"filipesilva","Number":"15864","RawContent":null,"Title":"test: add jit-prod e2e","State":"closed","Body":"","Url":"https://github.com/angular/angular-cli/pull/15864","RelatedDescription":"Closed or merged PR \"test: add jit-prod e2e\" (#15864)"},{"Id":"508261344","IsPullRequest":false,"CreatedAt":"2019-10-17T16:44:06","Actor":"Mobitelnoc","Number":"15859","RawContent":null,"Title":"Angular new project creating error occurred.How can fix this all installations are done perfectly with latest modules","State":"closed","Body":"üõëüõëüõëüõëüõëüõëüõëüõëüõëüõëüõëüõëüõëüõëüõëüõëüõëüõëüõëüõëüõëüõëüõëüõëüõëüõëüõë\r\nAngular new project creating error occurred.\r\n[2019-10-17T05_45_55_373Z-debug.log](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli/files/3737643/2019-10-17T05_45_55_373Z-debug.log)\r\n\r\nPlease file any Docs or angular.io issues at: https://github.com/angular/angular/issues/new/choose\r\n\r\nFor the time being, we keep Angular AIO issues in a separate repository.\r\n\r\nüõëüõëüõëüõëüõëüõëüõëüõëüõëüõëüõëüõëüõëüõëüõëüõëüõëüõëüõëüõëüõëüõëüõëüõëüõëüõëüõë\r\n","Url":"https://github.com/angular/angular-cli/issues/15859","RelatedDescription":"Closed issue \"Angular new project creating error occurred.How can fix this all installations are done perfectly with latest modules\" (#15859)"},{"Id":"508542636","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2019-10-17T15:08:30","Actor":"cexbrayat","Number":"15867","RawContent":null,"Title":"fix(@schematics/angular): remove unneeded debugElement in test","State":"open","Body":"The generate tests in `app.component.spec.ts` are using `fixture.debugElement.componentInstance` whereas we can directly use `fixture.componentInstance`.
