The article does cover how to overcome that. However, a consuming project will will only reference those files in `Import` elements when the package is a directly-included `PackageReference`-- there is no way to make that happen when the package is indirectly/transitively included.\n\n---\n\n@nkolev92 commented on [Tue Jul 31 2018](https://github.com/NuGet/docs.microsoft.com-nuget/issues/997#issuecomment-409340942)\n\nSay you have the following:\r\n\r\nProject 1 -> Package A -> Package B, where Package B has targets. \r\n\r\nWhen building Package A, the author of Package A can choose to allow the Package targets to flow transitively. \r\n\r\nPackage A could be built with Package B as a reference like this:\r\n> <PackageReference Include=\"B\" PrivateAssets=\"content;analyzers\"/>\r\n\r\nThe default PrivateAssets value is `build;content;analyzers` per https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/nuget/consume-packages/package-references-in-project-files#controlling-dependency-assets\r\n\r\nThat would preserve that information in the nuspec of Package A when packed. \r\n\r\nThen the consumer of Package A will be happy. \r\n\r\nNote that the options are more limited when it comes to the Package A consumer. \n\n---\n\n@geeeyetee commented on [Tue Jul 31 2018](https://github.com/NuGet/docs.microsoft.com-nuget/issues/997#issuecomment-409343119)\n\n@nkolev92 - Thanks for your reply-- it crossed path with my \"EDIT\" above.

I've definitely authored a package that has package references with `PrivateAssets=none`, and when projects consume that package, they definitely get the props/targets of the transitively referenced packages in their nuget.g.props/nuget.g.targets files.\n\n"},{"Id":"8151847246","Type":"IssuesEvent","CreatedAt":"2018-08-22T16:42:22","Actor":"livarcocc","Repository":"NuGet/Home","Organization":"NuGet","RawContent":null,"RelatedAction":"opened","RelatedUrl":"https://github.com/NuGet/Home/issues/7232","RelatedDescription":"Opened issue \"dotnet pack removes nuget range if floating version is used\" (#7232) at NuGet/Home","RelatedBody":"_From @Kieranties on August 22, 2018 9:39_\n\n## Steps to reproduce\r\nCreate a project and add a reference to a nuget package, floating on the patch, but within a range.\r\ne.g. `<PackageReference Include=\"microsoft.aspnetcore.app\" Version=\"[2.1.*, 2.3.0)\" />`\r\n\r\n## Expected  behavior\r\nWhen running `dotnet pack` the latest patch version is restored and the range is honored in the nuspec.\r\nE.g. if the latest patch is version `2.1.3`, the nuspec would contain:\r\n`<dependency id=\"microsoft.aspnetcore.app\" version=\"[2.1.3, 3.0.0)\" exclude=\"Build,Analyzers\" />`\r\n\r\n## Actual behavior\r\nThe latest patch is restored, however the range in the nuspec is removed:\r\n`<dependency id=\"microsoft.aspnetcore.app\" version=\"2.1.3\" exclude=\"Build,Analyzers\" />`\r\n\r\nThe same issue is seen when floating on the pre-release, e.g. `2.1.3-*`\r\n\r\n## Environment data\r\n`dotnet --info` output:\r\n```\r\n> dotnet --info\r\n.NET Core SDK (reflecting any global.json):\r\n Version:   2.1.400\r\n Commit:    8642e60a0f\r\n\r\nRuntime Environment:\r\n OS Name:     Windows\r\n OS Version:  10.0.17134\r\n OS Platform: Windows\r\n RID:         win10-x64\r\n Base Path:   C:\\Program Files\\dotnet\\sdk\\2.1.400\\\r\n\r\nHost (useful for support):\r\n  Version: 2.1.2\r\n  Commit:  811c3ce6c0\r\n\r\n.NET Core SDKs installed:\r\n  1.0.0-preview2-003121 [C:\\Program Files\\dotnet\\sdk]\r\n  1.1.0 [C:\\Program Files\\dotnet\\sdk]\r\n  2.0.0 [C:\\Program Files\\dotnet\\sdk]\r\n  2.0.2 [C:\\Program Files\\dotnet\\sdk]\r\n  2.0.3 [C:\\Program Files\\dotnet\\sdk]\r\n  2.1.2 [C:\\Program Files\\dotnet\\sdk]\r\n  2.1.4 [C:\\Program Files\\dotnet\\sdk]\r\n  2.1.101 [C:\\Program Files\\dotnet\\sdk]\r\n  2.1.102 [C:\\Program Files\\dotnet\\sdk]\r\n  2.1.103 [C:\\Program Files\\dotnet\\sdk]\r\n  2.1.104 [C:\\Program Files\\dotnet\\sdk]\r\n  2.1.200 [C:\\Program Files\\dotnet\\sdk]\r\n  2.1.201 [C:\\Program Files\\dotnet\\sdk]\r\n  2.1.202 [C:\\Program Files\\dotnet\\sdk]\r\n  2.1.301 [C:\\Program Files\\dotnet\\sdk]\r\n  2.1.400 [C:\\Program Files\\dotnet\\sdk]\r\n\r\n.NET Core runtimes installed:\r\n  Microsoft.AspNetCore.All 2.1.1 [C:\\Program Files\\dotnet\\shared\\Microsoft.AspNetCore.All]\r\n  Microsoft.AspNetCore.All 2.1.2 [C:\\Program Files\\dotnet\\shared\\Microsoft.AspNetCore.All]\r\n  Microsoft.AspNetCore.App 2.1.1 [C:\\Program Files\\dotnet\\shared\\Microsoft.AspNetCore.App]\r\n  Microsoft.AspNetCore.App 2.1.2 [C:\\Program Files\\dotnet\\shared\\Microsoft.AspNetCore.App]\r\n  Microsoft.NETCore.App 1.0.5 [C:\\Program Files\\dotnet\\shared\\Microsoft.NETCore.App]\r\n  Microsoft.NETCore.App 1.1.2 [C:\\Program Files\\dotnet\\shared\\Microsoft.NETCore.App]\r\n  Microsoft.NETCore.App 2.0.0 [C:\\Program Files\\dotnet\\shared\\Microsoft.NETCore.App]\r\n  Microsoft.NETCore.App 2.0.3 [C:\\Program Files\\dotnet\\shared\\Microsoft.NETCore.App]\r\n  Microsoft.NETCore.App 2.0.5 [C:\\Program Files\\dotnet\\shared\\Microsoft.NETCore.App]\r\n  Microsoft.NETCore.App 2.0.6 [C:\\Program Files\\dotnet\\shared\\Microsoft.NETCore.App]\r\n  Microsoft.NETCore.App 2.0.7 [C:\\Program Files\\dotnet\\shared\\Microsoft.NETCore.App]\r\n  Microsoft.NETCore.App 2.0.9 [C:\\Program Files\\dotnet\\shared\\Microsoft.NETCore.App]\r\n  Microsoft.NETCore.App 2.1.1 [C:\\Program Files\\dotnet\\shared\\Microsoft.NETCore.App]\r\n  Microsoft.NETCore.App 2.1.2 [C:\\Program Files\\dotnet\\shared\\Microsoft.NETCore.App]\r\n```\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\n\n_Copied from original issue: dotnet/cli#9878_"},{"Id":"8149493138","Type":"IssuesEvent","CreatedAt":"2018-08-22T09:47:27","Actor":"valeriob","Repository":"NuGet/Home","Organization":"NuGet","RawContent":null,"RelatedAction":"opened","RelatedUrl":"https://github.com/NuGet/Home/issues/7231","RelatedDescription":"Opened issue \"msbuild restore problem with feed with apiKey\" (#7231) at NuGet/Home","RelatedBody":"Hi,\r\nwe have nuget.config with 3 feed \r\n1) nuget.org\r\n2) ravendb ci\r\n3) a private one protected with apiKey\r\nusing msbuild target restore version 15.8 installed via visual studio tools in a build machine.\r\n\r\nAs you can see from the error \r\n\r\n> error NU1101: Unable to find package Onit.OnWms.Messages.
