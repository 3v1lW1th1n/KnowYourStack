As an example, if source 1 and source 2 both specify a style with the ID `heading1`, the style from source 1 will be used.\r\n\r\n**Observation 2**\r\nWhen saving a document in a version of Word with a different display language than English, Word localizes the style IDs of built-in styles. However, it doesn't localize the style names. This leads to style XML like the following (from a Danish-language instance of Word):\r\n```\r\n<w:style w:type=\"paragraph\" w:styleId=\"Overskrift1\" xmlns:w=\"http://schemas.openxmlformats.org/wordprocessingml/2006/main\">\r\n  <w:name w:val=\"heading 1\" />\r\n  <w:basedOn w:val=\"Normal\" />\r\n  <w:next w:val=\"Normal\" />\r\n  <w:link w:val=\"Overskrift1Tegn\" />\r\n  ...\r\n</w:style>\r\n```\r\n**Observation 3**\r\nWhen opening a document containing multiple (localized) styles with the same style name, Word deletes all but the last style, applying it to all elements that referenced one of the styles.\r\n\r\n**Result**\r\nTaken together, this means that `DocumentBuilder` seems to behave erratically with regards to style merging when building documents from sources saved in different language-versions of Word.\r\n\r\n**Solution**\r\nA possible solution would be to merge not only styles with the same ID, but also styles with the same name. This would mean that all references to one of the merged style would have to be changed to reference the ID of the \"canonical\" style."},{"Id":"7018238106","Type":"IssuesEvent","CreatedAt":"2017-12-21T12:56:44","Actor":"alejandronic","Repository":"OfficeDev/Open-Xml-PowerTools","Organization":"OfficeDev","RawContent":null,"RelatedAction":"opened","RelatedUrl":"https://github.com/OfficeDev/Open-Xml-PowerTools/issues/195","RelatedDescription":"Opened issue \"Inline conditional not properly working\" (#195) at OfficeDev/Open-Xml-PowerTools","RelatedBody":"Hi, \r\nI need to make a sentence with the data i have in my XML, where some values should appear and some not.
