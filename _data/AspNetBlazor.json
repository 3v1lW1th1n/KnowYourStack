The implementation is:\r\n\r\n### ParentComponent\r\n\r\n```\r\n@page \"/ParentComponent\"\r\n\r\n<h1>Parent Component</h1>\r\n\r\n<p>ParentYear: @ParentYear</p>\r\n\r\n<ChildComponent bind-Year=\"@ParentYear\" />\r\n\r\n@functions {\r\n    [Parameter]\r\n    private int ParentYear { get; set; } = 1978;\r\n}\r\n```\r\n### ChildComponent\r\n```\r\n<h2>Child Component</h2>\r\n<p>Year: @Year</p>\r\n\r\n<button class=\"btn btn-primary\" onclick=\"@ChangeTheYear\">Change Year to 1986</button>\r\n\r\n@functions {\r\n    [Parameter]\r\n    private int Year { get; set; }\r\n\r\n    [Parameter]\r\n    private Action<int> YearChanged { get; set; }\r\n\r\n    void ChangeTheYear()\r\n    {\r\n        Year = 1986;\r\n    }\r\n}\r\n```\r\nBut this approach doesn't work. So I tried to bind the event and value directly (see the code below), but it still fails, the only improvement is that now I can see the \"I was called\" line in the console output.\r\n\r\n### ParentComponent\r\n```\r\n@page \"/ParentComponent\"\r\n\r\n<h1>Parent Component</h1>\r\n\r\n<p>ParentYear: @ParentYear</p>\r\n\r\n<ChildComponent Year=\"@ParentYear\"  YearChanged=\"@((e) => { Console.WriteLine(\"I was called\"); @ParentYear = e;})\"/>\r\n\r\n@functions {\r\n    [Parameter]\r\n    private int ParentYear { get; set; } = 1978;\r\n}\r\n```\r\n### ChildComponent\r\n```\r\n<h2>Child Component</h2>\r\n\r\n<p>Year: @Year</p>\r\n\r\n<button class=\"btn btn-primary\" onclick=\"@ChangeTheYear\">Change Year to 1986</button>\r\n\r\n@functions {\r\n    [Parameter]\r\n    private int Year { get; set; }\r\n\r\n    [Parameter]\r\n    private Action<int> YearChanged { get; set; }\r\n\r\n    void ChangeTheYear()\r\n    {\r\n        Year = 1986;\r\n        YearChanged(Year);\r\n    }\r\n}\r\n```\r\nThen I added manualy UI refresh\r\n### ParentComponent\r\n```\r\n@page \"/ParentComponent\"\r\n\r\n<h1>Parent Component</h1>\r\n\r\n<p>ParentYear: @ParentYear</p>\r\n\r\n<ChildComponent Year=\"@ParentYear\" YearChanged=\"@((e) =>\r\n                                   {\r\n                                       Console.WriteLine(\"I was called!\");\r\n                                       @ParentYear = e;\r\n                                       StateHasChanged();\r\n                                   })\"></ChildComponent>\r\n\r\n@functions {\r\n    [Parameter]\r\n    private int ParentYear { get; set; } = 1978;\r\n}\r\n```\r\n### Child Component \r\n```\r\n<h2>Child Component</h2>\r\n\r\n<p>Year: @Year</p>\r\n\r\n<button class=\"btn btn-primary\" onclick=\"@ChangeTheYear\">Change Year to 1986</button>\r\n\r\n@functions {\r\n    [Parameter]\r\n    private int Year { get; set; }\r\n\r\n    [Parameter]\r\n    private Action<int> YearChanged { get; set; }\r\n\r\n    void ChangeTheYear()\r\n    {\r\n        Year = 1986;\r\n        YearChanged(Year);\r\n    }\r\n}\r\n```\r\nThe last thing I tried was to add a manual UI refresh via StateHasChanged(), this works, but I don't understand why the forced refresh is necessary, as the bind-{property} syntax should perform a Two-Way binding already. Is this behaviour intended or is it a bug? \r\n\r\nThanks and regards,\r\nAlberto\r\n","Url":"https://github.com/aspnet/Blazor/issues/1355","RelatedDescription":"Open issue \"How to access parent component from child component.\" (#1355)"},{"Id":"353371238","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2018-08-23T13:04:36","Actor":"cores-system","Number":"1354","RawContent":null,"Title":"fix #1352 and #1367","State":"open","Body":"fix https://github.com/aspnet/Blazor/issues/1352\r\nfix https://github.com/aspnet/Blazor/issues/1367\r\n\r\nUse\r\n```\r\n<a href=\"\" target=\"_self\">Reload page</a> <br />\r\n<a href=\"/page\" target=\"_blank\">Open page is new tab</a> <br />\r\n\r\n<a href=\"/file.pdf\" target=\"_self\">Open file this tab</a>\r\n<a href=\"/file.pdf\" target=\"_blank\">Open file new tab</a>\r\n```","Url":"https://github.com/aspnet/Blazor/pull/1354","RelatedDescription":"Open PR \"fix #1352 and #1367\" (#1354)"},{"Id":"353362607","IsPullRequest":false,"CreatedAt":"2018-08-23T12:41:32","Actor":"ebfortin","Number":"1353","RawContent":null,"Title":"Framework location path should be configurable","State":"open","Body":"I am experimenting with different hosting scenarios for a Blzaor App and thought about packaging it into a Chrome Extension / App. however, Chrome Extension do not support _ at the begining of a path because it is reserved for system use.
