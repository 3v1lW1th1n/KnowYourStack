For recursive calls however, the path is known to have been\r\nresolved in the module resolver. Therefore, it is safe to move the path\r\nresolution to the initial caller into the recursive process.\r\n\r\nNote that this is not expected to improve the performance of ngcc, as\r\nthe call to `resolveFileWithPostfixes` is known to succeed immediately,\r\nas the provided path is known to exist without needing to add any\r\npostfixes. Furthermore, the FileSystem caches whether files exist, so\r\nthe additional check that we used to do was cheap.\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n**fix(ngcc): handle deep imports that already have an extension**\r\n\r\nDuring the dependency analysis phase of ngcc, imports are resolved to\r\nfiles on disk according to certain module resolution rules. Since module\r\nspecifiers are typically missing extensions, or can refer to index.js\r\nbarrel files within a directory, the module resolver attempts several\r\npostfixes when searching for a module import on disk. Module  specifiers\r\nthat already include an extension, however, would fail to be resolved as\r\nngcc's module resolver failed to check the location on disk without\r\nadding any postfixes.\r\n\r\nCloses #32097","Url":"https://github.com/angular/angular/pull/32181","RelatedDescription":"Open PR \"fix(ngcc): handle deep imports that already have an extension\" (#32181)"},{"Id":"482023282","IsPullRequest":false,"CreatedAt":"2019-08-18T18:30:54","Actor":"e-davidson","Number":"32180","RawContent":null,"Title":"change detection wrong order on child components","State":"open","Body":"<!--üîÖüîÖüîÖüîÖüîÖüîÖüîÖüîÖüîÖüîÖüîÖüîÖüîÖüîÖüîÖüîÖüîÖüîÖüîÖüîÖüîÖüîÖüîÖüîÖüîÖüîÖüîÖüîÖüîÖüîÖüîÖ\r\n\r\nOh hi there! üòÑ\r\n\r\nTo expedite issue processing please search open and closed issues before submitting a new one.\r\nExisting issues often contain information about workarounds, resolution, or progress updates.\r\n\r\nüîÖüîÖüîÖüîÖüîÖüîÖüîÖüîÖüîÖüîÖüîÖüîÖüîÖüîÖüîÖüîÖüîÖüîÖüîÖüîÖüîÖüîÖüîÖüîÖüîÖüîÖüîÖüîÖüîÖüîÖüîÖüîÖüîÖ-->\r\n\r\n\r\n# üêû bug report\r\n\r\n### Affected Package\r\n<!-- Can you pin-point one or more @angular/* packages as the source of the bug? -->\r\n<!-- ‚úçÔ∏èedit: -->\r\n\r\nLife cycle and Change detection not running in the correct order for 2 sibling components.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Is this a regression?\r\n\r\n<!-- Did this behavior use to work in the previous version? -->\r\n<!-- ‚úçÔ∏è--> Not that I'm aware of.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Description\r\n\r\n<!-- ‚úçÔ∏è-->\r\n\r\nI have 2 sibling components.\r\nThe first hosts a template via ngTemplateOutlet\r\nThe 2nd has the template as part of its view to be used by it's sibling.\r\nThe parent gets the template from the 2nd child and passes it to the first child.\r\n\r\nIt works fine if the template that we're getting from the 2nd child gets passed to the 1st child in the first cycle.\r\n\r\nHowever, if we need a 2nd cycle to get the template like the following code it doesn't work.\r\n<pre><code>\r\n  ngAfterViewInit() {\r\n    setTimeout(() => {\r\n      this.templates = this.templateQuery.map( c => c.template );\r\n      this.cdr.markForCheck();\r\n    }, 0);\r\n  }\r\n</code></pre>\r\n\r\nDoing it in the set timeout is necessary otherwise you may get a ExpressionChangedAfterItHasBeenCheckedError.\r\n\r\nThe input bindings on the inner template are always one cycle behind the parent component.\r\n\r\nThe issue appears to be that the order that angular runs the life cycle hooks is not the same in the 1st case as in the 2nd.\r\n\r\nIn the first case.\r\nThe content is checked on the template component before the host component.\r\nSo the change is detected and passed through to the host component.\r\n\r\nHowever in the 2nd case\r\nChange detection first runs on the host component and nothing changed yet so the view doesn't update. Then it's run on the template component, but it's already too late for the host component.

In the component file, it's setup with the following styles:\r\n\r\n`    :root {\r\n      background-color: blue;\r\n    }\r\n    h1 {\r\n      color: red;\r\n    }`\r\n\r\nAdditionally, there's a css style in styles.css with the following:\r\n\r\n`:root {\r\n  background-color: rgb(87, 172, 87);\r\n}`\r\n\r\nThis ends up showing red text (from h1 css inside angular element) against a green background (from the :root tag in styles.css) but ignores the blue background style rule on :root within the angular element.\r\n\r\nAgain, regardless of how I configure the angular element, anything I put in a :root style within the element doesn't apply.\r\n\r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/1421719/63219208-d35f1a80-c13a-11e9-804f-76b9444a7e90.png)\r\n\r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/1421719/63219213-e96cdb00-c13a-11e9-8c81-de0e3925cf1e.png)\r\n\r\n","Url":"https://github.com/angular/angular/issues/32177","RelatedDescription":"Open issue \":root css pseudo-class ignored in angular elements\" (#32177)"},{"Id":"481919290","IsPullRequest":false,"CreatedAt":"2019-08-17T19:35:53","Actor":"zygimantas","Number":"32176","RawContent":null,"Title":"Ng-animating class of child animation is not removed","State":"open","Body":"<!--üîÖüîÖüîÖüîÖüîÖüîÖüîÖüîÖüîÖüîÖüîÖüîÖüîÖüîÖüîÖüîÖüîÖüîÖüîÖüîÖüîÖüîÖüîÖüîÖüîÖüîÖüîÖüîÖüîÖüîÖüîÖ\r\n\r\nOh hi there! üòÑ\r\n\r\nTo expedite issue processing please search open and closed issues before submitting a new one.\r\nExisting issues often contain information about workarounds, resolution, or progress updates.\r\n\r\nüîÖüîÖüîÖüîÖüîÖüîÖüîÖüîÖüîÖüîÖüîÖüîÖüîÖüîÖüîÖüîÖüîÖüîÖüîÖüîÖüîÖüîÖüîÖüîÖüîÖüîÖüîÖüîÖüîÖüîÖüîÖüîÖüîÖ-->\r\n\r\n\r\n# üêû bug report\r\n\r\n### Affected Package\r\n<!-- Can you pin-point one or more @angular/* packages as the source of the bug? -->\r\n<!-- ‚úçÔ∏èedit: --> The issue is caused by package @angular/animations\r\n\r\n\r\n### Is this a regression?\r\n\r\n<!-- Did this behavior use to work in the previous version? -->\r\n<!-- ‚úçÔ∏è--> No\r\n\r\n\r\n### Description\r\n\r\n<!-- ‚úçÔ∏è--> on the first run, the ng-animating class is not removed until all elements are animated\r\n\r\n\r\n## üî¨ Minimal Reproduction\r\n<!--\r\nPlease create and share minimal reproduction of the issue starting with this template: https://stackblitz.com/fork/angular-issue-repro2\r\n-->\r\n<!-- ‚úçÔ∏è--> https://stackblitz.com/edit/angular-issue-repro2-9pmdhp\r\n\r\n<!--\r\nIf StackBlitz is not suitable for reproduction of your issue, please create a minimal GitHub repository with the reproduction of the issue.\r\nA good way to make a minimal reproduction is to create a new app via `ng new repro-app` and add the minimum possible code to show the problem. \r\nShare the link to the repo below along with step-by-step instructions to reproduce the problem, as well as expected and actual behavior.\r\n\r\nIssues that don't have enough info and can't be reproduced will be closed.\r\n\r\nYou can read more about issue submission guidelines here: https://github.com/angular/angular/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md#-submitting-an-issue\r\n-->\r\n\r\n## üî• Exception or Error\r\n<pre><code>\r\n<!-- If the issue is accompanied by an exception or an error, please share it below: -->\r\n<!-- ‚úçÔ∏è--> None\r\n\r\n</code></pre>\r\n\r\n\r\n## üåç  Your Environment\r\n\r\n**Angular Version:**\r\n<pre><code>\r\n<!-- run `ng version` and paste output below -->\r\n<!-- ‚úçÔ∏è-->Angular CLI: 8.2.2\r\nNode: 12.4.0\r\nOS: win32 x64\r\nAngular: 8.2.2\r\n... animations, cli, common, compiler, compiler-cli, core\r\n... language-service, platform-browser, platform-browser-dynamic\r\n... router, service-worker\r\n\r\nPackage                           Version\r\n-----------------------------------------------------------\r\n@angular-devkit/architect         0.802.2\r\n@angular-devkit/build-angular     0.802.2\r\n@angular-devkit/build-optimizer   0.802.2\r\n@angular-devkit/build-webpack     0.802.2\r\n@angular-devkit/core              8.2.2\r\n@angular-devkit/schematics        8.2.2\r\n@angular/pwa                      0.802.2\r\n@ngtools/webpack                  8.2.2\r\n@schematics/angular               8.2.2\r\n@schematics/update                0.802.2\r\nrxjs                              6.5.2\r\ntypescript                        3.5.3\r\nwebpack                           4.38.0\r\n\r\n</code></pre>\r\n\r\n**Anything else relevant?**\r\n<!-- ‚úçÔ∏èIs this a browser specific issue?

By modifying the URL value to a malicious site, an attacker may successfully launch a phishing scam and steal user credentials. Because the server name in the modified link is identical to the original site, phishing attempts have a more trustworthy appearance.\r\n\r\nRemediation\r\nThe easiest and most effective way to prevent vulnerable open redirects would be to not let the user control where your page redirects him to.

It might also be better to combine it with the public-host spec file, as some test cases in there (no options specified, or with `disableHostCheck`) also apply to the `allowedHosts` option.","Url":"https://github.com/angular/angular-cli/pull/15366","RelatedDescription":"Open PR \"feat(@angular-devkit/build-angular): expose webpack-dev-server's allowedHosts option\" (#15366)"},{"Id":"481942967","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2019-08-18T01:41:43","Actor":"renovate-bot","Number":"15365","RawContent":null,"Title":"build: update less to version 3.10.1","State":"open","Body":"This PR contains the following updates:\n\n| Package | Type | Update | Change |\n|---|---|---|---|\n| [less](http://lesscss.org) ([source](https://togithub.com/less/less.js)) | dependencies | minor | [`3.9.0` -> `3.10.1`](https://renovatebot.com/diffs/npm/less/3.9.0/3.10.1) |\n\n---\n\n### Release Notes\n\n<details>\n<summary>less/less.js</summary>\n\n### [`v3.10.1`](https://togithub.com/less/less.js/compare/v3.10.0...v3.10.1)\n\n[Compare Source](https://togithub.com/less/less.js/compare/v3.10.0...v3.10.1)\n\n### [`v3.10.0`](https://togithub.com/less/less.js/blob/master/CHANGELOG.md#&#8203;3100-beta)\n\n[Compare Source](https://togithub.com/less/less.js/compare/v3.9.0...v3.10.0)\n\n2019-08-03\n\n-   Switched codebase to ES2015 w/ Rollup/Babel compilation\n-   Added TS linter to ESLint (types yet to be added to functions / vars)\n-   Ignore undefined content in generating source maps ([#&#8203;3360](https://togithub.com/less/less.js/issues/3360))\n\n</details>\n\n---\n\n### Renovate configuration\n\n:date: **Schedule**: \"after 10pm every weekday,before 4am every weekday,every weekend\" in timezone America/Tijuana.\n\n:vertical_traffic_light: **Automerge**: Disabled by config.

There in, I use the replace feature to replace different manifest and index files depending on the configuration I choose when I build/serve the project.\r\n\r\nI would like to add a version field to the manifest and index meta tags. But I don't like having to change all 8 files every time I update the version number.\r\n\r\n### Describe the solution you'd like\r\n<!-- ‚úçÔ∏è--> If you have a solution in mind, please describe it.\r\n\r\nIdeally I would like the ability to tell CLI to insert a version number which would be set in one location into each specified file, somehow, so I don't have to do it manually.\r\n\r\nAlong with the different configurations and file replacement properties in the angular.json file... perhaps add the ability to do string find/replace on specified files from a given source.\r\n\r\nOr better yet add some other versioning functionality into it so that it also increments the version number on every build.\r\n\r\n### Describe alternatives you've considered\r\n<!-- ‚úçÔ∏è--> Have you considered any alternative solutions or workarounds?\r\nThe only alternative I have seen would be to use php or some other back end scripting language to compile the html and manifest files. But since this is fairly basic variable insertions adding in the overhead of a backend script compiler seemed a bit overkill. Especially since the variable insertion does not need to be dynamic after the build/serve command is run.","Url":"https://github.com/angular/angular-cli/issues/15347","RelatedDescription":"Closed issue \"Add ability to compile/generate asset files\" (#15347)"},{"Id":"481668225","IsPullRequest":false,"CreatedAt":"2019-08-16T18:41:53","Actor":"Saif-Amer-20","Number":"15354","RawContent":null,"Title":"Get Error \"Please make sure it is in your tsconfig via the 'files' or 'include' property.\"","State":"closed","Body":"Hello, \r\nI'm new in Angular,I get this Error\r\n\r\n `\r\nWARNING in ./src/app/Owners/owneer.module.ts\r\nThere are multiple modules with names that only differ in casing.\r\nThis can lead to unexpected behavior when compiling on a filesystem with other case-semantic.\r\nUse equal casing.

[#&#8203;10590](https://togithub.com/angular/components/issues/10590)\n-   **drag-drop:** fix drag start delay behavior to allow scrolling ([#&#8203;16228](https://togithub.com/angular/components/issues/16228)) ([738f10c](https://togithub.com/angular/components/commit/738f10c)), closes [#&#8203;16224](https://togithub.com/angular/components/issues/16224)\n-   **drag-drop:** return up-to-date position if getFreeDragPosition is called while dragging

[#&#8203;16009](https://togithub.com/angular/components/issues/16009)\n-   **overlay:** OverlayKeyboardDispatcher (used in dialog and overlay\n      and available in the CDK) now listens on bubbling/propagation phase\n      instead of capture phase. This means that overlay keydown handlers\n      are now called after any applicable handlers inside of an overlay,\n      and it respects any stopPropagation() calls from inside the overlay.\n\n#####

After that I've included the partial scss file and used it in `app.component`. \r\nRun `ng serve --aot` **on Windows** and apply a change in the partial scss file. Nothing happens.\r\n\r\n## üî• Exception or Error\r\nNo error, just the changes are not detected and they are not applied.\r\n\r\n## üåç Your Environment\r\n<pre><code>\r\n<!-- run `ng version` and paste output below -->\r\n<!-- ‚úçÔ∏è-->\r\nAngular CLI: 8.2.2\r\nNode: 10.15.1\r\nOS: win32 x64\r\nAngular: 8.2.2\r\n... animations, cli, common, compiler, compiler-cli, core, forms\r\n... language-service, platform-browser, platform-browser-dynamic\r\n... router\r\n\r\nPackage                           Version\r\n-----------------------------------------------------------\r\n@angular-devkit/architect         0.802.2\r\n@angular-devkit/build-angular     0.802.2\r\n@angular-devkit/build-optimizer   0.802.2\r\n@angular-devkit/build-webpack     0.802.2\r\n@angular-devkit/core              8.2.2\r\n@angular-devkit/schematics        8.2.2\r\n@ngtools/webpack                  8.2.2\r\n@schematics/angular               8.2.2\r\n@schematics/update                0.802.2\r\nrxjs                              6.4.0\r\ntypescript                        3.5.3\r\nwebpack                           4.38.0\r\n</code></pre>\r\n\r\n**Anything else relevant?**\r\nIssue is reproducible only on Windows.\r\nNOTE: It breaks syncing of partial scss files in NativeScript Angular projects as well (`tns run android --env.aot` is not working on Windows when changing partial scss).","Url":"https://github.com/angular/angular-cli/issues/15340","RelatedDescription":"Open issue \"Changes in partial scss files are not respected when using ng serve --aot on Windows\" (#15340)"},{"Id":"481340791","IsPullRequest":false,"CreatedAt":"2019-08-10T22:40:08","Actor":"Splaktar","Number":"15348","RawContent":null,"Title":"docs(ng-add): docs don't mention that the library will be installed in the project of the CWD","State":"open","Body":"#### Reproduction\r\n\r\nSteps to reproduce:\r\n1. `ng new tmp` and respond to prompts\r\n1. `cd tmp/`\r\n1. `ng g app web-app` and respond to prompts\r\n1.
