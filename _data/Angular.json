I created the project using the angular cli and created three components and added them to app-routing.module.ts. Lastly, I added an anchor tag to the app.component.ts with routerLink=\"/about\", but the link does not work when previewed on the browser.\r\n\r\n**Behavior**\r\n- When clicking on the link, the browser does not reload nor does it navigate.\r\n- When hovering the link, the browser shows the tooltip on the bottom-left corner, but it shows the current URL rather than the URL I specified in routerLink.\r\n- Inspecting the HTML, the href attribute shows the current url, while the routerLink attribute shows the URL I specified.\r\n- The router-outlet works fine as it loads the components based on their URL correctly. However, it does not update when I click on a link with the routerLink directive.\r\n- After setting 'enableTracing' to true inside app-routing.module.ts, when I click on the link the console does not log any navigation events.\r\n\r\n## 🔬 Minimal Reproduction\r\nThe project was created with the following command:\r\n`ng new FaustoWeb2019 --experimental-ivy true --prefix fausto --routing true --skipt-git true --skip-tests true --style scss`\r\n\r\nGit repository with the generated (faulty) project:\r\n[https://github.com/faustotnc/ngRouterLinkNotWorking](https://github.com/faustotnc/ngRouterLinkNotWorking)\r\n\r\nModified files:\r\n- src/app/app.module.ts\r\n- src/app/app.component.html\r\n- src/app/app-routing.module.ts\r\n- src/app/components/\r\n\r\n## 🔥 Exception or Error\r\nNo console or CLI errors\r\n\r\n\r\n## 🌍  Your Environment\r\n\r\n**Angular Version:**\r\n<pre><code>7.2.15</code></pre>\r\n**Angular CLI Version:**\r\n<pre><code>7.3.9</code></pre>\r\n","Url":"https://github.com/angular/angular/issues/30459","RelatedDescription":"Open issue \"Angular 7 - routerLink does not work\" (#30459)"},{"Id":"444060861","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2019-05-14T18:28:07","Actor":"TwoDCube","Number":"30457","RawContent":null,"Title":"docs: fix typo in animations doc","State":"open","Body":"## PR Checklist\r\nPlease check if your PR fulfills the following requirements:\r\n\r\n- [x] The commit message follows our guidelines: https://github.com/angular/angular/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md#commit\r\n- [ ] Tests for the changes have been added (for bug fixes / features)\r\n- [ ] Docs have been added / updated (for bug fixes / features)\r\n\r\n\r\n## PR Type\r\nWhat kind of change does this PR introduce?\r\n\r\n<!-- Please check the one that applies to this PR using \"x\". -->\r\n\r\n- [ ] Bugfix\r\n- [ ] Feature\r\n- [ ] Code style update (formatting, local variables)\r\n- [ ] Refactoring (no functional changes, no api changes)\r\n- [ ] Build related changes\r\n- [ ] CI related changes\r\n- [x] Documentation content changes\r\n- [ ] angular.io application / infrastructure changes\r\n- [ ] Other...

Note this only affects `.js` files, since missing imports fail in `.ts` files.\r\n\r\nFor context:\r\nWe ran into this in angular/angular#30362, where esm files in `@angular/material` ended up trying to import missing exports from `@angular/core`.

This seems to be true for small number of prompts, but breaks when more are used.\r\n\r\nThe likely culprit is the sort on top of _applyPrompts in https://github.com/angular/angular-cli/blob/master/packages/angular_devkit/core/src/json/schema/registry.ts\r\n\r\nIt seems that older V8 versions didn't implement stable sort. I don't follow exactly the Node releases, so it's possible this is fixed in the absolutely newest one.\r\n\r\nSeeing that the priorities are currently not configurable, maybe commenting-out the sort call is the quickest fix.\r\n\r\n\r\n## 🔬 Minimal Reproduction\r\n\r\n- define schema.json with larger number of parameters and x-prompt (our is currently using 13)\r\n- run ng new or ng generate without providing the parameters, thus triggering the interactive prompts\r\n\r\n\r\n## 🌍 Your Environment\r\n<pre><code>\r\nAngular CLI: 7.3.8\r\nNode: 10.15.3\r\nOS: win32 x64\r\nAngular:\r\n...\r\n\r\nPackage                      Version\r\n------------------------------------------------------\r\n@angular-devkit/architect    0.13.8\r\n@angular-devkit/core         7.3.8\r\n@angular-devkit/schematics   7.3.8\r\n@schematics/angular          7.3.8\r\n@schematics/update           0.13.8\r\nrxjs                         6.3.3\r\ntypescript                   3.2.4\r\n</code></pre>\r\n\r\n","Url":"https://github.com/angular/angular-cli/issues/14402","RelatedDescription":"Closed issue \"Order of parameters not preserved when using x-prompt\" (#14402)"},{"Id":"443159689","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2019-05-13T22:56:18","Actor":"clydin","Number":"14407","RawContent":null,"Title":"refactor(@angular-devkit/build-angular): remove unused utility functions","State":"closed","Body":"Remaining remnants from the migration to the stable architect API.","Url":"https://github.com/angular/angular-cli/pull/14407","RelatedDescription":"Closed or merged PR \"refactor(@angular-devkit/build-angular): remove unused utility functions\" (#14407)"},{"Id":"443158027","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2019-05-13T22:55:53","Actor":"clydin","Number":"14406","RawContent":null,"Title":"fix(@angular-devkit/build-optimizer): remove deprecated test functions from public API","State":"closed","Body":"","Url":"https://github.com/angular/angular-cli/pull/14406","RelatedDescription":"Closed or merged PR \"fix(@angular-devkit/build-optimizer): remove deprecated test functions from public API\" (#14406)"},{"Id":"443080784","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2019-05-13T22:55:31","Actor":"renovate-bot","Number":"14405","RawContent":null,"Title":"build: update open to version 6.3.0","State":"closed","Body":"This PR contains the following updates:\n\n| Package | Type | Update | Change | References |\n|---|---|---|---|---|\n| open | dependencies | minor | [`6.2.0` -> `6.3.0`](https://diff.intrinsic.com/open/6.2.0/6.3.0) | [source](https://togithub.com/sindresorhus/open) |\n\n---\n\n### Release Notes\n\n<details>\n<summary>sindresorhus/open</summary>\n\n### [`v6.3.0`](https://togithub.com/sindresorhus/open/releases/v6.3.0)\n\n[Compare Source](https://togithub.com/sindresorhus/open/compare/v6.2.0...v6.3.0)\n\n-   Use the system `xdg-open` on Linux when `open` is bundled/packaged ([#&#8203;134](https://togithub.com/sindresorhus/open/issues/134))  [`c69fd06`](https://togithub.com/sindresorhus/open/commit/c69fd06)\n\n</details>\n\n---\n\n### Renovate configuration\n\n:date: **Schedule**: \"after 10pm every weekday,before 4am every weekday,every weekend\" in timezone America/Tijuana.\n\n:vertical_traffic_light: **Automerge**: Disabled by config.
