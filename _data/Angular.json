After animation end the inline style of the animated element is corrupted.\r\n\r\n## 🔬 Minimal Reproduction\r\n\r\nThe issue is not reproducible in StackBlitz. Here is a [repo](https://github.com/wnvko/AngularAnimationsIssue) showing the issue.\r\nRun the app and press `esc` key. This should start the animation. After animation ends the `#content` element's style contains `transform: matrix(1, 0, 0, 1, 0, -456.363);`.\r\n\r\n## 🔥 Exception or Error\r\n\r\nThere is no exceptions, nor errors, but the element inline style is poluted.\r\n\r\n## 🌍  Your Environment\r\n\r\n**Angular Version:**\r\n<pre><code>\r\nAngular CLI: 8.3.24\r\nNode: 12.13.1\r\nOS: win32 x64\r\nAngular: 8.2.14\r\n... animations, common, compiler, compiler-cli, core, forms     \r\n... language-service, platform-browser, platform-browser-dynamic\r\n... router\r\n\r\nPackage                           Version\r\n-----------------------------------------------------------     \r\n@angular-devkit/architect         0.803.24\r\n@angular-devkit/build-angular     0.803.24\r\n@angular-devkit/build-optimizer   0.803.24\r\n@angular-devkit/build-webpack     0.803.24\r\n@angular-devkit/core              8.3.24\r\n@angular-devkit/schematics        8.3.24\r\n@angular/cli                      8.3.24\r\n@ngtools/webpack                  8.3.24\r\n@schematics/angular               8.3.24\r\n@schematics/update                0.803.24\r\nrxjs                              6.4.0\r\ntypescript                        3.5.3\r\nwebpack                           4.39.2\r\n</code></pre>\r\n","Url":"https://github.com/angular/angular/issues/35124","RelatedDescription":"Open issue \"AnimationPlayer does not clear transform after animation ends\" (#35124)"},{"Id":"559244219","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2020-02-03T18:05:41","Actor":"devversion","Number":"35123","RawContent":null,"Title":"ci: re-enable components repo unit tests","State":"open","Body":"* See individual commits.\r\n\r\nIncludes a commit from #35090.

But the signature of `Subject.next` has a [design flaw](https://github.com/ReactiveX/rxjs/issues/2852) which has been copied to `EventEmitter.emit`.\r\n\r\nThis issue is essentially the same as https://github.com/ReactiveX/rxjs/issues/2852 , but applied to angular's EventEmitter. See repro below for details.\r\n\r\n\r\n## 🔬 Minimal Reproduction\r\n\r\n```ts\r\nconst em = new EventEmitter<string>();\r\nem.asObservable().subscribe(s => {\r\n    s.substring(0, 1); // boom\r\n});\r\nem.emit();\r\n```\r\n\r\n### Expected behavior\r\n\r\nA compile error at line 5\r\n\r\n### Actual behavior\r\n\r\nA runtime error at line 3\r\n\r\n### Details\r\n\r\nThe signature of `emit` allows emitting `undefined` on an event emitter which declares a non-nullable type.\r\nThis defeats the whole purpose of typescript's --strictNullCheck flag.\r\n\r\n\r\n## 🔥 Exception or Error\r\n\r\nNo error, that's the problem.\r\n\r\n\r\n## 🌍  Your Environment\r\n\r\nAll versions since #10058\r\n\r\n## 🔧 Suggested fix\r\n\r\nThe suggested fix is simple enough, but it is a breaking change:\r\n- Make the parameter of `emit` non-optional. One can still write `em.emit()` provided the EventEmitter is of type `EventEmitter<void>`.\r\n- Make the default type of T `void` instead of `any` (see [this](https://github.com/ReactiveX/rxjs/issues/5066#issuecomment-581462164)) for details.\r\n\r\n```diff\r\ndiff --git a/packages/core/src/event_emitter.ts b/packages/core/src/event_emitter.ts\r\nindex 07143d9774..eaf84b7ad0 100644\r\n--- a/packages/core/src/event_emitter.ts\r\n+++ b/packages/core/src/event_emitter.ts\r\n@@ -61,7 +61,7 @@ import {Subject, Subscription} from 'rxjs';\r\n  * @see [Observables in Angular](guide/observables-in-angular)\r\n  * @publicApi\r\n  */\r\n-export class EventEmitter<T extends any> extends Subject<T> {\r\n+export class EventEmitter<T extends any = void> extends Subject<T> {\r\n   /**\r\n    * @internal\r\n    */\r\n@@ -83,7 +83,7 @@ export class EventEmitter<T extends any> extends Subject<T> {\r\n    * Emits an event containing a given value.\r\n    * @param value The value to emit.\r\n    */\r\n-  emit(value?: T) { super.next(value); }\r\n+  emit(value: T) { super.next(value); }\r\n \r\n   /**\r\n    * Registers handlers for events emitted by this instance.\r\n```","Url":"https://github.com/angular/angular/issues/35119","RelatedDescription":"Open issue \"EventEmitter.emit() should only accept T, not T | undefined.\" (#35119)"},{"Id":"558960360","IsPullRequest":false,"CreatedAt":"2020-02-03T09:40:28","Actor":"pkozlowski-opensource","Number":"35117","RawContent":null,"Title":"The `isNode()` detection in the animations module is not precise enough","State":"open","Body":"While profiling the issue reported in  #35029  it turned out that [the isNode() detection method](https://github.com/angular/angular/blob/4d36b2f6e9a1a7673b3f233752895c96ca7dba1e/packages/animations/browser/src/render/shared.ts#L22-L24), present in the animation module, is not precise enough and can execute in a browser, leading to the performance problems.\r\n\r\n![Screenshot 2020-01-31 at 14 41 41](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/973550/73641995-2be68d80-4671-11ea-807f-49d50effce6a.png)\r\n\r\nLooking at the profiling picture captured in a browser we can notice that `writeStyleAttribute` function is executed, [even if is supposed to execute in the Node environment only](https://github.com/angular/angular/blob/b0834fe962b96fc84e5ffbcdb5283b25f74a5c47/packages/animations/browser/src/util.ts#L176-L187)!\r\n\r\n This is unfortunate since the  `writeStyleAttribute` is relatively slow (see #35116) - but the point of this issue here is that it should not execute in a browser at all!

The way the dragging sequence works is that the drop list keeps track of its items via `ContentChildren` and it registers itself with them once they're picked up by the `QueryList`. If an item doesn't have a container when the drag sequence is started, it is considered a \"standalone\" drag.\r\n\r\nThis becomes a problem with transplanted views (e.g. ones created by `cdk-table`) that use OnPush where we could end up in a situation where the items aren't picked up during the first pass, but when the user starts dragging, we trigger change detection and the `QueryList` is updated, but at that point it's too late, because we've already started the dragging sequence with a different set of information.\r\n\r\nThese changes work around the issue by assigning the container manually again through the drag directive.\r\n\r\nA couple of notes:\r\n* This is a second iteration of the fix. I went with this approach, because it doesn't require hacky timeouts and triggering change detection again. See the origin approach here: https://github.com/angular/components/commit/22afc3723258e6431b4603d96442daaffaa02f22\r\n* It's difficult to capture this in a test, because we'd have to duplicate half of the logic from `CdkTable` and we might still not be able to get the same change detection timing due to `TestBed`.\r\n\r\nFixes #18341.","Url":"https://github.com/angular/components/pull/18356","RelatedDescription":"Open PR \"fix(drag-drop): error when dragging items inside transplanted views with OnPush change detection\" (#18356)"},{"Id":"558178676","IsPullRequest":false,"CreatedAt":"2020-01-31T19:12:35","Actor":"fetis","Number":"18353","RawContent":null,"Title":"ng-template inside MatAutocomplete doesn't work","State":"closed","Body":"#### Reproduction\r\n\r\nhttps://stackblitz.com/edit/angular-wwwm2h\r\n\r\nSteps to reproduce:\r\n1.
