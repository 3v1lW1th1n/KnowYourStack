Using Show(...) method it never gets nulled. In Dispose only PropOwner is nulled. So the reference to the provided Owner-Form is held the PropertyStore and child forms will not GCed.\r\n\r\n**Expected behavior:**\r\nA: The said property is cleared in Dispose like PropOwner\r\nB: PropDialogOwner is not used at all because it is not ShowDialog\r\n\r\n**Minimal repro:**\r\n* open a Form\r\n* open some forms which consume some memory\r\n* let them open child forms with said method \r\n* and close them\r\n* profile memory for parent forms\r\n\r\n```\r\n    static class Program\r\n    {\r\n        [STAThread]\r\n        static void Main()\r\n        {\r\n            Application.EnableVisualStyles();\r\n            Application.SetCompatibleTextRenderingDefault(false);\r\n            Application.Run(new MainForm());\r\n        }\r\n    }\r\n\r\n    public class MainForm : Form\r\n    {\r\n        public MainForm()\r\n        {\r\n            long a = Process.GetCurrentProcess().WorkingSet64;\r\n\r\n            var children = new List<Form>();\r\n            for (int i = 0; i < 50; i++)\r\n            {\r\n                ParentForm parent = new ParentForm();\r\n                parent.Show();\r\n                children.Add(parent.Yum());\r\n                parent.Close();\r\n            }\r\n            \r\n            children.ForEach(cf => cf.Close());\r\n\r\n            long b = Process.GetCurrentProcess().WorkingSet64;\r\n            GC.Collect();\r\n            GC.WaitForPendingFinalizers();\r\n            GC.Collect();\r\n            long c = Process.GetCurrentProcess().WorkingSet64;\r\n            \r\n            this.Controls.Add(new Label() { Text = $\"{a}\\n{b}\\n{c}\", Dock = DockStyle.Fill, TextAlign = ContentAlignment.MiddleCenter});\r\n        }\r\n    }\r\n\r\n    public class ParentForm : Form\r\n    {\r\n        private Byte[] array;\r\n\r\n        public Form Yum()\r\n        {\r\n            this.array = new Byte[1024 * 1024];\r\n            Array.Clear(array, 0, this.array.Length);\r\n            \r\n            Form child = new Form();\r\n            child.Show(this); // <-----\r\n\r\n            return child;\r\n        }\r\n    }\r\n```\r\n\r\n**Workaround**\r\n```\r\nchild.Owner = this;\r\nchild.Show();\r\n```\r\n\r\n","Url":"https://github.com/dotnet/winforms/issues/530","RelatedDescription":"Open issue \"Form.Show/PropDialogOwner causing memory leaks\" (#530)"},{"Id":"417301639","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2019-03-05T16:52:16","Actor":"dotnet-maestro[bot]","Number":"529","RawContent":null,"Title":"[master] Update dependencies from dotnet/corefx","State":"closed","Body":"This pull request updates the following dependencies\r\n\r\nUpdates from https://github.com/dotnet/corefx\r\n\r\n- System.CodeDom - 4.6.0-preview4.19154.9\r\n- Microsoft.NETCore.Platforms - 3.0.0-preview4.19154.9\r\n- Microsoft.Win32.Registry - 4.6.0-preview4.19154.9\r\n- Microsoft.Win32.SystemEvents - 4.6.0-preview4.19154.9\r\n- System.Security.Cryptography.Cng - 4.6.0-preview4.19154.9\r\n- System.Security.Permissions - 4.6.0-preview4.19154.9\r\n- System.Configuration.ConfigurationManager - 4.6.0-preview4.19154.9\r\n- System.Windows.Extensions - 4.6.0-preview4.19154.9\r\n- System.Drawing.Common - 4.6.0-preview4.19154.9\r\n\r\n","Url":"https://github.com/dotnet/winforms/pull/529","RelatedDescription":"Closed or merged PR \"[master] Update dependencies from dotnet/corefx\" (#529)"},{"Id":"417287035","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2019-03-05T16:52:03","Actor":"dotnet-maestro[bot]","Number":"528","RawContent":null,"Title":"[master] Update dependencies from dotnet/arcade","State":"closed","Body":"This pull request updates the following dependencies\r\n\r\nUpdates from https://github.com/dotnet/arcade\r\n\r\n- Microsoft.DotNet.Arcade.Sdk - 1.0.0-beta.19154.14\r\n- Microsoft.DotNet.XUnitExtensions - 2.4.0-beta.19154.14\r\n- Microsoft.DotNet.GenFacades - 1.0.0-beta.19154.14\r\n\r\n","Url":"https://github.com/dotnet/winforms/pull/528","RelatedDescription":"Closed or merged PR \"[master] Update dependencies from dotnet/arcade\" (#528)"}],"ResultType":"GitHubIssue"}},"RunOn":"2019-03-09T05:30:46.2598406Z","RunDurationInMilliseconds":568}
