I tried reflecting it using the Productivity Tool but it would seem it does not support it correctly, and the chart itself is an image embedded into the PPTX. Seems to be stored very much differently than other types of charts.\r\n\r\nI know this is a question and not a bug, but SO is entirely unhelpful in answering new questions, I tried asking and they just outright closed my question."},{"Id":"11336233660","Type":"IssuesEvent","CreatedAt":"2020-01-22T17:46:07","Actor":"AceTheWiz","Repository":"OfficeDev/Open-XML-SDK","Organization":"OfficeDev","RawContent":null,"RelatedAction":"opened","RelatedUrl":"https://github.com/OfficeDev/Open-XML-SDK/issues/673","RelatedDescription":"Opened issue \"n open xml exaples\" (#673) at OfficeDev/Open-XML-SDK","RelatedBody":"# Before submitting an issue, please fill this out\r\n\r\nIs this a:\r\n- [ ] Issue with the OpenXml library\r\n- [ ] Question on library usage\r\n\r\nIf you have answered that this is a question, please ask it on StackOverflow instead of here.\r\nThis issue tracker is meant to track product issues while StackOverflow excels at answering questions\r\n\r\n---------------- Remove this line and above before posting ----------------\r\n\r\n**Description**\r\n\r\nPlease provide a simple description of the issue encountered.\r\n\r\n**Information**\r\n\r\n- .NET Target: (ie .NET Framework, .NET Core, UWP, Xamarin, etc)\r\n- DocumentFormat.OpenXml Version: (ie 2.7.2)\r\n\r\n**Repro**\r\n\r\n```csharp\r\n// Please add a self-contained, minimum viable repro of the issue.\r\n// If you require external resources, please provide a gist or GitHub repro\r\n// An Xunit style test is preferred, but a console application would work too.\r\n``` \r\n\r\n**Observed**\r\n\r\nPlease add your observed behavior here\r\n\r\n**Expected**\r\n\r\nPlease add your expected behavior here.\r\n"},{"Id":"11301661024","Type":"IssuesEvent","CreatedAt":"2020-01-17T16:01:28","Actor":"AlejandroFerrandiz","Repository":"OfficeDev/Open-XML-SDK","Organization":"OfficeDev","RawContent":null,"RelatedAction":"opened","RelatedUrl":"https://github.com/OfficeDev/Open-XML-SDK/issues/672","RelatedDescription":"Opened issue \"CellReference is null\" (#672) at OfficeDev/Open-XML-SDK","RelatedBody":"**Description**\r\n\r\nI have excel files that I'm trying to map but CellReference is null for each cell but, if I Open the file with Microsoft Office and save, after that if I try to map again CellReference is not null for each cell.
