CoreRT expects to find a published ObjectWriter package, musl edition, in the nuget feed. The error message when invoking the above is therefore (after having successfully built the native components of CoreRT + objwriter):\r\n\r\n```\r\n Restoring packages for /corertalpine/src/ILCompiler/ObjectWriter/ObjectWriter.depproj...\r\n  Installing Microsoft.DotNet.ObjectWriter 1.0.0-alpha-27619-05.\r\n/corertalpine/src/ILCompiler/ObjectWriter/ObjectWriter.depproj : error NU1101: Unable to find package runtime.linux-musl-x64.Microsoft.DotNet.ObjectWriter.

So my approach was like this:\r\n\r\n```\r\n  public class ArrayView<Tin, Tout> where Tin : struct where Tout : struct\r\n    {\r\n        private Tin[] array;\r\n\r\n        public ArrayView(Tin[] array_in)\r\n        {\r\n            array = array_in;\r\n        }\r\n\r\n        public Tout this[int index] => (Tout)array[index];\r\n\r\n        public Tout this[int index]\r\n        {\r\n            get\r\n            {\r\n                switch (Type.GetTypeCode(typeof(Tin)))\r\n                {\r\n                    case TypeCode.Byte: return (Tout)array[index];\r\n                }\r\n            }\r\n        }\r\n    }\r\n```\r\n\r\nBut this one doesn't work. `Span<T>` also do not have some sort of `static_cast<>` which I can use. What I tried then, was to benchmark a regular array index access vs. Array.GetValue() and I thought Array.GetValue is recognized by the CLR and optimized well, but when I compare my benchmark this looks horrible. Is there an explanation for this and some sort of solution for the example above?\r\n\r\n```\r\n public class ArrayGet\r\n    {\r\n        public int[] ArraySource1;\r\n        public Array ArraySource2;\r\n        public int N = 1000;\r\n\r\n        [GlobalSetup]\r\n        public void Setup()\r\n        {\r\n            ArraySource1 = new int[N];\r\n            for (int i = 0; i < N; i++) ArraySource1[i] = i;\r\n\r\n            ArraySource2 = ArraySource1;\r\n        }\r\n\r\n        [Benchmark]\r\n        public void SumClassic()\r\n        {\r\n            int sum = 0;\r\n\r\n            for (int i = 0; i < N; i++)\r\n                sum += ArraySource1[i];\r\n        }\r\n\r\n        [Benchmark]\r\n        public void SumArrayGetValue()\r\n        {\r\n            int sum = 0;\r\n\r\n            for (int i = 0; i < N; i++)\r\n                sum += (int)ArraySource2.GetValue(i);\r\n        }\r\n    }\r\n```\r\n\r\n```\r\n|           Method | Runtime |     Toolchain |        Mean |        Error |       StdDev | Ratio | RatioSD |\r\n|----------------- |-------- |-------------- |------------:|-------------:|-------------:|------:|--------:|\r\n|       SumClassic |     Clr |        net472 |          NA |           NA |           NA |     ? |       ? |\r\n|       SumClassic |    Core | netcoreapp2.2 |    707.1 ns |     1.793 ns |     1.497 ns |  1.00 |    0.00 |\r\n|       SumClassic |    Core | netcoreapp3.0 |    732.1 ns |     4.750 ns |     4.211 ns |  1.04 |    0.01 |\r\n|                  |         |               |             |              |              |       |         |\r\n| SumArrayGetValue |     Clr |        net472 |          NA |           NA |           NA |     ? |       ? |\r\n| SumArrayGetValue |    Core | netcoreapp2.2 | 76,886.0 ns | 1,467.282 ns | 1,372.496 ns |  1.00 |    0.00 |\r\n| SumArrayGetValue |    Core | netcoreapp3.0 | 79,786.7 ns | 1,128.441 ns | 1,055.544 ns |  1.04 |    0.02 |\r\n```","Url":"https://github.com/dotnet/coreclr/issues/25175","RelatedDescription":"Open issue \"Array.GetValue has slowed down in .NET Core 3.0\" (#25175)"},{"Id":"456001819","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2019-06-14T20:47:05","Actor":"jorive","Number":"25161","RawContent":null,"Title":"Moving non-EventPipe types out of eventpipe.*","State":"closed","Body":"- Replace an `_ASSERTE` with `static_assert`\r\n- Moved out non-`EventPipe` types out of `eventpipe.[h|cpp]`","Url":"https://github.com/dotnet/coreclr/pull/25161","RelatedDescription":"Closed or merged PR \"Moving non-EventPipe types out of eventpipe.*\" (#25161)"},{"Id":"455934567","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2019-06-14T19:48:47","Actor":"kouvel","Number":"25158","RawContent":null,"Title":"Fix crash/corruption in VSD hash tables when backpatching entry point slots is enabled","State":"closed","Body":"Fixes https://github.com/dotnet/coreclr/issues/25080\r\nFixes https://github.com/dotnet/coreclr/issues/22964\r\n- The prober used to look for an item (`DispatchStub` or `ResolveCacheElem`) stores information specific to the table\r\n- Cooperative GC mode guarantees that the information stored in the prober remains valid when the prober is reused to add a new item when one is not found\r\n- The lock taken to record/backpatch an item's slot exits and reenters cooperative GC mode, which can cause the table to be reclaimed and replaced with a new table, and the prober still refers to the old table\r\n- Upon adding the new item it may crash or corrupt some other memory\r\n- Fixed by resetting the prober if a path is taken that may reenter cooperative GC mode","Url":"https://github.com/dotnet/coreclr/pull/25158","RelatedDescription":"Closed or merged PR \"Fix crash/corruption in VSD hash tables when backpatching entry point slots is enabled\" (#25158)"},{"Id":"456396657","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2019-06-14T19:16:59","Actor":"elinor-fung","Number":"25174","RawContent":null,"Title":"Fix duplicate imports in managed product build","State":"open","Body":"Avoid duplicate imports in managed product build.\r\n\r\nSince we still have other BuildTools dependencies, a cleaner fix would require a bunch more finagling to split things up / move them about.

As far as I can tell the IBM MQ sets up its own signal handlers. By doing this it saves any previously registered handler for each signal. The library handles one of the signals and then attempts to call the original handler that was in effect previously.\r\n\r\nIf we only allow the library to register its own signal handlers (SIGSEGV) we end up in the `stack smashing detected` errors instead of getting `NullReferenceException`s.

I however wonder what’s the expected behaviour here and what is allowed?\r\n\r\nThe C# spec says that when a value of X is null, then a `System.NullReferenceException` is thrown. Is this guarantee broken here? In our case a native library seems to be indirectly involved which: \r\n* first is not obvious for.NET developers\r\n* secondly is not well documented\r\n\r\nIf the above signal interaction cannot be changed then maybe it’s worth documenting it e.g. in the .NET native interoperability guidelines.\r\n\r\nI guess it’s not possible to force .NET not to use signals and do explicit null checks (it might not be performance wise anyway). I recall something like this for mono set via the MONO_DEBUG (but as the name speaks it is also for debug and not release versions)\r\n\r\n","Url":"https://github.com/dotnet/coreclr/issues/25166","RelatedDescription":"Open issue \"Stack Smashing Failures (SIGSEGV) instead of NullReferenceExceptions\" (#25166)"},{"Id":"456083233","IsPullRequest":false,"CreatedAt":"2019-06-14T06:32:59","Actor":"AriNuer","Number":"25164","RawContent":null,"Title":"Test failure: JIT_jit64._opt_cse_HugeArray_HugeArray_/_opt_cse_HugeArray_HugeArray_sh","State":"open","Body":"The test `JIT_jit64._opt_cse_HugeArray_HugeArray_/_opt_cse_HugeArray_HugeArray_sh` has failed.\r\n\r\nFailure Message:\r\n```\r\n/root/helix/work/workitem/JIT/jit64/opt/cse/HugeArray/HugeArray.sh: line 163:  2420 Segmentation fault      (core dumped) $_DebuggerFullPath \\\"$CORE_ROOT/crossgen\\\" /Platform_Assemblies_Paths $CORE_ROOT:$PWD/IL:$PWD /in HugeArray.org /out HugeArray.exe\r\n\r\nReturn code:      1\r\nRaw output file:      /root/helix/work/workitem/JIT/jit64/Reports/JIT.jit64/opt/cse/HugeArray/HugeArray.output.txt\r\nRaw output:\r\nBEGIN EXECUTION\r\nin takeLock\r\n/root/helix/work/correlation/crossgen /Platform_Assemblies_Paths /root/helix/work/correlation:/root/helix/work/workitem/JIT/jit64/opt/cse/HugeArray/IL:/root/helix/work/workitem/JIT/jit64/opt/cse/HugeArray /in HugeArray.org /out HugeArray.exe\r\nCrossgen failed with exitcode: 139\r\nin ReleaseLock\r\nTest Harness Exitcode is : 1\r\nTo run the test:\r\n> set CORE_ROOT=/root/helix/work/correlation\r\n> /root/helix/work/workitem/JIT/jit64/opt/cse/HugeArray/HugeArray.sh\r\nExpected: True\r\nActual:   False\r\n```\r\n\r\nStack Trace:\r\n```\r\n   at JIT_jit64._opt_cse_HugeArray_HugeArray_._opt_cse_HugeArray_HugeArray_sh() in /__w/1/s/bin/tests/Linux.arm.Release/TestWrappers/JIT.jit64/JIT.jit64.XUnitWrapper.cs:line 14655\r\n```\r\n\r\nBuild : Master -

Download latest preview7 tar.gz from [core-sdk](https://github.com/dotnet/core-sdk) for Linux x64\r\n2. unpack with `tar zxvf dotnet-sdk-latest-linux-x64.tar.gz -C ./dotnet3` (create destination folder befor extracting)\r\n3. setup environment variables `export DOTNET_ROOT=$HOME/dotnet3` & `export PATH=$PATH:$HOME/dotnet3`, I'm using zsh so they goes into my .zshrc (or .zprofile)\r\n4. reopen shell\r\n5. run `dotnet new -i \"Microsoft.AspNetCore.Blazor.Templates::3.0.0-preview7.*\"`\r\n6. restore process hangs with no output or any message\r\n\r\nAlso with preview6 bits as root or user, does not make any difference.\r\nIt works on Windows 10 and WSL (Ubuntu 18.04) perfectly!\r\n\r\n## Expected  behavior\r\nThe command should restore necessary files from Nuget and install new templates so they can be used with `dotnet new`\r\n\r\n## Actual behavior\r\nRestore process hangs with no output or any message.\r\n\r\n## Environment data\r\n`dotnet --info` output:\r\n```\r\n.NET Core SDK (reflecting any global.json):\r\n Version:   3.0.100-preview7-012398\r\n Commit:    028dd7635a\r\n\r\nRuntime Environment:\r\n OS Name:     ubuntu\r\n OS Version:  18.04\r\n OS Platform: Linux\r\n RID:         ubuntu.18.04-x64\r\n Base Path:   /home/---/dotnet3/sdk/3.0.100-preview7-012398/\r\n\r\nHost (useful for support):\r\n  Version: 3.0.0-preview7-27813-06\r\n  Commit:  5cfc2cab25\r\n\r\n.NET Core SDKs installed:\r\n  3.0.100-preview7-012398 [/home/---/dotnet3/sdk]\r\n\r\n.NET Core runtimes installed:\r\n  Microsoft.AspNetCore.App 3.0.0-preview7.19311.5 [/home/---/dotnet3/shared/Microsoft.AspNetCore.App]\r\n  Microsoft.NETCore.App 3.0.0-preview7-27813-06 [/home/---/dotnet3/shared/Microsoft.NETCore.App]\r\n\r\nTo install additional .NET Core runtimes or SDKs:\r\n  https://aka.ms/dotnet-download\r\n```","Url":"https://github.com/dotnet/cli/issues/11560","RelatedDescription":"Open issue \"Unable to restore packages on Ubuntu 18.04 (3.0 preview7)\" (#11560)"},{"Id":"456216241","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2019-06-14T12:53:25","Actor":"dotnet-maestro[bot]","Number":"11559","RawContent":null,"Title":"[master] Update dependencies from dotnet/templating","State":"closed","Body":"This pull request updates the following dependencies\r\n\r\n[marker]: <> (Begin:0be14b38-c39d-4bd1-cee3-08d67668456c)\r\n## From https://github.com/dotnet/templating\r\n- **Build**: 20190613.1\r\n- **Date Produced**: 6/13/2019 12:55 PM\r\n- **Commit**: 4f65a5662b1ce832c946f4120744b4da46f20d39\r\n- **Branch**: refs/heads/master\r\n- **Updates**:\r\n  - **Microsoft.TemplateEngine.Cli** -> 1.0.2-beta5.19313.1\r\n\r\n[marker]: <> (End:0be14b38-c39d-4bd1-cee3-08d67668456c)\r\n\r\n","Url":"https://github.com/dotnet/cli/pull/11559","RelatedDescription":"Closed or merged PR \"[master] Update dependencies from dotnet/templating\" (#11559)"},{"Id":"456213496","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2019-06-14T12:41:29","Actor":"dotnet-maestro[bot]","Number":"11558","RawContent":null,"Title":"[master] Update dependencies from dotnet/sdk","State":"closed","Body":"This pull request updates the following dependencies\r\n\r\n[marker]: <> (Begin:145b81c3-fdcc-4cb6-70fa-08d645e3a44f)\r\n## From https://github.com/dotnet/sdk\r\n- **Build**: 20190613.3\r\n- **Date Produced**: 6/14/2019 1:49 AM\r\n- **Commit**: cb8c89e71323d667cac97fcbe6ad6cf95a11068a\r\n- **Branch**: refs/heads/master\r\n- **Updates**:\r\n  - **Microsoft.NET.Sdk** -> 3.0.100-preview7.19313.3\r\n\r\n[marker]: <> (End:145b81c3-fdcc-4cb6-70fa-08d645e3a44f)\r\n\r\n","Url":"https://github.com/dotnet/cli/pull/11558","RelatedDescription":"Closed or merged PR \"[master] Update dependencies from dotnet/sdk\" (#11558)"},{"Id":"456212847","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2019-06-14T12:04:22","Actor":"dotnet-bot","Number":"11556","RawContent":null,"Title":"Merge release/2.1.5xx to release/2.2.1xx","State":"open","Body":"\nThis is an automatically generated pull request from release/2.1.5xx into release/2.2.1xx.\n\n``` bash\ngit fetch --all\ngit checkout merges/release/2.1.5xx-to-release/2.2.1xx\ngit reset --hard upstream/release/2.2.1xx\ngit merge upstream/release/2.1.5xx\n# Fix merge conflicts\ngit commit\ngit push upstream merges/release/2.1.5xx-to-release/2.2.1xx --force\n```\n\nOnce all conflicts are resolved and all the tests pass, you are free to merge the pull request.","Url":"https://github.com/dotnet/cli/pull/11556","RelatedDescription":"Open PR \"Merge release/2.1.5xx to release/2.2.1xx\" (#11556)"},{"Id":"455905844","IsPullRequest":false,"CreatedAt":"2019-06-14T04:43:09","Actor":"jimbobbennett","Number":"11549","RawContent":null,"Title":"dotnet tool install fails with a local source if offline","State":"closed","Body":"## Steps to reproduce\r\n\r\nBe offline\r\nInstall a tool using a local package with the --add-sources flag\r\n\r\n\r\n## Expected  behavior\r\n\r\nThe CLI should check all sources for the tool and install it if it is found in any path, and ignore being offline unless no package is found. It should look in the add-sources path first and install from there, not caring that the nuget.org source is offline.\r\n\r\n## Actual behavior\r\n\r\nIf the add-sources flag is used it is a good indicator that that source is the one the user intends to use - and indeed this appears to be the case as the tool is installed from the add-sources path instead of nuget.org. The problem comes in that the install checks for it in the online packages as well, and when this fails due to being offline you get an error.\r\n\r\n## Environment data\r\n`dotnet --info` output:\r\n\r\n.NET Core SDK (reflecting any global.json):\r\n Version:   2.1.503\r\n Commit:    4c506e0f35\r\n\r\nRuntime Environment:\r\n OS Name:     Windows\r\n OS Version:  10.0.18362\r\n OS Platform: Windows\r\n RID:         win10-x64\r\n Base Path:   C:\\Program Files\\dotnet\\sdk\\2.1.503\\\r\n\r\nHost (useful for support):\r\n  Version: 3.0.0-preview5-27626-15\r\n  Commit:  61f30f5a23\r\n\r\n.NET Core SDKs installed:\r\n  2.1.400-preview-009063 [C:\\Program Files\\dotnet\\sdk]\r\n  2.1.400 [C:\\Program Files\\dotnet\\sdk]\r\n  2.1.402 [C:\\Program Files\\dotnet\\sdk]\r\n  2.1.403 [C:\\Program Files\\dotnet\\sdk]\r\n  2.1.500-preview-009335 [C:\\Program Files\\dotnet\\sdk]\r\n  2.1.500-preview-009398 [C:\\Program Files\\dotnet\\sdk]\r\n  2.1.500-preview-009404 [C:\\Program Files\\dotnet\\sdk]\r\n  2.1.500 [C:\\Program Files\\dotnet\\sdk]\r\n  2.1.502 [C:\\Program Files\\dotnet\\sdk]\r\n  2.1.503 [C:\\Program Files\\dotnet\\sdk]\r\n  2.1.505 [C:\\Program Files\\dotnet\\sdk]\r\n  2.1.600-preview-009426 [C:\\Program Files\\dotnet\\sdk]\r\n  2.1.600-preview-009472 [C:\\Program Files\\dotnet\\sdk]\r\n  2.1.602 [C:\\Program Files\\dotnet\\sdk]\r\n  2.1.700-preview-009597 [C:\\Program Files\\dotnet\\sdk]\r\n  2.1.700 [C:\\Program Files\\dotnet\\sdk]\r\n  2.1.800-preview-009677 [C:\\Program Files\\dotnet\\sdk]\r\n  2.2.105 [C:\\Program Files\\dotnet\\sdk]\r\n  3.0.100-preview5-011568 [C:\\Program Files\\dotnet\\sdk]\r\n\r\n.NET Core runtimes installed:\r\n  Microsoft.AspNetCore.All 2.1.4 [C:\\Program Files\\dotnet\\shared\\Microsoft.AspNetCore.All]\r\n  Microsoft.AspNetCore.All 2.1.5 [C:\\Program Files\\dotnet\\shared\\Microsoft.AspNetCore.All]\r\n  Microsoft.AspNetCore.All 2.1.6 [C:\\Program Files\\dotnet\\shared\\Microsoft.AspNetCore.All]\r\n  Microsoft.AspNetCore.All 2.1.7 [C:\\Program Files\\dotnet\\shared\\Microsoft.AspNetCore.All]\r\n  Microsoft.AspNetCore.All 2.1.9 [C:\\Program Files\\dotnet\\shared\\Microsoft.AspNetCore.All]\r\n  Microsoft.AspNetCore.All 2.1.11 [C:\\Program Files\\dotnet\\shared\\Microsoft.AspNetCore.All]\r\n  Microsoft.AspNetCore.All 2.2.3 [C:\\Program Files\\dotnet\\shared\\Microsoft.AspNetCore.All]\r\n  Microsoft.AspNetCore.App 2.1.4 [C:\\Program Files\\dotnet\\shared\\Microsoft.AspNetCore.App]\r\n  Microsoft.AspNetCore.App 2.1.5 [C:\\Program Files\\dotnet\\shared\\Microsoft.AspNetCore.App]\r\n  Microsoft.AspNetCore.App 2.1.6 [C:\\Program Files\\dotnet\\shared\\Microsoft.AspNetCore.App]\r\n  Microsoft.AspNetCore.App 2.1.7 [C:\\Program Files\\dotnet\\shared\\Microsoft.AspNetCore.App]\r\n  Microsoft.AspNetCore.App 2.1.9 [C:\\Program Files\\dotnet\\shared\\Microsoft.AspNetCore.App]\r\n  Microsoft.AspNetCore.App 2.1.11 [C:\\Program Files\\dotnet\\shared\\Microsoft.AspNetCore.App]\r\n  Microsoft.AspNetCore.App 2.2.3 [C:\\Program Files\\dotnet\\shared\\Microsoft.AspNetCore.App]\r\n  Microsoft.AspNetCore.App 3.0.0-preview5-19227-01 [C:\\Program Files\\dotnet\\shared\\Microsoft.AspNetCore.App]\r\n  Microsoft.NETCore.App 2.1.1 [C:\\Program Files\\dotnet\\shared\\Microsoft.NETCore.App]\r\n  Microsoft.NETCore.App 2.1.2 [C:\\Program Files\\dotnet\\shared\\Microsoft.NETCore.App]\r\n  Microsoft.NETCore.App 2.1.4 [C:\\Program Files\\dotnet\\shared\\Microsoft.NETCore.App]\r\n  Microsoft.NETCore.App 2.1.5 [C:\\Program Files\\dotnet\\shared\\Microsoft.NETCore.App]\r\n  Microsoft.NETCore.App 2.1.6 [C:\\Program Files\\dotnet\\shared\\Microsoft.NETCore.App]\r\n  Microsoft.NETCore.App 2.1.7 [C:\\Program Files\\dotnet\\shared\\Microsoft.NETCore.App]\r\n  Microsoft.NETCore.App 2.1.9 [C:\\Program Files\\dotnet\\shared\\Microsoft.NETCore.App]\r\n  Microsoft.NETCore.App 2.1.11 [C:\\Program Files\\dotnet\\shared\\Microsoft.NETCore.App]\r\n  Microsoft.NETCore.App 2.2.3 [C:\\Program Files\\dotnet\\shared\\Microsoft.NETCore.App]\r\n  Microsoft.NETCore.App 3.0.0-preview5-27626-15 [C:\\Program Files\\dotnet\\shared\\Microsoft.NETCore.App]\r\n  Microsoft.WindowsDesktop.App 3.0.0-preview5-27626-15 [C:\\Program Files\\dotnet\\shared\\Microsoft.WindowsDesktop.App]\r\n\r\nTo install additional .NET Core runtimes or SDKs:\r\n  https://aka.ms/dotnet-download\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n","Url":"https://github.com/dotnet/cli/issues/11549","RelatedDescription":"Closed issue \"dotnet tool install fails with a local source if offline\" (#11549)"},{"Id":"456025108","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2019-06-14T04:03:08","Actor":"jkotalik","Number":"11550","RawContent":null,"Title":"Add Dev cert as a real dependency","State":"closed","Body":"Fixes a dependency on the ASP.NET Core https dev cert.

This works pretty well but does introduce an ambiguous scenario when the server completes the response before the client completes the request.\r\n\r\nServer code: (Kestrel 3.0.0-preview7)\r\n```\r\n                var response = \"hello, world\";\r\n                context.Response.ContentLength = response.Length;\r\n                await context.Response.WriteAsync(response);\r\n\r\n                await context.Features.Get<IHttpResponseCompletionFeature>().CompleteAsync();\r\n                await Task.Delay(TimeSpan.FromSeconds(5));\r\n                // Drain the request body\r\n                await context.Request.Body.CopyToAsync(Stream.Null);\r\n```\r\nYes this server code is a bit unusual, it was written this way to make the error visible from CopyToAsync. You'll get similar behavior if you just write Hello World and let the request unwind.\r\n\r\nClient code:\r\n```\r\n            var client = new HttpClient();\r\n            client.DefaultRequestVersion = new Version(2, 0);\r\n            using var file = File.OpenRead(@\"A200MbFile.txt\");\r\n            var content = new StreamContent(file);\r\n            var response = await client.PostAsync(\"https://localhost:5001\", content);\r\n```\r\n- In HTTP/1.x this works fine, PostAsync won't complete until the request stream has been completely uploaded. \r\n- In HTTP/2 it's ambiguous because when PostAsync completes you have a fully buffered response body but you have no idea what the state of the request is nor a way to be notified of its completion. Trying to perform any operations on that file can cause errors in the client code because it's still in use. If you close the file now the request will fail, but the error will only be visible on the server.\r\n- HttpCompletionOptions do not have any affect on the request, they only affect the response.\r\n- None of the built in HttpContent implementations provide any visibility on their progress. PushStreamContent from WebApi is the only HttpContent example I've seen that would surface this state to users.\r\n\r\nMitigations:\r\n- Servers usually wait for the request body to end before ending the response body. However the client can't always rely on the server behaving a specific way, ending the response early is within spec.\r\n- For >= 300 responses the HTTP/2 stream will be reset and the request stream abandon. These are the most common scenarios where the server would end the response without draining the request. This doesn't surface any errors directly to the caller unless they have a custom HttpContent, they have to infer the request body is done/abandon from the status code.\r\n\r\nThese mitigations make the issue occur infrequently enough that it will cause some very non-obvious issues when it it does happen (e.g. locked files, InvalidOperationExceptions, multi-threaded stream re-use, etc.).\r\n\r\nProposals:\r\nA) At a minimum there needs to be guidance given that this might happen and how the user might handle it. I don't know what guidance could be given beyond implementing a custom HttpContent.\r\nB) Add something to HttpContent to make progress more visible. E.g. something they could await or DisposeAsync that could wait for things to finish first. This wouldn't be very discoverable and would need to be accompanied by guidance.\r\nC) Only enable bidirectional support when using HttpCompletionOptions.ResponseHeadersRead (or a new flag?). Most people don't use this flag so they wouldn't be impacted by the behavior change (e.g. PostAsync doesn't support that mode). I'm not sure how you implement this without B.\r\n\r\n@wfurt @davidsh ","Url":"https://github.com/dotnet/corefx/issues/38559","RelatedDescription":"Open issue \"Bidirectional HTTP/2 makes request body completion ambiguous\" (#38559)"},{"Id":"456379243","IsPullRequest":false,"CreatedAt":"2019-06-14T18:29:15","Actor":"krwq","Number":"38558","RawContent":null,"Title":"HTTP2: HttpClient does not respond to pings after GOAWAY when some streams are still active","State":"open","Body":"After client receives GOAWAY it should still respond to PING as long as there are any streams open.\r\n\r\nDetails:\r\n- GOAWAY frame contains two parameters: streamId => always 0, lastStreamId > last stream server can take action on (this means the streams with lower or equal number than that should still continue)\r\n- GOAWAY tells that connection is that server no longer wishes for new streams to be open on the same connection and that client should not respond to frames with higher id than lastStreamId\r\n- PING per rfc should be treated with high priority and should be responded to\r\n\r\nThis behavior seem to not be explicitly defined in the spec (at least I could not find any mentions) but:\r\n- spec says that communication on streams with lower stream ids than last stream id should continue (GOAWAY and PING are both not tied to specific stream id but ID they send frame to is lower than lastStreamId)\r\n- after GOAWAY is send it is particularly important to respond to pings as it seems it may be used by server to determine if client immediately went away or not\r\n- we currently respond to still active streams but not on streamless frames like PING\r\n- not responding to PING means that active stream might be unnecesarily closed and will need to be retried on the new connection\r\n","Url":"https://github.com/dotnet/corefx/issues/38558","RelatedDescription":"Open issue \"HTTP2: HttpClient does not respond to pings after GOAWAY when some streams are still active\" (#38558)"},{"Id":"456365826","IsPullRequest":false,"CreatedAt":"2019-06-14T17:53:10","Actor":"IvanJosipovic","Number":"38557","RawContent":null,"Title":"[System.Text.Json] Dictionary ordering with nulls bug","State":"open","Body":"There appears to be bug in System.Text.Json related to property ordering, IgnoreNullValues and Dictionary.\r\n\r\n.Net Core: 3.0.100-preview6-012264\r\nSystem.Text.Json: 4.6.0-preview6.19303.8\r\n\r\nRunning the code below will throw an exception:\r\n```\r\nUnhandled Exception: System.NullReferenceException: Object reference not set to an instance of an object.\r\n   at System.Text.Json.Serialization.JsonSerializer.ApplyValueToEnumerable[TProperty](TProperty& value, ReadStack& state, Utf8JsonReader& reader)\r\n   at System.Text.Json.Serialization.JsonPropertyInfoNotNullable`3.ReadEnumerable(JsonTokenType tokenType, ReadStack& state, Utf8JsonReader& reader)\r\n   at System.Text.Json.Serialization.JsonPropertyInfoNotNullable`3.Read(JsonTokenType tokenType, ReadStack& state, Utf8JsonReader& reader)\r\n   at System.Text.Json.Serialization.JsonSerializer.HandleValue(JsonTokenType tokenType, JsonSerializerOptions options, Utf8JsonReader& reader, ReadStack& state)\r\n   at System.Text.Json.Serialization.JsonSerializer.ReadCore(JsonSerializerOptions options, Utf8JsonReader& reader, ReadStack& readStack)\r\n   at System.Text.Json.Serialization.JsonSerializer.ReadCore(Type returnType, JsonSerializerOptions options, Utf8JsonReader& reader)\r\n   at System.Text.Json.Serialization.JsonSerializer.ParseCore(String json, Type returnType, JsonSerializerOptions options)\r\n   at System.Text.Json.Serialization.JsonSerializer.Parse[TValue](String json, JsonSerializerOptions options)\r\n   at ConsoleApp1.SystemExtension.Clone[T](T source) in C:\\Repos\\ConsoleApp1\\ConsoleApp1\\Program.cs:line 10\r\n   at ConsoleApp1.Program.Main(String[] args) in C:\\Repos\\ConsoleApp1\\ConsoleApp1\\Program.cs:line 24\r\n```\r\n\r\n\r\n```\r\nusing System.Collections.Generic;\r\nusing System.Text.Json.Serialization;\r\n\r\nnamespace ConsoleApp1\r\n{\r\n    public static class SystemExtension\r\n    {\r\n        public static T Clone<T>(this T source)\r\n        {\r\n            return JsonSerializer.Parse<T>(JsonSerializer.ToString(source, new JsonSerializerOptions { IgnoreNullValues = true }));\r\n        }\r\n    }\r\n\r\n    class Program\r\n    {\r\n        static void Main(string[] args)\r\n        {\r\n            new GoodOrder()\r\n            {\r\n                Test = \"value1\"\r\n            }\r\n            .Clone();\r\n\r\n            new BadOrder()\r\n            {\r\n                Test = \"value1\"\r\n            }\r\n            .Clone();

I noticed that JSON generated with System.Text.Json.Serialization.JsonSerializer was a bit larger than the same data serialized with Newtonsoft.Json.JsonSerializer/JsonWriter. The difference is in the serialized strings, as System.Text.Json.Serialization.JsonSerializer escapes more characters than Newtonsoft does, and mostly uses the hex character code, even if a shorter escape sequence exists. I did another test with all visible ASCII characters (0x20 to 0x7e), here are the results (hoping that Markdown won't screw it up).\r\n\r\n```\r\nNewtonsoft.Json:\r\n{\"msg\":\" !\\\"#$%&'()*+,-./0123456789:;<=>?@ABCDEFGHIJKLMNOPQRSTUVWXYZ[\\\\]^_`abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz{|}~\"}\r\n\r\nSystem.Text.Json:\r\n{\"msg\":\" !\\u0022#$%\\u0026\\u0027()*\\u002b,-.\\u002f0123456789:;\\u003c=\\u003e?@ABCDEFGHIJKLMNOPQRSTUVWXYZ[\\\\]^_\\u0060abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz{|}~\"}\r\n```\r\n\r\nSo, Newtonsoft only escapes `\"` and `\\` (and only with 2-character escape sequences) while System.Text.Json escapes ``\"&'+-<>\\` ``  (using hex values - 6 characters - in all cases except one).

This is the value used when no `RollForward` is specified by the SDK in `.runtimeconfig.json`. More details about `RollForward` are here and here.\r\n\r\nFor dynamically loaded components this value would come with problems. The most important one being ordering issues. For example let’s have two COM components `A 3.0 Minor` and `B 3.1 Minor` on a machine which has both `3.0` and `3.1` installed. If the native app activates B first, it will load `3.1` runtime and then when it activates A second it will just work (since A can run on `3.1`). But if the app activates A first, it would load `3.0` (closest available match to `3.0 Minor`) and then when it would try to activate B that would fail (B is not compatible with `3.0`).\r\n\r\nTo overcome this problem the `RollForward` has two settings:\r\n* `LatestMinor` – pick the highest available version with the same `major.` part of the version (so `3.0 LatestMinor` would roll to latest `3.*` version)\r\n* `LatestMajor` – pick the highest available version (all up)\r\n\r\nIf in the above scenario A would be `3.0 LatestMinor` and B would be `3.1 LatestMinor`, no matter which one got activated first, they both would load `3.1` (as the latest `3.*` available version).\r\n\r\nSo to make it easy for users and make things just work out of the box, we would like to set `RollForward` to one of the `LatestMinor`/`LatestMajor` by default on component projects.\r\nElinor has a PR out which introduces the notion of “component project”: https://github.com/dotnet/sdk/pull/3305\r\n\r\nThe question is if we should use `LatestMinor` or `LatestMajor` as the default for component projects.\r\n\r\n*`LatestMinor`:*\r\n* Pros: Higher chance of providing the expected compatibility – in general we try really hard to avoid breaking changes for minor versions, so 3.1 is expected to be fully backward compatible with 3.0. We tell people that upgrading to minor version is “safe”.\r\n* Cons: Come .NET 5 components targeting 3.0 would not run on 5.0. Basically creating an upgrade problem. Combining components targeting both 3.0 and 5.0 would fail.\r\n\r\n*`LatestMajor`:*\r\n* Pros: No upgrade problems – all components run everywhere and together.\r\n* Cons: Potentially breaking for some components as we may introduce some breaking changes between `5.0` and `3.0`. That said `classlibs` (which components are a special case of) are already assumed to work just fine even across major versions (NuGet has no notion of compatibility ranges, and will let people use `3.0` `classlibs` in `5.0` projects).\r\n\r\nSome related discussions already happened:\r\nhttps://github.com/dotnet/core-setup/issues/5870\r\nhttps://github.com/dotnet/core-setup/issues/5062\r\n\r\nThoughs?","Url":"https://github.com/dotnet/sdk/issues/3312","RelatedDescription":"Open issue \"What should be default RollForward for component projects\" (#3312)"},{"Id":"453186764","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2019-06-07T01:17:19","Actor":"peterhuene","Number":"3310","RawContent":null,"Title":"Fix P/Invoke signatures for the resource updater.","State":"closed","Body":"The resource updater was not specifying a CharSet for the Windows API\r\nP/Invoke signatures and therefore the ANSI versions of the APIs were\r\nbeing used.\r\n\r\nThis caused an unhandled exception when customizing the apphost on\r\nWindows when the intermediate apphost path contained Unicode characters\r\nbecause the ANSI resource updating API couldn't find the file.\r\n\r\nFixes [AB#900429](https://devdiv.visualstudio.com/0bdbc590-a062-4c3f-b0f6-9383f67865ee/_workitems/edit/900429).","Url":"https://github.com/dotnet/sdk/pull/3310","RelatedDescription":"Closed or merged PR \"Fix P/Invoke signatures for the resource updater.\" (#3310)"},{"Id":"452776840","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2019-06-06T20:36:55","Actor":"cdmihai","Number":"3306","RawContent":null,"Title":"Update Microsoft.NETFramework.ReferenceAssemblies in TestProject","State":"closed","Body":"","Url":"https://github.com/dotnet/sdk/pull/3306","RelatedDescription":"Closed or merged PR \"Update Microsoft.NETFramework.ReferenceAssemblies in TestProject\" (#3306)"},{"Id":"452957325","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2019-06-06T10:36:29","Actor":"v-zbsail","Number":"3308","RawContent":null,"Title":"LOC CHECKIN | dotnet/sdk master | 20190606","State":"open","Body":"","Url":"https://github.com/dotnet/sdk/pull/3308","RelatedDescription":"Open PR \"LOC CHECKIN | dotnet/sdk master | 20190606\" (#3308)"},{"Id":"452816272","IsPullRequest":false,"CreatedAt":"2019-06-06T03:38:50","Actor":"kkwpsv","Number":"3307","RawContent":null,"Title":"Publish a WebApplication project using `dotnet publish` will fail when it references a project with Exe outputtype","State":"open","Body":"I have two projects.

Either target .NET Core 2.1 or lower, or use a version of the .NET SDK that supports .NET Core 2.2.`\r\n\r\nIf you downloaded the .NET Core SDK 2.2 between April 2 and April 12, 2019, the main [.NET downloads page](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/download/) included only 2.2.2nn. Starting April 12th, a new button marked \"Compatible with Visual Studio 2017\" is provided to target 2.2.1nn. If you downloaded 2.2 prior to this date, and you use Visual Studio 2017, install the compatible version.\r\n\r\n### Visual Studio 2017 can't target .NET Core 2.1\r\n\r\nIf you receive this error message in Visual Studio 2017:\r\n\r\n`The current .NET SDK does not support targeting .NET Core 2.1. Either target .NET Core 2.0 or lower, or use a version of the .NET SDK that supports .NET Core 2.1.`\r\n\r\nThis problem most often occurs because you manually uninstall the 2.1.5nn version. Simply reinstall it from the [.NET Core 2.1 downloads page](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/download/dotnet-core/2.1).\r\n\r\n## More information\r\n\r\nHere is the draft of an article we are preparing for .NET Core documentation:\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n## Solving Problems with .NET Core SDK Selection in Visual Studio\r\n\r\nYou may have .NET Core SDKs on your machine and still have problems with Visual Studio finding an appropriate one. This article explains why this happens and how you can fix your installation.\r\n\r\nWhen Visual Studio can't find an appropriate version of the .NET Core SDK, you'll receive an error message. This may appear in the Error pane as NETSDK1045:\r\n\r\n\"The current .NET SDK does not support targeting .NET Core 2...\"\r\n\r\nYou can check what .NET Core SDKs you have on your machine with the following command:\r\n\r\n```bash\r\ndotnet --list-sdks\r\n```\r\n\r\nUnless you have a global.json file, when you use `dotnet` from the command line, the latest .NET Core SDK is used.\r\n\r\n> [TIP!] \r\n> Open a command prompt and try to build with `dotnet build`. If the command line build works, but Visual Studio doesn't suggestions in this article may help.\r\n\r\nThe last two digits of the .NET Core SDK version numbers are in the format are a patch number, which is represented by `nn` in this article because we will continue to service them to include the latest runtimes. To find out more, vist the [Overview of how .NET Core is versioned page](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/core/versions/).\r\n\r\n## Fixes for Common Problems\r\n\r\n### Visual Studio 2017 can't target .NET Core 2.2\r\n\r\nIf you receive the error message in Visual Studio 2017:\r\n\r\n`The current .NET SDK does not support targeting .NET Core 2.2… Either target .NET Core 2.1 or lower, or use a version of the .NET SDK that supports .NET Core 2.2.`\r\n\r\nUse `dotnet --list-sdks` to ensure you have .NET Core SDK 2.2.1nn. As an example, 2.2.106 would be a valid entry.\r\n\r\nIf you downloaded the .NET Core SDK 2.2 after April 2, 2019, version 2.2.2nn (such as 2.2.203) is listed first and is the highest version available. However, Visual Studio 2017 requires 2.2.1nn (such as 2.2.106). .NET Core SDK 2.2.2nn works with Visual Studio 2019. Visual Studio 2017 and Visual Studio 2019 can be installed side by side, but this requires both .NET Core SDK 2.2.1nn and .NET Core SDK 2.2.2nn to develop .NET Core 2.2 applications.\r\n\r\nTo download .NET Core SDK 2.2.2nn, visit the [.NET downloads page](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/download/dotnet-core/2.2).\r\n\r\n### Visual Studio 2017 can't target .NET Core 2.1\r\n\r\nIf you receive this error message in Visual Studio 2017:\r\n\r\n`The current .NET SDK does not support targeting .NET Core 2.1. Either target .NET Core 2.0 or lower, or use a version of the .NET SDK that supports .NET Core 2.1.`\r\n\r\nUse `dotnet --list-sdks` to ensure you have .NET Core SDK 2.1.5nn. As an example, 2.1.505 would be a valid entry. \r\n\r\nThis problem occurs of you manually uninstall the 2.1.5nn version.\r\n\r\nThe Visual Studio 2019 installation will not remove this file and Visual Studio 2017 will continue to work side by side.\r\n\r\nTo reinstall .NET Core SDK 2.1.5nn, visit the [.NET downloads page](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/download/dotnet-core/2.1).\r\n\r\n### Visual Studio 2019 can't target .NET Core 3.0 Preview\r\n\r\nIf you receive this error message in Visual Studio 2019:\r\n\r\n`The current .NET SDK does not support targeting .NET Core 2.1. Either target .NET Core 2.0 or lower, or use a version of the .NET SDK that supports .NET Core 2.1.`\r\n\r\nUse `dotnet --list-sdks` to ensure you have .NET Core SDK 3.0.100-preview... As an example, SDK 3.0.100-preview3-010431 would be a valid entry.\r\n\r\nTo install .NET Core SDK 3.0.1nn preview, visit the [.NET downloads page](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/download/dotnet-core/3.0).\r\n\r\nIn Visual Studio, go to `Tools\\Options\\Projects and Solutions\\.NET Core` and check the box `Use Previews of the .NET Core SDK`.\r\n\r\n> [NOTE!]\r\n> This option will be moving to `Tools\\Options\\Environment` and renamed `Preview Features` in Visual Studio 2019 version 16.1 Preview 2.\r\n\r\nIf you are targeting .NET Core 3.0 preview, the [C# language version will be C# 8.0 Preview by default](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/visualstudio/releases/2019/release-notes#csharp-defaults) allowing you to use new C# features.\r\n\r\n## Understand the relationship between .NET Core SDKs and Visual Studio build tools\r\n\r\nVisual Studio has its own copies of tools like MSBuild, NuGet and the compilers. If you install the .NET Core workload, it also installs the .NET Core SDK which has versions of these tools and provides tasks and targets. These two versions are built from the same repositories, but target .NET Framework and .NET Core respectively. \r\n\r\nWhen you build a .NET Core project in Visual Studio, it uses Visual Studio's copy of MSBuild, but the tasks and targets are supplied from the selected version of the .NET Core SDK. \r\n\r\nWhen you upgrade the .NET Core SDK, you get new tasks and targets. These new tasks and targets may contain features that are not supported by older versions of MSBuild. Like all of the .NET Core SDK, MSBuild is backwards compatible. It is not forwards compatible.\r\n\r\nThis generally works well, but requires a guarantee that the tasks and targets work with the MSBuild version. To ensure this, each .NET Core SDK indicates an MSBuild version range that is used by Visual Studio to determine compatibility. Versions of the .NET Core SDK that have a higher MSBuild identifier than expected are ignored by Visual Studio. In the normal case, this simply means you use the tasks and targets that were installed with your version of Visual Studio.\r\n\r\nBecause of this, you may have many versions of the .NET Core SDK on your machine and Visual Studio still fail to find one it considers appropriate. This is compounded by a poor error message, which we cannot fully correct because it is from the old version of the .NET Core SDK on your machine. Confusion is also compounded by a complex non-linear release matrix that makes it difficult to predict the right .NET Core SDK to select. We are working to improve all this. \r\n\r\n## The Visual Studio / .NET Core SDK support matrix\r\n\r\nThe last two digits of the .NET Core SDK version number are a patch number, which are represented by a `nn` in this table. You can learn more about .NET Core SDK and .NET Core Runtime versioning at the [Overview of how .NET Core is versioned page](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/core/versions/).\r\n\r\nThe following table shows which Visual Studio versions and .NET Core SDKs are compatible and how they are acquired if you are working with Visual Studio. \r\n\r\n| .NET Core SDK | .NET Core Runtime | Compatible Visual Studio | MSBuild | Notes                                     |\r\n|---------------|-------------------|--------------------------|---------|-------------------------------------------|\r\n| 2.1.5nn       | 2.1               | 2017                     | 15      | Installed as part of VS 2017 version 15.9 |\r\n| 2.1.6nn       | 2.1               | 2019                     | 16      | Installed as part of VS 2019              |\r\n| 2.2.1nn       | 2.2               | 2017                     | 15      | Installed manually                        |\r\n| 2.2.2nn       | 2.2               | 2019                     | 16      | Installed as part of VS 2019              |\r\n| 3.0.1nn       | 3.0 (Preview)     | 2019                     | 16      | Installed manually                        |\r\n\r\nVisual Studio 2017 cannot work with .NET Core SDK 2.1.6nn or 2.2.2nn.\r\n\r\nTo find out more about removing older versions of the .NET Core Runtime and .NET Core SDK, visit the [How to remove the .NET Core Runtime and SDK page](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/core/versions/remove-runtime-sdk-versions?tabs=macos).\r\n\r\nTo download the .NET Core SDK, visit the [.NET downloads page](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/download/dotnet-core).","Url":"https://github.com/dotnet/announcements/issues/108","RelatedDescription":"Open issue \".NET Core SDK 2.2.2nn and 2.1.6nn do not work with Visual Studio 2017\" (#108)"},{"Id":"432081093","IsPullRequest":false,"CreatedAt":"2019-04-11T15:16:43","Actor":"KathleenDollard","Number":"107","RawContent":null,"Title":"Limit DotNetCliToolReference Tools to .NET Core 2.2 and Below","State":"open","Body":"# Limit DotNetCliToolReference Tools to .NET Core 2.2 and Below\r\n\r\n.NET Core 3 takes the next step in the .NET Core tool strategy with local tools.

This issue would occur much more frequently if targeting .NET Core 3.0 was allowed. Restricting tools to target only .NET Core 2.2 and below means existing scenarios to continue to work (as well as they previously did), regardless of the framework version targeted by the project or the current .NET Core SDK. \r\n\r\nThe new .NET Core tool strategy avoids this flaw in restore strategy and offers other benefits, like the ability to author one type of tool and install it in different ways depending on project and user needs.\r\n\r\nWe look forward to your feedback on .NET Core Local Tools, and on challenges you face moving away from DotNetCliToolReference tools. \r\n\r\n[dotnet/sdk #3057](https://github.com/dotnet/sdk/pull/3057)","Url":"https://github.com/dotnet/announcements/issues/107","RelatedDescription":"Open issue \"Limit DotNetCliToolReference Tools to .NET Core 2.2 and Below\" (#107)"},{"Id":"431012407","IsPullRequest":false,"CreatedAt":"2019-04-09T14:51:18","Actor":"MichaelSimons","Number":"106","RawContent":null,"Title":".NET Core SDK container images now contain the Visual Studio 2019 toolset","State":"open","Body":"# .NET Core SDK container images now contain the Visual Studio 2019 toolset\r\n\r\n.NET Core SDK container images now include Visual Studio 2019 tools.

There are now multiple repos for our nightly builds:\r\n\r\n* [.NET Core Nightly product repo](https://hub.docker.com/_/microsoft-dotnet-core-nightly)\r\n* [.NET Core SDK Nightly repo](https://hub.docker.com/_/microsoft-dotnet-core-nightly-sdk/)\r\n* [.NET Core ASP.NET Core Nightly repo](https://hub.docker.com/_/microsoft-dotnet-core-nightly-aspnet/)\r\n* [.NET Core Runtime Nightly repo](https://hub.docker.com/_/microsoft-dotnet-core-nightly-runtime/)\r\n* [.NET Core Runtime-deps Nightly repo](https://hub.docker.com/_/microsoft-dotnet-core-nightly-runtime-deps/)\r\n\r\nThe same split will exist for the non-nightly stable repo (currently hosted at  [microsoft/dotnet](https://hub.docker.com/r/microsoft/dotnet)) when we start publishing it to MCR and syndicating it back to DockerHub.\r\n\r\n## Changes to registry URL\r\n\r\nThe biggest change is that your Dockerfiles need to be updated to point to the MCR registry in order get access to new .NET Core container tags. The same change is required for scripts or human operations that pull images via `docker pull`.\r\n\r\nThe following example shows the registry path, repo and tag for the .NET Core 2.2 \"Nightly\" SDK on MCR:\r\n\r\n```console\r\nmcr.microsoft.com/dotnet/core-nightly/sdk:2.2\r\n```\r\n\r\nAs comparison, the following repo and tag have been used to date for the .NET Core 2.2 \"Nightly\" SDK on Docker Hub:\r\n\r\n```console\r\nmicrosoft/dotnet-nightly:2.2-sdk\r\n```\r\n\r\nThe new repo URL is provided at each of the news repos. For example, the new .NET Core SDK \"nightly\" repo provides a box on the right where you can copy and paste the correct MCR-based repo syntax that you can use for `docker pull` or in `FROM` statements in your Dockerfiles.\r\n\r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/2608468/52811702-95c5eb80-304a-11e9-8de8-e6ea1f4b4d75.png)\r\n\r\n## Servicing existing Docker Hub tags\r\n\r\nWe will continue to service existing non-version-specific or floating tags on Docker Hub while the associated .NET Core version is supported. For example the `microsoft/dotnet:2.1-sdk` tag is a floating tag that will continue to be serviced for the lifetime of .NET Core 2.1. You can continue using floating tags without issue.\r\n\r\nIf you use non-floating tags, like `microsoft/dotnet:2.1.504-sdk-alpine`, then you will need to update your Dockerfile to use a new non-floating tag. No new non-floating tags will be published to `microsoft/dotnet` and `microsoft/dotnet-nightly` after we fully transition to MCR.\r\n\r\n.NET Core 3.0 Preview 3 and later will only be made available on MCR.\r\n\r\n## Microsoft is a Verified Publisher\r\n\r\nUntil now, Microsoft-provided container images were considered \"community images\". As part of this change, we are re-classifying Microsoft as a \"verified publisher\" on Docker Hub. This designation should make it clearer that .NET and other Microsoft-provided images are coming from a verified source. There clearly was that expectation previously, but Docker is now making that clearer in the Docker Hub pages they host for Microsoft.\r\n\r\nWe will provide official vulnerability scanning Microsoft-provided images as a second phase of this transition.","Url":"https://github.com/dotnet/announcements/issues/101","RelatedDescription":"Open issue \"Publishing .NET Core images to Microsoft Container Registry (MCR)\" (#101)"},{"Id":"410784442","IsPullRequest":false,"CreatedAt":"2019-02-15T14:06:29","Actor":"TaraOverfield","Number":"100","RawContent":null,"Title":"RESOLVED: Advisory on February 2019 Security update for Windows 10 update 1809","State":"open","Body":"<strong><em>Final Update 2/19/19 @1:30 PM (PST)</em></strong><em>: This </em><em>advisory is now resolved with no action needed from Microsoft Customers.

Congratulations, Alpine team! On the .NET team, we are committed to supporting new Alpine versions quickly, and also need to define a policy for older versions. This policy only applies for the container images that we publish.\r\n\r\n## Discussion\r\nPlease share your thoughts on this change and see what others are saying at:\r\n\r\n* [dotnet-docker #933](https://github.com/dotnet/dotnet-docker/issues/933)\r\n\r\n## Policy\r\n\r\nWe intend to establish the following policy for supporting Alpine with .NET Core container images:\r\n\r\n* Support new Alpine versions within 60 days of release (hopefully much less).\r\n* Support n-1 Alpine versions for 3 months after we support a new Alpine version.\r\n\r\nNote: The [.NET Core support policy](https://github.com/dotnet/core/blob/master/os-lifecycle-policy.md) may be broader. This policy is specific to the container images we produce.\r\n\r\n## Plans\r\n\r\nWe're in the process of [fixing issues required to support Alpine 3.9](https://github.com/dotnet/dotnet-docker/issues/921). We expect that these issues will be resolved in February and that we'll be able to provide support for Alpine 3.9 in March.\r\n\r\nWe will produce Alpine 3.9 images for .NET Core 2.1, 2.2 and 3.0. Assuming we publish 3.9 images in March, we'll stop producing and supporting Alpine 3.7 and 3.8 images after June (2019).\r\n\r\n## Using Alpine-based .NET Core images\r\n\r\nWe produce a variety of Alpine-based images. You can either depend on a specific Alpine version, like with `microsoft/dotnet:2.2-sdk-alpine3.8` or opt to use the latest Alpine image we have to offer, like with `microsoft/dotnet:2.2-sdk-alpine`. Either are good choices. It is just a question of whether you want to make a conscious decision to move to later Alpine releases.\r\n\r\n## Support for ARM32?\r\n\r\nWe produce Alpine images for x64 (and ARM64, shortly). The [Alpine 3.9 announcement](https://twitter.com/alpinelinux/status/1090416212822110214) made mention of support for ARM32v7. We would like to enable .NET Core [Alpine-based images on ARM32](https://github.com/gliderlabs/docker-alpine/issues/463#issuecomment-460530395). We are patiently waiting for that to happen.

To check the currently installed runtimes, open a command prompt and run the `dotnet --info` command. If you have a 2.1 or greater runtime installed, you'll see output like the following;\r\n\r\n```text\r\n.NET Core SDK (reflecting any global.json):\r\n Version:   2.2.100\r\n Commit:    b9f2fa0ca8\r\n\r\nRuntime Environment:\r\n OS Name:     Windows\r\n OS Version:  10.0.17134\r\n OS Platform: Windows\r\n RID:         win10-x64\r\n Base Path:   C:\\Program Files\\dotnet\\sdk\\2.2.100\\\r\n\r\nHost (useful for support):\r\n  Version: 2.2.0\r\n  Commit:  1249f08fed\r\n\r\n.NET Core SDKs installed:\r\n  2.1.5 [C:\\Program Files\\dotnet\\sdk]\r\n  2.1.502 [C:\\Program Files\\dotnet\\sdk]\r\n  2.2.100 [C:\\Program Files\\dotnet\\sdk]\r\n\r\n.NET Core runtimes installed:\r\n  Microsoft.AspNetCore.All 2.1.6 [C:\\Program Files\\dotnet\\shared\\Microsoft.AspNetCore.All]\r\n  Microsoft.AspNetCore.App 2.1.6 [C:\\Program Files\\dotnet\\shared\\Microsoft.AspNetCore.App]\r\n  Microsoft.AspNetCore.All 2.2.0 [C:\\Program Files\\dotnet\\shared\\Microsoft.AspNetCore.All]\r\n  Microsoft.AspNetCore.App 2.2.0 [C:\\Program Files\\dotnet\\shared\\Microsoft.AspNetCore.App]\r\n  Microsoft.NETCore.App 2.1.6 [C:\\Program Files\\dotnet\\shared\\Microsoft.NETCore.App]\r\n  Microsoft.NETCore.App 2.2.0 [C:\\Program Files\\dotnet\\shared\\Microsoft.NETCore.App]\r\n\r\nTo install additional .NET Core runtimes or SDKs:\r\n  https://aka.ms/dotnet-download\r\n```\r\n\r\nIf your host version is 2.1.x and the highest `Microsoft.NETCore.App` runtime version is less than 2.1.7, you're vulnerable to this issue.\r\nIf your host version is 2.2.x and the highest 2.1.x `Microsoft.NETCore.App` runtime version is less than 2.2.1, you're vulnerable to this issue.\r\n\r\nYou will not see SDK versions if you have only installed the runtime.\r\n\r\n#### Applications not using Microsoft.NetCore.App\r\n\r\nThe affected assembly is also available separately as a NuGet package. If you are not using Microsoft.NetCore.App, you may still be affected if you are referencing the packages listed above.\r\n\r\n##### Direct dependencies\r\n\r\nDirect dependencies are discoverable by examining your `csproj` file. They can be fixed by [editing the project file](#fixing-direct-dependencies) or using NuGet to update the dependency.\r\n\r\n##### Transitive dependencies\r\n\r\nTransitive dependencies occur when you add a package to your project that in turn relies on another package. For example, if Contoso publishes a package `Contoso.Utility` which, in turn, depends on `Contoso.Internals` and you add the `Contoso.Utility` package to your project now your project has a direct dependency on `Contoso.Utility` and, because `Contoso.Utility` depends 'Contoso.Internals', your application gains a transitive dependency on the `Contoso.Internals` package.\r\n\r\nTransitive dependencies are reviewable in two ways:\r\n\r\n* In the Visual Studio Solution Explorer window, which supports searching.\r\n* By examining the `project.assets.json` file contained in the obj directory of your project for `csproj` based projects\r\n\r\nThe `project.assets.json` files are the authoritative list of all packages used by your project, containing both direct and transitive dependencies.\r\n\r\nThere are two ways to view transitive dependencies. You can either [use Visual Studio’s Solution Explorer](#vs-solution-explorer), or you can review [the `project.assets.json` file](#project-assets-json)).\r\n\r\n##### <a name=\"vs-solution-explorer\"></a>Using Visual Studio Solution Explorer\r\n\r\nTo use Solution Explorer, open the project in Visual Studio, and then press Ctrl+; to activate the search in Solution Explorer. Search for the [vulnerable package](#affected-software) and make a note of the version numbers of any results you find.\r\n\r\nFor example, searching for `Microsoft.AspNetCore.Mvc.Core` in an example project that contains a package that takes a dependency on `Microsoft.AspNetCore.Mvc` shows the following results in Visual Studio 2017:\r\n\r\n![Screenshot of search results in Visual Studio 2017](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/796298/25858816/8ecdc2b4-3491-11e7-9363-746804bb9832.png)\r\n\r\nThe search results appear as a tree. In the previous results, you can see that a reference to `Microsoft.AspNetCore.Mvc.Core` version 1.1.2 is discovered.\r\n\r\nUnder the Dependencies node is a NuGet node. Under the NuGet node is the list of packages you have directly taken a dependency on and their versions.\r\nIn screenshot, the application takes a direct dependency on `Microsoft.AspNetCore.Mvc`. `Microsoft.AspNetCore.Mvc` in turn has leaf nodes that list its dependencies and their versions.\r\nThe `Microsoft.AspNetCore.Mvc` package takes a dependency on a version of `Microsoft.AspNetCore.Mvc.ApiExplorer`, that in turn takes a dependency on a version of `Microsoft.AspNetCore.Mvc.Core`.\r\n\r\n##### <a name=\"project-assets-json\"></a> Manually reviewing project.assets.json\r\n\r\nOpen the *project.assets.json* file from your project’s obj directory in your editor. We suggest you use an editor that understands JSON and allows you to collapse and expand nodes to review this file.\r\nVisual Studio and Visual Studio Code provide JSON friendly editing.\r\n\r\nSearch the *project.assets.json* file for the [vulnerable package](#affected-software), using the format `packagename/` for each of the package names from the preceding table. If you find the assembly name in your search:\r\n\r\n* Examine the line on which they are found, the version number is after the `/`.\r\n* Compare to the [vulnerable versions table](#affected-software).\r\n\r\nFor example, a search result that shows `System.Private.Uri/4.3.0` is a reference to version 4.3.0 of `System.Private.Uri`.\r\n\r\nIf your *project.assets.json* file includes references to the [vulnerable package](#affected-software), then you need to fix the transitive dependencies.\r\n\r\nIf you have not found any reference to any vulnerable packages, this means either\r\n\r\n* None of your direct dependencies depend on any vulnerable packages, or\r\n* You have already fixed the problem by updating the direct dependencies.\r\n\r\n### <a name=\"how-fix\"></a>How do I fix the issue?\r\n\r\n#### Updating the version of Microsoft.NETCore.App\r\n\r\nIf your host version is a 2.1.x host you must install version 2.1.8 or later of the [.NET Core 2.1 runtime](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/download/dotnet-core/2.1), or corresponding [.NET Core 2.1 SDK](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/download/dotnet-core/2.1).\r\n\r\nIf your host version is a 2.2.x you must install version 2.2.2 or later of the [.NET Core 2.2 runtime](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/download/dotnet-core/2.2), or corresponding  [.NET Core 2.2 SDK](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/download/dotnet-core/2.2).\r\n\r\n#### <a name=\"fixing-direct-dependencies\"></a>Fixing direct dependencies\r\n\r\nOpen *projectname.csproj* in your editor. If you're using Visual Studio, right-click the project and choose **Edit projectname.csproj** from the context menu, where projectname is the name of your project. Look for `PackageReference` elements. The following shows an example project file:\r\n\r\n```xml\r\n<Project Sdk=\"Microsoft.NET.Sdk.Web\">\r\n  <PropertyGroup>\r\n    <TargetFramework>netcoreapp2.1</TargetFramework>\r\n  </PropertyGroup>\r\n  <ItemGroup>\r\n    <PackageReference Include=\"System.Private.Uri\" Version=\"4.3.0\" />\r\n  </ItemGroup>\r\n</Project>\r\n```\r\n\r\nThe preceding example has a reference to the [vulnerable package](#affected-software), as seen by the single `PackageReference` element. The name of the package is in the `Include` attribute.\r\nThe package version number is in the `Version` attribute. The previous example shows a single direct dependency on `System.Private.Uri` version 4.3.0\r\n\r\nTo update the version to the secure package, change the version number to the updated package version as listed on the table [previously](#affected-software).\r\nIn this example, update `System.Private.Uri` to the appropriate [fixed package number](#affected-software) for your major version. Save the *csproj* file. The example *csproj* now looks as follows:\r\n\r\n```xml\r\n<Project Sdk=\"Microsoft.NET.Sdk.Web\">\r\n  <PropertyGroup>\r\n    <TargetFramework>netcoreapp2.1</TargetFramework>\r\n  </PropertyGroup>\r\n  <ItemGroup>\r\n    <PackageReference Include=\"System.Private.Uri\" Version=\"4.3.0\" />\r\n  </ItemGroup>\r\n</Project>\r\n```\r\n\r\nIf you're using Visual Studio and you save your updated *csproj* file, Visual Studio will restore the new package version.\r\nYou can see the restore results by opening the **Output** window (Ctrl+Alt+O) and changing the **Show output from** drop-down list to **Package Manager**.\r\n\r\nIf you're not using Visual Studio, open a command line and change to your project directory. Execute the `dotnet restore` command to restore the updated dependencies.\r\n\r\nNow recompile your application. If after recompilation you see a *Dependency conflict warning*, you must update your other direct dependencies to versions that take a dependency on the updated package.\r\n\r\n#### <a name=\"transitive-dependencies\"></a>Fixing transitive dependencies\r\n\r\nIf your transitive dependency review found references to the [vulnerable package](#affected-software), you must add a direct dependency to the updated package to your *csproj* file to override the transitive dependency.\r\n\r\nOpen *projectname.csproj* in your editor. If you're using Visual Studio, right-click the project and choose **Edit projectname.csproj** from the context menu, where projectname is the name of your project.\r\nLook for `PackageReference` nodes, for example:\r\n\r\n```xml\r\n<Project Sdk=\"Microsoft.NET.Sdk.\">\r\n  <PropertyGroup>\r\n    <TargetFramework>net461</TargetFramework>\r\n  </PropertyGroup>\r\n  <ItemGroup>\r\n    <PackageReference Include=\"ThirdParty.NotUpdatedYet\" Version=\"2.0.0\" />\r\n  </ItemGroup>\r\n</Project>\r\n```\r\n\r\nYou must add a direct dependency to the updated version of the [vulnerable package](#affected-software) by adding it to the *csproj* file.\r\nYou do this by adding a new line to the dependencies section, referencing the fixed version.\r\nFor example, if your search showed a transitive reference to a vulnerable `System.ServiceModel.Http` version, you'd add a reference to the [fixed package number](#affected-software).\r\n\r\n```xml\r\n<Project Sdk=\"Microsoft.NET.Sdk.Web\">\r\n  <PropertyGroup>\r\n    <TargetFramework>net461</TargetFramework>\r\n  </PropertyGroup>\r\n  <ItemGroup>\r\n    <PackageReference Include=\"System.Private.Uri\" Version=\"4.3.0\" />\r\n    <PackageReference Include=\"ThirdParty.NotUpdatedYet\" Version=\"2.0.0\" />\r\n  </ItemGroup>\r\n</Project>\r\n```\r\n\r\nAfter you've added the direct dependency reference, save your *csproj* file.\r\n\r\nIf you're using Visual Studio, save your updated *csproj* file and Visual Studio will restore the new package versions.\r\nYou can see the restore results by opening the **Output** window (Ctrl+Alt+O) and changing the **Show output from** drop-down list to **Package Manager**.\r\n\r\nIf you're not using Visual Studio, open a command line and change to your project directory. Execute the `dotnet restore` command to restore the new dependencies.\r\n\r\n##### Rebuilding your application\r\n\r\nFinally, you must rebuild your application, test, and redeploy.\r\n\r\n## Other Information\r\n\r\n### Reporting Security Issues\r\n\r\nIf you have found a potential security issue in .NET Core, please email details to secure@microsoft.com.

To check the currently installed runtimes, open a command prompt and run the `dotnet --info` command. If you have a 2.1 or greater runtime installed, you'll see output like the following;\r\n\r\n```text\r\n.NET Core SDK (reflecting any global.json):\r\n Version:   2.2.100\r\n Commit:    b9f2fa0ca8\r\n\r\nRuntime Environment:\r\n OS Name:     Windows\r\n OS Version:  10.0.17134\r\n OS Platform: Windows\r\n RID:         win10-x64\r\n Base Path:   C:\\Program Files\\dotnet\\sdk\\2.2.100\\\r\n\r\nHost (useful for support):\r\n  Version: 2.2.0\r\n  Commit:  1249f08fed\r\n\r\n.NET Core SDKs installed:\r\n  2.1.5 [C:\\Program Files\\dotnet\\sdk]\r\n  2.1.502 [C:\\Program Files\\dotnet\\sdk]\r\n  2.2.100 [C:\\Program Files\\dotnet\\sdk]\r\n\r\n.NET Core runtimes installed:\r\n  Microsoft.AspNetCore.All 2.1.6 [C:\\Program Files\\dotnet\\shared\\Microsoft.AspNetCore.All]\r\n  Microsoft.AspNetCore.App 2.1.6 [C:\\Program Files\\dotnet\\shared\\Microsoft.AspNetCore.App]\r\n  Microsoft.AspNetCore.All 2.2.0 [C:\\Program Files\\dotnet\\shared\\Microsoft.AspNetCore.All]\r\n  Microsoft.AspNetCore.App 2.2.0 [C:\\Program Files\\dotnet\\shared\\Microsoft.AspNetCore.App]\r\n  Microsoft.NETCore.App 2.1.6 [C:\\Program Files\\dotnet\\shared\\Microsoft.NETCore.App]\r\n  Microsoft.NETCore.App 2.2.0 [C:\\Program Files\\dotnet\\shared\\Microsoft.NETCore.App]\r\n\r\nTo install additional .NET Core runtimes or SDKs:\r\n  https://aka.ms/dotnet-download\r\n```\r\n\r\nIf your host version is 2.1.x and the highest `Microsoft.NETCore.App` runtime version is less than 2.1.7, you're vulnerable to this issue.\r\nIf your host version is 2.2.x and the highest 2.1.x `Microsoft.NETCore.App` runtime version is less than 2.1.7, you're vulnerable to this issue.\r\n\r\nYou will not see SDK versions if you have only installed the runtime.\r\n\r\n#### Applications not using Microsoft.NetCore.App\r\n\r\nThe affected assembly is also available separately as a NuGet package. If you are not using Microsoft.NetCore.App, you may still be affected if you are referencing the packages listed above.\r\n\r\n##### Direct dependencies\r\n\r\nDirect dependencies are discoverable by examining your `csproj` file. They can be fixed by [editing the project file](#fixing-direct-dependencies) or using NuGet to update the dependency.\r\n\r\n##### Transitive dependencies\r\n\r\nTransitive dependencies occur when you add a package to your project that in turn relies on another package. For example, if Contoso publishes a package `Contoso.Utility` which, in turn, depends on `Contoso.Internals` and you add the `Contoso.Utility` package to your project now your project has a direct dependency on `Contoso.Utility` and, because `Contoso.Utility` depends 'Contoso.Internals', your application gains a transitive dependency on the `Contoso.Internals` package.\r\n\r\nTransitive dependencies are reviewable in two ways:\r\n\r\n* In the Visual Studio Solution Explorer window, which supports searching.\r\n* By examining the `project.assets.json` file contained in the obj directory of your project for `csproj` based projects\r\n\r\nThe `project.assets.json` files are the authoritative list of all packages used by your project, containing both direct and transitive dependencies.\r\n\r\nThere are two ways to view transitive dependencies. You can either [use Visual Studio’s Solution Explorer](#vs-solution-explorer), or you can review [the `project.assets.json` file](#project-assets-json)).\r\n\r\n##### <a name=\"vs-solution-explorer\"></a>Using Visual Studio Solution Explorer\r\n\r\nTo use Solution Explorer, open the project in Visual Studio, and then press Ctrl+; to activate the search in Solution Explorer. Search for the [vulnerable package](#affected-software) and make a note of the version numbers of any results you find.\r\n\r\nFor example, searching for `Microsoft.AspNetCore.Mvc.Core` in an example project that contains a package that takes a dependency on `Microsoft.AspNetCore.Mvc` shows the following results in Visual Studio 2017:\r\n\r\n![Screenshot of search results in Visual Studio 2017](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/796298/25858816/8ecdc2b4-3491-11e7-9363-746804bb9832.png)\r\n\r\nThe search results appear as a tree. In the previous results, you can see that a reference to `Microsoft.AspNetCore.Mvc.Core` version 1.1.2 is discovered.\r\n\r\nUnder the Dependencies node is a NuGet node. Under the NuGet node is the list of packages you have directly taken a dependency on and their versions.\r\nIn screenshot, the application takes a direct dependency on `Microsoft.AspNetCore.Mvc`. `Microsoft.AspNetCore.Mvc` in turn has leaf nodes that list its dependencies and their versions.\r\nThe `Microsoft.AspNetCore.Mvc` package takes a dependency on a version of `Microsoft.AspNetCore.Mvc.ApiExplorer`, that in turn takes a dependency on a version of `Microsoft.AspNetCore.Mvc.Core`.\r\n\r\n##### <a name=\"project-assets-json\"></a> Manually reviewing project.assets.json\r\n\r\nOpen the *project.assets.json* file from your project’s obj directory in your editor. We suggest you use an editor that understands JSON and allows you to collapse and expand nodes to review this file.\r\nVisual Studio and Visual Studio Code provide JSON friendly editing.\r\n\r\nSearch the *project.assets.json* file for the [vulnerable package](#affected-software), using the format `packagename/` for each of the package names from the preceding table. If you find the assembly name in your search:\r\n\r\n* Examine the line on which they are found, the version number is after the `/`.\r\n* Compare to the [vulnerable versions table](#affected-software).\r\n\r\nFor example, a search result that shows `SSystem.Net.Http/4.3.0` is a reference to version 4.3.0 of `System.Net.Http`.\r\n\r\nIf your *project.assets.json* file includes references to the [vulnerable package](#affected-software), then you need to fix the transitive dependencies.\r\n\r\nIf you have not found any reference to any vulnerable packages, this means either\r\n\r\n* None of your direct dependencies depend on any vulnerable packages, or\r\n* You have already fixed the problem by updating the direct dependencies.\r\n\r\n### <a name=\"how-fix\"></a>How do I fix the issue?\r\n\r\n#### Updating the version of Microsoft.NETCore.App\r\n\r\nIf your host version is a 2.1.x host you must install version 2.1.7 or later of the [.NET Core 2.1 runtime](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/download/dotnet-core/2.1), or corresponding [.NET Core 2.1 SDK](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/download/dotnet-core/2.1).\r\n\r\nIf your host version is a 2.2.x you must install version 2.2.1 or later of the [.NET Core 2.2 runtime](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/download/dotnet-core/2.2), or corresponding  [.NET Core 2.2 SDK](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/download/dotnet-core/2.2).\r\n\r\n#### <a name=\"fixing-direct-dependencies\"></a>Fixing direct dependencies\r\n\r\nOpen *projectname.csproj* in your editor. If you're using Visual Studio, right-click the project and choose **Edit projectname.csproj** from the context menu, where projectname is the name of your project. Look for `PackageReference` elements. The following shows an example project file:\r\n\r\n```xml\r\n<Project Sdk=\"Microsoft.NET.Sdk.Web\">\r\n  <PropertyGroup>\r\n    <TargetFramework>netcoreapp2.1</TargetFramework>\r\n  </PropertyGroup>\r\n  <ItemGroup>\r\n    <PackageReference Include=\"System.Net.Http\" Version=\"4.3.0\" />\r\n  </ItemGroup>\r\n</Project>\r\n```\r\n\r\nThe preceding example has a reference to the [vulnerable package](#affected-software), as seen by the single `PackageReference` element. The name of the package is in the `Include` attribute.\r\nThe package version number is in the `Version` attribute. The previous example shows a single direct dependency on `System.Net.Http` version 4.3.0\r\n\r\nTo update the version to the secure package, change the version number to the updated package version as listed on the table [previously](#affected-software).\r\nIn this example, update `System.IO.Pipelines` to the appropriate [fixed package number](#affected-software) for your major version. Save the *csproj* file. The example *csproj* now looks as follows:\r\n\r\n```xml\r\n<Project Sdk=\"Microsoft.NET.Sdk.Web\">\r\n  <PropertyGroup>\r\n    <TargetFramework>netcoreapp2.1</TargetFramework>\r\n  </PropertyGroup>\r\n  <ItemGroup>\r\n    <PackageReference Include=\"System.Net.Http\" Version=\"4.3.5\" />\r\n  </ItemGroup>\r\n</Project>\r\n```\r\n\r\nIf you're using Visual Studio and you save your updated *csproj* file, Visual Studio will restore the new package version.\r\nYou can see the restore results by opening the **Output** window (Ctrl+Alt+O) and changing the **Show output from** drop-down list to **Package Manager**.\r\n\r\nIf you're not using Visual Studio, open a command line and change to your project directory. Execute the `dotnet restore` command to restore the updated dependencies.\r\n\r\nNow recompile your application. If after recompilation you see a *Dependency conflict warning*, you must update your other direct dependencies to versions that take a dependency on the updated package.\r\n\r\n#### <a name=\"transitive-dependencies\"></a>Fixing transitive dependencies\r\n\r\nIf your transitive dependency review found references to the [vulnerable package](#affected-software), you must add a direct dependency to the updated package to your *csproj* file to override the transitive dependency.\r\n\r\nOpen *projectname.csproj* in your editor. If you're using Visual Studio, right-click the project and choose **Edit projectname.csproj** from the context menu, where projectname is the name of your project.\r\nLook for `PackageReference` nodes, for example:\r\n\r\n```xml\r\n<Project Sdk=\"Microsoft.NET.Sdk.\">\r\n  <PropertyGroup>\r\n    <TargetFramework>net461</TargetFramework>\r\n  </PropertyGroup>\r\n  <ItemGroup>\r\n    <PackageReference Include=\"ThirdParty.NotUpdatedYet\" Version=\"2.0.0\" />\r\n  </ItemGroup>\r\n</Project>\r\n```\r\n\r\nYou must add a direct dependency to the updated version of the [vulnerable package](#affected-software) by adding it to the *csproj* file.\r\nYou do this by adding a new line to the dependencies section, referencing the fixed version.\r\nFor example, if your search showed a transitive reference to a vulnerable `System.ServiceModel.Http` version, you'd add a reference to the [fixed package number](#affected-software).\r\n\r\n```xml\r\n<Project Sdk=\"Microsoft.NET.Sdk.Web\">\r\n  <PropertyGroup>\r\n    <TargetFramework>net461</TargetFramework>\r\n  </PropertyGroup>\r\n  <ItemGroup>\r\n    <PackageReference Include=\"System.Net.Http\" Version=\"4.3.5\" />\r\n    <PackageReference Include=\"ThirdParty.NotUpdatedYet\" Version=\"2.0.0\" />\r\n  </ItemGroup>\r\n</Project>\r\n```\r\n\r\nAfter you've added the direct dependency reference, save your *csproj* file.\r\n\r\nIf you're using Visual Studio, save your updated *csproj* file and Visual Studio will restore the new package versions.\r\nYou can see the restore results by opening the **Output** window (Ctrl+Alt+O) and changing the **Show output from** drop-down list to **Package Manager**.\r\n\r\nIf you're not using Visual Studio, open a command line and change to your project directory. Execute the `dotnet restore` command to restore the new dependencies.\r\n\r\n##### Rebuilding your application\r\n\r\nFinally, you must rebuild your application, test, and redeploy.\r\n\r\n## Other Information\r\n\r\n### Reporting Security Issues\r\n\r\nIf you have found a potential security issue in .NET Core, please email details to secure@microsoft.com.

However, .NET hasn't had a (great) built-in way to deal with JSON. Instead we've relied on [Json.NET] which continues to serve the .NET ecosystem well.\r\n\r\n[Json.NET]: https://www.newtonsoft.com/json\r\n\r\nMoving forward, we plan on making some changes to our JSON support:\r\n\r\n* **We need high-performance JSON APIs**. We need a new set of JSON APIs that are highly tuned for performance by using `Span<T>` and allows for processing UTF-8 directly without having to transcode to UTF-16 `string` instances. Both aspects are critical for our web server Kestrel, where throughput is a key requirement.\r\n\r\n* **Remove dependency from ASP.NET Core to Json.NET**. Today, ASP.NET Core has a dependency on Json.NET. While this provides a tight integration between ASP.NET Core and Json.NET, it also means that application developers cannot freely choose which JSON library they are using. This is also problematic for customers of Json.NET as the version is dictated by the underlying platform. However, Json.NET is frequently updated and application developers often want to -- or even have to -- use a specific version. Thus, we want to remove the dependency from ASP.NET Core 3.0 to Json.NET so that customers can choose which version to use, without fearing they might accidentally break the underlying platform. In addition, this makes it also possible to plug-in an entirely different JSON library.\r\n\r\n* **Provide an ASP.NET Core integration package for Json.NET**. Json.NET has basically become the Swiss Army knife of JSON processing in .NET. It provides many options and facilities that allow customers to handle their JSON needs with ease. We don't want to compromise on the Json.NET support customers are getting today, for example, the ability to configure the JSON serialization via the `AddJsonOptions` extension method. Thus, we want to provide the Json.NET integration as a NuGet package that developers can optionally install so they get all the bells and whistles they get from Json.NET today. The other part of this work item is to ensure we have the right extension points so that other parties can provide similar integration packages for their JSON library of choice.\r\n\r\nBelow are more details around this plan.\r\n\r\n## The need for high-performance JSON APIs\r\n\r\nThe requirements for the .NET stack have changed a bit since the arrival of .NET Core. Historically, .NET has valued usability and convenience. With .NET Core, we've added a focus on performance, and we've made significant investments to serve high performance needs. And the [improvements we made][techempower] in the popular TechEmpower benchmark are a testament to that.\r\n\r\n[techempower]: https://www.techempower.com/blog/2016/11/16/framework-benchmarks-round-13/\r\n\r\nWith .NET Core 2.1, we've added a brand new primitive called [Span\\<T>][span-msdn] that allows us to represent native memory and arrays in a uniform way. With this type, we've also added a set of parsing and encoding APIs that are much more memory efficient without having to resort to unsafe code.\r\n\r\n[span-msdn]: https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/magazine/mt814808.aspx\r\n\r\nPart of the work of minimizing allocations is to avoid having to transcode UTF-8 payloads into UTF-16 strings, purely for parsing reasons. Currently, Json.NET is implemented by reading UTF-16. We need the ability to read (and write) JSON documents directly in UTF-8 because most network protocols (including HTTP) use UTF-8.\r\n\r\nDuring .NET Core 2.1 we've learned that updating our existing APIs to leverage `Span<T>` has limits. While we did add a bunch of overloads that accept spans, we also had to produce brand new APIs that are designed around minimizing allocations and dealing with buffers, which we exposed in `System.Buffers` namespaces. And with `System.IO.Pipelines` we've also added a programming model that enables developers to share buffers without having to deal with lifetime issues.\r\n\r\nBased on these experiences we believe in order to support JSON parsing, we'll need to expose a new set of JSON APIs that are specifically geared for high-performance scenarios.\r\n\r\nYou might wonder why we can't just update Json.NET to include support for parsing JSON using `Span<T>`? Well, James Newton-King -- the author of Json.NET -- has the following to say about that:\r\n\r\n> Json.NET was created over 10 years ago, and since then it has added a wide range of features aimed to help developers work with JSON in .NET. In that time Json.NET has also become far and away NuGet's most depended on and downloaded package, and is the go-to library for JSON support in .NET. Unfortunately, Json.NET's wealth of features and popularity works against making major changes to it. Supporting new technologies like `Span<T>` would require fundamental breaking changes to the library and would disrupt existing applications and libraries that depend on it.\r\n>\r\n> Going forward Json.NET will continue to be worked on and invested in, both addressing known issues today and supporting new platforms in the future. Json.NET has always existed alongside other JSON libraries for .NET, and there will be nothing to prevent you using one or more together, depending on whether you need the performance of the new JSON APIs or the large feature set of Json.NET.\r\n\r\n## Move Json.NET integration into a separate NuGet package\r\n\r\nToday, you cannot use ASP.NET Core without Json.NET because it is a dependency of ASP.NET Core itself. Over the years, we've received feedback that the dependency can conflict with other libraries that have their own dependency on a different version of Json.NET. In the past, we've considered addressing this issue by using a private copy of Json.NET in ASP.NET. However, this would create problems when developers want to configure Json.NET (for instance, in order to control how the serializer behaves when formatting JSON objects).\r\n\r\nMoving forward we'd like to:\r\n\r\n1. Replace the internal usage of Json.NET in ASP.NET Core by the new platform-provided JSON APIs.\r\n\r\n2. Factor the public facing usage of Json.NET into an optional integration package that can be acquired from NuGet.\r\n\r\nSo the existing integration between ASP.NET Core and Json.NET will continue to be supported, but will be moving out of the platform and into a separate package. However, since the integration is then designed to sit on top of the platform, it will also allow customers to update Json.NET to later versions.\r\n\r\nFurthermore, customers who need more performance can also choose to use the new JSON APIs, at the expense of the rich feature set that Json.NET offers.\r\n\r\n## Discussion\r\n\r\nFor a discussion, please go to https://github.com/dotnet/corefx/issues/33115.","Url":"https://github.com/dotnet/announcements/issues/90","RelatedDescription":"Open issue \"The future of JSON in .NET Core 3.0\" (#90)"},{"Id":"368440353","IsPullRequest":false,"CreatedAt":"2018-10-09T23:44:06","Actor":"vivmishra","Number":"89","RawContent":null,"Title":"October 2018 .NET Updates","State":"open","Body":"# October 2018 .NET Updates\r\n\r\nThe following .NET updates were released in October 2018.

This means [.NET Core 2.0](https://blogs.msdn.microsoft.com/dotnet/2017/08/14/announcing-net-core-2-0/) is no longer supported and updates will no longer be provided.

LTS releases are stable release which receive critical updates and are supported for at least three years. Current releases can include new features that may undergo future change based on feedback. Current releases are supported for three months after the subsequent .NET Core major or minor release. Both LTS and Current releases receive critical fixes throughout their lifecycle, for security, reliability, or to add support for new operating system versions. You must stay up-to-date with the latest patches to qualify for support. \r\n\r\n## .NET Core 2.0 Lifecycle\r\n\r\n[.NET Core 2.0](https://blogs.msdn.microsoft.com/dotnet/2017/08/14/announcing-net-core-2-0/) was released in August 2017 as a Current release. Per the lifecycle policy, Current releases reach end of life 3 months after a subsequent release (Current or LTS). .NET Core 2.1 released May 2018 and began the end of life countdown for .NET Core 2.0. The 3 month maintenance period for .NET Core 2.0 was scheduled to end August 2018 but was [extended to October](https://blogs.msdn.microsoft.com/dotnet/2018/06/20/net-core-2-0-will-reach-end-of-life-on-september-1-2018/) to allow time to address an issue some customers were experiencing while migrating to .NET Core 2.1.\r\n\r\n## .NET Core 2.0 Downloads\r\n\r\n.NET Core 2.0 installers, zips and tar.gzs will remain available, but unsupported. This includes existing releases available on Linux package feeds. Previous versions, including 2.0, will be accessible through the [Download Archives](https://www.microsoft.com/net/download/archives). \r\n\r\n## .NET Core 2.0 Docker Images\r\n\r\n.NET Core 2.0 will be removed from the .NET and ASP.NET Docker repo READMEs, however the existing images remain available in those repos.\r\n\r\n* [microsoft/dotnet](https://hub.docker.com/r/microsoft/dotnet/)\r\n* [microsoft/dotnet-nightly](https://hub.docker.com/r/microsoft/dotnet-nightly/)\r\n* [microsoft/aspnetcore](https://hub.docker.com/r/microsoft/aspnetcore/)\r\n* [microsoft/aspnetcore-build](https://hub.docker.com/r/microsoft/aspnetcore-build/)\r\n\r\n## Policy Information\r\n\r\nAdditional lifecycle and support details  and background can be seen in the following:\r\n\r\n* [.NET Core Support Lifecycle](https://www.microsoft.com/net/platform/support-policy)\r\n* [Support and Versioning](https://blogs.msdn.microsoft.com/dotnet/2016/07/26/net-support-and-versioning/)\r\n* [2.0 end of life early announcement](https://blogs.msdn.microsoft.com/dotnet/2018/06/20/net-core-2-0-will-reach-end-of-life-on-september-1-2018/)\r\n* [.NET Core OS Lifecycle Policy](https://github.com/dotnet/core/blob/master/os-lifecycle-policy.md)\r\n","Url":"https://github.com/dotnet/announcements/issues/86","RelatedDescription":"Open issue \".NET Core 2.0 has reached end of life\" (#86)"},{"Id":"361098704","IsPullRequest":false,"CreatedAt":"2018-09-18T01:10:23","Actor":"spshant","Number":"85","RawContent":null,"Title":"NET Framework 4.8 Early Access build 3646 is available!","State":"open","Body":"Today, we are happy to share an Early Access build for the .NET Framework 4.8.
