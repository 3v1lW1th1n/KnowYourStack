This section explains that if a piece of state is needed in two different component, it should reside in their lowest common ancestor and be passed as an input. \r\n\r\nThis conecept is very important for Angular developers to know. I've seen some very bad example in Angular codebases that don't take advantage of this technique. Alternative method were employed instead: \r\n\r\n1. Child component fetches data, then passes it to its parent in an output, which passes it to another child as input.\r\n\r\n2. Holding the state in a service.\r\n\r\nMost of the time storing the data in the parent is a much better solution.\r\n\r\nI suggest putting a similar tutorial in a prominent place in the Angular docs.\r\n","Url":"https://github.com/angular/angular/issues/28863","RelatedDescription":"Open issue \"Teach About \"State should Go to Lowest Common Ancestor\" similar to \"Thinking in React\"\" (#28863)"},{"Id":"412342757","IsPullRequest":false,"CreatedAt":"2019-02-20T10:06:28","Actor":"xergiu90","Number":"28862","RawContent":null,"Title":"IE11 Syntax error vendor.js (124116) class Dom7","State":"open","Body":"### Description\r\nOpening the page on IE11 gives a SCRIPT1002: Syntax error inside vendor.js(124116,1)\r\nIf i open vendor.js at the row specified i find the class Dom7 \r\n\r\nMy package.json files are:\r\n\r\n\"dependencies\": {\r\n    \"@angular/animations\": \"^6.0.3\",\r\n    \"@angular/common\": \"^6.0.3\",\r\n    \"@angular/compiler\": \"^6.0.3\",\r\n    \"@angular/core\": \"^6.0.3\",\r\n    \"@angular/forms\": \"^6.0.3\",\r\n    \"@angular/http\": \"^6.0.3\",\r\n    \"@angular/platform-browser\": \"^6.0.3\",\r\n    \"@angular/platform-browser-dynamic\": \"^6.0.3\",\r\n    \"@angular/router\": \"^6.0.3\",\r\n    \"@ng-bootstrap/ng-bootstrap\": \"^3.3.1\",\r\n    \"@types/file-saver\": \"^2.0.0\",\r\n    \"boosted\": \"^4.1.3\",\r\n    \"core-js\": \"^2.5.4\",\r\n    \"file-saver\": \"^2.0.0\",\r\n    \"jquery\": \"^3.3.1\",\r\n    \"ng-boosted\": \"^2.2.2\",\r\n    \"ng4-charts\": \"^1.0.2\",\r\n    \"ngx-cookie-service\": \"^1.0.10\",\r\n    \"ngx-filesaver\": \"^2.2.0\",\r\n    \"ngx-pagination\": \"^3.2.1\",\r\n    \"popper.js\": \"^1.14.6\",\r\n    \"rxjs\": \"^6.0.0\",\r\n    \"tablesorter\": \"^2.31.1\",\r\n    \"zone.js\": \"^0.8.26\"\r\n  },\r\n  \"devDependencies\": {\r\n    \"@angular-devkit/build-angular\": \"~0.6.8\",\r\n    \"@angular/cli\": \"~6.0.8\",\r\n    \"@angular/compiler-cli\": \"^6.0.3\",\r\n    \"@angular/language-service\": \"^6.0.3\",\r\n    \"@types/jasmine\": \"~2.8.6\",\r\n    \"@types/jasminewd2\": \"~2.0.3\",\r\n    \"@types/node\": \"~8.9.4\",\r\n    \"codelyzer\": \"~4.2.1\",\r\n    \"jasmine-core\": \"~2.99.1\",\r\n    \"jasmine-spec-reporter\": \"~4.2.1\",\r\n    \"karma\": \"~1.7.1\",\r\n    \"karma-chrome-launcher\": \"~2.2.0\",\r\n    \"karma-coverage-istanbul-reporter\": \"~2.0.0\",\r\n    \"karma-jasmine\": \"~1.1.1\",\r\n    \"karma-jasmine-html-reporter\": \"^0.2.2\",\r\n    \"protractor\": \"^5.4.2\",\r\n    \"ts-node\": \"~5.0.1\",\r\n    \"tslint\": \"~5.9.1\",\r\n    \"typescript\": \"~2.7.2\"\r\n  }\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n## üî• Exception or Error\r\nSCRIPT1002: Syntax error\r\nvendor.js(124116,1)\r\n\r\n## üåç  Your Environment\r\n\r\n**Angular Version:**\r\nI am using Angular 4 with Maven Spring as backend\r\n\r\n\r\n**Anything else relevant?**\r\nOnly happens on IE11 not on any other browser\r\n\r\nI also enabled all in polyfills.ts\r\nimport 'core-js/es6/symbol';\r\nimport 'core-js/es6/object';\r\nimport 'core-js/es6/function';\r\nimport 'core-js/es6/parse-int';\r\nimport 'core-js/es6/parse-float';\r\nimport 'core-js/es6/number';\r\nimport 'core-js/es6/math';\r\nimport 'core-js/es6/string';\r\nimport 'core-js/es6/date';\r\nimport 'core-js/es6/array';\r\nimport 'core-js/es6/regexp';\r\nimport 'core-js/es6/map';\r\nimport 'core-js/es6/weak-map';\r\nimport 'core-js/es6/set';\r\n\r\nAnd set the target to es5\r\n\"target\": \"es5\",\r\n    \"typeRoots\": [\r\n      \"node_modules/@types\"\r\n    ],\r\n    \"lib\": [\r\n      \"es2017\",\r\n      \"dom\"\r\n    ]\r\n","Url":"https://github.com/angular/angular/issues/28862","RelatedDescription":"Open issue \"IE11 Syntax error vendor.js (124116) class Dom7\" (#28862)"},{"Id":"412268780","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2019-02-20T09:32:44","Actor":"alan-agius4","Number":"28855","RawContent":null,"Title":"build: enable bundle_dts for core package","State":"closed","Body":"## PR Checklist\r\nPlease check if your PR fulfills the following requirements:\r\n\r\n- [ ] The commit message follows our guidelines: https://github.com/angular/angular/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md#commit\r\n- [ ] Tests for the changes have been added (for bug fixes / features)\r\n- [ ] Docs have been added / updated (for bug fixes / features)\r\n\r\n\r\n## PR Type\r\nWhat kind of change does this PR introduce?\r\n\r\n<!-- Please check the one that applies to this PR using \"x\". -->\r\n\r\n- [ ] Bugfix\r\n- [ ] Feature\r\n- [ ] Code style update (formatting, local variables)\r\n- [ ] Refactoring (no functional changes, no api changes)\r\n- [ ] Build related changes\r\n- [ ] CI related changes\r\n- [ ] Documentation content changes\r\n- [ ] angular.io application / infrastructure changes\r\n- [ ] Other...

This was an important improvement, however, I am still missing a smarter build command that would `build` all the projects in a correct sequence. And the same is applicable to `test` command.\r\n\r\n**What does the correct sequence mean**\r\nUsually in a bigger monorepo workspaces developed packages can have dependencies on one another, which means that simple alphabetical order of build/test will not work.\r\n\r\n**Example**\r\n\r\n```bash\r\nLibraries & dependencies\r\n‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ Library 1\r\n‚îÇ   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ Library 3\r\n‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ Library 2\r\n‚îÇ   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ Library 3\r\n‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ Library3\r\n```\r\n\r\nIn the example above current sequence of `ng test` would be `Library 1 - Library 2 - Library 3`, but the correct sequence would be `Library 3 - Library 1 - Library 2`\r\n\r\n\r\n### Describe the solution you'd like\r\nEvery project in a workspace already contains `package.json` (_obviously_). We could use `peerDependencies` to declare the dependencies between projects of the workspace. Then `build` and `test` commands would be able to detect the dependencies and build the libraries in the correct sequence.\r\n\r\nI have written myself a node executable that does exactly that. Follows the dependency tree and builds the libraries in the correct sequence.\r\nIf that is something you see as a valuable addition to Angular CLI I would be more than happy to contribute.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Describe alternatives you've considered\r\nCurrently, the only alternative is to write `ng build` commands in an npm script, which is practically unmaintainable in bigger workspaces.\r\n","Url":"https://github.com/angular/angular-cli/issues/13722","RelatedDescription":"Closed issue \"Build and test all projects in the correct sequence following dependencies.\" (#13722)"},{"Id":"412329192","IsPullRequest":false,"CreatedAt":"2019-02-20T09:59:28","Actor":"Destreyf","Number":"13719","RawContent":null,"Title":"Typo/missing quotes in vscode extension json template file.","State":"closed","Body":"# üêû Bug report\r\n\r\nI was reading the change log, and happened to see the mention of vscode extensions, being interested in what you might be recommended i went and read through the changes and found a typo/missing quotation on the tslint recommendation.\r\n\r\nthe file is here: https://github.com/angular/angular-cli/blob/master/packages/schematics/angular/workspace/files/__dot__vscode/extensions.json.template","Url":"https://github.com/angular/angular-cli/issues/13719","RelatedDescription":"Closed issue \"Typo/missing quotes in vscode extension json template file.\" (#13719)"},{"Id":"412225464","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2019-02-20T03:18:23","Actor":"hansl","Number":"13715","RawContent":null,"Title":"Architect browser schema","State":"open","Body":"refactor(@angular-devkit/build-angular): clean up some interfaces and schemas\r\n\r\nRemove the manually maintained schema.d.ts from the browser builder, and use\r\nthe Schema JSON file to generate it.

According to the documentation of the library I'm using, I think they assume it's always worked.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Description\r\n\r\n<!-- ‚úçÔ∏è--> I'm using [angulartics2](https://github.com/angulartics/angulartics2), which provides integrations with 3rd party analytics such as Google Analytics.  One of the features of this library is watching and reporting route changes.  There is a configuration option to clean up `id` references in routes, documentation is [here](https://github.com/angulartics/angulartics2#remove-ids-from-url-paths).\r\n\r\nMy configuration for this module is as follows:\r\n```ts\r\n    Angulartics2Module.forRoot({\r\n      pageTracking: {\r\n        clearIds: true,\r\n        idsRegExp: /^[a-zA-Z]+-[0-9a-zA-Z_-]{22}$/\r\n      }\r\n    })\r\n```\r\n\r\nWhen building for production (`ng build --prod`) and using a RegExp (non-constructor variant), it gives me this exception.\r\n\r\n```\r\nDate: 2019-02-18T20:42:19.190Z\r\nHash: f87abc34a327d3cd4386\r\nTime: 5030ms\r\nchunk {0} runtime.a5dd35324ddfd942bef1.js (runtime) 1.41 kB [entry] [rendered]\r\nchunk {1} es2015-polyfills.67c5cff8371af1f9a1d4.js (es2015-polyfills) 56.4 kB [initial] [rendered]\r\nchunk {2} main.cde404c57fbcc43faae1.js (main) 128 bytes [initial] [rendered]\r\nchunk {3} polyfills.70c2c870c3a0f5c90635.js (polyfills) 130 bytes [initial] [rendered]\r\nchunk {4} styles.3ff695c00d717f2d2a11.css (styles) 0 bytes [initial] [rendered]\r\n\r\nERROR in app/app.module.ts(18,20): Error during template compile of 'AppModule'\r\n  Expression form not supported.\r\n```\r\n\r\nAlternatively, when using the constructor format, \r\n```ts\r\n    Angulartics2Module.forRoot({\r\n      pageTracking: {\r\n        clearIds: true,\r\n        idsRegExp: new RegExp('^[a-zA-Z]+-[0-9a-zA-Z_-]{22}$')\r\n      }\r\n    })\r\n```\r\n\r\nThe above actually compiles and builds the distribution, but if you look at the distributed JS, it has removed that particular line and the output JS looks like:\r\n```js\r\nr.qb(256,H,{settings:{pageTracking:{clearIds:!0}}}\r\n```\r\n\r\n\r\n## üî¨ Minimal Reproduction\r\n<!--\r\nSimple steps to reproduce this bug.\r\n\r\nPlease include: commands run (including args), packages added, related code changes.\r\n\r\nIf reproduction steps are not enough for reproduction of your issue, please create a minimal GitHub repository with the reproduction of the issue.
