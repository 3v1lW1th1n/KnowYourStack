This list is a little arbitrary making it hard to tell when this must be done manually or if `ng_package` does it for you etc. It should probably either do nothing or be replaced with something more generic such as anything in `node_modules` or `dependencies` from `package.json`.\r\n\r\nThe error message is also quite cryptic and appears to be very angular/component specific. For example when depending on `@angular/material/x` I got an error about an ngfactory file file missing from an indirect dependency:\r\n```\r\n[!] (Plugin at position 3 plugin) Error: Could not resolve import '@angular/cdk/scrolling/virtual-scroll-viewport.ngfactory' from '...long tmp dir path.../bazel-out/darwin-fastbuild/bin/libs/butterfly/npm.es6/external/angular_material/src/cdk/overlay/overlay-container.js'\r\n```\r\n\r\n## 🔬 Minimal Reproduction\r\nA basic repro showing the issue when depending on material: https://github.com/jbedard/ng_package-material, running `bazel build //ui:npm` produces the error.\r\n\r\nIn this case it can be fixed quite easily by just adding:\r\n```\r\n   globals = {\r\n       '@angular/material/button': 'ng.material.button',\r\n       '@angular/material/icon': 'ng.material.icon',\r\n   }\r\n```\r\nBut that doesn't seem obvious based on the error message, and isn't clear why this one is required but something such as `@angular/animations` is not required.","Url":"https://github.com/angular/angular/issues/28971","RelatedDescription":"Open issue \"ng_package only marks main @angular packages as external\" (#28971)"},{"Id":"413728341","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2019-02-26T02:02:45","Actor":"mhevery","Number":"28947","RawContent":null,"Title":"Normalize arrays","State":"closed","Body":"refactor(ivy): moved wrapped reference to 0 position in array \r\n\r\n`LView`, `LContainer`, `StylingContext` are all arrays which wrap either\r\nan `HTMLElement`, `LView`, `LContainer`, `StylingContext`.

I'd like to have it exported from @angular/common so I can use it in my library.\r\n\r\nI need that function to convert my custom date format to a CDLR compatible format.\r\n\r\n**My config:**\r\n```typescript\r\n{\r\n        date: FormatWidth.Full,\r\n        time: FormatWidth.Short,\r\n        separator: FormatWidth.Full,\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\n**My output**\r\n`Monday, June 15, 2015 at 9:03 AM` (no seconds and timezone information here)\r\n\r\nI am already using three other functions from @angular/common to achieve this:\r\n- getLocaleDateFormat\r\n- getLocaleTimeFormat\r\n- getLocaleDateTimeFormat\r\n\r\nIt's just that I had to copy `formatDateTime` function into my own source code. And I'd like to use the same one as Angular uses internally.\r\n\r\n### Describe alternatives you've considered\r\nI tried creating my own custom format. But I have to support more then 200 languages so I gave up.","Url":"https://github.com/angular/angular/issues/28962","RelatedDescription":"Open issue \"Export formatDateTime from @angular/common\" (#28962)"},{"Id":"414097691","IsPullRequest":false,"CreatedAt":"2019-02-25T13:12:06","Actor":"axelboc","Number":"28960","RawContent":null,"Title":"`scrollToAnchor` in BrowserViewportScroller fails with some fragments","State":"open","Body":"# 🐞 bug report\r\n\r\n### Affected Package\r\n\r\nThe issue is caused by packages @angular/common and/or @angular/router when the router is configured to scroll to anchors with `anchorScrolling: 'enabled'`.\r\n\r\n### Description\r\n\r\nWhen attempting to scroll to an anchor using the URL's fragment, the `BrowserViewportScroller` throws `SyntaxError: The string did not match the expected pattern.`\r\n\r\nThe error seems to come from this line : https://github.com/angular/angular/blob/7.2.6/packages/common/src/viewport_scroller.ts#L109\r\n\r\n`querySelector('#<id>')` requires `<id>` to be a valid CSS identifier -- i.e. one that doesn't start with a number or a special character like `_`.

Zero progress on pushing it to browsers as a standard. On the other hand Proxy is already supported by most browsers.\r\n2. There is no way to monkey patch async/await after they are fully supported on all browsers. Currently Zone.js is working just because async/await is converted to generators and promises. In the feature this is going to be a problem.\r\n3. ChangeDetectionStrategy, Zone.runOutsideAngular are needed just because angular is not smart enough.\r\n\r\n### Describe the solution you'd like\r\nMobx and Vue showed that observable based reactive change detection is a powerful and smart thing to do. Mobx 5 introduced Proxy based observables which overcomes problems with observing dynamically added properties. The only problem is that it is not supported on IE11 as it's not polyfillable. I propose that Angular should also use Proxy and observer pattern to do change detection.\r\n\r\n**Syntax:**\r\n```ts\r\nimport { Component, observable, watch, computed } from '@angular/core';\r\n\r\n@Component({\r\n  selector: 'app',\r\n  template: `<div (click)=\"changeTitle()\">{{title}}</div>`\r\n})\r\nexport class AppComponent {\r\n  @observable title = 'hi';\r\n\r\n  @computed get reversedTitle() {\r\n       return this.title.split('').reverse().join('');\r\n  }\r\n\r\n  @action changeTitle() {\r\n       this.title = 'bye';\r\n  }\r\n   \r\n  @watch() {\r\n      console.log('new title', this.title);\r\n  }\r\n}\r\n``` \r\n**Benefits:**\r\n\r\n1. No zone.js is needed.\r\n2. No change detection strategy OnPush is needed, by default all components can work as OnPush.\r\n3. Useful and powerful helpers like watch and computed.\r\n4. RxJs may not be needed at all then working with reactive forms as observables will already allow to observe changes easily.\r\n\r\n**Implementation:**\r\n\r\nThis is already working when using mobx with angular. But since most 3th party libraries depends on zone.js there is no way of removing it. Built in observables and reactions would be a huge win.\r\n\r\n**Migration**\r\n\r\nSince angular checks templates during AOT compilation we could write a tool which automatically adds observable decorators properties automatically where needed.\r\n","Url":"https://github.com/angular/angular/issues/28958","RelatedDescription":"Open issue \"Proposal: Proxy based reactive change detection\" (#28958)"},{"Id":"413917700","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2019-02-25T03:30:48","Actor":"maheshchandra0024","Number":"28957","RawContent":null,"Title":"docs: describe your change...","State":"closed","Body":"## PR Checklist\r\nPlease check if your PR fulfills the following requirements:\r\n\r\n- [ ] The commit message follows our guidelines: https://github.com/angular/angular/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md#commit\r\n- [ ] Tests for the changes have been added (for bug fixes / features)\r\n- [ ] Docs have been added / updated (for bug fixes / features)\r\n\r\n\r\n## PR Type\r\nWhat kind of change does this PR introduce?\r\n\r\n<!-- Please check the one that applies to this PR using \"x\". -->\r\n\r\n- [ ] Bugfix\r\n- [ ] Feature\r\n- [ ] Code style update (formatting, local variables)\r\n- [ ] Refactoring (no functional changes, no api changes)\r\n- [ ] Build related changes\r\n- [ ] CI related changes\r\n- [ ] Documentation content changes\r\n- [ ] angular.io application / infrastructure changes\r\n- [ ] Other...

I have some \"reader\" page with infinite scroll that loads next chapter when user scrolls near to of a page. When some chapter enters view-port, I change browser URL to this chapter without triggering navigation (using `Location.replaceState`). \r\n\r\nIf users scroll to some next chapter and then reload page or go back/forward in history, they lost scroll position, because saved scroll position (on page with several chapters) is greater then reloaded page length (on page with only \"last\" chapter)\r\n\r\nThe idea was to use `history.state` to save scroll position relative to current chapter top.\r\n\r\n### Problems\r\nSaving position was pretty straightforward, because `Location.replaceState` method already has state property. But restoring this state is a pain.\r\n\r\nThanks to #27198 router already knows something about history state, current design/implementation isn't enough do described use case. I didn't figure out why we need both `NavigationStart.restoredState` and `NavigationExtras.state`, but despite similar description, they are not the same. \r\n\r\nRouter itself lacks public method that behaves like `Location.replaceState` (#24617), and any \"outside\" changes to `history.state` are not available as `NavigationExtras.state` of `Router.getCurrentNavigation()`, but only available as `NavigationStart.restoredState`. There is private `setBrowserUrl` method, that can be used for public implementation.\r\n\r\n`NavigationStart.restoredState` of initial page load can't be reached inside component that is responsible for text rendering (i.e. in the place, which knows chapter top offset, where we need to add saved scroll position), because initial `NavigationStart` is fired before any component (except of `AppComponent`) is created. And there is no way to get this value otherwise, except of catching it in `AppComponent` and saving in some service.\r\n\r\nBuy the way workaround from https://github.com/angular/angular/pull/27198#issuecomment-453789450 to pass `NavigationStart.restoredState` as `NavigationExtras.state` doesn't work (any more?) because of resetting `currentNavigation` [here](https://github.com/angular/angular/blob/7.2.6/packages/router/src/router.ts#L711) in case of \"redirect during NavigationStart\".\r\n\r\nAnd even if we can get `NavigationStart.restoredState` in such hackish way, there is no sense to do this, because of bug. We don't get load any stored state from history in initial navigation (see `null` in [line 951](https://github.com/angular/angular/blob/7.2.6/packages/router/src/router.ts#L951) called from [line 778](https://github.com/angular/angular/blob/7.2.6/packages/router/src/router.ts#L778))\r\n\r\nActually we don't even have a way to get this initial state, because all classes on the way from `Location`, through `LocationStrategy`, `PathLocationStrategy`, `PlatformLocation`, `BrowserPlatformLocation` up to `History` lacks an abstraction to get current state.\r\n\r\nHopefully we still can access `window.history.state` directly. But again, we cann't do it in the component code, because before we create component, router already resets saves `history.state` with `{navigationId:1}`. So I still need to write some hackish way to store this value somewhere before first `ActivationStart` event.\r\n\r\n### Describe the solution you'd like\r\nI'd like to have a way to straightforwardly call something on router to replace current state and than be able to get this state in `Scroll` router event. I want this state to be persistently saved even after page reload to moving back/forward outside of angular application. \r\n\r\nI don't really care how it will be implemented internally, but just fixing problems above should be enough.\r\n\r\nRouter should have it's own `replaceState` (or something) method, that encapsulate any logic around  `Location.replaceState` to handle `navigationId` or any other possible future angular-specific internal structure of `history.state` (#27607) and also to provide state as `NavigationExtras.state` instead of `NavigationStart.restoredState`.\r\n\r\n### Describe alternatives you've considered\r\nThis section is mostly for someone looking for solution for exactly my use case. \r\nWorkaround I came up with consists of two parts. \r\nFirst - I use resolver to get saved data directly from `window.history.state`.\r\nSecond - because of the same reason I can get data on initial page load - I receive wrong data on navigating away to another chapter. What do I mean? Consider following use case:\r\n- Initial page load without history. \r\n- No data in history -> no scrolling to position.\r\n- Scroll a bit, position is saved to history.\r\n- Reload page. \r\n- Router will rewrite history only on ActivationStart, so we get correct data in resolver. \r\n- There is data from resolver -> scroll to saved position.\r\n- Scroll a bit, position is saved to history.\r\n- Navigate to another chapter directly (there is contents feature in my app). \r\n- _Router will rewrite history only on ActivationStart_, so we get **incorrect** data of previous chapter in resolver.\r\n- There is data from resolver -> we scroll to incorrect saved position of previous chapter.\r\n\r\nTo workaround this problem, I save chapter id together with scroll position, so I can check is this data is relevant.\r\nFinal code looks something like this:\r\n\r\nprogress-resolver.service.ts:\r\n```TypeScript\r\nimport { Inject, Injectable, PLATFORM_ID } from '@angular/core';\r\nimport { isPlatformBrowser } from \"@angular/common\";\r\nimport { ActivatedRouteSnapshot, Resolve, RouterStateSnapshot } from \"@angular/router\";\r\n\r\ninterface Progress {\r\n  scroll: number,\r\n  chapterId: number,\r\n}\r\n\r\n@Injectable({\r\n  providedIn: 'root'\r\n})\r\nexport class ProgressResolverService implements Resolve<Progress | null> {\r\n\r\n  constructor(@Inject(PLATFORM_ID) private platformId: Object) {\r\n  }\r\n\r\n  resolve(route: ActivatedRouteSnapshot, state: RouterStateSnapshot): Progress | null {\r\n    if (isPlatformBrowser(this.platformId) && window && window.history && window.history.state && window.history.state.progress) {\r\n      return {\r\n        scroll: window.history.state.scroll,\r\n        chapterId: window.history.state.chapterId,\r\n      };\r\n    }\r\n    return null;\r\n  }\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nchapter-text.component.ts:\r\n```TypeScript\r\nimport { AfterViewInit, Component, ElementRef, Input, OnDestroy, ViewChild } from '@angular/core';\r\nimport { OnScrollService } from \"../on-scroll/on-scroll.service\";\r\nimport { ActivatedRoute } from \"@angular/router\";\r\nimport { Location, ViewportScroller } from \"@angular/common\";\r\nimport { debounceTime, filter, map } from \"rxjs/operators\";\r\nimport { Subscription } from \"rxjs\";\r\n\r\n@Component({\r\n  selector: 'app-chapter-text',\r\n  templateUrl: './chapter-text.component.html',\r\n  styleUrls: ['./chapter-text.component.scss']\r\n})\r\nexport class ChapterTextComponent implements OnDestroy, AfterViewInit {\r\n  @Input() chapter: any;\r\n  private progressSub: Subscription;\r\n  private subscription: Subscription;\r\n  private position: { top: number; height: number };\r\n\r\n  constructor(\r\n    private elem: ElementRef,\r\n    private route: ActivatedRoute,\r\n    private onScroll: OnScrollService,\r\n    private location: Location,\r\n    private viewportScroller: ViewportScroller,\r\n  ) {\r\n  }\r\n\r\n  ngAfterViewInit() {\r\n    this.position = {\r\n      top: this.elem.nativeElement.offsetTop,\r\n      height: this.elem.nativeElement.offsetHeight\r\n    };\r\n    this.subscribe();\r\n  }\r\n\r\n  subscribe() {\r\n    this.subscription = this.onScroll.scroll.pipe(\r\n      filter(scroll => this.position.top < scroll && scroll < this.position.top + this.position.height),\r\n      debounceTime(100),\r\n    ).subscribe(scroll => this.location.replaceState(this.chapter.url, undefined, {\r\n      ...window.history.state,\r\n      scroll,\r\n      chapterId: this.chapter.chapterId\r\n    }));\r\n    \r\n    this.progressSub = this.route.data.pipe(\r\n      map(data => data.progress),\r\n      filter(progress => progress && this.chapter.chapterId == progress.chapterId),\r\n      map(progress => progress.scroll),\r\n    ).subscribe(scroll => this.viewportScroller.scrollToPosition([0, scroll]));\r\n  }\r\n\r\n  ngOnDestroy() {\r\n    this.subscription.unsubscribe();\r\n    this.progressSub.unsubscribe();\r\n  }\r\n}\r\n```\r\n","Url":"https://github.com/angular/angular/issues/28954","RelatedDescription":"Open issue \"Improve router work with `history.state`\" (#28954)"},{"Id":"413835513","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2019-02-24T15:48:26","Actor":"crisbeto","Number":"28951","RawContent":null,"Title":"fix(ivy): ViewRef.rootNodes not including projected nodes","State":"open","Body":"Currently if an embedded view contains projected nodes, its `rootNodes` array will include `null` instead of the root nodes inside the projection slot.

I've configured my app this way intentionally, and I don't want to see these warnings every time I start my application for development.\r\n\r\nHere is my command:\r\n\r\n    ng serve --host 0.0.0.0 --port 8000 --ssl true --ssl-key localhost.key --ssl-cert localhost.cert\r\n\r\nAnd the warnings:\r\n\r\n```\r\nWARNING: This is a simple server for use in testing or debugging Angular applications\r\nlocally. It hasn't been reviewed for security issues.\r\n\r\nBinding this server to an open connection can result in compromising your application or\r\ncomputer. Using a different host than the one passed to the \"--host\" flag might result in\r\nwebsocket connection issues. You might need to use \"--disableHostCheck\" if that's the\r\ncase.\r\n```\r\n\r\nThe top one is useful, but I don't need to be reminded, I'm already not using Angular CLI in production.\r\n\r\nThe second one is of course useful as well, but I'm running this app inside of a Docker container on my dev machine with an port exposed to the host, so that's not an issue in my case either.\r\n\r\n### Describe the solution you'd like\r\nA broad flag (or a number of more specific flags) to disable warnings at start time.  I have found another issue requesting something like this here:\r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/angular/angular-cli/issues/11802\r\n\r\nHowever, the answer given to this is to redirect stderr.  This does have the desired effect, but it _also_ disables all compile-time errors, which I _need_ for the development process.\r\n\r\n### Describe alternatives you've considered\r\nEither find a configuration that Angular complains about less, or simply ignore the warnings.\r\n","Url":"https://github.com/angular/angular-cli/issues/13765","RelatedDescription":"Open issue \"Disable start-up warnings\" (#13765)"},{"Id":"414139127","IsPullRequest":false,"CreatedAt":"2019-02-25T14:44:27","Actor":"mwhitis","Number":"13764","RawContent":null,"Title":"Incorrect scss file name generated","State":"open","Body":"# 🐞 Bug report\r\n\r\n### Command (mark with an `x`)\r\n<!-- Can you pin-point the command or commands that are effected by this bug? -->\r\n<!-- ✍️edit: -->\r\n```\r\n- [x] new\r\n- [ ] build\r\n- [ ] serve\r\n- [ ] test\r\n- [ ] e2e\r\n- [ ] generate\r\n- [ ] add\r\n- [ ] update\r\n- [ ] lint\r\n- [ ] xi18n\r\n- [ ] run\r\n- [ ] config\r\n- [ ] help\r\n- [ ] version\r\n- [ ] doc\r\n```\r\n\r\n### Is this a regression?\r\n\r\n<!-- Did this behavior use to work in the previous version? -->\r\n<!-- ✍️--> Yes, the previous version in which this bug was not present was: ....\r\nHas worked previously, but I don't know how long ago it regressed\r\n\r\n### Description\r\n\r\n<!-- ✍️--> A clear and concise description of the problem...\r\nUsing cli 7.3.3\r\n\r\nGenerates src/styles.**scss**\r\n\r\nAngular.json looking for src/styles.**sass**\r\n\r\n## 🔬 Minimal Reproduction\r\n\r\nng new foo \r\nY to angular routing\r\nChange Stylesheet to SASS\r\n\r\nng serve\r\n\r\n## 🔥 Exception or Error\r\n<pre><code>\r\n<!-- If the issue is accompanied by an exception or an error, please share it below: -->\r\n<!-- ✍️-->\r\nERROR in multi ./src/styles.sass\r\nModule not found: Error: Can't resolve '/Users/mwhitis/git/mwhitis/foo/src/styles.sass' in '/Users/m420498/git/mwhitis/foo'\r\nℹ ｢wdm｣: Failed to compile.\r\n</code>\r\n</pre>\r\n\r\n\r\n## 🌍 Your Environment\r\n<pre><code>\r\n<!-- run `ng version` and paste output below -->\r\n<!-- ✍️-->\r\n     _                      _                 ____ _     ___\r\n    / \\   _ __   __ _ _   _| | __ _ _ __     / ___| |   |_ _|\r\n   / △ \\ | '_ \\ / _` | | | | |/ _` | '__|   | |   | |    | |\r\n  / ___ \\| | | | (_| | |_| | | (_| | |      | |___| |___ | |\r\n /_/   \\_\\_| |_|\\__, |\\__,_|_|\\__,_|_|       \\____|_____|___|\r\n                |___/\r\n\r\n\r\nAngular CLI: 7.3.3\r\nNode: 11.10.0\r\nOS: darwin x64\r\nAngular: 7.2.6\r\n... animations, common, compiler, compiler-cli, core, forms\r\n... language-service, platform-browser, platform-browser-dynamic\r\n... router\r\n\r\nPackage                           Version\r\n-----------------------------------------------------------\r\n@angular-devkit/architect         0.13.3\r\n@angular-devkit/build-angular     0.13.3\r\n@angular-devkit/build-optimizer   0.13.3\r\n@angular-devkit/build-webpack     0.13.3\r\n@angular-devkit/core              7.3.3\r\n@angular-devkit/schematics        7.3.3\r\n@angular/cli                      7.3.3\r\n@ngtools/webpack                  7.3.3\r\n@schematics/angular               7.3.3\r\n@schematics/update                0.13.3\r\nrxjs                              6.3.3\r\ntypescript                        3.2.4\r\nwebpack                           4.29.0\r\n</code></pre>\r\n\r\n**Anything else relevant?**\r\n<!-- ✍️Is this a browser specific issue?

I am working on the windows machine ( with cygwin ) could it be paths or ?\r\n\r\n\r\n## 🔬 Minimal Reproduction\r\n\r\n1. `ng add @angular-extensions.model` (or any other 3rd party library which contains schematics, eg: `@angular/material` or `@ngrx/store`)\r\n\r\n2. `ng generate model examples/user --collection @angular-extensions/model`\r\n\r\nThis results in a error where `model` schematics is not found in the `@schematics/angular` which is a default collection in Angular CLI so that means the `--collection` was ignored.\r\n\r\nOn the other hand, everything works just fine when using `ng generate @angular-extensions/model:model examples/user`.\r\n\r\n\r\n## 🔥 Exception or Error\r\n<pre><code>\r\nSchematic \"model\" not found in collection \"@schematics/angular\".\r\nError: Schematic \"model\" not found in collection \"@schematics/angular\".\r\n    at SchematicEngine.createSchematic (C:\\projects\\meetup\\schematics-example-workspace\\node_modules\\@angular-devkit\\schematics\\src\\engine\\engine.js:232:23)\r\n</code></pre>\r\n\r\n\r\n## 🌍 Your Environment\r\n<pre><code>\r\nAngular CLI: 7.3.3\r\nNode: 10.11.0\r\nOS: win32 x64\r\nAngular: 7.2.6\r\n... animations, common, compiler, compiler-cli, core, forms\r\n... language-service, platform-browser, platform-browser-dynamic\r\n... router\r\n\r\nPackage                            Version\r\n------------------------------------------------------------\r\n@angular-devkit/architect          0.13.3\r\n@angular-devkit/build-angular      0.13.3\r\n@angular-devkit/build-ng-packagr   0.13.3\r\n@angular-devkit/build-optimizer    0.13.3\r\n@angular-devkit/build-webpack      0.13.3\r\n@angular-devkit/core               7.3.3\r\n@angular-devkit/schematics         7.3.3\r\n@angular/cdk                       7.3.3\r\n@angular/cli                       7.3.3\r\n@angular/material                  7.3.3\r\n@ngtools/json-schema               1.1.0\r\n@ngtools/webpack                   7.3.3\r\n@schematics/angular                7.3.3\r\n@schematics/update                 0.13.3\r\nng-packagr                         4.7.1\r\nrxjs                               6.3.3\r\ntypescript                         3.2.4\r\nwebpack                            4.29.0\r\n</code></pre>\r\n","Url":"https://github.com/angular/angular-cli/issues/13753","RelatedDescription":"Open issue \"Running 3rd party schematics should be possible using both <collection>:<schematics> and --collection <collection> syntax\" (#13753)"},{"Id":"413723027","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2019-02-23T18:30:54","Actor":"renovate-bot","Number":"13752","RawContent":null,"Title":"build: update license-webpack-plugin to version 2.1.1","State":"open","Body":"This PR contains the following updates:\n\n| Package | Type | Update | Change | References |\n|---|---|---|---|---|\n| license-webpack-plugin | dependencies | patch | `2.1.0` -> `2.1.1` | [source](https://togithub.com/xz64/license-webpack-plugin) |\n\n---\n\n### Release Notes\n\n<details>\n<summary>xz64/license-webpack-plugin</summary>\n\n### [`v2.1.1`](https://togithub.com/xz64/license-webpack-plugin/blob/master/CHANGELOG.md#&#8203;211---2019-02-23)\n\n[Compare Source](https://togithub.com/xz64/license-webpack-plugin/compare/v2.1.0...v2.1.1)\n\n##### Fixed\n\n-   Handle missing license template file when `licenseTemplateDir` is used\n\n</details>\n\n---\n\n### Renovate configuration\n\n:date: **Schedule**: \"after 10pm every weekday,before 4am every weekday,every weekend\" in timezone America/Tijuana.\n\n:vertical_traffic_light: **Automerge**: Disabled by config.
