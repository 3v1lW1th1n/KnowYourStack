When we get windows messages (`WM_*`) we create event classes and jump through a lot of hoops that would not be necessary in a closed system.\r\n\r\nFor one example, getting a `WM_ERASEBKGND` often ends up being a `FillRect` on the passed in `HDC`.  We could potentially avoid a lot of hoop jumping some allocations if we knew the `OnPaintBackground` was completely under our control.\r\n\r\nWe would pay up front for this sort of check, but could potentially earn it back quite quickly. The following code takes a couple of milliseconds on class creation:\r\n\r\n``` C#\r\nType type = GetType();\r\n_isTypeInAssembly = type.Assembly == typeof(Control).Assembly;\r\n\r\n_isOnPaintBackgroundLocal = _isTypeInAssembly\r\n    || type.GetMethod(\r\n        \"OnPaintBackground\",\r\n        BindingFlags.NonPublic |
