After that, the `registration` is created from the previous pipes.\r\n\r\nWhat happens if the `serviceworker.controller` is `null` in all `controllerchange` events? (At the moment you are thinking that couldn't happen, but yes üéâit happens!!!üéâ. \r\nThen if the app is started with `serviceworker.controller = null `and `requestSubscription` is called a few minutes later, the promise won't never be resolved.\r\nhttps://github.com/angular/angular/blob/c0757d1d440d6f934436418add9755e7d630bbcf/packages/service-worker/src/push.ts#L93-L99\r\n\r\n**Possible solution**\r\nMerging `registration`observable with `serviceworker.ready`but I'm not sure if breaks something.\r\nhttps://github.com/angular/angular/blob/c0757d1d440d6f934436418add9755e7d630bbcf/packages/service-worker/src/low_level.ts#L81-L82\r\n\r\n## üî¨ Minimal Reproduction\r\nThe problem reproduction is explained in the previous section. But if you want to get crazy to Chrome to test the bug, you can do the following:\r\n\r\nYou can test this on Chrome 72 Windows, the steps are not going to work on Chrome Mac. But I have logs that prove the bug happens in other Chrome version and platforms, maybe, doing different steps, but the state is the same, `serviceworker.controller` is `null`.\r\n\r\nSteps Chrome Windows.\r\n1. Create a app with a checkbox or switch button to activate/descativate notifications.\r\n2. Check the switch in your app will call `requestSubscription()`\r\n3. When the popup is shown, press Block.\r\n4. Go to de addressbar, click in the lock :lock:. Change the notifications state to Allow. Chrome will say you that the page should be reloaded.\r\n6. Reload the page.\r\n7. If you call `requestSubscription()`again, you won't get the popup. Or if you write in the console `serviceworker.controller` you will get `null`.\r\n\r\nHere is an example image. The app is started, `serviceworker.controller` is `null`, but I can get the service worker registration and the push subscription, so `serviceworker.controller` is not needed to get it. (Keys are hidden in the image).\r\n<img width=\"735\" alt=\"captura de pantalla 2019-03-01 a las 19 49 21\" src=\"https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/315972/53675185-44e20400-3c94-11e9-91ac-9b9b46f04919.png\">\r\n\r\n## üåç  Your Environment\r\n\r\n**Angular Version:**\r\nTested in angular 7.1.7 but I think all version are affected.\r\n\r\n**Anything else relevant?**\r\n\r\nI use this code with a timeout before I  run into the issue to avoid freezing the function.

I have spent several hours testing that this code is valid in Repl.it for both JavaScript and TypeScript.\r\n\r\nMy code without object Deconstruction compiles fine:\r\n\r\n```\r\n this.data.getScore(this.titleUrl).subscribe(data => {\r\n  this.avgRating=data['avgrating'];\r\n  this.numReviews=data['numOfReviews'];\r\n  this.posterUrl = data['posterUrl']'  \r\n``` \r\n     \r\n\r\n\r\nMy code with either object Deconstruction below throws an error:\r\n\r\n```\r\n this.data.getScore(this.titleUrl).subscribe(data => {\r\n  ({avgrating: this.avgRating, numOfReviews: this.numReviews, posterUrl: this.posterUrl}= data) \r\n```\r\n     \r\n\r\n\r\n```\r\nthis.data.getMovieInfo(this.titleUrl).subscribe(({id, title, poster_url, backdrop_url}) => {\r\n        this.title=title;\r\n        this.posterUrl=poster_url;\r\n        this.backdropUrl=backdrop_url;\r\n```\r\nThe errors I get back are:\r\n\r\nERROR in src/app/app.component.ts(84,11): error TS2459: Type 'Object' has no property 'poster_Url' and no string index signature. \r\n\r\nI have tested this in multiple ways to try a workaround with Destructuring this but all have failed even though almost exact code can be reproduced in Repl.it with either javascript or typescript and it passes.  \r\n It seems the bug is the fact that the compiler doesn't know what is on the data object as it is coming from my BackEnd API even though I do know what will be on the object and refuses to build.\r\n\r\n## üî¨ Minimal Reproduction\r\nTo reproduce you must do the following:\r\n1. Create a new service connecting to some api:\r\n\r\n```\r\nexport class DataService {\r\n\r\n  constructor(private http: HttpClient) { }\r\n\r\n  getScore(titleUrl) {\r\n    return this.http.get(`${environment.url}cr/score/${titleUrl}`);\r\n\r\n  }\r\n```\r\n\r\n2. Create a component that accesses that service and try to deconstruct the return value on the object.\r\nimport {DataService} from './data.service';\r\n\r\n```\r\n@Component({\r\n  selector: 'app-root',\r\n  templateUrl: './app.component.html',\r\n  styleUrls: ['./app.component.css'],\r\n})\r\n\r\nexport class AppComponent implements OnInit {\r\n//declaration of variables to display\r\n...\r\n    constructor(private data: DataService) {\r\n\r\n    }\r\n\r\n   ngOnInit() {\r\n    this.data.getScore(this.titleUrl).subscribe(data => {\r\n   ({avgrating: this.avgRating, numOfReviews: this.numReviews, posterUrl: this.posterUrl}= data) \r\n   }\r\n     \r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\n\r\n<!--\r\n\r\n-->\r\n\r\n## üî• Exception or Error\r\n<pre><code>\r\nERROR in src/app/app.component.ts(84,11): error TS2459: Type 'Object' has no property 'poster_Url' and no string index signature. \r\n\r\n</code></pre>\r\n\r\n\r\n","Url":"https://github.com/angular/angular-cli/issues/13803","RelatedDescription":"Closed issue \"ES6 Destructuring Issue with Data from API\" (#13803)"},{"Id":"416340646","IsPullRequest":false,"CreatedAt":"2019-03-02T01:35:47","Actor":"mmehta4","Number":"13804","RawContent":null,"Title":"npm ERR! notarget No matching version found for @angular-devkit/core@7.3.4","State":"open","Body":"<!--üîÖüîÖüîÖüîÖüîÖüîÖüîÖüîÖüîÖüîÖüîÖüîÖüîÖüîÖüîÖüîÖüîÖüîÖüîÖüîÖüîÖüîÖüîÖüîÖüîÖüîÖüîÖüîÖüîÖüîÖüîÖ\r\n\r\nOh hi there! üòÑ\r\n\r\nTo expedite issue processing please search open and closed issues before submitting a new one.\r\nExisting issues often contain information about workarounds, resolution, or progress updates.\r\n\r\nüîÖüîÖüîÖüîÖüîÖüîÖüîÖüîÖüîÖüîÖüîÖüîÖüîÖüîÖüîÖüîÖüîÖüîÖüîÖüîÖüîÖüîÖüîÖüîÖüîÖüîÖüîÖüîÖüîÖüîÖüîÖüîÖüîÖ-->\r\n\r\n\r\n# üêû Bug report\r\nGetting Error with - ng new my-project\r\n\r\n### Command (mark with an `x`)\r\n<!-- Can you pin-point the command or commands that are effected by this bug? -->\r\n<!-- ‚úçÔ∏èedit: -->\r\n```\r\n- [x ] new\r\n- [ ] build\r\n- [ ] serve\r\n- [ ] test\r\n- [ ] e2e\r\n- [ ] generate\r\n- [ ] add\r\n- [ ] update\r\n- [ ] lint\r\n- [ ] xi18n\r\n- [ ] run\r\n- [ ] config\r\n- [ ] help\r\n- [ ] version\r\n- [ ] doc\r\n```\r\n\r\n### Is this a regression?\r\n\r\n<!-- Did this behavior use to work in the previous version? -->\r\n<!-- ‚úçÔ∏è--> Yes, the previous version in which this bug was not present was: ....\r\n\r\n\r\n### Description\r\n\r\n<!-- ‚úçÔ∏è--> A clear and concise description of the problem...\r\n\r\n\r\n## üî¨ Minimal Reproduction\r\n<!--\r\nSimple steps to reproduce this bug.\r\n\r\nPlease include: commands run (including args), packages added, related code changes.\r\n\r\nIf reproduction steps are not enough for reproduction of your issue, please create a minimal GitHub repository with the reproduction of the issue.
