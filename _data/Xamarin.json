This fixes the situation by eliminating\r\nthe dependencies. Especially it is easier to just parse api-*.xml.in to\r\nextract int consts from Java API.\r\n\r\n... thought so? It turnd out to not be that easy.\r\n\r\nUnlike DroidDoc, api-*.xml.in does not contain \"api-since\" information,\r\nso we need to parse ALL the API XML. And they cannot be **precise**\r\nbecause we only have a subset of the API definitions. For example,\r\n\"since API Level 1\" now becomes \"since API Level 10\" because we don't\r\nhave api-1.xml.in (not even api-4.xml.in). So they will become non-precise.\r\n\r\n(A slightly better possibility to \"fix\" this is to parse\r\n`android-sdk-whatever/platform-tools/api/api-versions.xml`, but it won't\r\ncontain \"already vanished\" constants so it will be incomplete either.\r\nI didn't bother to do \"better\" so far. We don't need that for enumification.)\r\n\r\nTherefore, there is a lot of changes in `map.csv` to reflect those\r\n\"insignificant\" changes to remap \"API since\" column (e.g. from \"1\" to \"10\").\r\n\r\nRegeneration from api-LEVEL.xml.in instead of DroidDoc has some other\r\nside effects; some consts are back to the list so that we don't have to\r\nmanually copy existing mapped consts that could not be generated from\r\nthe latest DroidDocs (due to disappearance) anymore. Instead we have to\r\nremove manually-mapped constants (either from the sources or `map.csv`).\r\nTherefore, a handful of heading lines in `map.csv` were removed, and\r\nsome definitions in `enum-conversion-mappings.xml` are back.\r\n\r\n[*1] https://github.com/xamarin/xamarin-android/pull/1038"},{"Id":"6885039980","Type":"PullRequestEvent","CreatedAt":"2017-11-21T14:59:00","Actor":"grendello","Repository":"xamarin/xamarin-android","Organization":"xamarin","RawContent":null,"RelatedAction":"opened","RelatedUrl":"https://github.com/xamarin/xamarin-android/pull/1043","RelatedDescription":"Opened pull request \"Bump mono\" (#1043) at xamarin/xamarin-android","RelatedBody":"Need fix for https://bugzilla.xamarin.com/show_bug.cgi?id=60625"},{"Id":"6884256047","Type":"PullRequestEvent","CreatedAt":"2017-11-21T12:21:52","Actor":"jonpryor","Repository":"xamarin/xamarin-android","Organization":"xamarin","RawContent":null,"RelatedAction":"merged","RelatedUrl":"https://github.com/xamarin/xamarin-android/pull/1042","RelatedDescription":"Merged pull request \"[android-toolchain] update emulator to 26.1.4.0\" (#1042) at xamarin/xamarin-android","RelatedBody":"Context:\r\nhttps://developer.android.com/studio/releases/emulator.html#26-1-3\r\n\r\nGoogle has added support for `hypervisor.framework` on Mac instead of\r\nusing HAXM.
