responsive","State":"closed","Body":"### Version\r\n2.6.10\r\n\r\n### Reproduction link\r\n[https://codepen.io/dreamcarter/pen/ajoePd?editors=1111](https://codepen.io/dreamcarter/pen/ajoePd?editors=1111)\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n### Steps to reproduce\r\n1. add an array to data like:\r\n    data:{ arr : [1] }\r\n2. binding arr[0] to template: <div>{{ arr[0] }}</div>\r\n3. change arr with index: arr[0] = 2\r\n\r\n\r\n### What is expected?\r\nwe should get <div>2</div>\r\n\r\n### What is actually happening?\r\nnow we get <div>1</div>,the arr[0] is not responsive\r\n\r\n---\r\nIn my opinion, we can regard arr as an plain object to make arr[0] = 2 responsive. \r\n\r\nIn fact,we know that Object.keys(arr) => [\"0\"], and it means that arr is an object with a property \"0\".so if we execute this.walk(arr),arr[0]will be a responsive property now.In this case, we don't need function observeArray.We can make a change in constructor of Observer like this:\r\n\r\nsrc/core/observer/index.js\r\n\r\nif (Array.isArray(value)) {\r\n\r\n      if (hasProto) {\r\n\r\n        protoAugment(value, arrayMethods)\r\n\r\n      } else {\r\n\r\n        copyAugment(value, arrayMethods, arrayKeys)\r\n\r\n      }\r\n\r\n      this.observeArray(value)\r\n\r\n    } else {\r\n\r\n      this.walk(value)\r\n\r\n    }\r\n\r\nmake a change:\r\n\r\nif (Array.isArray(value)) {\r\n\r\n      if (hasProto) {\r\n\r\n        protoAugment(value, arrayMethods)\r\n\r\n      } else {\r\n\r\n        copyAugment(value, arrayMethods, arrayKeys)\r\n\r\n      }\r\n\r\n}\r\n\r\nthis.walk(value)\r\n\r\nIn this time,we regard arr = [1] as arr = { \"0\": 1 }.So, we don't need observeArray in the constructor of Observer and make all initial items of arr responsive.But if arr[0] doesn't exist initially, it is not responsive because it's a new property for arr.\r\n\r\n<!-- generated by vue-issues.

There are reasonable workarounds proposed in #2105, but they don't address the fact that developers who fall into this pattern have to spend time and effort debugging this undefined behavior due to the lack of feedback from the library. This deviates from the expectations established by the useful console warnings provided when using named routes incorrectly.\r\n\r\nSome solutions to this problem that were not explored in #2105 include:\r\n\r\n- Warning about router views with no component in the console\r\n- Adding more explicit requirements to the documentation. All router views must specify a component containing a router view to propagate rendering to child route components\r\n\r\n<!-- generated by vue-issues.

When entering the `beforeEach` callback, an error will be thrown but will work accordingly. If clicking on the current page link, there's also an error being thrown.\r\n\r\n### What is expected?\r\nTo work without error.\r\n\r\n### What is actually happening?\r\nIt works with an error\r\n\r\n---\r\nThis error happens only when using a compiler, could not make it happens in a JSFiddle.\r\n\r\nUpon inspection, the error happens since version 3.1.0. The breaking change is the use of `Promise` in the `VueRouter.prototype.push` callback. The problem might be located in the file [`vue-router@3.1.2 history/base.js#87`](https://github.com/vuejs/vue-router/blob/v3.1.2/src/history/base.js#L87):\r\n\r\n```\r\nif (onAbort) {\r\n  onAbort(err)\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nHere, `onAbort` is equal to the `reject` function of the Promise. `err` can be equal to many things depending on what is being passed to `next()`, but there's no way that I know of to catch the error thrown.\r\n\r\nDowngrading to version 3.0.7 solves the issue.\r\n\r\n<!-- generated by vue-issues.

This allows the mutation functions to directly update the payload data rather than the state object.\r\n\r\nAs an example see [editTodo() in the todo demo](https://github.com/vuejs/vuex/blob/91f3e69ed9e290cf91f8885c6d5ae2c97fa7ab81/examples/todomvc/store/mutations.js#L17):\r\n\r\n```javascript\r\neditTodo (state, { todo, text = todo.text, done = todo.done }) {\r\n  todo.text = text\r\n  todo.done = done\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nThere are 2 downsides to this.\r\n\r\nThe first is that the function is mutating the payload and not the state. It is not clear here what is being mutated. We now need to traverse all around the app to find out.\r\n\r\nIf the payload was instead passed by value then updating the value would not actually do anything. All mutation functions would need to update the state object. This would make vuex stores more explicit and understandable as well as ensure there is a clear boundary between it and the app. \r\n\r\nThe second is that Vuex plugins cannot log the mutations to a server and replay them back later. Here is a pseudocode example:\r\n\r\n```javascript\r\n// replaying back mutation logs\r\nlet logs = await getLogsFromServer();\r\nfor (log in logs) {\r\n  // any editTodo mutations passed in below will not work\r\n  // as the mutation will update the \"log\" object instead of \r\n  // the actual todo in the state object\r\n  this.store.commit(log.type, log.payload);\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nI'm working on a plugin that does this (similar to [redux-vcr](https://github.com/joshwcomeau/redux-vcr)) and it would be great if there was a systematic guarantee that it would work with all Vuex stores. \r\n\r\n### What does the proposed API look like?\r\nExample - No changes needed\r\n```javascript\r\nmutations: {\r\n  // current: n is passed by reference\r\n  increment (state, n) { \r\n    state.count  = n\r\n  }\r\n}\r\n\r\nmutations: {\r\n  // proposed: n is passed by value\r\n  increment (state, n) { \r\n    state.count  = n\r\n  }\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nExample B - editTodo\r\n\r\n```javascript\r\nmutations: {\r\n  // current - can update payload\r\n  editTodo (state, { todo, text = todo.text, done = todo.done }) {\r\n    todo.text = text\r\n    todo.done = done\r\n  }\r\n}\r\n\r\nmutations: {\r\n  // proposed - with pass by value we \r\n  // must update the state object\r\n  editTodo (state, todo) {\r\n     const index = state.todos.findIndex(t => t.id === todo.id);\r\n     state.todos[index] = todo;\r\n  }\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\n<!-- generated by vue-issues.
