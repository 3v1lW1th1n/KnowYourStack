Add `z-index: auto` to each `.navbar`\r\n    - Property included via the **new** `bd-navbar-color-example` class\r\n    - Sass included in the `specific.sass` file\r\n![After_Colors](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/22060392/61165661-8b682a80-a4e0-11e9-86c8-fa1cbf91c11d.png)\r\n\r\n\r\n4. Add HTML snippet for all the hero under navbars called `navbar_hero_filler_html` \r\n    - **Along with that** I noticed a lot of reuse of the same navbar items so I moved those into another \r\nHTML snippet called `navbar_items_html`\r\n5. Completed By no. 4\r\n\r\n### Tradeoffs\r\n\r\nThere may be a little overhead by including more snippets in the `navbar.html` file but i believe it is negligible.
