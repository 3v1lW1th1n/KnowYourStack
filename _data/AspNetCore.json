Since then, from time to time, I used to update the version of SignalR client & server and .NET runtime. I was doing so by using \"ci-dev\" feed and it used to work pretty well.\r\n\r\nFew weeks, the \"ci-dev\" feed started to ask me credentials (I don't know why), so I switched to \"dev\" feed and then, issues have started... \r\n\r\nI created an issue in the cli repo (https://github.com/dotnet/cli/issues/8280) and after a short discussion, they adviced me to create an issue here.\r\n\r\nBasically, the issue is that the latest bits don't allow me to run an aspnet core 2.1 web app on my machine because of a new feature they are implementing.

If you like it then I'll start working on the tests.\r\n\r\nRelated issues:\r\nhttps://github.com/aspnet/KestrelHttpServer/issues/2016 - Config support\r\nhttps://github.com/aspnet/KestrelHttpServer/issues/2167 - Default settings\r\nhttps://github.com/aspnet/KestrelHttpServer/issues/2166 - UseHttps()\r\nhttps://github.com/aspnet/KestrelHttpServer/issues/1290 - Config and code parity\r\nhttps://github.com/aspnet/KestrelHttpServer/issues/2188 - Listen on https by default\r\n\r\nMajor features:\r\n- KestrelServerOptions.ConfigureEndpointDefaults sets a callback that will be called for every new endpoint no matter what source.\r\n- KestrelServerOptions.ConfigureHttpsDefaults sets a callback that will be called to configured every new Https adapter. This is primarily useful for endpoints config.\r\n- KestrelServerOptions.Configure(IConfiguration) creates a builder that reads config and registers endpoints. This includes the .Endpoint method to configure additional settings for individually named endpoints from config.\r\n- New ListenOptions.UseHttps extensions to provide code and config functional symmetry, and overloads with configureOptions so you don't have to re-invent cert loading when you want to configure other settings.\r\n\r\nSupported configurations:\r\n\r\n- No config: Listens on http://localhost:5000 and https://localhost:5001 (if a default cert is available)\r\n- Configure Urls: Urls can be specified by ASNETCORE_URLS environment variable, Urls command line variable, or Urls top level key in hosting's configuration, or via the `UseUrls` IWebHostBuilder extension. These can be http or https (if a default cert is available). This may be a semicolon separated list. E.g. `\"Urls\": \"http://localhost:5000;http://localhost:5001\"`.\r\n- Default cert from config: The default certificate can be replaced from configuration. Call `serverOptions.Configure(context.Configuration.GetSection(\"Kestrel\"))` to specify the configuration section (this will be added to the metapackage). Then add the following config:\r\n```\r\n{\r\n  \"Kestrel\": {\r\n    \"Certificates\": {\r\n       \"Default\": {\r\n          \"Path\": \"...\",\r\n          \"Password\": \"\"\r\n       }\r\n    }\r\n  }\r\n}\r\n```\r\nCertificates can also be loaded from the machine store by specifying the following parameters instead of Path and Password:\r\n```\r\n  \"Subject\": \"Test Subject\", // Required\r\n  \"Store\": \"My\", // StoreName defaults to My\r\n  \"Location\": \"CurrentUser/LocalMachine\", // StoreLocation defaults to CurrentUser\r\n  \"AllowInvalid\": true // defaults to false. Setting this to true allows for self-signed or other non-trusted certificates.\r\n```\r\n- Change defaults in code: ConfigureEndpointDefaults and ConfigureHttpsDefaults can be used to change default settings for ListenOptions and HttpsConnectionAdapterOptions, including overriding the default certificate specified in the prior scenario.\r\n```\r\noptions.ConfigureEndpointDefaults(opt =>\r\n{\r\n    opt.Protocols = HttpProtocols.Http1;\r\n});\r\n\r\noptions.ConfigureHttpsDefaults(httpsOptions =>\r\n{\r\n    httpsOptions.SslProtocols = SslProtocols.Tls12;\r\n});\r\n```\r\n- Configure endpoints: Named endpoints can be added via configuration with the following format:\r\n```\r\n  \"Kestrel\": {\r\n\t\"Endpoints\": {\r\n\t   \"HTTP\": { \"Url\": \"http://*:5000\" },\r\n           \"HTTPS\": {\r\n              \"Url\": \"https://*:5463\",\r\n              \"Certificate\": {\r\n                  \"Path\": \"testCert.pfx\",\r\n                  \"Password\": \"testPassword\"\r\n              }\r\n          }\r\n    }\r\n```\r\nSchema details:\r\n1. The endpoints above are named HTTP and HTTPS. These names are arbitrary but will become useful in the next example. These names are case-insensitive.\r\n2. The Url parameter is required for each endpoint. The format for this parameter is the same as the top level Urls configuration parameter except that it's limited to a single value.\r\n3. These endpoints replace those defined in the top level Urls configuration rather than adding to them. Endpoints defined in code via Listen are cumulative with the endpoints defined in this configuration section.\r\n4. The Certificate section is optional, if not specified then the defaults defined in earlier scenarios will be used. If no defaults are available then the server will throw and fail to start.\r\n5. The Certificate section supports both the Path&Password and the Subject&Store type of certificates.\r\n6. Any number of endpoints may be defined in this way so long as they don't cause port conflicts.\r\n- `serverOptions.Configure(context.Configuration.GetSection(\"Kestrel\"))` returns a KestrelConfigurationLoader with an `.Endpoint(string name, options => { })` method that can be used to supplement configured endpoint's settings.\r\n```\r\n  serverOptions.Configure(context.Configuration.GetSection(\"Kestrel\"))\r\n    .Endpoint(\"HTTPS\", opt =>\r\n    {\r\n         opt.ListenOptions.Protocols = HttpProtocols.Http1;\r\n         opt.HttpsOptions.SslProtocols = SslProtocols.Tls12;\r\n    });\r\n```\r\n- The configuration section for each endpoint is a available on the options in the Endpoint method so that custom settings may be read.\r\n- Multiple configurations may be loaded by calling `serverOptions.Configure(context.Configuration.GetSection(\"Kestrel\"))` again with another section. Only the last configuration will be used unless Load is explicitly called on prior instances. The metapackage will not call Load so that it's default configuration section may be replaced.\r\n- KestrelConfigurationLoader mirrors the Listen family of APIs from KestrelServerOptions as Endpoint overloads so code and config endpoints may be configured in the same place. These overloads do not use names and only consume default settings from configuration."},{"Id":"7019506702","Type":"IssuesEvent","CreatedAt":"2017-12-21T17:30:22","Actor":"Tratcher","Repository":"aspnet/KestrelHttpServer","Organization":"aspnet","RawContent":null,"RelatedAction":"opened","RelatedUrl":"https://github.com/aspnet/KestrelHttpServer/issues/2232","RelatedDescription":"Opened issue \"Build.cmd fails due to new BenchmarkDotNet RELEASE error\" (#2232) at aspnet/KestrelHttpServer","RelatedBody":"build.cmd now fails by default on dev machines because BenchmarkDotNet started issuing a fatal error if the project is not compiled as RELEASE.\r\n\r\nworkaround: `build /p:configuration=Release`\r\n\r\nProposals:\r\n- Disable BenchmarkDotNet for DEBUG?\r\n- Suppress the error?\r\n"},{"Id":"7019488696","Type":"IssuesEvent","CreatedAt":"2017-12-21T17:26:05","Actor":"Tratcher","Repository":"aspnet/KestrelHttpServer","Organization":"aspnet","RawContent":null,"RelatedAction":"closed","RelatedUrl":"https://github.com/aspnet/KestrelHttpServer/issues/2226","RelatedDescription":"Closed issue \"issue solved\" (#2226) at aspnet/KestrelHttpServer","RelatedBody":""},{"Id":"7015592838","Type":"IssuesEvent","CreatedAt":"2017-12-20T22:27:41","Actor":"benaadams","Repository":"aspnet/KestrelHttpServer","Organization":"aspnet","RawContent":null,"RelatedAction":"opened","RelatedUrl":"https://github.com/aspnet/KestrelHttpServer/issues/2231","RelatedDescription":"Opened issue \"Allow Unix Sockets on Windows\" (#2231) at aspnet/KestrelHttpServer","RelatedBody":"😮 https://blogs.msdn.microsoft.com/commandline/2017/12/19/af_unix-comes-to-windows/"},{"Id":"7011654196","Type":"IssuesEvent","CreatedAt":"2017-12-20T07:20:23","Actor":"jkotalik","Repository":"aspnet/KestrelHttpServer","Organization":"aspnet","RawContent":null,"RelatedAction":"opened","RelatedUrl":"https://github.com/aspnet/KestrelHttpServer/issues/2230","RelatedDescription":"Opened issue \"Consume BindingAddress in ServerAddress \" (#2230) at aspnet/KestrelHttpServer","RelatedBody":"[HttpAbstractions has a new type](https://github.com/aspnet/HttpAbstractions/commit/150bb3faf413226d053777bbc72618fb284a6970) that will be consumed for using the IServerAddressFeature.
