However, the client can start sending requests before it receives the settings. The server is supposed to assume default settings until the client ack's the settings (with a timeout), but Kestrel does not, it assumes its own initial settings.\r\n\r\nKestrel has two settings it sets to lower than the default, SETTINGS_MAX_HEADER_LIST_SIZE and SETTINGS_MAX_CONCURRENT_STREAMS. The trouble with both of these settings is that the spec default is infinite, allowing infinite for either would be untenable, even for a short period of time.\r\n\r\nThe good thing about SETTINGS_MAX_CONCURRENT_STREAMS is that they're rejected with REFUSE_STREAM, meaning they're explicitly re-tryable, and HttpClient does retry them. The resets don't arrive until after the settings frame, so the retry will always happen with knowledge of the expected settings. The stream limit issue also contributes to https://github.com/aspnet/AspNetCore/issues/17484.\r\n\r\nSETTINGS_MAX_HEADER_LIST_SIZE is less of a concern because the request is going to fail whether the client knows about the limit or not, there's no automated way to make the request smaller.\r\n\r\nHaving now written this up, I don't think kestrel has any alternatives in these scenarios. Temporary infinite limits are untenable and a client could run into the same issues even if we used more forgiving temporary non-infinite limits.","Url":"https://github.com/aspnet/AspNetCore/issues/17842","RelatedDescription":"Open issue \"Kestrel enforces non-default HTTP/2 limits before the Settings ack\" (#17842)"},{"Id":"537241075","IsPullRequest":false,"CreatedAt":"2019-12-12T22:11:29","Actor":"vsfeedback","Number":"17841","RawContent":null,"Title":"CS1061 incorrectly identifies File with typo","State":"open","Body":"_This issue has been moved from [a ticket on Developer Community](https://developercommunity.visualstudio.com/content/problem/853115/cs1061-incorrectly-identifies-file-with-typo.html)._\n\n---\nI had a typo in Subscriptions.cshtml but Visual Studio Error List window says it occured in Securities.cshtml.\n\nIf helpful, this problem appears to occur when you copy-paste a cshtml file from one folder to another in order to expedite feature development.

However, I copied the parent folder containing Securities.cshtml and renamed that parent folder from \"Securities - Copy\" to \"Reports\".  I think I then re-named Securities.cshtml in the new \"Reports\" folder to Subscriptions.cshtml.  It is also possible I first renamed the cshtml and then renamed the copied folder. Perhaps this is more clear than my original descriptive comment:</p><p>\"If helpful, this problem appears to occur when you copy-paste a cshtml file from one folder to another in order to expedite feature development.\"</p><p>Additionally, if helpful, Razor files in my solution have sometimes lag of up to 5 seconds to activate a context menu.  My disk has 450mb/s read/write capacity.  I plan to test on an NVMe drive later in the week.  I have inquired to VS Engineering if there is Input-Output Anomalies in how Visual Studio watches files, and it would make sense that only some of the anomalies I've filed have been accepted as bugs due to VS Engineers having 5x faster disks.</p>\n\n\n---\n### Original Solutions\n(no solutions)","Url":"https://github.com/aspnet/AspNetCore/issues/17841","RelatedDescription":"Open issue \"CS1061 incorrectly identifies File with typo\" (#17841)"},{"Id":"537192458","IsPullRequest":false,"CreatedAt":"2019-12-12T20:18:59","Actor":"halter73","Number":"17840","RawContent":null,"Title":"Provide better experience when the BodyReader is left in a reading state ","State":"open","Body":"When middleware calls HttpContext.Request.BodyReader.ReadAsync() and exits without calling HttpContext.Request.BodyReader.AdvanceTo(), Kestrel will fail to read the following request while logging the following exception as a warning (at least for Content-Length HTTP/1.1 requests, not sure about others):\r\n\r\n```\r\nSystem.InvalidOperationException\r\n  HResult=0x80131509\r\n  Message=Reading is already in progress.\r\n  Source=Microsoft.AspNetCore.Server.Kestrel.Core\r\n  StackTrace:\r\n   at Microsoft.AspNetCore.Server.Kestrel.Core.Internal.Http.Http1ContentLengthMessageBody.TryReadInternal(ReadResult& readResult) in /_/src/Servers/Kestrel/Core/src/Internal/Http/Http1ContentLengthMessageBody.cs:line 126\r\n```\r\n\r\nThis is pretty common type of error when something throws in between calls to ReadAsync() and AdvanceTo() and AdvanceTo() isn't in a finally block.\r\n\r\nIt would be better if Kestrel logged a warning that explicitly tells the developer that there's a missing call to BodyReader.AdvanceTo().

Even if the parameters are only url or query parameters.\r\n\r\n## Background\r\nWe want to stream a large file directly from the frontend into azure storage and need to pass some ID in addition to the file (query parameter).\r\n\r\n## Problem\r\nReal streaming does only work when the controller method has no parameters. **This works correctly**, you can access the stream with the `MultipartReader`:\r\n```csharp\r\n[HttpPost]\r\npublic async Task<IActionResult> UploadFile()\r\n```\r\n\r\n**This does not work correctly** because the whole request is stored into memory before the controller method is called:\r\n\r\n```csharp\r\n[HttpPost]\r\npublic async Task<IActionResult> UploadFile([FromQuery] UploadDocumentProperties uploadDocumentProperties)\r\n```\r\n\r\nAs soon as there is any parameter the whole request will be loaded into memory and only when this is done the controller method is called. This is even true when the parameter is only a url or query parameter.\r\n\r\nWe noticed this with big files. The UI control uploaded them to 100% and then the user had to wait about the same time again for the API to stream the file to azure. With debugging we could see that the controller is not called before the UI control uploaded the file completely. Now without the parameter the controller is called immediately and streams the file directly as expected.\r\n\r\n## Workaround\r\nWe need some ID that is passed as query parameter. Since the controller method must not have any parameter for the streaming to work correctly we parse the query parameters by hand (`Request.Query`).\r\n\r\nBR\r\nMatthias\r\n\r\n\r\n_Copied from original issue: dotnet/core#3986_","Url":"https://github.com/aspnet/AspNetCore/issues/17837","RelatedDescription":"Open issue \"Multipart file loaded into memory when controller method has parameter\" (#17837)"},{"Id":"537147748","IsPullRequest":false,"CreatedAt":"2019-12-12T18:39:51","Actor":"NTaylorMullen","Number":"17836","RawContent":null,"Title":"On text document change, update HTML in VS LSP client","State":"open","Body":"The Razor language server [will already have the smarts](https://github.com/aspnet/AspNetCore/issues/14286) to push down HTML updates to the client when the primary document is changed.

During the build, for each project that includes `AddLinkerConfigGeneration.targets`, it:\r\n\r\n * If you pass `/p:RegenerateLinkerConfig=true`, emits a file called `<AssemblyName>.linkerconfig.xml`, containing linker rules based on ASP.NET Core / Blazor patterns, i.e.,\r\n    * preserve all `IComponent` types completely, since their constructors and property-setters are used through reflection only\r\n    * preserve all `[JSinterop]` methods, since they are called through reflection only\r\n    * preserve all DI service types, since their constructors are called through reflection only\r\n    * preserve all `EventArgs` subclasses, since their property setters are called through reflection only\r\n * Otherwise,\r\n    * Embeds `<AssemblyName>.linkerconfig.xml` as a resource called `<AssemblyName>.xml` (which is what the linker looks for), if such a file exists on disk\r\n    * Validates that the resulting assembly contains an embedded resource called `<AssemblyName>.xml` and that its contents exactly match what would have been generated if you had passed `/p:RegenerateLinkerConfig=true`. If not, fails the build.\r\n\r\nIn other words, it's very much like our flow for generating reference assemblies, storing them in source control, and validating their up-to-dateness during build. I chose this approach (versus simply generating and embedding on every build) so that humans would manually inspect the diffs to the xml config files and reason about their correctness. This means we inherently have baselines for correct output and don't want a different set of tests for this functionality.\r\n\r\n### Why I don't like this\r\n\r\nIt's really complicated.\r\n\r\nIt means creating a new MSBuild tasks assembly on build, which comes with all the awful mess of locking files and caring about VS running MSBuild as netfx versus netcore. I hate this stuff.\r\n\r\nWe have to use Mono.Cecil to generate the configs. We can't use System.Reflection.Metadata or anything based on it, because the Mono linker only recognizes the exact method signature string format produced by Cecil.\r\n\r\nThe resulting size reductions aren't as big as with https://github.com/aspnet/AspNetCore/pull/17819.","Url":"https://github.com/aspnet/AspNetCore/pull/17820","RelatedDescription":"Closed or merged PR \"Link more assemblies by generating XML config files\" (#17820)"},{"Id":"536954242","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2019-12-12T12:40:39","Actor":"SteveSandersonMS","Number":"17819","RawContent":null,"Title":"[WIP] Link more assemblies using type granularity","State":"open","Body":"**Can only be merged after https://github.com/mono/linker/pull/854 and when we take an updated build of the Mono linker that includes that**\r\n\r\nThis is a preferred implementation for https://github.com/aspnet/AspNetCore/issues/17022.

So i am going to put it here in hopes of getting an answer.\r\n\r\nThe issue is the understanding of how remember me is supposed to work.    My problem is that its not doing what we would expect it to do.   \r\n\r\nManagement expects when a user logs in and clicks remember me that they will then not be required to type their login and password again for a month.  Whether or not they will still have to type in the 2fa code is up for debate.\r\n\r\nWhat is actually happening is that i can close the browser reboot and come back for about an hour and 15 minutes and then i will be forced to type my password again.    This still happens even with a valid `.AspNetCore.Identity.Application` cookie set that is not due to expire for another month.\r\n\r\nAfter digging around in the code i found that Remember me is actually isPersistent and it is defined as.\r\n\r\n>Flag indicating whether the sign-in cookie should persist after the browser is closed.\r\n\r\nWhich brings you to:\r\n\r\nThere are two different types of Cookies:\r\n\r\n- session cookies, held in memory, and which expire once the browser exits\r\n- persistent cookies, which have a time-to-live, are persisted on disk, and are sent by the browser until their time-to-live has elapsed.\r\n\r\nAll this being said remember machine 2fa works as expected i am not prompted again for the 2fa and i have a cookie on my machine `Identity.TwoFactorRememberMe`.\r\n\r\nSo I guess my question is why are we not getting a `Identity.FactorRememberMe` or why isn't sign in respecting a long life time of the `AspNetCore.Identity.Application` cookie?\r\n\r\nHow is this supposed to work exactly?

VS 2019 is about to be released in around early 2019\r\n2. ASP.NET Core 1.0/1.1 is not going to be supported anymore, based on [this page](https://github.com/dotnet/core/blob/master/microsoft-support.md).\r\n3. Creating new ASP.NET Core 1.0/1.1 will always install the .NET Core 1.0/1.1 web tooling, and this is not necessary when previous reason has reached the unsupported period and it's quite near or might be the same time of VS 2019 release.\r\n4. Based on the problem mentioned above, VS 2017 has no \"built in\" tooling when creating new ASP.NET Core 1.0/1.1 project, but the external tooling may help. Therefore for those that still need to maintain ASP.NET Core 1.0/1.1 projects, we could use VS 2017 as long as the VS 2017 is still in support lifecycle or in mainstream support lifecycle.\r\n\r\nI

See aspnet/Extensions#1549\r\n\r\nUsing integer values is ultimately more flexible than text because it allows queries on ranges of values. \r\n\r\nWe considered adding an additional log value to capture the integer status code, but that would introduce another inconsistency with the rest of ASP.NET Core. HttpClient logging and HTTP server/hosting logging use the same key name (`StatusCode`) already.\r\n\r\n### Recommended action\r\n\r\nThe best option is update logging queries to use the integer values of status codes. While this may cause some difficulty writing queries across multiple ASP.NET Core versions right now, we believe that using integers for this purpose is much more flexible for querying logs. \r\n\r\nIf for some reason you need to force compatibility with the old behavior, and use textual status codes, you can do this by replacing `IHttpClientFactory`'s logging with your own.\r\n\r\n1. Copy the 3.1 versions of [LoggingHttpMessageHandlerBuilderFilter](https://github.com/aspnet/Extensions/blob/release/3.1/src/HttpClientFactory/Http/src/Logging/LoggingHttpMessageHandlerBuilderFilter.cs) [LoggingHttpMessageHandler](https://github.com/aspnet/Extensions/blob/release/3.1/src/HttpClientFactory/Http/src/Logging/LoggingHttpMessageHandler.cs) [LoggingScopeHttpMessageHandler](https://github.com/aspnet/Extensions/blob/master/src/HttpClientFactory/Http/src/Logging/LoggingScopeHttpMessageHandler.cs) and [HttpHeadersLogValue](https://github.com/aspnet/Extensions/blob/master/src/HttpClientFactory/Http/src/Logging/HttpHeadersLogValue.cs) into your project.\r\n\r\n2. Rename these types to avoid conflicts with public types in the `Microsoft.Extensions.Http` package\r\n\r\n3. Replace the built-in implementation of `LoggingHttpMessageHandlerBuilderFilter` with your own inside `Startup.Configure(IServiceProvider services)`\r\n\r\n```cs\r\n        public void ConfigureServices(IServiceCollection services)\r\n        {\r\n            // other service registrations go first\r\n            ....\r\n\r\n            // place after all AddHttpClient registrations\r\n            var descriptors = services.Where(s => s.ServiceType == typeof(IHttpMessageHandlerBuilderFilter));\r\n            foreach (var descriptor in descriptors)\r\n            {\r\n                services.Remove(descriptor);\r\n            }\r\n\r\n            services.AddSingleton<IHttpMessageHandlerBuilderFilter, MyLoggingHttpMessageHandlerBuilderFilter>();\r\n        }\r\n\r\n```\r\n\r\n### Category\r\n\r\nASP.NET\r\n\r\n### Affected APIs\r\n\r\nNot detectable via API analysis\r\n\r\n<!-- Do not modify anything below this line -->\r\n\r\n---\r\n#### Issue metadata\r\n\r\n* Issue type: breaking-change\r\n","Url":"https://github.com/aspnet/Announcements/issues/396","RelatedDescription":"Open issue \"HttpClient instances created by IHttpClientFactory will now log HTTP status codes as integers instead of with status code names\" (#396)"},{"Id":"528274635","IsPullRequest":false,"CreatedAt":"2019-11-25T18:56:51","Actor":"Tratcher","Number":"395","RawContent":null,"Title":"Static File CSV Content-Type Changed to \"text/csv\"","State":"open","Body":"## Static File CSV Content-Type Changed to \"text/csv\"\r\n\r\nThe default Content-Type that StaticFiles uses for `.csv` files is being changed to be the standards compliant value `text/csv`.\r\n\r\nSee https://github.com/aspnet/AspNetCore/issues/17385 for questions and discussion.\r\n\r\n### Version introduced\r\n\r\n5.0\r\n\r\n### Old behavior\r\n\r\nThe Content-Type `application/octet-stream` was used.\r\n\r\n### New behavior\r\n\r\nThe Content-Type `text/csv` is used.\r\n\r\n### Reason for change\r\n\r\nThis complies with [RFC 7111](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc7111#section-5.1).\r\n\r\n### Recommended action\r\n\r\nIf this change impacts your application then the Content-Type mapping can be customized as documented [here](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/aspnet/core/fundamentals/static-files?view=aspnetcore-3.0#fileextensioncontenttypeprovider).\r\n\r\n### Category\r\n\r\nASP.NET\r\n\r\n### Affected APIs\r\n\r\n[FileExtensionContentTypeProvider](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/api/microsoft.aspnetcore.staticfiles.fileextensioncontenttypeprovider?view=aspnetcore-3.0)\r\n\r\n<!-- Do not modify anything below this line -->\r\n\r\n---\r\n#### Issue metadata\r\n\r\n* Issue type: breaking-change\r\n","Url":"https://github.com/aspnet/Announcements/issues/395","RelatedDescription":"Open issue \"Static File CSV Content-Type Changed to \"text/csv\"\" (#395)"},{"Id":"522353373","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2019-11-18T22:17:32","Actor":"timheuer","Number":"394","RawContent":null,"Title":"Adding BC notification workflow","State":"closed","Body":"This adds a simple workflow for the .NET team to better monitor breaking change notifications.\r\n\r\n# Summary\r\nAs a part of the triage and communication process for our partners working on .NET-related products we are automating some breaking-change notification.

OutOfProcess changed to automatically add the ASPNETCORE_HTTPS_PORT environment variable which affected both 2.2 and 3.0 applications because the OutOfProcess component is shared globally. 2.1 apps are not affected because they use a prior version of AspNetCoreModule by default.\r\n\r\nThe 3.0 version of AspNetCoreModule was recently deployed to Azure Web Sites and some users noticed the that this did affect their 2.2 applications as described above.\r\n\r\n### Reason for change\r\n\r\nImproved 3.0 functionality.\r\n\r\n### Recommended action\r\n\r\nIf you want all clients to use HTTPS then no action is required.

These changes impact remote authentication scenarios like OpenIdConnect and WsFederation which must now opt out by sending SameSite=None. However, SameSite=None breaks on iOS 12 and some older versions of other browsers. The application will need to sniff these versions and omit SameSite.\r\n\r\nFor discussion on this issue see https://github.com/aspnet/AspNetCore/issues/14996.\r\n\r\n### Version introduced\r\n\r\n3.1.0-preview1\r\n\r\n### Old behavior\r\n\r\nSameSite is a [2016 draft standard](https://tools.ietf.org/html/draft-west-first-party-cookies-07#section-4.1) extension to HTTP cookies intended to mitigate cross site request forgery (CSRF). This was originally designed as a feature the servers would opt into by adding the new parameters. ASP.NET Core 2.0 added initial support for SameSite.\r\n\r\n### New behavior\r\n\r\nGoogle is now pushing [a new draft standard](https://tools.ietf.org/html/draft-west-cookie-incrementalism-00) that is not backwards compatible. It changes the default mode to Lax and adds a new entry None to opt out. Lax is OK for most application cookies but breaks cross site scenarios like OpenIdConnect and WsFederation login. Most OAuth logins are not affected due to differences in how the request flows. The new None parameter causes compatibility problems with clients that implemented the prior draft standard (e.g. iOS 12). Chrome plans to go live with their changes in Chrome 80 in February 2020.\r\n\r\nASP.NET Core 3.1 has been [updated](https://github.com/aspnet/AspNetCore/pull/13776/files) to implement the new SameSite behavior. This includes redefining the behavior of SameSiteMode.None to emit “SameSite=None” and adding a new value SameSiteMode.Unspecified to omit the SameSite attribute. All cookies APIs now default to Unspecified, though some components that use cookies set values more specific to their scenarios such as the OpenIdConnect correlation and nonce cookies.\r\n\r\nFor other recent changes in this area see the [3.0 announcement](https://github.com/aspnet/Announcements/issues/348) where most defaults were changed from Lax to None (but still using the prior standard).\r\n\r\n### Reason for change\r\n\r\nBrowser and spec changes as outlined above.\r\n\r\n### Recommended action\r\n\r\nApplications that interact with remote sites such as through 3rd party login will need to test those scenarios on multiple browsers, as well as apply the CookiePolicy browser sniffing mitigation discussed below. See below for testing and browser sniffing instructions.\r\nHow to test if you’re affected \r\nTest your web application using a client version that can opt-in to the new behavior. Chrome, Firefox, and Chromium Edge all have new opt-in feature flags that can be used for testing. \r\nYou’ll also want to do compatibility testing with older client versions after you’ve applied the patches, especially Safari. See “Supporting older browsers” below. \r\n \r\nChrome:\r\nChrome 78+ will give you misleading test results as it has a temporary mitigation in place, allowing cookies less than two minutes old. Chrome 76 or 77 with the appropriate test flags turned on will give you more accurate results. To test the new behavior toggle chrome://flags/#same-site-by-default-cookies to enabled. Older versions of Chrome (75 and below) are reported to fail with the new None setting. See “Supporting older browsers” below. \r\nWhilst Google does not make older chrome versions available you can download older versions of Chromium which will suffice for testing. Follow the instructions at https://www.chromium.org/getting-involved/download-chromium, don’t go downloading random assed installers from the internet that say they’re for older versions.  \r\n[Chromium 76 Win64 ](https://commondatastorage.googleapis.com/chromium-browser-snapshots/index.html?prefix=Win_x64/664998/)\r\n[Chromium 74 Win64](https://commondatastorage.googleapis.com/chromium-browser-snapshots/index.html?prefix=Win_x64/638880/)\r\n\r\nSafari:\r\nSafari 12 strictly implemented the prior draft and will fail if it sees the new None value in cookies. This must be avoided via the browser sniffing code shown below. Ensure you test Safari 12 and Safari 13 as well as WebKit based OS style logins using MSAL, ADAL or whatever library you are using. Note that the problem is dependent on the underlying OS version, OSX Mojave (10.14) and iOS 12 are known to have compatibility problems with the new behavior. Upgrading the OS to OSX Catalina (10.15) or iOS 13 fixes the problem. Safari does not currently have an opt-in flag for testing the new spec behavior. \r\n\r\nFirefox:\r\nFirefox support for the new standard can be tested on version 68+ by opting in on the “about:config” page with the feature flag “network.cookie.sameSite.laxByDefault”. There have not been reports of compatibility issues with older versions of Firefox. \r\n\r\nEdge:\r\nWhile Edge supports the old SameSite standard, as of version 44 it did not have any compatibility problems with the new standard. \r\n\r\nEdge (Chromium):\r\nThe feature flag is edge://flags/#same-site-by-default-cookies. No compatibility issues were observed when testing with Edge Chromium 78. \r\n\r\nElectron:\r\nVersions of electron will include older versions of Chromium, for example the version of Electron used by Teams is Chromium 66 which exhibits the older behavior. You must perform your own compatibility testing with the version of Electron your product uses. See “Supporting older browsers” below. \r\n\r\nSupporting older browsers:\r\nThe 2016 SameSite standard mandated that unknown values must be treated as SameSite=Strict values, so any older browsers which support the original standard may break when they see a SameSite property with a value of None. Web applications must implement browser sniffing if they intend to support these old browsers. AspNetCore as a rule does not implement browser sniffing for you because User-Agents values are highly unstable and change on a weekly basis. What is available is an extension point in CookiePolicy allowing you to plug in User-Agent specific logic. \r\n\r\nIn Startup.cs add the following\r\n```\r\nprivate void CheckSameSite(HttpContext httpContext, CookieOptions options) \r\n{ \r\n    if (options.SameSite == SameSiteMode.None) \r\n    { \r\n        var userAgent = httpContext.Request.Headers[\"User-Agent\"].ToString(); \r\n        // TODO: Use your User Agent library of choice here. \r\n        if (/* UserAgent doesn’t support new behavior */) \r\n        { \r\n               options.SameSite = SameSiteMode.Unspecified; \r\n        } \r\n    } \r\n}\r\n\r\npublic void ConfigureServices(IServiceCollection services) \r\n{ \r\n    services.Configure<CookiePolicyOptions>(options => \r\n    { \r\n        options.MinimumSameSitePolicy = SameSiteMode.Unspecified; \r\n        options.OnAppendCookie = cookieContext =>  \r\n            CheckSameSite(cookieContext.Context, cookieContext.CookieOptions); \r\n        options.OnDeleteCookie = cookieContext =>  \r\n            CheckSameSite(cookieContext.Context, cookieContext.CookieOptions); \r\n    }); \r\n} \r\n \r\npublic void Configure(IApplicationBuilder app) \r\n{ \r\n    app.UseCookiePolicy(); // Before UseAuthentication or anything else that writes cookies. \r\n    app.UseAuthentication(); \r\n    // … \r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nOpt-out switches:\r\nThere is a compat switch which enables you to temporarily opt-out of the new ASP.NET Core cookie behavior. Add a runtimeconfig.template.json file to your project containing: \r\n```\r\n{ \r\n  \"configProperties\": { \r\n    \"Microsoft.AspNetCore.SuppressSameSiteNone\": \"true\" \r\n  } \r\n} \r\n```\r\nThis switch will be removed in the next major version.\r\n\r\nOther Versions:\r\nRelated SameSite patches are forthcoming for ASP.NET Core 2.1, 2.2, 3.0, Microsoft.Owin 4.1, and System.Web (.NET 4.7.2+).\r\n\r\n### Category\r\n\r\nASP.NET\r\n\r\n### Affected APIs\r\n\r\n[SameSiteMode](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/api/microsoft.aspnetcore.http.samesitemode)\r\n[CookieOptions.SameSite](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/api/microsoft.aspnetcore.http.cookieoptions.samesite)\r\n[CookieBuilder.SameSite](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/api/microsoft.aspnetcore.http.cookiebuilder.samesite)\r\n[CookiePolicyOptions.MinimumSameSitePolicy](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/api/microsoft.aspnetcore.builder.cookiepolicyoptions.minimumsamesitepolicy) \r\n\r\nMicrosoft.Net.Http.Headers:\r\n[SameSiteMode](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/api/microsoft.net.http.headers.samesitemode)\r\n[SetCookieHeaderValue.SameSite](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/api/microsoft.net.http.headers.setcookieheadervalue.samesite)\r\n\r\n<!-- Do not modify anything below this line -->\r\n\r\n---\r\n#### Issue metadata\r\n\r\n* Issue type: breaking-change\r\n","Url":"https://github.com/aspnet/Announcements/issues/390","RelatedDescription":"Open issue \"Reacting to browser SameSite changes in 3.1.0-preview1, impacts OpenIdConnect\" (#390)"},{"Id":"496088190","IsPullRequest":false,"CreatedAt":"2019-09-20T00:47:11","Actor":"rynowak","Number":"389","RawContent":null,"Title":"JsonResult has moved to the Microsoft.AspNetCore.Mvc.Core assembly","State":"open","Body":"## JsonResult has moved to the Microsoft.AspNetCore.Mvc.Core assembly\r\n\r\nJsonResult has moved to the `Microsoft.AspNetCore.Mvc.Core` assembly.

When you add a dependency on `Microsoft.AspNetCore.Mvc` in your project, you're taking a transitive dependency on `Microsoft.AspNetCore.Mvc.Core`.\r\n\r\nAny application that has a direct or transitive dependency on the [affected package](#affected-software) can be exposed to the vulnerability if it does not meet any of the [mitigation factors](#mitigation-factors).\r\n\r\n### <a name=\"how-fix\"></a>How do I fix the issue?\r\n\r\nTo fix the issue please install the latest version of .NET Core. If you have multiple versions of .NET Core installed you will need to install multiple runtimes, or SDKs depending on what you have installed.\r\n\r\nIf you have .NET Core 2.0 or greater installed, you can list the versions you have installed by running the `dotnet --info` command. You will see output like the following;\r\n\r\n```\r\n.NET Core SDK (reflecting any global.json):\r\n Version:   3.0.100-preview3-010431\r\n Commit:    d72abce213\r\n\r\nRuntime Environment:\r\n OS Name:     Windows\r\n OS Version:  10.0.18362\r\n OS Platform: Windows\r\n RID:         win10-x64\r\n Base Path:   C:\\Program Files\\dotnet\\sdk\\3.0.100-preview3-010431\\\r\n\r\nHost (useful for support):\r\n  Version: 3.0.0-preview3-27503-5\r\n  Commit:  3844df9537\r\n\r\n.NET Core SDKs installed:\r\n  2.1.604 [C:\\Program Files\\dotnet\\sdk]\r\n  2.2.202 [C:\\Program Files\\dotnet\\sdk]\r\n  3.0.100-preview3-010431 [C:\\Program Files\\dotnet\\sdk]\r\n\r\n.NET Core runtimes installed:\r\n  Microsoft.AspNetCore.All 2.1.11 [C:\\Program Files\\dotnet\\shared\\Microsoft.AspNetCore.All]\\\r\n  Microsoft.AspNetCore.All 2.2.3 [C:\\Program Files\\dotnet\\shared\\Microsoft.AspNetCore.All]\r\n  Microsoft.AspNetCore.App 2.1.11 [C:\\Program Files\\dotnet\\shared\\Microsoft.AspNetCore.App]\r\n  Microsoft.AspNetCore.App 2.2.3 [C:\\Program Files\\dotnet\\shared\\Microsoft.AspNetCore.App]\r\n  Microsoft.AspNetCore.App 3.0.0-preview3-19153-02 [C:\\Program Files\\dotnet\\shared\\Microsoft.AspNetCore.App]\r\n  Microsoft.NETCore.App 2.1.11 [C:\\Program Files\\dotnet\\shared\\Microsoft.NETCore.App]\r\n  Microsoft.NETCore.App 2.2.3 [C:\\Program Files\\dotnet\\shared\\Microsoft.NETCore.App]\r\n  Microsoft.NETCore.App 3.0.0-preview3-27503-5 [C:\\Program Files\\dotnet\\shared\\Microsoft.NETCore.App]\r\n  Microsoft.WindowsDesktop.App 3.0.0-preview3-27504-2 [C:\\Program Files\\dotnet\\shared\\Microsoft.WindowsDesktop.App]\r\n\r\nTo install additional .NET Core runtimes or SDKs:\r\n  https://aka.ms/dotnet-download\r\n```\r\n\r\n* For machines running .NET Core 2.1, you should download Runtime 2.1.13 or SDK 2.1.509 for Visual Studio 2017 or SDK 2.1.606 for Visual Studio 2019 (v16.0) or SDK 2.1.802 for Visual Studio 2019 (v16.2) from https://dotnet.microsoft.com/download/dotnet-core/2.1.\r\n* For machines running .NET Core 2.2, you should download Runtime 2.2.7 or SDK 2.2.109 for Visual Studio 2017 or SDK 2.2.206 for Visual Studio 2019 (v16.0) or SDK 2.2.402 for Visual Studio 2019 (v16.2) from https://dotnet.microsoft.com/download/dotnet-core/2.2.\r\n\r\nIf you have both 2.1 and 2.2, you need to install updates for both versions.\r\n\r\nOnce you have installed the updated runtime or SDK, restart your apps for the update to take effect.\r\n\r\nIf you have [pinned your application](https://docs.microsoft.com/dotnet/core/versions/selection) to a specific version of the runtime, you must update your app, recompile and redeploy it for the update to take effect.\r\n\r\nThe affected assemblies are also available separately as a NuGet package. Even if you are not using `Microsoft.AspNetCore.DataProtection.AzureStorage.dll` or `Microsoft.Data.OData` directly you may still be affected if either package is a transitive dependency.\r\n\r\n#### Direct dependencies\r\n\r\nDirect dependencies are discoverable by examining your `csproj` file. They can be fixed by [editing the project file](#fixing-direct-dependencies) or using NuGet to update the dependency.\r\n\r\n#### Transitive dependencies\r\n\r\nTransitive dependencies occur when you add a package to your project that in turn relies on another package. For example, if Contoso publishes a package `Contoso.Utility` which, in turn, depends on `Contoso.Internals` and you add the `Contoso.Utility` package to your project now your project has a direct dependency on `Contoso.Utility` and, because `Contoso.Utility` depends on `Contoso.Internals`, your application gains a transitive dependency on the `Contoso.Internals` package.\r\n\r\nTransitive dependencies are reviewable in two ways:\r\n\r\n* In the Visual Studio Solution Explorer window, which supports searching.\r\n* By examining the `project.assets.json` file contained in the obj directory of your project for `csproj` based projects\r\n\r\nThe `project.assets.json` files are the authoritative list of all packages used by your project, containing both direct and transitive dependencies.\r\n\r\nThere are two ways to view transitive dependencies. You can either [use Visual Studio’s Solution Explorer](#vs-solution-explorer), or you can review [the `project.assets.json` file](#project-assets-json)).\r\n\r\n##### <a name=\"vs-solution-explorer\"></a>Using Visual Studio Solution Explorer\r\n\r\nTo use Solution Explorer, open the project in Visual Studio, and then press Ctrl+; to activate the search in Solution Explorer. Search for the [vulnerable package](#affected-software) and make a note of the version numbers of any results you find.\r\n\r\nFor example, searching for `Microsoft.AspNetCore.Mvc.Core` in an example project that contains a package that takes a dependency on `Microsoft.AspNetCore.Mvc` shows the following results in Visual Studio 2017:\r\n\r\n![Screenshot of search results in Visual Studio 2017](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/796298/25858816/8ecdc2b4-3491-11e7-9363-746804bb9832.png)\r\n\r\nThe search results appear as a tree. In the previous results, you can see that a reference to `Microsoft.AspNetCore.Mvc.Core` version 1.1.2 is discovered.\r\n\r\nUnder the Dependencies node is a NuGet node. Under the NuGet node is the list of packages you have directly taken a dependency on and their versions.\r\nIn screenshot, the application takes a direct dependency on `Microsoft.AspNetCore.Mvc`. `Microsoft.AspNetCore.Mvc` in turn has leaf nodes that list its dependencies and their versions.\r\nThe `Microsoft.AspNetCore.Mvc` package takes a dependency on a version of `Microsoft.AspNetCore.Mvc.ApiExplorer`, that in turn takes a dependency on a version of `Microsoft.AspNetCore.Mvc.Core`.\r\n\r\n##### <a name=\"project-assets-json\"></a> Manually reviewing project.assets.json\r\n\r\nOpen the *project.assets.json* file from your project’s obj directory in your editor. We suggest you use an editor that understands JSON and allows you to collapse and expand nodes to review this file.\r\nVisual Studio and Visual Studio Code provide JSON friendly editing.\r\n\r\nSearch the *project.assets.json* file for the [vulnerable package](#affected-software), using the format `packagename/` for each of the package names from the preceding table. If you find the assembly name in your search:\r\n\r\n* Examine the line on which they are found, the version number is after the `/`.\r\n* Compare to the [vulnerable versions table](#affected-software).\r\n\r\nFor example, a search result that shows `Microsoft.AspNetCore.DataProtection.AzureStorage.dll/2.1.1` is a reference to version 2.1.1 of `Microsoft.AspNetCore.DataProtection.AzureStorage.dll`.\r\n\r\nIf your *project.assets.json* file includes references to the [vulnerable package](#affected-software), then you need to fix the transitive dependencies.\r\n\r\nIf you have not found any reference to any vulnerable packages, this means either\r\n\r\n* None of your direct dependencies depend on any vulnerable packages, or\r\n* You have already fixed the problem by updating the direct dependencies.\r\n\r\n### <a name=\"how-fix\"></a>How do I fix the issue?\r\n\r\n#### <a name=\"fixing-direct-dependencies\"></a>Fixing direct dependencies\r\n\r\nOpen *projectname.csproj* in your editor. If you're using Visual Studio, right-click the project and choose **Edit projectname.csproj** from the context menu, where projectname is the name of your project. Look for `PackageReference` elements. The following shows an example project file:\r\n\r\n```xml\r\n<Project Sdk=\"Microsoft.NET.Sdk.Web\">\r\n  <PropertyGroup>\r\n    <TargetFramework>netcoreapp2.1</TargetFramework>\r\n  </PropertyGroup>\r\n  <ItemGroup>\r\n    <PackageReference Include=\"Microsoft.AspNetCore.DataProtection.AzureStorage.dll\" Version=\"2.1.1 />\r\n  </ItemGroup>\r\n</Project>\r\n```\r\n\r\nThe preceding example has a reference to the [vulnerable package](#affected-software), as seen by the single `PackageReference` element. The name of the package is in the `Include` attribute.\r\nThe package version number is in the `Version` attribute. The previous example shows a single direct dependency on `Microsoft.AspNetCore.DataProtection.AzureStorage.dll` version 2.1.1\r\n\r\nTo update the version to the secure package, change the version number to the updated package version as listed on the table [previously](#affected-software).\r\nIn this example, update `Microsoft.AspNetCore.DataProtection.AzureStorage.dll` to the appropriate [fixed package number](#affected-software) for your major version. Save the *csproj* file. The example *csproj* now looks as follows:\r\n\r\n```xml\r\n<Project Sdk=\"Microsoft.NET.Sdk.Web\">\r\n  <PropertyGroup>\r\n    <TargetFramework>netcoreapp2.1</TargetFramework>\r\n  </PropertyGroup>\r\n  <ItemGroup>\r\n    <PackageReference Include=\"Microsoft.AspNetCore.DataProtection.AzureStorage.dll\" Version=\"2.1.2\" />\r\n  </ItemGroup>\r\n</Project>\r\n```\r\n\r\nIf you're using Visual Studio and you save your updated *csproj* file, Visual Studio will restore the new package version.\r\nYou can see the restore results by opening the **Output** window (Ctrl+Alt+O) and changing the **Show output from** drop-down list to **Package Manager**.\r\n\r\nIf you're not using Visual Studio, open a command line and change to your project directory. Execute the `dotnet restore` command to restore the updated dependencies.\r\n\r\nNow recompile your application. If after recompilation you see a *Dependency conflict warning*, you must update your other direct dependencies to versions that take a dependency on the updated package.\r\n\r\n#### <a name=\"transitive-dependencies\"></a>Fixing transitive dependencies\r\n\r\nIf your transitive dependency review found references to the [vulnerable package](#affected-software), you must add a direct dependency to the updated package to your *csproj* file to override the transitive dependency.\r\n\r\nOpen *projectname.csproj* in your editor. If you're using Visual Studio, right-click the project and choose **Edit projectname.csproj** from the context menu, where projectname is the name of your project.\r\nLook for `PackageReference` nodes, for example:\r\n\r\n```xml\r\n<Project Sdk=\"Microsoft.NET.Sdk.\">\r\n  <PropertyGroup>\r\n    <TargetFramework>net461</TargetFramework>\r\n  </PropertyGroup>\r\n  <ItemGroup>\r\n    <PackageReference Include=\"ThirdParty.NotUpdatedYet\" Version=\"2.0.0\" />\r\n  </ItemGroup>\r\n</Project>\r\n```\r\n\r\nYou must add a direct dependency to the updated version of the [vulnerable package](#affected-software) by adding it to the *csproj* file.\r\nYou do this by adding a new line to the dependencies section, referencing the fixed version.\r\nFor example, if your search showed a transitive reference to a vulnerable `Microsoft.AspNetCore.DataProtection.AzureStorage.dll` version, you'd add a reference to the [fixed package number](#affected-software).\r\n\r\n```xml\r\n<Project Sdk=\"Microsoft.NET.Sdk.Web\">\r\n  <PropertyGroup>\r\n    <TargetFramework>net461</TargetFramework>\r\n  </PropertyGroup>\r\n  <ItemGroup>\r\n    <PackageReference Include=\"Microsoft.AspNetCore.DataProtection.AzureStorage.dll\" Version=\"2.1.2\" />\r\n    <PackageReference Include=\"ThirdParty.NotUpdatedYet\" Version=\"2.0.0\" />\r\n  </ItemGroup>\r\n</Project>\r\n```\r\n\r\nAfter you've added the direct dependency reference, save your *csproj* file.\r\n\r\nIf you're using Visual Studio, save your updated *csproj* file and Visual Studio will restore the new package versions.\r\nYou can see the restore results by opening the **Output** window (Ctrl+Alt+O) and changing the **Show output from** drop-down list to **Package Manager**.\r\n\r\nIf you're not using Visual Studio, open a command line and change to your project directory. Execute the `dotnet restore` command to restore the new dependencies.\r\n\r\n##### Rebuilding your application\r\n\r\nFinally, you must rebuild your application, test, and redeploy.\r\n\r\n# Other Information\r\n\r\n### Reporting Security Issues\r\n\r\nIf you have found a potential security issue in .NET Core, please email details to secure@microsoft.com.

This advisory also provides guidance on what developers can do to update their applications to remove this vulnerability.\r\n\r\nMicrosoft is aware of an elevation of privilege vulnerability exists when a ASP.NET Core web application, created using vulnerable project templates, fails to properly sanitize web requests. An attacker who successfully exploited this vulnerability could perform content injection attacks and run script in the security context of the logged-on user.\r\n\r\nTo exploit the vulnerability, an attacker could send a specially crafted email, containing a malicious link, to a user. Alternatively, an attacker could use a chat client to social engineer a user into clicking the malicious link. However, in all cases to exploit this vulnerability a user must click a maliciously crafted link from an attacker.\r\n\r\nThe update addresses the vulnerability by correcting how the .NET Core web application handles content encoding and updates the application templates to depend on the corrected code libraries.\r\n\r\n## Discussion\r\n\r\nDiscussion for this issue can be found at https://github.com/aspnet/AspNetCore/issues/13859\r\n\r\n## <a name=\"mitigation-factors\"></a>Mitigation factors\r\n\r\nIf your application does not ASP.NET SPA services your application is not vulnerable.\r\n\r\n## <a name=\"affected-software\"></a>Affected software\r\n\r\nAny .NET Core based application running on ASP.NET Core 2.1.0-2.1.1, or ASP.NET Core 2.2.0 or any preview of ASP.NET Core 3.0.\r\n\r\n## <a name=\"affected-software\"></a>Affected software\r\n\r\nAny ASP.NET Core based application that uses `Microsoft.AspNetCore.SpaServices` with a vulnerable version listed below.\r\n\r\nPackage name | Vulnerable versions | Secure versions\r\n------------ | ---------------- | -------------------------\r\nMicrosoft.AspNetCore.SpaServices | 2.1.0-2.1.1 <br /> 2.2.0 | 2.1.2 <br /> 2.2.1\r\n\r\nASP.NET Core v3 will be updated with its RTM release.\r\n\r\n### <a name=\"how-affected\"></a>How do I know if I am affected?\r\n\r\n.NET Core has two types of dependencies: direct and transitive. Direct dependencies are dependencies where you specifically add a package to your project, transitive dependencies occur when you add a package to your project that in turn relies on another package.\r\n\r\nFor example, the `Microsoft.AspNetCore.Mvc` package depends on the `Microsoft.AspNetCore.Mvc.Core` package. When you add a dependency on `Microsoft.AspNetCore.Mvc` in your project, you're taking a transitive dependency on `Microsoft.AspNetCore.Mvc.Core`.\r\n\r\nAny application that has a direct or transitive dependency on the [affected package](#affected-software) can be exposed to the vulnerability if it does not meet any of the [mitigation factors](#mitigation-factors).\r\n\r\n### <a name=\"how-fix\"></a>How do I fix the issue?\r\n\r\nTo fix the issue please install the latest version of .NET Core. If you have multiple versions of .NET Core installed you will need to install multiple runtimes, or SDKs depending on what you have installed.\r\n\r\nIf you have .NET Core 2.0 or greater installed, you can list the versions you have installed by running the `dotnet --info` command. You will see output like the following;\r\n\r\n```\r\n.NET Core SDK (reflecting any global.json):\r\n Version:   3.0.100-preview3-010431\r\n Commit:    d72abce213\r\n\r\nRuntime Environment:\r\n OS Name:     Windows\r\n OS Version:  10.0.18362\r\n OS Platform: Windows\r\n RID:         win10-x64\r\n Base Path:   C:\\Program Files\\dotnet\\sdk\\3.0.100-preview3-010431\\\r\n\r\nHost (useful for support):\r\n  Version: 3.0.0-preview3-27503-5\r\n  Commit:  3844df9537\r\n\r\n.NET Core SDKs installed:\r\n  2.1.604 [C:\\Program Files\\dotnet\\sdk]\r\n  2.2.202 [C:\\Program Files\\dotnet\\sdk]\r\n  3.0.100-preview3-010431 [C:\\Program Files\\dotnet\\sdk]\r\n\r\n.NET Core runtimes installed:\r\n  Microsoft.AspNetCore.All 2.1.11 [C:\\Program Files\\dotnet\\shared\\Microsoft.AspNetCore.All]\\\r\n  Microsoft.AspNetCore.All 2.2.3 [C:\\Program Files\\dotnet\\shared\\Microsoft.AspNetCore.All]\r\n  Microsoft.AspNetCore.App 2.1.11 [C:\\Program Files\\dotnet\\shared\\Microsoft.AspNetCore.App]\r\n  Microsoft.AspNetCore.App 2.2.3 [C:\\Program Files\\dotnet\\shared\\Microsoft.AspNetCore.App]\r\n  Microsoft.AspNetCore.App 3.0.0-preview3-19153-02 [C:\\Program Files\\dotnet\\shared\\Microsoft.AspNetCore.App]\r\n  Microsoft.NETCore.App 2.1.11 [C:\\Program Files\\dotnet\\shared\\Microsoft.NETCore.App]\r\n  Microsoft.NETCore.App 2.2.3 [C:\\Program Files\\dotnet\\shared\\Microsoft.NETCore.App]\r\n  Microsoft.NETCore.App 3.0.0-preview3-27503-5 [C:\\Program Files\\dotnet\\shared\\Microsoft.NETCore.App]\r\n  Microsoft.WindowsDesktop.App 3.0.0-preview3-27504-2 [C:\\Program Files\\dotnet\\shared\\Microsoft.WindowsDesktop.App]\r\n\r\nTo install additional .NET Core runtimes or SDKs:\r\n  https://aka.ms/dotnet-download\r\n```\r\n\r\n* For machines running .NET Core 2.1, you should download Runtime 2.1.13 or SDK 2.1.509 for Visual Studio 2017 or SDK 2.1.606 for Visual Studio 2019 (v16.0) or SDK 2.1.802 for Visual Studio 2019 (v16.2) from https://dotnet.microsoft.com/download/dotnet-core/2.1.\r\n* For machines running .NET Core 2.2, you should download Runtime 2.2.7 or SDK 2.2.109 for Visual Studio 2017 or SDK 2.2.206 for Visual Studio 2019 (v16.0) or SDK 2.2.402 for Visual Studio 2019 (v16.2) from https://dotnet.microsoft.com/download/dotnet-core/2.2.\r\n\r\nIf you have both 2.1 and 2.2, you need to install updates for both versions.\r\n\r\nOnce you have installed the updated runtime or SDK, restart your apps for the update to take effect.\r\n\r\nIf you have [pinned your application](https://docs.microsoft.com/dotnet/core/versions/selection) to a specific version of the runtime, you must update your app, recompile and redeploy it for the update to take effect.\r\n\r\nYou must now update your existing SPA services projects to use the newer version of the vulnerable packages.\r\n\r\n#### Direct dependencies\r\n\r\nDirect dependencies are discoverable by examining your `csproj` file. They can be fixed by [editing the project file](#fixing-direct-dependencies) or using NuGet to update the dependency.\r\n\r\n#### Transitive dependencies\r\n\r\nTransitive dependencies occur when you add a package to your project that in turn relies on another package. For example, if Contoso publishes a package `Contoso.Utility` which, in turn, depends on `Contoso.Internals` and you add the `Contoso.Utility` package to your project now your project has a direct dependency on `Contoso.Utility` and, because `Contoso.Utility` depends 'Contoso.Internals', your application gains a transitive dependency on the `Contoso.Internals` package.\r\n\r\nTransitive dependencies are reviewable in two ways:\r\n\r\n* In the Visual Studio Solution Explorer window, which supports searching.\r\n* By examining the `project.assets.json` file contained in the obj directory of your project for `csproj` based projects\r\n\r\nThe `project.assets.json` files are the authoritative list of all packages used by your project, containing both direct and transitive dependencies.\r\n\r\nThere are two ways to view transitive dependencies. You can either [use Visual Studio’s Solution Explorer](#vs-solution-explorer), or you can review [the `project.assets.json` file](#project-assets-json)).\r\n\r\n##### <a name=\"vs-solution-explorer\"></a>Using Visual Studio Solution Explorer\r\n\r\nTo use Solution Explorer, open the project in Visual Studio, and then press Ctrl+; to activate the search in Solution Explorer. Search for the [vulnerable package](#affected-software) and make a note of the version numbers of any results you find.\r\n\r\nFor example, searching for `Microsoft.AspNetCore.Mvc.Core` in an example project that contains a package that takes a dependency on `Microsoft.AspNetCore.Mvc` shows the following results in Visual Studio 2017:\r\n\r\n![Screenshot of search results in Visual Studio 2017](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/796298/25858816/8ecdc2b4-3491-11e7-9363-746804bb9832.png)\r\n\r\nThe search results appear as a tree. In the previous results, you can see that a reference to `Microsoft.AspNetCore.Mvc.Core` version 1.1.2 is discovered.\r\n\r\nUnder the Dependencies node is a NuGet node. Under the NuGet node is the list of packages you have directly taken a dependency on and their versions.\r\nIn screenshot, the application takes a direct dependency on `Microsoft.AspNetCore.Mvc`. `Microsoft.AspNetCore.Mvc` in turn has leaf nodes that list its dependencies and their versions.\r\nThe `Microsoft.AspNetCore.Mvc` package takes a dependency on a version of `Microsoft.AspNetCore.Mvc.ApiExplorer`, that in turn takes a dependency on a version of `Microsoft.AspNetCore.Mvc.Core`.\r\n\r\n##### <a name=\"project-assets-json\"></a> Manually reviewing project.assets.json\r\n\r\nOpen the *project.assets.json* file from your project’s obj directory in your editor. We suggest you use an editor that understands JSON and allows you to collapse and expand nodes to review this file.\r\nVisual Studio and Visual Studio Code provide JSON friendly editing.\r\n\r\nSearch the *project.assets.json* file for the [vulnerable package](#affected-software), using the format `packagename/` for each of the package names from the preceding table. If you find the assembly name in your search:\r\n\r\n* Examine the line on which they are found, the version number is after the `/`.\r\n* Compare to the [vulnerable versions table](#affected-software).\r\n\r\nFor example, a search result that shows `Microsoft.AspNetCore.SpaServices/2.1.0` is a reference to version 2.1.1 of `Microsoft.AspNetCore.SpaServices`.\r\n\r\nIf your *project.assets.json* file includes references to the [vulnerable package](#affected-software), then you need to fix the transitive dependencies.\r\n\r\nIf you have not found any reference to any vulnerable packages, this means either\r\n\r\n* None of your direct dependencies depend on any vulnerable packages, or\r\n* You have already fixed the problem by updating the direct dependencies.\r\n\r\n### <a name=\"how-fix\"></a>How do I fix the issue?\r\n\r\n#### <a name=\"fixing-direct-dependencies\"></a>Fixing direct dependencies\r\n\r\nOpen *projectname.csproj* in your editor. If you're using Visual Studio, right-click the project and choose **Edit projectname.csproj** from the context menu, where projectname is the name of your project. Look for `PackageReference` elements. The following shows an example project file:\r\n\r\n```xml\r\n<Project Sdk=\"Microsoft.NET.Sdk.Web\">\r\n  <PropertyGroup>\r\n    <TargetFramework>netcoreapp2.1</TargetFramework>\r\n  </PropertyGroup>\r\n  <ItemGroup>\r\n    <PackageReference Include=\"Microsoft.AspNetCore.SpaServices\" Version=\"2.1.1 />\r\n  </ItemGroup>\r\n</Project>\r\n```\r\n\r\nThe preceding example has a reference to the [vulnerable package](#affected-software), as seen by the single `PackageReference` element. The name of the package is in the `Include` attribute.\r\nThe package version number is in the `Version` attribute. The previous example shows a single direct dependency on `Microsoft.AspNetCore.DataProtection.AzureStorage.dll` version 2.1.1\r\n\r\nTo update the version to the secure package, change the version number to the updated package version as listed on the table [previously](#affected-software).\r\nIn this example, update `Microsoft.AspNetCore.SpaServices` to the appropriate [fixed package number](#affected-software) for your major version. Save the *csproj* file. The example *csproj* now looks as follows:\r\n\r\n```xml\r\n<Project Sdk=\"Microsoft.NET.Sdk.Web\">\r\n  <PropertyGroup>\r\n    <TargetFramework>netcoreapp2.1</TargetFramework>\r\n  </PropertyGroup>\r\n  <ItemGroup>\r\n    <PackageReference Include=\"Microsoft.AspNetCore.SpaServices\" Version=\"2.1.2\" />\r\n  </ItemGroup>\r\n</Project>\r\n```\r\n\r\nIf you're using Visual Studio and you save your updated *csproj* file, Visual Studio will restore the new package version.\r\nYou can see the restore results by opening the **Output** window (Ctrl+Alt+O) and changing the **Show output from** drop-down list to **Package Manager**.\r\n\r\nIf you're not using Visual Studio, open a command line and change to your project directory. Execute the `dotnet restore` command to restore the updated dependencies.\r\n\r\nNow recompile your application. If after recompilation you see a *Dependency conflict warning*, you must update your other direct dependencies to versions that take a dependency on the updated package.\r\n\r\n#### <a name=\"transitive-dependencies\"></a>Fixing transitive dependencies\r\n\r\nIf your transitive dependency review found references to the [vulnerable package](#affected-software), you must add a direct dependency to the updated package to your *csproj* file to override the transitive dependency.\r\n\r\nOpen *projectname.csproj* in your editor. If you're using Visual Studio, right-click the project and choose **Edit projectname.csproj** from the context menu, where projectname is the name of your project.\r\nLook for `PackageReference` nodes, for example:\r\n\r\n```xml\r\n<Project Sdk=\"Microsoft.NET.Sdk.\">\r\n  <PropertyGroup>\r\n    <TargetFramework>net461</TargetFramework>\r\n  </PropertyGroup>\r\n  <ItemGroup>\r\n    <PackageReference Include=\"ThirdParty.NotUpdatedYet\" Version=\"2.0.0\" />\r\n  </ItemGroup>\r\n</Project>\r\n```\r\n\r\nYou must add a direct dependency to the updated version of the [vulnerable package](#affected-software) by adding it to the *csproj* file.\r\nYou do this by adding a new line to the dependencies section, referencing the fixed version.\r\nFor example, if your search showed a transitive reference to a vulnerable `Microsoft.AspNetCore.SpaServices` version, you'd add a reference to the [fixed package number](#affected-software).\r\n\r\n```xml\r\n<Project Sdk=\"Microsoft.NET.Sdk.Web\">\r\n  <PropertyGroup>\r\n    <TargetFramework>net461</TargetFramework>\r\n  </PropertyGroup>\r\n  <ItemGroup>\r\n    <PackageReference Include=\"Microsoft.AspNetCore.SpaServices\" Version=\"2.1.2\" />\r\n    <PackageReference Include=\"ThirdParty.NotUpdatedYet\" Version=\"2.0.0\" />\r\n  </ItemGroup>\r\n</Project>\r\n```\r\n\r\nAfter you've added the direct dependency reference, save your *csproj* file.\r\n\r\nIf you're using Visual Studio, save your updated *csproj* file and Visual Studio will restore the new package versions.\r\nYou can see the restore results by opening the **Output** window (Ctrl+Alt+O) and changing the **Show output from** drop-down list to **Package Manager**.\r\n\r\nIf you're not using Visual Studio, open a command line and change to your project directory.

Unfortunately, we missed a critical design flaw which prevents this from working end-to-end.\r\n\r\nTrying to invoke build on a project with a `Counter` component that looked like the following would result in a build error:\r\n```Razor\r\n<Counter @ref=\"myCounter\" />\r\n\r\n@code {\r\n    // This will not compile because there will be no backing field for myCounter\r\n    private readonly int _incrementingBy = myCounter.IncrementAmount;\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nGiven that we're so close to a 3.0 release, we are going to cut this feature from 3.0. We will think about viable solutions to this in future releases, if we can find one, we may consider it then.\r\n\r\n### The problem deep dive\r\nTo summarize the problem effectively, I need to describe how the Razor compilation process works. It's a two-phase process:\r\n\r\n1. Discovery: All the components and directive attributes are discovered. Razor does this by generating a skeleton of each component file and then introspecting on their structure, we call these files declarations. Basically, any content in your Razor file that isn't a directive or inside of a directive block `@code` is thrown out to avoid compilation errors during this phase.\r\n2. Compiling: The actual Razor file compilation where it uses the inputs resolved in phase 1. This phase utilizes all of discovered components to properly parse HTML elements that look like components and uses all of the discovered directive attributes to properly parse those elements corresponding attributes that look like directive attributes.\r\n\r\nThe process is broken into two phases to enable Components to be written in Razor yet also impact other Razor files in the project. This is why you can write a `Counter.razor` file and still recursively use it in the same `Counter.razor` file.\r\n\r\nThe core problem is that during the `discovery` phase the Razor compiler has no awareness of the available components or directive attributes (it hasn't discovered them yet). This means, the `@ref` attribute and other component's existence is not available in this phase. This introduces a problem because a user may have written code in their `@code` block that references the supposed backing field generated from `@ref`; however, during discovery we didn't know about `@ref` so no backing field was generated. This results in Razor skeleton file that can't be compiled or introspected on (C# errors). We considered working around this limitation by hard coding `@ref` to not require the first phase but quickly found that would not work either because if a user writes `<Counter @ref=\"myCounter\" />` We need to generate a proper type name for the auto-generated backing field (`private Counter myCounter;`) which isn't reliably available because during the discovery phase we haven't yet discovered anything (it's not till phase 2 that we know of `Counter`).\r\n\r\n### Workaround\r\nIn 3.0.0-preview8 in order to utilize the `@ref` attribute you must do:\r\n\r\n```razor\r\n<button @ref=\"myButton\" @ref:suppressField />\r\n@code {\r\n    ElementReference myButton;\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nOnce 3.0.0-preview9 and up ships you will be able to use the older syntax such as:\r\n\r\n```razor\r\n<button @ref=\"myButton\" />\r\n@code {\r\n    ElementReference myButton;\r\n}\r\n```","Url":"https://github.com/aspnet/Announcements/issues/381","RelatedDescription":"Open issue \"[Blazor] Removing automatic backing field support for @ref in 3.0.0-preview9\" (#381)"},{"Id":"480691511","IsPullRequest":false,"CreatedAt":"2019-08-14T13:51:16","Actor":"javiercn","Number":"380","RawContent":null,"Title":"Breaking change Identity UI uses the new static web assets","State":"open","Body":"In ASP.NET Core 3.0 we've moved Identity UI to use the new static web assets feature introduced in 3.0.

If you're using HttpResponse directly you should not need to make any code changes. Read further if you were wrapping or replacing HttpResponse.Body or accessing HttpContext.Features.\r\n\r\nVersion: 3.0.0-preview8\r\n\r\nBackground:\r\nHttpContext, HttpRequest, HttpResponse are backed by an abstraction called [Features](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/aspnet/core/fundamentals/request-features?view=aspnetcore-2.2). This allows functionality to be provided by different components in the pipeline without wrapping the entire HttpContext.\r\n\r\nIn 2.x there are three APIs associated with the response body: IHttpResponseFeature.Body, IHttpSendFileFeature.SendFileAsync, and IHttpBufferingFeature.DisableResponseBuffering, but the later two were rarely implemented or used.\r\n\r\nOver the course of 3.0 several new response body APIs were added:\r\nIHttpResponseBodyPipeFeature\r\nIHttpResponseStartFeature.StartAsync\r\nIHttpResponseCompleteFeature.CompleteAsync\r\n\r\nProblem: With so many APIs it became too hard for middleware to properly intercept the response body. It was also hard for calling code to rely on those features being present on all servers.\r\n\r\nFix: Consolidate the response body APIs onto a single new feature interface [IHttpResponseBodyFeature](https://github.com/aspnet/AspNetCore/blob/4aebd29abca80242f5ff9e89e07d4f1b28788a44/src/Http/Http.Features/src/IHttpResponseBodyFeature.cs). HttpResponse has been updated accordingly, and each server has been updated to provide at least a minimal implementation for all of these APIs. We'll iterate to provide more fully featured implementations in each server but that won't require any more API changes.\r\n\r\nNote if you replace HttpResponse.Body it will now replace the entire IHttpResponseBodyFeature with a wrapper around your given stream using StreamResponseBodyFeature to provide default implementations for all of the expected APIs. Setting back the original stream will undo this change.\r\nhttps://github.com/aspnet/AspNetCore/blob/4aebd29abca80242f5ff9e89e07d4f1b28788a44/src/Http/Http/src/Internal/DefaultHttpResponse.cs#L67-L89\r\n\r\nBreaking change https://github.com/aspnet/AspNetCore/pull/12328\r\n\r\nObsolete existing 2.x APIs\r\nIHttpResponseFeature.Body\r\nIHttpSendFileFeature\r\nIHttpBufferingFeature\r\n\r\nDeleted feature interfaces that were introduced earlier in 3.0.\r\nIHttpResponseBodyPipeFeature\r\nIHttpResponseStartFeature\r\nIHttpResponseCompleteFeature\r\n\r\nIn a future major release we plan to refactor the request body features as well https://github.com/aspnet/AspNetCore/issues/12620.\r\n\r\nSee https://github.com/aspnet/AspNetCore/issues/12635 for discussion.\r\n\r\nThis announcement has been migrated to: dotnet/docs#14832","Url":"https://github.com/aspnet/Announcements/issues/376","RelatedDescription":"Open issue \"HttpResponse body infrastructure changes\" (#376)"},{"Id":"473077311","IsPullRequest":false,"CreatedAt":"2019-07-25T21:25:57","Actor":"HaoK","Number":"375","RawContent":null,"Title":"Breaking change in IAuthorizationPolicyProvider","State":"open","Body":"As part of https://github.com/aspnet/AspNetCore/pull/9759 we added a new method to `IAuthorizationPolicyProvider.GetFallbackPolicyAsync` which is the policy that will be used by the authorization middleware when no policy is specified.\r\n\r\nThis announcement has been migrated to: dotnet/docs#14834","Url":"https://github.com/aspnet/Announcements/issues/375","RelatedDescription":"Open issue \"Breaking change in IAuthorizationPolicyProvider\" (#375)"},{"Id":"472946568","IsPullRequest":false,"CreatedAt":"2019-07-25T15:58:23","Actor":"HaoK","Number":"374","RawContent":null,"Title":"Breaking change in SignInManager constructor (new parameter)","State":"open","Body":"As part of adding support for new email/confirmation flows in Identity(https://github.com/aspnet/AspNetCore/issues/8356), we added a new `IUserConfirmation<TUser>` argument to the constructor of `SignInManager`\r\n\r\nThis announcement has been migrated to: dotnet/docs#14828\r\n","Url":"https://github.com/aspnet/Announcements/issues/374","RelatedDescription":"Open issue \"Breaking change in SignInManager constructor (new parameter)\" (#374)"},{"Id":"465890178","IsPullRequest":false,"CreatedAt":"2019-07-09T17:01:09","Actor":"blowdart","Number":"373","RawContent":null,"Title":"Microsoft Security Advisory CVE-2019-1075: ASP.NET Core Spoofing Vulnerability","State":"open","Body":"# Microsoft Security Advisory CVE-2019-1075: ASP.NET Core Spoofing Vulnerability\r\n\r\n## <a name=\"executive-summary\"></a>Executive summary\r\n\r\nMicrosoft is releasing this security advisory to provide information about a vulnerability in ASP.NET Core 2.1 and 2.2.
