There is a slight issue with _what_ Angular considers a \"change\". If an object reference changes to an object identical to the first one, Angular will update the view with this new object, even if the view ends up being identical to the previous one. This situation is easy for new developers to fall into, as it very easy to write a function like:\r\n```\r\ndivClasses() {\r\n  return {\r\n    red: this.isRed\r\n  };\r\n}\r\n```\r\nand then bind it to an `[ngClass]` directive, which will remove and re-apply the `red` class every change detection call, because `divClasses()` returns a new object every time it is run.\r\n```\r\n<div [ngClass]=\"divClasses()\"></div><!-- This div will be updated every time change detection is ran. -->\r\n```\r\n\r\nThis causes two big problems, the first being inefficient view rendering. Change detection only needs to update the view whenever the component's `isRed` value changes, but it ends up updating the view every single time change detection is run. This would slow down the page and negatively impact the end user's experience.\r\n\r\nThe less obvious problem is the possibility of change detection recursion. If the application has a `MutationObserver` somewhere, watching for DOM changes, the above function will cause it to run every time change detection is ran. If this `MutationObserver` also triggers a change detection check, the page will hang as the `divClasses()` function updates the view, triggering the `MutationObserver`, which triggers change detection again. This might not even directly be the developer's fault, as the `MutationObserver` could be from a 3rd party library.\r\n\r\nI recently spent a day and a half attempting to debug an application hanging in this way. Funnily enough, the problem was made worse by a 3rd party library which modified `console.log` to run change detection - which caused recursion to happen again. Ultimately, I suspect this scenario might be the cause of issues like https://github.com/valor-software/ngx-bootstrap/issues/3047, https://github.com/angular/angular/issues/20450, or https://github.com/angular/angular/issues/24614.\r\n\r\n### Describe the solution you'd like\r\nTo be clear, my proposed \"fix\" does *NOT* involve modifying Angular's change detection to deeply compare object references. Discussion on this bug: https://github.com/angular/angular/issues/24614 was ultimately tabled because the proposed fix involved deep equality checks, which would be inefficient and very time consuming to check larger objects.\r\n\r\nUltimately, the issue here seems to be with functions like my example `divClasses()`, which inadvertently abuse change detection to unnecessarily update the view. If there was some way to alert the developer that a function they've written was possibly faulty, that would probably be the way to go.\r\n\r\nCurrently, Angular displays warnings for change detection when the application is running in dev mode for a similar scenario. If change detection itself causes a property/function to change its output, Angular currently displays a warning about what happened. Could it be possible to display a similar warning for whenever a function returns a different object reference on subsequent change detection calls? A reference check would not be very expensive, and this may end up helping the application developer optimize their program.","Url":"https://github.com/angular/angular/issues/27804","RelatedDescription":"Open issue \"DEV mode change detection - Show warning if object reference changes in subsequent check\" (#27804)"},{"Id":"393520702","IsPullRequest":false,"CreatedAt":"2018-12-21T16:40:26","Actor":"ydomenjoud","Number":"27803","RawContent":null,"Title":"component implements ControlValueAccessor still connected to ngForm after destroy","State":"open","Body":"\r\n# üêû bug report\r\n\r\n### Affected Package\r\nThe issue is caused by package @angular/forms\r\n\r\n### Is this a regression?\r\nI don't know if this had work before.\r\n\r\n### Description\r\nWhen a component implementing ControlValueAccessor is destroyed, writeValue is still called on patchValue for example.

When I use mouse wheel to scroll down with the cursor in the viewport, after the item list in the viewport reaches bottom, if I continue scroll down on my mouse, the webpage will start to move up. But on Windows' chrome v70, after the items list has reached the bottom, I need to scroll down multiple times on my mousewheel to let the webpage start to move up. It feels like you need to scroll 3 times more to reach the bottom. The same happens when I scroll up. I tested on an old windows laptop which runs chrome 63 and that one does not have such behavior. I'm not sure this is a Chrome issue or library issue.\r\n\r\n#### What are the steps to reproduce?\r\nProviding a StackBlitz reproduction is the *best* way to share your issue. <br/>\r\nhttps://angular-material2-issue-qi74ey.stackblitz.io<br/>\r\n\r\n\r\n#### Which versions of Angular, Material, OS, TypeScript, browsers are affected?\r\ncdk 7.2, windows 10, Chrome 71.0.3578.98\r\n\r\n#### Is there anything else we should know?\r\n","Url":"https://github.com/angular/material2/issues/14628","RelatedDescription":"Open issue \"cdk-virtual-scroll-viewport behaves different in mac's and windows' chrome v70 \" (#14628)"},{"Id":"393897139","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2018-12-24T15:12:20","Actor":"crisbeto","Number":"14627","RawContent":null,"Title":"fix(button-toggle): remove references to selected toggle on destroy","State":"open","Body":"Currently when a button toggle is destroyed, we still keep a reference to it in the selection model which is leaky and causes the model value to be inaccurate.
