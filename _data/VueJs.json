In porting Metawidget to Vue, I am having difficulty because, when passing a prop to a component, I don't seem to be able to access the prop's original expression?\r\n\r\nFor example, for this Vue component:\r\n\r\n    Vue.component( 'my-component', Vue.extend( {\r\n\t    template: '<output>The answer is {{value}} but what is the question?</output>',\r\n\t    props: [ 'value' ]\r\n    } ));\r\n\r\n    new Vue( {\r\n    \tel: '#app',\r\n        data() {\r\n        \treturn {\r\n      \t        theQuestion: '42'\r\n          }\r\n        }\r\n    } );\r\n\r\nand this HTML:\r\n\r\n    <div id=\"app\">  \r\n        <my-component v-model=\"theQuestion\"></my-component>\r\n    </div>\r\n\r\nhow could the Vue component access the text string `theQuestion` as contained in the `v-model` attribute? Fiddle here: https://jsfiddle.net/oznz8a4z/\r\n\r\n### What does the proposed API look like?\r\nAny of several approaches would be suitable:\r\n\r\n1. Extend the component 'props object notation' to pass a second parameter to 'validator' so that I could capture the original expression as well as the value\r\n\r\n2. Allow the $attrs array to hold the original expression for the prop (this is what Angular 1 does)\r\n\r\n<!-- generated by vue-issues.

This PR addresses a few important points:\r\n\r\n1. `next` in `beforeRouteEnter` and `beforeRouteUpdate` behaves the same.\r\n\r\n2. When `router-view` has a key, you can now access the new `vm` from `next`, making it possible to update the new component.

All callbacks added by `next(cb)` are called after navigation has finished, ensuring that torn updates don't happen.
