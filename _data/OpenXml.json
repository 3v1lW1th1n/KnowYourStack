Otherwise there is an error (Word says the document is corrupted and asks if it should repair the document).\r\nThe part information is lost when trying to repair the document in MS Word.\r\n\r\nThis is controlled in OpenXmlPackage.GetContentsAsXml by checking: part.ContentType.EndsWith(\"xml\")\r\nThe standard lists the following content-types for altChunk:\r\n- text/plain\r\n- text/html\r\n- application/vnd.openxmlformats-officedocument.wordprocessingml.document\r\n- application/xhtml+xml\r\n\r\nThe 3rd entry seems like an error because +xml is missing in the standard. I did not try altChunk with Word-Processing-ML but I suppose Word expects a binary part too.\r\nConsidering that, a check for ending of \"xml\" or \"+xml\" is not really feasible for the problem.\r\n\r\nTo be able to tell, if this is an altChunk-Part that should be binary (for MS Word) the Relationship-Type (\"http://schemas.openxmlformats.org/officeDocument/2006/relationships/aFChunk\" or the purl-Version \"http://purl.oclc.org/ooxml/officeDocument/relationships/aFChunk\") of the part should be checked and not the content-Type of the part.\r\nThe check for \"xml\" could be done after this check for altChunk but should anyway rather be for \"+xml\" instead.\r\n\r\n**Information**\r\n\r\n- .NET Target: 4.6.1\r\n- DocumentFormat.OpenXml Version: 2.7.2 but code in 2.9 seams to have the same issue.\r\n\r\n**Repro**\r\nSee Unit-Test at:\r\nhttps://gist.github.com/rominator1983/248dcd826802eeb0a768f18fe709f2b1\r\n\r\nAn additional file (docx with altchunk) is needed:\r\nhttps://amforst.ddns.net/s/qd5RELXM6TeMX8t\r\n\r\n**Observed**\r\naltChunk-Part is returned as XML-Part instead of binary.\r\n\r\n**Expected**\r\naltChunk-Part is returned as binary-Part instead of XML-Part.\r\n\r\n---\r\nCopied from https://gist.github.com/rominator1983/248dcd826802eeb0a768f18fe709f2b1 for easier discoverability:\r\n\r\n```csharp\r\nusing System.IO;\r\nusing System.IO.Packaging;\r\nusing DocumentFormat.OpenXml;\r\nusing DocumentFormat.OpenXml.Packaging;\r\nusing NUnit.Framework;\r\n\r\nnamespace ConversionTestNamespace\r\n{\r\n  [TestFixture]\r\n  public class ConvertTest\r\n  {\r\n    [Test]\r\n    public void Convert ()\r\n    {\r\n      // download file from: https://amforst.ddns.net/s/qd5RELXM6TeMX8t\r\n      using (var package = Package.Open (@\"c:\\\\temp\\\\Doc with altChunk.docx\", FileMode.Open))\r\n      {\r\n        using (var wordprocessingDocument = WordprocessingDocument.Create (package, WordprocessingDocumentType.Document))\r\n        {\r\n          var flatOpcDocumentString = wordprocessingDocument.ToFlatOpcString ();\r\n\r\n          Assert.That (flatOpcDocumentString, Does.Contain(\"pkg:binaryData\"));\r\n        }\r\n      }\r\n    }\r\n  }\r\n}\r\n```"},{"Id":"11137980203","Type":"PullRequestEvent","CreatedAt":"2019-12-20T20:57:13","Actor":"twsouthwick","Repository":"OfficeDev/Open-XML-SDK","Organization":"OfficeDev","RawContent":null,"RelatedAction":"opened","RelatedUrl":"https://github.com/OfficeDev/Open-XML-SDK/pull/667","RelatedDescription":"Opened pull request \"Use ValidationStack to track current element\" (#667) at OfficeDev/Open-XML-SDK","RelatedBody":""},{"Id":"11137937575","Type":"PullRequestEvent","CreatedAt":"2019-12-20T20:49:19","Actor":"twsouthwick","Repository":"OfficeDev/Open-XML-SDK","Organization":"OfficeDev","RawContent":null,"RelatedAction":"merged","RelatedUrl":"https://github.com/OfficeDev/Open-XML-SDK/pull/664","RelatedDescription":"Merged pull request \"Refactor ValidationStack and use for Part and Package\" (#664) at OfficeDev/Open-XML-SDK","RelatedBody":""},{"Id":"11137933335","Type":"PullRequestEvent","CreatedAt":"2019-12-20T20:48:34","Actor":"twsouthwick","Repository":"OfficeDev/Open-XML-SDK","Organization":"OfficeDev","RawContent":null,"RelatedAction":"closed","RelatedUrl":"https://github.com/OfficeDev/Open-XML-SDK/pull/665","RelatedDescription":"Closed pull request \"[WIP] Add validation stack as separate class\" (#665) at OfficeDev/Open-XML-SDK","RelatedBody":""},{"Id":"11137471664","Type":"IssuesEvent","CreatedAt":"2019-12-20T19:26:36","Actor":"twsouthwick","Repository":"OfficeDev/Open-XML-SDK","Organization":"OfficeDev","RawContent":null,"RelatedAction":"opened","RelatedUrl":"https://github.com/OfficeDev/Open-XML-SDK/issues/666","RelatedDescription":"Opened issue \"Enable external viewing of CI failures\" (#666) at OfficeDev/Open-XML-SDK","RelatedBody":"Since we're using an internal DevOps instance, it makes it challenging for the community to see errors (especially since the matrix we build for is larger than the default build in VS).
