On case insensitive\r\nplatforms (e.g. windows) these examples cannot be built because ngtsc fails\r\nthe app imports a generated shim file (such as the factory shim files).\r\n\r\nThis is because the `GeneratedShimsHostWrapper` TypeScript host uses\r\nthe `getCanonicalFileName` method in order to check whether a given\r\nfile/module exists in the generator file maps. e.g.\r\n\r\n```ts\r\n// Generator Map:\r\n'C:/users/paul/_bazel_paul/lm3s4mgv/execroot/angular/packages/core/index.ngfactory.ts' =>\r\n'C:/users/paul/_bazel_paul/lm3s4mgv/execroot/angular/packages/core/index.ts',\r\n\r\n// Path passed into `fileExists`\r\nC:/users/paul/_bazel_paul/lm3s4mgv/execroot/angular/packages/core/index.ngfactory.ts\r\n\r\n// After getCanonicalFileName (notice the **lower-case drive name**)\r\nc:/users/paul/_bazel_paul/lm3s4mgv/execroot/angular/packages/core/index.ngfactory.ts\r\n```\r\n\r\nAs seen above, the generator map does not use the canonical file names, as well as\r\nTypeScript internally does not pass around canonical file names. We can fix this by removing\r\nthe manual call to `getCanonicalFileName` and just following TypeScript internal-semantics.","Url":"https://github.com/angular/angular/pull/28831","RelatedDescription":"Open PR \"fix(ivy): unable to import shim factory files on case-insensitive platforms\" (#28831)"},{"Id":"411963010","IsPullRequest":false,"CreatedAt":"2019-02-19T14:52:19","Actor":"oleersoy","Number":"28826","RawContent":null,"Title":"[Feature Request] Automatic Inclusion of Component in Entry Components","State":"open","Body":"\r\n\r\n# üöÄ feature request\r\nAutomatic inclusion / management of component in entry components.\r\n\r\n### Relevant Package\r\nAngular/core angular/compiler\r\n\r\n### Description\r\nWhen creating a component / host view as documented here:\r\nhttps://medium.com/@ole.ersoy/creating-a-host-view-2dfc895a384b\r\n\r\nWe have to remember to include the component in the entry components.

One of the features of this library is watching and reporting route changes.  There is a configuration option to clean up `id` references in routes, documentation is [here](https://github.com/angulartics/angulartics2#remove-ids-from-url-paths).\r\n\r\nMy configuration for this module is as follows:\r\n```ts\r\n    Angulartics2Module.forRoot({\r\n      pageTracking: {\r\n        clearIds: true,\r\n        idsRegExp: /^[a-zA-Z]+-[0-9a-zA-Z_-]{22}$/\r\n      }\r\n    })\r\n```\r\n\r\nWhen building for production (`ng build --prod`) and using a RegExp (non-constructor variant), it gives me this exception.\r\n\r\n```\r\nDate: 2019-02-18T20:42:19.190Z\r\nHash: f87abc34a327d3cd4386\r\nTime: 5030ms\r\nchunk {0} runtime.a5dd35324ddfd942bef1.js (runtime) 1.41 kB [entry] [rendered]\r\nchunk {1} es2015-polyfills.67c5cff8371af1f9a1d4.js (es2015-polyfills) 56.4 kB [initial] [rendered]\r\nchunk {2} main.cde404c57fbcc43faae1.js (main) 128 bytes [initial] [rendered]\r\nchunk {3} polyfills.70c2c870c3a0f5c90635.js (polyfills) 130 bytes [initial] [rendered]\r\nchunk {4} styles.3ff695c00d717f2d2a11.css (styles) 0 bytes [initial] [rendered]\r\n\r\nERROR in app/app.module.ts(18,20): Error during template compile of 'AppModule'\r\n  Expression form not supported.\r\n```\r\n\r\nAlternatively, when using the constructor format, \r\n```ts\r\n    Angulartics2Module.forRoot({\r\n      pageTracking: {\r\n        clearIds: true,\r\n        idsRegExp: new RegExp('^[a-zA-Z]+-[0-9a-zA-Z_-]{22}$')\r\n      }\r\n    })\r\n```\r\n\r\nThe above actually compiles and builds the distribution, but if you look at the distributed JS, it has removed that particular line and the output JS looks like:\r\n```js\r\nr.qb(256,H,{settings:{pageTracking:{clearIds:!0}}}\r\n```\r\n\r\n\r\n## üî¨ Minimal Reproduction\r\n<!--\r\nSimple steps to reproduce this bug.\r\n\r\nPlease include: commands run (including args), packages added, related code changes.\r\n\r\nIf reproduction steps are not enough for reproduction of your issue, please create a minimal GitHub repository with the reproduction of the issue.
