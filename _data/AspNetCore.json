My problem is that its not doing what we would expect it to do.   \r\n\r\nManagement expects when a user logs in and clicks remember me that they will then not be required to type their login and password again for a month.

VS 2019 is about to be released in around early 2019\r\n2. ASP.NET Core 1.0/1.1 is not going to be supported anymore, based on [this page](https://github.com/dotnet/core/blob/master/microsoft-support.md).\r\n3. Creating new ASP.NET Core 1.0/1.1 will always install the .NET Core 1.0/1.1 web tooling, and this is not necessary when previous reason has reached the unsupported period and it's quite near or might be the same time of VS 2019 release.\r\n4. Based on the problem mentioned above, VS 2017 has no \"built in\" tooling when creating new ASP.NET Core 1.0/1.1 project, but the external tooling may help. Therefore for those that still need to maintain ASP.NET Core 1.0/1.1 projects, we could use VS 2017 as long as the VS 2017 is still in support lifecycle or in mainstream support lifecycle.\r\n\r\nI welcome feedback 🙂 \r\n\r\n","Url":"https://github.com/aspnet/Tooling/issues/1078","RelatedDescription":"Closed issue \"Feedback: ensure that .NET Core 1.0/1.1 tooling only supported in VS 2017 and

If you have a 2.1 or greater runtime installed, you'll see output like the following;\r\n\r\n```text\r\n.NET Core SDK (reflecting any global.json):\r\n Version:   2.2.100\r\n Commit:    b9f2fa0ca8\r\n\r\nRuntime Environment:\r\n OS Name:     Windows\r\n OS Version:  10.0.17134\r\n OS Platform: Windows\r\n RID:         win10-x64\r\n Base Path:   C:\\Program Files\\dotnet\\sdk\\2.2.100\\\r\n\r\nHost (useful for support):\r\n  Version: 2.2.0\r\n  Commit:  1249f08fed\r\n\r\n.NET Core SDKs installed:\r\n  2.1.5 [C:\\Program Files\\dotnet\\sdk]\r\n  2.1.502 [C:\\Program Files\\dotnet\\sdk]\r\n  2.2.100 [C:\\Program Files\\dotnet\\sdk]\r\n\r\n.NET Core runtimes installed:\r\n  Microsoft.AspNetCore.All 2.1.6 [C:\\Program Files\\dotnet\\shared\\Microsoft.AspNetCore.All]\r\n  Microsoft.AspNetCore.App 2.1.6 [C:\\Program Files\\dotnet\\shared\\Microsoft.AspNetCore.App]\r\n  Microsoft.AspNetCore.All 2.2.0 [C:\\Program Files\\dotnet\\shared\\Microsoft.AspNetCore.All]\r\n  Microsoft.AspNetCore.App 2.2.0 [C:\\Program Files\\dotnet\\shared\\Microsoft.AspNetCore.App]\r\n  Microsoft.NETCore.App 2.1.6 [C:\\Program Files\\dotnet\\shared\\Microsoft.NETCore.App]\r\n  Microsoft.NETCore.App 2.2.0 [C:\\Program Files\\dotnet\\shared\\Microsoft.NETCore.App]\r\n\r\nTo install additional .NET Core runtimes or SDKs:\r\n  https://aka.ms/dotnet-download\r\n```\r\n\r\nIf your host version is 2.1.x and the highest `Microsoft.AspNetCore.App` runtime version is less than 2.1.7, you're vulnerable to this issue.\r\nIf your host version is 2.2.x and the highest 2.1.x `Microsoft.AspNetCore.App` runtime version is less than 2.1.7, or the highest 2.2.x `Microsoft.AspNetCore.App` runtime version is less than 2.2.1, you're vulnerable to this issue.\r\n\r\nYou will not see SDK versions if you have only installed the runtime.\r\n\r\n#### Applications not using Microsoft.AspNetCore.App or Microsoft.AspNetCore.All\r\n\r\nSome of the affected assemblies are also available separately as a NuGet package. If you are not using Microsoft.AspNetCore.App or .All, you may still be affected if you are referencing the packages listed above.\r\n\r\n##### Direct dependencies\r\n\r\nDirect dependencies are discoverable by examining your `csproj` file. They can be fixed by [editing the project file](#fixing-direct-dependencies) or using NuGet to update the dependency.\r\n\r\n##### Transitive dependencies\r\n\r\nTransitive dependencies occur when you add a package to your project that in turn relies on another package. For example, if Contoso publishes a package `Contoso.Utility` which, in turn, depends on `Contoso.Internals` and you add the `Contoso.Utility` package to your project now your project has a direct dependency on `Contoso.Utility` and, because `Contoso.Utility` depends 'Contoso.Internals', your application gains a transitive dependency on the `Contoso.Internals` package.\r\n\r\nTransitive dependencies are reviewable in two ways:\r\n\r\n* In the Visual Studio Solution Explorer window, which supports searching.\r\n* By examining the `project.assets.json` file contained in the obj directory of your project for `csproj` based projects\r\n\r\nThe `project.assets.json` files are the authoritative list of all packages used by your project, containing both direct and transitive dependencies.\r\n\r\nThere are two ways to view transitive dependencies. You can either [use Visual Studio’s Solution Explorer](#vs-solution-explorer), or you can review [the `project.assets.json` file](#project-assets-json)).\r\n\r\n##### <a name=\"vs-solution-explorer\"></a>Using Visual Studio Solution Explorer\r\n\r\nTo use Solution Explorer, open the project in Visual Studio, and then press Ctrl+; to activate the search in Solution Explorer. Search for the [vulnerable package](#affected-software) and make a note of the version numbers of any results you find.\r\n\r\nFor example, searching for `Microsoft.AspNetCore.Mvc.Core` in an example project that contains a package that takes a dependency on `Microsoft.AspNetCore.Mvc` shows the following results in Visual Studio 2017:\r\n\r\n![Screenshot of search results in Visual Studio 2017](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/796298/25858816/8ecdc2b4-3491-11e7-9363-746804bb9832.png)\r\n\r\nThe search results appear as a tree. In the previous results, you can see that a reference to `Microsoft.AspNetCore.Mvc.Core` version 1.1.2 is discovered.\r\n\r\nUnder the Dependencies node is a NuGet node. Under the NuGet node is the list of packages you have directly taken a dependency on and their versions.\r\nIn screenshot, the application takes a direct dependency on `Microsoft.AspNetCore.Mvc`. `Microsoft.AspNetCore.Mvc` in turn has leaf nodes that list its dependencies and their versions.\r\nThe `Microsoft.AspNetCore.Mvc` package takes a dependency on a version of `Microsoft.AspNetCore.Mvc.ApiExplorer`, that in turn takes a dependency on a version of `Microsoft.AspNetCore.Mvc.Core`.\r\n\r\n##### <a name=\"project-assets-json\"></a> Manually reviewing project.assets.json\r\n\r\nOpen the *project.assets.json* file from your project’s obj directory in your editor. We suggest you use an editor that understands JSON and allows you to collapse and expand nodes to review this file.\r\nVisual Studio and Visual Studio Code provide JSON friendly editing.\r\n\r\nSearch the *project.assets.json* file for the [vulnerable package](#affected-software), using the format `packagename/` for each of the package names from the preceding table. If you find the assembly name in your search:\r\n\r\n* Examine the line on which they are found, the version number is after the `/`.\r\n* Compare to the [vulnerable versions table](#affected-software).\r\n\r\nFor example, a search result that shows `System.IO.Pipelines/4.5.0` is a reference to version 4.5.0 of `System.IO.Pipelines`.\r\n\r\nIf your *project.assets.json* file includes references to the [vulnerable package](#affected-software), then you need to fix the transitive dependencies.\r\n\r\nIf you have not found any reference to any vulnerable packages, this means either\r\n\r\n* None of your direct dependencies depend on any vulnerable packages, or\r\n* You have already fixed the problem by updating the direct dependencies.\r\n\r\n### <a name=\"how-fix\"></a>How do I fix the issue?\r\n\r\n#### Updating the version of Microsoft.NETCore.App, Microsoft.AspNetCore.App, and Microsoft.AspNetCore.All\r\n\r\nIf your host version is a 2.1.x host, you must install version 2.1.7 or later of the [.NET Core 2.1 runtime](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/download/dotnet-core/2.1), or corresponding [.NET Core 2.1 SDK](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/download/dotnet-core/2.1).\r\n\r\nIf your host version is a 2.2.x, you must install version 2.2.1 or later of the [.NET Core 2.2 runtime](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/download/dotnet-core/2.2), or corresponding  [.NET Core 2.2 SDK](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/download/dotnet-core/2.2).\r\n\r\n#### <a name=\"fixing-direct-dependencies\"></a>Fixing direct dependencies\r\n\r\nOpen *projectname.csproj* in your editor. If you're using Visual Studio, right-click the project and choose **Edit projectname.csproj** from the context menu, where projectname is the name of your project. Look for `PackageReference` elements. The following shows an example project file:\r\n\r\n```xml\r\n<Project Sdk=\"Microsoft.NET.Sdk.Web\">\r\n  <PropertyGroup>\r\n    <TargetFramework>netcoreapp2.1</TargetFramework>\r\n  </PropertyGroup>\r\n  <ItemGroup>\r\n    <PackageReference Include=\"System.IO.Pipelines\" Version=\"4.5.0\" />\r\n  </ItemGroup>\r\n</Project>\r\n```\r\n\r\nThe preceding example has a reference to the [vulnerable package](#affected-software), as seen by the single `PackageReference` element. The name of the package is in the `Include` attribute.\r\nThe package version number is in the `Version` attribute. The previous example shows a single direct dependency on `System.IO.Pipelines` version 4.5.0\r\n\r\nTo update the version to the secure package, change the version number to the updated package version as listed on the table [previously](#affected-software).\r\nIn this example, update `System.IO.Pipelines` to the appropriate [fixed package number](#affected-software) for your major version. Save the *csproj* file. The example *csproj* now looks as follows:\r\n\r\n```xml\r\n<Project Sdk=\"Microsoft.NET.Sdk.Web\">\r\n  <PropertyGroup>\r\n    <TargetFramework>netcoreapp2.1</TargetFramework>\r\n  </PropertyGroup>\r\n  <ItemGroup>\r\n    <PackageReference Include=\"System.IO.Pipelines\" Version=\"4.5.1\" />\r\n  </ItemGroup>\r\n</Project>\r\n```\r\n\r\nIf you're using Visual Studio and you save your updated *csproj* file, Visual Studio will restore the new package version.\r\nYou can see the restore results by opening the **Output** window (Ctrl+Alt+O) and changing the **Show output from** drop-down list to **Package Manager**.\r\n\r\nIf you're not using Visual Studio, open a command line and change to your project directory. Execute the `dotnet restore` command to restore the updated dependencies.\r\n\r\nNow recompile your application. If after recompilation you see a *Dependency conflict warning*, you must update your other direct dependencies to versions that take a dependency on the updated package.\r\n\r\n#### <a name=\"transitive-dependencies\"></a>Fixing transitive dependencies\r\n\r\nIf your transitive dependency review found references to the [vulnerable package](#affected-software), you must add a direct dependency to the updated package to your *csproj* file to override the transitive dependency.\r\n\r\nOpen *projectname.csproj* in your editor. If you're using Visual Studio, right-click the project and choose **Edit projectname.csproj** from the context menu, where projectname is the name of your project.\r\nLook for `PackageReference` nodes, for example:\r\n\r\n```xml\r\n<Project Sdk=\"Microsoft.NET.Sdk.\">\r\n  <PropertyGroup>\r\n    <TargetFramework>net461</TargetFramework>\r\n  </PropertyGroup>\r\n  <ItemGroup>\r\n    <PackageReference Include=\"ThirdParty.NotUpdatedYet\" Version=\"2.0.0\" />\r\n  </ItemGroup>\r\n</Project>\r\n```\r\n\r\nYou must add a direct dependency to the updated version of the [vulnerable package](#affected-software) by adding it to the *csproj* file.\r\nYou do this by adding a new line to the dependencies section, referencing the fixed version.\r\nFor example, if your search showed a transitive reference to a vulnerable `System.ServiceModel.Http` version, you'd add a reference to the [fixed package number](#affected-software).\r\n\r\n```xml\r\n<Project Sdk=\"Microsoft.NET.Sdk.Web\">\r\n  <PropertyGroup>\r\n    <TargetFramework>net461</TargetFramework>\r\n  </PropertyGroup>\r\n  <ItemGroup>\r\n    <PackageReference Include=\"System.IO.Pipelines\" Version=\"4.5.1\" />\r\n    <PackageReference Include=\"ThirdParty.NotUpdatedYet\" Version=\"2.0.0\" />\r\n  </ItemGroup>\r\n</Project>\r\n```\r\n\r\nAfter you've added the direct dependency reference, save your *csproj* file.\r\n\r\nIf you're using Visual Studio, save your updated *csproj* file and Visual Studio will restore the new package versions.\r\nYou can see the restore results by opening the **Output** window (Ctrl+Alt+O) and changing the **Show output from** drop-down list to **Package Manager**.\r\n\r\nIf you're not using Visual Studio, open a command line and change to your project directory. Execute the `dotnet restore` command to restore the new dependencies.\r\n\r\n##### Rebuilding your application\r\n\r\nFinally, you must rebuild your application, test, and redeploy.\r\n\r\n## Other Information\r\n\r\n### Reporting Security Issues\r\n\r\nIf you have found a potential security issue in .NET Core, please email details to secure@microsoft.com.

ASP.NET and ASP.NET Core have been using the Google+ Signin APIs to authenticate Google account users in web applications. The affected NuGet packages are [Microsoft.AspNetCore.Authentication.Google](https://www.nuget.org/packages/Microsoft.AspNetCore.Authentication.Google/) for ASP.NET Core and [Microsoft.Owin.Security.Google](https://www.nuget.org/packages/Microsoft.Owin.Security.Google/) for Microsoft.Owin with ASP.NET Web Forms and MVC. Mitigations and solutions will vary depending on which package and which version of that package you use. \r\n\r\nNote that the replacement APIs Google has provided use a different data source and format. The mitigations and solutions given below account for the structural changes but applications will need to verify the data itself still satisfies their requirements. E.g. names, e-mail addresses, profile links, profile photos, etc. may provide subtly different values than before.\r\n\r\n### Microsoft.Owin with ASP.NET Web Forms and MVC\r\nFor Microsoft.Owin 3.1.0 and later a temporary mitigation is outlined [here](https://github.com/aspnet/AspNetKatana/issues/251#issuecomment-449587635). Applications should do immediate testing with the mitigation to check for changes in the data format. We'll plan to release Microsoft.Owin 4.0.1 with a fix for this as soon as possible. Applications using any prior version will need to update to 4.0.1.\r\n\r\n### ASP.NET Core 1.x\r\nThe mitigation given above for [Microsoft.Owin](https://github.com/aspnet/AspNetKatana/issues/251#issuecomment-449587635) can also be adapted for ASP.NET Core 1.x. As 1.x is nearing [end of life](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/platform/support-policy) and has low usage there are no plans to patch the NuGet packages for this issue.\r\n\r\n### ASP.NET Core 2.x\r\nFor Microsoft.AspNetCore.Authentication.Google 2.x the mitigation is to replace your existing call to `AddGoogle` in `Startup` with:\r\n```c#\r\n            .AddGoogle(o =>\r\n            {\r\n                o.ClientId = Configuration[\"Authentication:Google:ClientId\"];\r\n                o.ClientSecret = Configuration[\"Authentication:Google:ClientSecret\"];\r\n                o.UserInformationEndpoint = \"https://www.googleapis.com/oauth2/v2/userinfo\";\r\n                o.ClaimActions.Clear();\r\n                o.ClaimActions.MapJsonKey(ClaimTypes.NameIdentifier, \"id\");\r\n                o.ClaimActions.MapJsonKey(ClaimTypes.Name, \"name\");\r\n                o.ClaimActions.MapJsonKey(ClaimTypes.GivenName, \"given_name\");\r\n                o.ClaimActions.MapJsonKey(ClaimTypes.Surname, \"family_name\");\r\n                o.ClaimActions.MapJsonKey(\"urn:google:profile\", \"link\");\r\n                o.ClaimActions.MapJsonKey(ClaimTypes.Email, \"email\");\r\n            });\r\n```\r\nApplications should do immediate testing with the mitigation to check for changes in the data format. Expect a fix for this to be included in the February 2.1 and 2.2 patches that incorperates the above reconfiguration as the new defaults. No patch is planned for 2.0 since it has reached [end of life](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/platform/support-policy).\r\n\r\n### ASP.NET Core 3.0 Preview\r\nThe mitigation given for 2.x can also be used for the current 3.0 preview. In future 3.0 previews we're considering removing the Microsoft.AspNetCore.Authentication.Google package and directing users to Microsoft.AspNetCore.Authentication.OpenIdConnect instead. We'll follow up with the final plan. Here's how to replace `AddGoogle` with `AddOpenIdConnect` in `Startup`. This replacement can be used with ASP.NET Core 2.0 and later and can be adapted for 1.x as needed.\r\n```c#\r\n            .AddOpenIdConnect(\"Google\", o =>\r\n            {\r\n                o.ClientId = Configuration[\"Authentication:Google:ClientId\"];\r\n                o.ClientSecret = Configuration[\"Authentication:Google:ClientSecret\"];\r\n                o.Authority = \"https://accounts.google.com\";\r\n                o.ResponseType = OpenIdConnectResponseType.Code;\r\n                o.CallbackPath = \"/signin-google\"; // Or register the default \"/sigin-oidc\"\r\n                o.Scope.Add(\"email\");\r\n            });\r\n            JwtSecurityTokenHandler.DefaultInboundClaimTypeMap.Clear();\r\n```\r\n\r\nSee https://github.com/aspnet/AspNetCore/issues/6486 for discussion.","Url":"https://github.com/aspnet/Announcements/issues/333","RelatedDescription":"Open issue \"Google+ based auth deprecation and replacement\" (#333)"},{"Id":"390815611","IsPullRequest":false,"CreatedAt":"2018-12-13T19:01:52","Actor":"JunTaoLuo","Number":"331","RawContent":null,"Title":"Session: obsolete APIs removed in 3.0","State":"open","Body":"This is a follow up to https://github.com/aspnet/Announcements/issues/257.

This includes types in the following namespaces:\r\n\r\n* Microsoft.AspNetCore.Mvc.Formatters.Xml.Internal\r\n* Microsoft.AspNetCore.Mvc.Cors.Internal\r\n* Microsoft.AspNetCore.Mvc.ViewFeatures.Internal\r\n* Microsoft.AspNetCore.Mvc.Formatters.Json.Internal\r\n* Microsoft.AspNetCore.Mvc.RazorPages.Internal\r\n* Microsoft.AspNetCore.Mvc.DataAnnotations.Internal\r\n* Microsoft.AspNetCore.Mvc.TagHelpers.Internal\r\n* Microsoft.AspNetCore.Mvc.Internal\r\n* Microsoft.AspNetCore.Mvc.Razor.Internal\r\n* Microsoft.AspNetCore.Mvc.Formatters.Internal\r\n* Microsoft.AspNetCore.Mvc.Core.Internal\r\n* Microsoft.AspNetCore.Mvc.ModelBinding.Internal\r\n\r\nIf there are specific types in these namespaces that are critical to your applications, please file an issue in https://github.com/aspnet/Mvc and we will consider making the requested types public.","Url":"https://github.com/aspnet/Announcements/issues/326","RelatedDescription":"Open issue \"Making \"pubinternal\" types in MVC internal\" (#326)"},{"Id":"375243400","IsPullRequest":false,"CreatedAt":"2018-10-29T22:28:29","Actor":"natemcmaster","Number":"325","RawContent":null,"Title":"Breaking changes to Microsoft.AspNetCore.App in 3.0","State":"open","Body":"_This change is one of several which were [announced earlier today on the ASP.NET blog.][aspnet-blog]_\r\n\r\nStarting in 3.0, the ASP.NET Core shared framework (`Microsoft.AspNetCore.App`) will only contain first-party assemblies that are fully developed, supported, and serviceable by Microsoft. You can think of this as constituting the ASP.NET Core “platform.” It will be fully [source buildable by anybody via GitHub](https://github.com/dotnet/source-build) and will continue to bring all the existing benefits of .NET Core shared frameworks to your applications moving forward (smaller deployment size, centralized patching, faster startup time, etc.). \r\n\r\nAs part of this change, some notable breaking changes will be made in Microsoft.AspNetCore.App 3.0.\r\n\r\n## Removal of some sub-components\r\n\r\nAs part of this change, some notable sub-components will be removed from the ASP.NET Core shared framework in 3.0: \r\n\r\n* Json.NET (Newtonsoft.Json)\r\n* Entity Framework Core (Microsoft.EntityFrameworkCore.\\*) \r\n* Microsoft.CodeAnalysis (Roslyn)\r\n\r\nEntity Framework Core will ship as “pure” NuGet packages in 3.0. This makes its shipping model the same as all other data access libraries on .NET, and allows it the simplest path to continue innovation while providing support for all the various .NET platforms customers enjoy it on today. Note, Entity Framework Core moving out of the shared framework has no impact on its status as a Microsoft developed, supported, and serviceable library, and it will continue to be covered by the [.NET Core support policy.](https://www.microsoft.com/net/platform/support-policy)\r\n\r\nJson.NET or Entity Framework Core will continue to work with ASP.NET Core, but they will not be \"in the box\" with the shared framework.\r\n\r\nSee [\"The future of JSON in .NET Core 3.0\"](https://github.com/dotnet/announcements/issues/90) for details on our plans to remove the dependency from ASP.NET Core to Json.NET and replace it with high-performance JSON APIs.\r\n\r\nWe have separately posted [a complete list of exact binaries][items-removed-from-fx] that are being removed. This list may fluctuate as we continue to work on ASP.NET Core 3.0.\r\n\r\n## Removal of the PackageReference to Microsoft.AspNetCore.App\r\n\r\nStarting in ASP.NET Core 3.0, references to Microsoft.AspNetCore.App will no longer be a `<PackageReference>` element in the project file. The .NET Core SDK will support a new item called\r\n`<FrameworkReference>` which will replace the use of PackageReference. Changes to support this new item type are already under way. \r\n\r\nSee [aspnet/AspNetCore#3612](https://github.com/aspnet/AspNetCore/issues/3612) for more details.\r\n\r\n## Reducing the duplication between NuGet packages and shared frameworks\r\n\r\nAs result these changes, it will not be necessary for projects to consume assemblies in Microsoft.AspNetCore.App as NuGet packages. To simplify the way in which consumers target and use the ASP.NET Core shared framework, we will stop producing many of the NuGet packages that we have been shipping since ASP.NET Core 1.0. The API those packages provide are still available to apps by using a `<FrameworkReference>` to Microsoft.AspNetCore.App. This includes commonly referenced API, such as Kestrel, Mvc, Razor, and others.\r\n\r\nThis will not apply to all binaries that are pulled in via Microsoft.AspNetCore.App in 2.x. Notable exceptions include:\r\n\r\n* Microsoft.Extensions libraries which continue to target .NET Standard will be available as NuGet packages (see https://github.com/aspnet/Extensions)\r\n* API produced by the ASP.NET Core team which is not part of Microsoft.AspNetCore.App. For example, Entity Framework Core, API which provides 3rd party integration, experimental features, or API which has dependencies that could not [satisy the requirements to be in the shared framework][shared-fx-guidance] will ship as NuGet packages and not in the shared framework.\r\n* Extensions to MVC that maintain support for Json.NET. We intend to provide API as a NuGet package to support using Json.NET and MVC.\r\n* The SignalR .NET client will continue to support .NET Standard and ship as NuGet package because it is intended for use on many .NET runtimes, like Xamarin and UWP.\r\n\r\nFor more details, see the [complete list of packages that will only be obsolete in favor of `<FrameworkReference>`.][packages-removed-from-fx] This list may fluctuate as we continue to work on ASP.NET Core 3.0.\r\n\r\nSee [the blog post from earlier today][aspnet-blog] for more details on the motivation for this change.\r\n\r\nYou can use [aspnet/AspNetCore#3757][discussion] for discussion.\r\n\r\n[2.1-lts]: https://www.microsoft.com/net/download/dotnet-core/2.1\r\n[aspnet-blog]: https://blogs.msdn.microsoft.com/webdev/2018/10/29/a-first-look-at-changes-coming-in-asp-net-core-3-0\r\n[discussion]: https://github.com/aspnet/AspNetCore/issues/3757\r\n[items-removed-from-fx]: https://github.com/aspnet/AspNetCore/issues/3755\r\n[packages-removed-from-fx]: https://github.com/aspnet/AspNetCore/issues/3756\r\n[shared-fx-guidance]: https://github.com/aspnet/AspNetCore/blob/4e44e5bcbedd961cc0d4f6b846699c7c494f5597/docs/SharedFramework.md\r\n","Url":"https://github.com/aspnet/Announcements/issues/325","RelatedDescription":"Open issue \"Breaking changes to Microsoft.AspNetCore.App in 3.0\" (#325)"},{"Id":"375240026","IsPullRequest":false,"CreatedAt":"2018-10-29T22:16:36","Actor":"natemcmaster","Number":"324","RawContent":null,"Title":"ASP.NET Core 3.0 will only run on .NET Core","State":"open","Body":"_This change is one of several which were [announced earlier today on the ASP.NET blog.][aspnet-blog]_\r\n\r\nAs announced on the [.NET Blog earlier this month][dotnet-blog], .NET Framework will get fewer of the newer platform and language features that come to .NET Core moving forward, due to the in-place update nature of .NET Framework and the desire to limit changes there that might break existing applications.

We know there are some drawbacks to working in larger repos, but we find the benefits compelling enough to move forward with this change. The new set of repos more closely aligns with the layering of the products they ship.\r\n\r\n### Timeframe\r\n\r\nWe'll be starting the first round of changes soon. We expect the entire unification effort will take us several weeks. We'll migrate repositories in phases and adjust the plan along the way, as necessary.\r\n\r\n### Archived repos\r\n\r\nThe following repos will be merged into the main repos above. They will not be used any more for active development on 2.1 LTS and new releases. The source code for the projects will move to the new project with any issues we intend to keep working on. Remaining issues and pull requests will be closed. We do not plan to delete the repos or remove tagged commits, but the projects will become read-only.\r\n\r\n* AADIntegration           \r\n* Antiforgery              \r\n* AuthSamples              \r\n* AzureIntegration         \r\n* BasicMiddleware          \r\n* BrowserLink              \r\n* Caching                  \r\n* Common                   \r\n* Configuration            \r\n* CORS                     \r\n* DataProtection           \r\n* DependencyInjection      \r\n* Diagnostics              \r\n* DotNetTools              \r\n* EventNotification        \r\n* FileSystem               \r\n* Hosting                  \r\n* HtmlAbstractions         \r\n* HttpAbstractions         \r\n* HttpClientFactory        \r\n* HttpSysServer            \r\n* Identity                 \r\n* IISIntegration           \r\n* JavaScriptServices       \r\n* JsonPatch                \r\n* KestrelHttpServer        \r\n* Localization             \r\n* Logging                  \r\n* MetaPackages             \r\n* Microsoft.Data.Sqlite    \r\n* MusicStore               \r\n* Mvc                      \r\n* MvcPrecompilation        \r\n* Options                  \r\n* Proxy                    \r\n* Razor                    \r\n* ResponseCaching          \r\n* Routing                  \r\n* Scaffolding              \r\n* Security                 \r\n* ServerTests              \r\n* Session                  \r\n* SignalR                  \r\n* StaticFiles              \r\n* Templating               \r\n* Testing                  \r\n* Universe                 \r\n* WebHooks                 \r\n* WebSockets\r\n\r\n\r\n_Please use https://github.com/aspnet/Home/issues/3598 for discussion._  ","Url":"https://github.com/aspnet/Announcements/issues/320","RelatedDescription":"Open issue \"For contributors: unifying to fewer GitHub repos\" (#320)"},{"Id":"367922912","IsPullRequest":false,"CreatedAt":"2018-10-08T19:29:02","Actor":"pranavkm","Number":"319","RawContent":null,"Title":"3.0 - Removing Microsoft.AspNetCore.Mvc.WebApiCompatShim","State":"open","Body":"The Microsoft.AspNetCore.Mvc.WebApiCompatShim (WebApiCompatShim) package provides partial compatibility in ASP.NET Core with ASP.NET Web API 2 to simplify migrating existing Web API implementations to ASP.NET Core.

This advisory also provides guidance on what developers can do to remove current security restrictions added by ASP.NET to their applications to become compatible with iOS12.\r\n\r\n## Discussion\r\n\r\nDiscussion for this issue can be found at https://github.com/aspnet/Identity/issues/1984 for ASP.NET Core Identity\r\nDiscussion for this issue can be found at https://github.com/aspnet/Security/issues/1864 for ASP.NET Core Cookie Authentication\r\n\r\n## <a name=\"advisory-faq\"></a>Advisory FAQ\r\n\r\n### <a name=\"how-affected\"></a>What has changed\r\n\r\nThe recent iOS12 update has changed Safari's handling of [SameSite](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc6265) cookies. The SameSite attribute allows a developer to control when cookies are sent to a web site, enabling the flow to only occur when requests are from the same site. This standard was introduced to reduce exposure to Cross Site Request Forgery (CSRF) attacks. By default ASP.NET Core 2.0 and later protects its authentication cookies using the SameSite property. The change on Apple's part is not limited to ASP.NET Core applications, it is affecting multiple frameworks and authentication software which relay on HTTP forms in a browser, for example authenticating to a third party via Facebook, Twitter or browser based Open ID Connect (OIDC) mechanism.\r\n\r\nApple have stated they believe [their change is correct behavior](https://bugs.webkit.org/show_bug.cgi?id=188165), and that the fault lies in every other browser's implementation.\r\n\r\nWhile we take no stance on the correctness of browser behavior we feel that removing the SameSite protections would expose our customers, and their customers to a wider risk, as it would remove the protection provided everywhere, for all users, in any browser.\r\n\r\n### <a name=\"how-affected\"></a>How do I know if I am affected?\r\n\r\nIf your users can no longer login to your web application on iOS12 using Safari then you are affected.\r\n\r\n### <a name=\"how-fix\"></a>How do I fix this?\r\n\r\nDevelopers can allow iOS12 Safari users to log into their applications by turn off SameSite protection in `ConfigureServices()`.\r\n\r\nIf you are using ASP.NET Core Identity you disable the protection by configuring cookies with the following code\r\n\r\n```c#\r\nservices.ConfigureExternalCookie(options =>\r\n{\r\n    // Other options\r\n    options.Cookie.SameSite = SameSiteMode.None;\r\n});\r\nservices.ConfigureApplicationCookie(options =>\r\n{\r\n    // Other options\r\n    options.Cookie.SameSite = SameSiteMode.None;\r\n});\r\n```\r\n\r\nIf you are using cookie authentication without ASP.NET Core identity you can turn off the protection with the following code\r\n\r\n```c#\r\nservices.AddCookie(CookieAuthenticationDefaults.AuthenticationScheme, options =>\r\n{\r\n    // Other options\r\n    options.Cookie.SameSite = Microsoft.AspNetCore.Http.SameSiteMode.None;\r\n})\r\n```\r\n\r\nIf you are using external OIDC providers you may be able to avoid the issue by changing the response mode your provider uses from a POST to a GET request, using the following code. Not all providers may support this.\r\n\r\n```c#\r\n.AddOpenIdConnect(\"myOIDProvider\", options => {\r\n    // Other options\r\n    options.ResponseType = \"code\";\r\n    options.ResponseMode = \"query\";\r\n};\r\n```\r\n\r\n_Note that in making these changes protection is removed for all users and all browsers. You should ensure that all your actions that make state changes are protected with [CSRF anti-forgery mechanisms](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/aspnet/core/security/anti-request-forgery) built into ASP.NET Core.\r\n\r\n#### Rebuilding your application\r\n\r\nAfter making these configuration changes you rebuild your application, test, and redeploy.\r\n\r\n## Other Information\r\n\r\n### Reporting Security Issues\r\n\r\nIf you have found a potential security issue in .NET Core, please email details to secure@microsoft.com.
