Sometimes we use Template ASTs\r\nrather than Render3 ASTs, and it's desirable to test for correct\r\nexpression spans in the template parser as well.\r\n\r\nAdding these tests resolved one bug, similar to the one fixed in\r\nfd4fed14d8935866fe16d30648d115f3ebb5fd43, where expressions in the value\r\nof a template attribute were not given an absolute span corresponding to\r\nthe start of the attribute name rather than the start of the attribute\r\nvalue.\r\n\r\nThe diff on this commit is large, partially because it involves some\r\nstructural changes of the template parser testing layout. In particular,\r\nthe following is done:\r\n\r\n1. Move `createMeta*`-like functions from `template_parser_spec.ts` to\r\n   be exported from a new test utility file.\r\n2. Create an `ExpressionSourceHumanizer`, similar to the one created in\r\n   b04488d692ca11c83444da56f51d53c3ac868243, to allow convinient testing\r\n   of expressions' locations.\r\n3.

This can happen when an input has a getter/setter pair\r\nwhere the getter always returns a narrow type, and the setter coerces a\r\nwider value down to the narrow type.\r\n\r\nFor example, you could imagine an input of the form:\r\n\r\n```typescript\r\n@Input() get value(): string {\r\n  return this._value;\r\n}\r\n\r\nset value(v: {toString(): string}) {\r\n  this._value = v.toString();\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nHere, the getter always returns a `string`, but the setter accepts any value\r\nthat can be `toString()`'d, and coerces it to a string.\r\n\r\nUnfortunately TypeScript does not actually support this syntax, and so\r\nAngular users are forced to type their setters as narrowly as the getters,\r\neven though at runtime the coercion works just fine.\r\n\r\nTo support these kinds of patterns (e.g. as used by Material), this commit\r\nadds a compiler feature called \"input coercion\". When a binding is made to\r\nthe 'value' input of a directive like MatInput, the compiler will look for a\r\nstatic function with the name ngCoerceInput_value. If such a function is\r\nfound, the type-checking expression for the input will be wrapped in a call\r\nto the function, allowing for the expression of a type conversion between\r\nthe binding expression and the value being written to the input's field.\r\n\r\nTo solve the case above, for example, MatInput might write:\r\n\r\n```typescript\r\nclass MatInput {\r\n  // rest of the directive...\r\n\r\n  static ngCoerceInput_value(value: {toString(): string}): string {\r\n    return null!;\r\n  }\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nFW-1475 #resolve\r\n","Url":"https://github.com/angular/angular/pull/33243","RelatedDescription":"Open PR \"feat(ivy): input type coercion for template type-checking\" (#33243)"},{"Id":"508755715","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2019-10-17T22:38:14","Actor":"clydin","Number":"33242","RawContent":null,"Title":"fix(compiler-cli): remove unused CLI private exports","State":"open","Body":"These exports are no longer used by the CLI since version 7.1.0.

A [common](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/48141804/angular-2-routing-with-fragments-async-data), but wrong, idea is to use a Resolver for async data shown on a page. However if the data is asynchronous then it is also conditional. Thus there is no way to implement functional anchor scrolling from Angular Router with any type of dynamic data in a component.\r\n\r\nAlso of note, once the component fully loads, anchor scrolling does work.

This can lead to a race condition, where both check for the directory existence, see that the directory does not exist and both try to create it, with the second failing due the directory's having already been created by the first one. Note that this only affects directories and not files, because `ngcc` tasks operate on different sets of files.\r\n\r\nThis commit avoids this race condition by allowing `FileSystem`'s `ensureDir()` method to not fail if one of the directories it is trying to create already exists (and is indeed a directory). This is fine for\r\nthe `ensureDir()` method, since it's purpose is to ensure that the specified directory exists. So, even if the `mkdir()` call failed (because the directory exists), `ensureDir()` has still completed its mission.\r\n\r\nRelated discussion: https://github.com/angular/angular/pull/33049#issuecomment-540485703\r\n[FW-1635](https://angular-team.atlassian.net/browse/FW-1635) #resolve\r\n","Url":"https://github.com/angular/angular/pull/33237","RelatedDescription":"Open PR \"fix(ngcc): do not fail when multiple workers try to create the same directory\" (#33237)"},{"Id":"508706299","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2019-10-17T20:33:35","Actor":"mhevery","Number":"33235","RawContent":null,"Title":"Recursive change detection","State":"open","Body":"\r\n```\r\n┌────────────────────────────────────┬─────────┬──────┬───────────┬───────────┬───────┐\r\n│              (index)               │  time   │ unit │ base_time │ base_unit │   %   │\r\n├────────────────────────────────────┼─────────┼──────┼───────────┼───────────┼───────┤\r\n│       directive_instantiate        │  2.427  │ 'us' │   2.483   │   'us'    │ -2.26 │\r\n│        element_text_create         │  1.266  │ 'us' │   1.278   │   'us'    │ -0.94 │\r\n│           interpolation            │ 213.588 │ 'us' │  216.65   │   'us'    │ -1.41 │\r\n│             listeners              │  1.921  │ 'us' │   1.952   │   'us'    │ -1.59 │\r\n│ map_based_style_and_class_bindings │ 18.211  │ 'ms' │  17.983   │   'ms'    │ 1.27  │\r\n│       noop_change_detection        │  24.99  │ 'us' │   23.96   │   'us'    │  4.3  │\r\n│          property_binding          │ 220.944 │ 'us' │  219.963  │   'us'    │ 0.45  │\r\n│      property_binding_update       │ 442.284 │ 'us' │  408.865  │   'us'    │ 8.17  │\r\n│      style_and_class_bindings      │  1.023  │ 'ms' │  990.402  │   'us'    │ 3.29  │\r\n│           style_binding            │ 443.163 │ 'us' │  489.636  │   'us'    │ -9.49 │\r\n└────────────────────────────────────┴─────────┴──────┴───────────┴───────────┴───────┘\r\n```\r\n","Url":"https://github.com/angular/angular/pull/33235","RelatedDescription":"Open PR \"Recursive change detection\" (#33235)"},{"Id":"508657914","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2019-10-17T18:50:56","Actor":"AMDphreak","Number":"33234","RawContent":null,"Title":"docs: change \"comprises\" to \"consists of\" in getting started","State":"open","Body":"per Google Guidelines.\r\n\r\n## PR Checklist\r\nPlease check if your PR fulfills the following requirements:\r\n\r\n- [x] The commit message follows our guidelines: https://github.com/angular/angular/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md#commit\r\n- [x] Tests for the changes have been added (for bug fixes / features)\r\n- [x] Docs have been added / updated (for bug fixes / features)\r\n\r\n\r\n## PR Type\r\nWhat kind of change does this PR introduce?\r\n\r\n<!-- Please check the one that applies to this PR using \"x\". -->\r\n\r\n- [ ] Bugfix\r\n- [ ] Feature\r\n- [ ] Code style update (formatting, local variables)\r\n- [ ] Refactoring (no functional changes, no api changes)\r\n- [ ] Build related changes\r\n- [ ] CI related changes\r\n- [x] Documentation content changes\r\n- [ ] angular.io application / infrastructure changes\r\n- [ ] Other...

The [default value](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli/blob/e8cdfa6020b8856498f9ea86b1fbbddb3f767975/packages/ngtools/webpack/src/compiler_host.ts#L48) of this option is `false`.\r\n\r\nThe Angular CLI creates an instance of the `AngularCompilerPlugin` and sets this option to `true`, with no way of overriding this behavior.\r\nhttps://github.com/angular/angular-cli/blob/e8cdfa6020b8856498f9ea86b1fbbddb3f767975/packages/angular_devkit/build_angular/src/angular-cli-files/models/webpack-configs/typescript.ts#L94\r\n\r\nSetting this to `true` made sense when there was no way to customize the webpack config. However, now that CLI Builders are [officially supported](https://blog.angular.io/introducing-cli-builders-d012d4489f1b), it will become more common for builders like [`@angular-builders/custom-webpack`](https://github.com/just-jeb/angular-builders/tree/master/packages/custom-webpack) to be used to customize the webpack configuration. But with `directTemplateLoading` being hard-coded to `true`, there is no way to customize the webpack configuration to allow a loader to manipulate a component's template.\r\n\r\n### Describe the solution you'd like\r\n\r\nLet the `directTemplateLoading` option be set in the `angular.json` file. For example:\r\n\r\n```json\r\n\"architect\": {\r\n  \"build\": {\r\n    \"builder\": \"@angular-builders/custom-webpack:browser\",\r\n    \"options\": {\r\n      \"directTemplateLoading\": false,\r\n      \"customWebpackConfig\": {\r\n        \"path\": \"./webpack.config.js\"\r\n      },\r\n      \"etc\": \"etc\"\r\n```\r\n\r\n\r\n### Describe alternatives you've considered\r\n\r\nThis idea has been raised before in a couple of issues, but both were closed with workarounds or hacks. Since CLI Builders are now officially supported, I feel that a proper solution is required.\r\n\r\n#### Use `template` and inline loaders\r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/angular/angular-cli/issues/14855#issuecomment-510592634 suggests using `template` and specifying the loaders in the require statement instead of using `templateUrl`.\r\n\r\n> Hi all, we had a chat around this, and we think that if you want to use webpack specific stuff you can use [ngx-build-plus](https://github.com/manfredsteyer/ngx-build-plus) or otherwise you can update the require statements to include the raw-loader import syntax ie: `require('!raw-loader!./path-to-template.html')` as suggested above.\r\n\r\nManually specifying the same loaders for _every_ component template is not maintainable.\r\n\r\n#### Hack the webpack config\r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/angular/angular-cli/issues/14534#issuecomment-496666971 states that a hack is required to set `directTemplateLoading`:\r\n\r\n> Closing as the above method is a necessary step to augment an existing plugin within a webpack configuration.\r\n\r\nThe \"above method\" is to search through the plugins in the webpack config and find the `AngularCompilerPlugin`, get it's options, change the `directTemplateLoading` value to false, create a new instance of the plugin with the modified options and replace the original plugin in the webpack config. Very hacky.\r\n\r\n#### Use `template` with loaders in the webpack config\r\n\r\nSimilar to the outcome of #14855, you can:\r\n\r\n1. Install `@types/node`.\r\n2. Add `\"node\"` to the `types` property of the tsconfig file.\r\n3. Change `templateUrl: './foo.component.html` to `template: require('./foo.component.html')`\r\n\r\nand the custom loaders specified in the webpack config will be used. _But_ this requires you to make changes to the way the component's template is specified by default, which is easy to forget to do. That's just asking for problems because forgetting to change `templateUrl` to `template` means it won't be passed through the custom loaders.\r\n\r\nIn addition to that, the Angular Language Service complains that _\"Component 'FooComponent' must have a template or templateUrl\"_.  \r\n\r\nGiven the choice between this and hacking the webpack config to recreate the `AngularCompilerPlugin`, I'd choose hacking the webpack config. 😁 ","Url":"https://github.com/angular/angular-cli/issues/15861","RelatedDescription":"Closed issue \"Allow directTemplateLoading to be set from angular.json\" (#15861)"},{"Id":"508538465","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2019-10-17T17:45:13","Actor":"filipesilva","Number":"15866","RawContent":null,"Title":"fix(@ngtools/webpack): don't set ngprogram to null","State":"closed","Body":"It should be undefined instead: https://github.com/angular/angular/blob/cd7b1992193be85f3317a4ef793b13c03ac2b215/packages/compiler-cli/src/ngtsc/program.ts#L161\r\n\r\nFix https://github.com/angular/angular-cli/issues/15857","Url":"https://github.com/angular/angular-cli/pull/15866","RelatedDescription":"Closed or merged PR \"fix(@ngtools/webpack): don't set ngprogram to null\" (#15866)"},{"Id":"507895035","IsPullRequest":false,"CreatedAt":"2019-10-17T17:45:13","Actor":"filipesilva","Number":"15857","RawContent":null,"Title":"Follow up on @angular-devkit/build-angular spec_large error","State":"closed","Body":"This should really be using Ivy but was getting the error below on every second build.\r\n`ERROR in Cannot read property 'incrementalState' of null`\r\n\r\nSee https://github.com/angular/angular-cli/pull/15847/commits/0a4dd9b209cbaaaabbe25bc09cb538948fa4b148","Url":"https://github.com/angular/angular-cli/issues/15857","RelatedDescription":"Closed issue \"Follow up on @angular-devkit/build-angular spec_large error\" (#15857)"},{"Id":"508528782","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2019-10-17T16:55:57","Actor":"filipesilva","Number":"15864","RawContent":null,"Title":"test: add jit-prod e2e","State":"closed","Body":"","Url":"https://github.com/angular/angular-cli/pull/15864","RelatedDescription":"Closed or merged PR \"test: add jit-prod e2e\" (#15864)"},{"Id":"508261344","IsPullRequest":false,"CreatedAt":"2019-10-17T16:44:06","Actor":"Mobitelnoc","Number":"15859","RawContent":null,"Title":"Angular new project creating error occurred.How can fix this all installations are done perfectly with latest modules","State":"closed","Body":"🛑🛑🛑🛑🛑🛑🛑🛑🛑🛑🛑🛑🛑🛑🛑🛑🛑🛑🛑🛑🛑🛑🛑🛑🛑🛑🛑\r\nAngular new project creating error occurred.\r\n[2019-10-17T05_45_55_373Z-debug.log](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli/files/3737643/2019-10-17T05_45_55_373Z-debug.log)\r\n\r\nPlease file any Docs or angular.io issues at: https://github.com/angular/angular/issues/new/choose\r\n\r\nFor the time being, we keep Angular AIO issues in a separate repository.\r\n\r\n🛑🛑🛑🛑🛑🛑🛑🛑🛑🛑🛑🛑🛑🛑🛑🛑🛑🛑🛑🛑🛑🛑🛑🛑🛑🛑🛑\r\n","Url":"https://github.com/angular/angular-cli/issues/15859","RelatedDescription":"Closed issue \"Angular new project creating error occurred.How can fix this all installations are done perfectly with latest modules\" (#15859)"},{"Id":"508542636","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2019-10-17T15:08:30","Actor":"cexbrayat","Number":"15867","RawContent":null,"Title":"fix(@schematics/angular): remove unneeded debugElement in test","State":"open","Body":"The generate tests in `app.component.spec.ts` are using `fixture.debugElement.componentInstance` whereas we can directly use `fixture.componentInstance`.
