It uses\r\nthis file to compare timestamps and decide if XML files need fixed up\r\nor not.\r\n\r\nSupplying `$(_AndroidResgenFlagFile)` seemed to be the way to go here,\r\nsince `_UpdateAndroidResgen` runs right before this task. It also\r\nsolves the original problem from the `Tabbar.axml` file.\r\n\r\nI also realized we should be using a \"stamp\" file for the\r\n`_GenerateJavaStubs` MSBuild target, in general.\r\n\r\nThis gives us several benefits:\r\n- `ConvertResourcesCases` has a proper `AndroidConversionFlagFile` it\r\n  can use for checking timestamps\r\n- The `Outputs` of the target are drastically simplified, this should\r\n  help peformance in MSBuild evaluating if the target should run\r\n- It is likely more precise/correct.\r\n\r\nSo I added a new file in `$(IntermediateOutputPath)`,\r\n`obj\\Debug\\_javastubs.stamp` we use to determine if\r\n`_GenerateJavaStubs` should run.\r\n\r\nI also tried to do things \"the right way\", such as:\r\n- Adding the stamp file to the `FileWrites` item group\r\n- Made sure the file is deleted during a `Clean`\r\n\r\nAfter these changes, two instances of `ConvertResourcesCases` were\r\n*still* fighting each other. They would always run and update the\r\ntimestamps on one file: causing the other one to run.\r\n\r\n`ConvertResourcesCases` runs twice:\r\n- In the `_UpdateAndroidResgen` target\r\n- In the `_GenerateJavaStubs` target\r\n\r\nBut these are both working with the same files, so in the second case,\r\nwe need to make sure `_GenerateJavaStubs` updates the timestamp on the\r\n*first* flag file so the target doesn't run every time.\r\n\r\n### Problem 2\r\n\r\nTimestamps of Xamarin.Forms assemblies in `obj\\Debug\\linksrc` were out\r\nof date!\r\n\r\nI updated the `_CopyIntermediateAssemblies` target to update the\r\ntimestamps of all files within this directory. It did not appear to be\r\ndoing it correctly, and was only running `<Touch />` on a subset of\r\nassemblies.\r\n\r\n### Problem 3\r\n\r\nAfter fixing No. 2, the next problem I noticed were `*.pdb` and\r\n`*.mdb` files in `obj\\Debug\\linksrc` were out of date!\r\n\r\nThe problem here was a call to `<Touch />`:\r\n\r\n    <Touch Files=\"@(_DebugFilesCopiedToLinkerSrc)\" />\r\n\r\nThe `_DebugFilesCopiedToLinkerSrc` did not appear to contain any\r\nitems!\r\n\r\nI updated the `_CopyPdbFiles` and `_CopyMdbFiles` targets to use the\r\ncorrect item groups.\r\n\r\n### Problem 4\r\n\r\nLastly, after fixing the previous three issues, the timestamps of\r\noutput assemblies in `obj\\Release\\android\\assets` were not correct for\r\n`Release` builds.\r\n\r\nI had made a change for this in the past, which was making `Debug`\r\nbuilds work correctly:\r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/xamarin/xamarin-android/pull/2028\r\n\r\nAt the time I wrote #2028, since the test wasn't using Xamarin.Forms,\r\nI did not see the problem ocurring in `Release` mode. It *does* occur\r\nif you are using NuGet packages.\r\n\r\nI replicated what I changed in the `_LinkAssembliesNoShrink` target,\r\nand also renamed the item groups to be unique:\r\n- `_LinkAssembliesNoShrinkFiles`\r\n- `_LinkAssembliesShrinkFiles`\r\n\r\n### Other changes\r\n\r\nThe `CheckTimestamps` test also was verifying timestamps in\r\n`$(OutputPath)` such as `bin\\Debug`.\r\n\r\nIt appears the core MSBuild targets are leaving timestamps as-is in\r\nthe `CopyFilesToOutputDirectory` and `_CopyFilesMarkedCopyLocal`\r\ntargets. Assemblies from Xamarin.Forms NuGet are out of date here, but\r\nI don't think we should do anything, since the core MSBuild targets\r\nare doing this.\r\n\r\nFor now, I removed the checks for `$(OutputPath)` in this test, and\r\ncleaned up the test a bit."},{"Id":"8197179289","Type":"PullRequestEvent","CreatedAt":"2018-08-31T12:35:31","Actor":"radekdoulik","Repository":"xamarin/xamarin-android","Organization":"xamarin","RawContent":null,"RelatedAction":"opened","RelatedUrl":"https://github.com/xamarin/xamarin-android/pull/2127","RelatedDescription":"Opened pull request \"[monodroid] Add java-interop-jvm.c to desktop libmonodroid\" (#2127) at xamarin/xamarin-android","RelatedBody":"So that `jnimarshalmethod-gen.exe` (and possible future desktop\r\nutilities, which would use JVM) work."}],"ResultType":"GitHubEvent"},"Forms":{"Events":[{"Id":"8200286104","Type":"IssuesEvent","CreatedAt":"2018-09-01T02:00:14","Actor":"devmikew","Repository":"xamarin/Xamarin.Forms","Organization":"xamarin","RawContent":null,"RelatedAction":"opened","RelatedUrl":"https://github.com/xamarin/Xamarin.Forms/issues/3692","RelatedDescription":"Opened issue \"Cant access x:Name property of an XF control\" (#3692) at xamarin/Xamarin.Forms","RelatedBody":"It would be nice to be able to access the x:Name property of an XF control, either created directly in XAML, or in a style/control template.\r\n\r\nAlso, to copy that name to the top level native control created by the renderer.\r\n\r\nEg, in Windows a FrameWorkElement has a Name property which is copied from the XAML.\r\n\r\nAndroid has Id, however it is an integer.
