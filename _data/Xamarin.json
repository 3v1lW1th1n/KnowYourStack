They can also be\r\nexpected to produce *lots* of build log output.\r\n\r\nWhat's unexpected is the *vast size* of the build logs: a \"normal\" PR\r\nbuild log is usually ~20-30MB in size.  Add in a complete mono bump,\r\nand the build log becomes 1.4GB.\r\n\r\nTake a page out of commit 987a05fa8: the Console log has \"normal\"\r\nverbosity, and `.binlog` files are produced which contain \"diagnostic\"\r\nlevel output.  Why does the Console log for mono bumps need to be so\r\nginormous?\r\n\r\nThe answer is, they don't.\r\n\r\nUpdate the `<Exec/>` tasks within `mono-runtimes.targets` so that\r\n`StandardOutputImportance=\"Low\"` is specified.  This will *hide*\r\nmono's build messages from the normal Console output, while preserving\r\nthe build logs within the `.binlog` files.\r\n\r\nThis should make the default Console log significantly smaller, which\r\nin turn will allow the Jenkins **Failure Cause Management** scanning\r\nto be effective.  (If the Console log is too large, then the error\r\nindicators that Failure Cause Management aren't actually checked.)\r\n\r\nIf the full mono build log is necessary, it can still be obtained from\r\nthe `.binlog` files within the `xa-build-status*.zip` package."},{"Id":"9208899787","Type":"PullRequestEvent","CreatedAt":"2019-03-08T20:31:19","Actor":"jonathanpeppers","Repository":"xamarin/xamarin-android","Organization":"xamarin","RawContent":null,"RelatedAction":"opened","RelatedUrl":"https://github.com/xamarin/xamarin-android/pull/2809","RelatedDescription":"Opened pull request \"[build] improve XA's build for proguard & r8\" (#2809) at xamarin/xamarin-android","RelatedBody":"If you build `Xamarin.Android.sln`, a lot of stuff happens even if\r\nthere are no changes...\r\n\r\nOur build doesn't follow our own \"MSBuild Best Practices\", and we have\r\na few MSBuild targets that always run.\r\n\r\n## r8.csproj ##\r\n\r\nThe main problem here was that we were invoking `gradlew` every time,\r\nand it takes quite a while to startup when using the `--no-daemon`\r\nswitch.\r\n\r\nI added proper `Inputs` and `Outputs` for the `_BuildR8` MSBuild\r\ntarget, as well as a `<Touch/>` call.\r\n\r\nThese changes saved 6 seconds(!!!) on incremental builds of\r\n`Xamarin.Android.sln`.\r\n\r\n## proguard.csproj ##\r\n\r\nThis project was invoking `<Ant/>` and copying files every time.\r\n\r\nI cleaned this project up a bit by creating an `@(_Outputs)` item\r\ngroup to be used throughout.

Download the repro (the creatively-named, perhaps legendary?\r\n   `App72.sln`)\r\n2. Delete the `bin` and `obj` directories\r\n3. Open a new VS for Mac instance. (`Automatic NuGet restore` should\r\n   be off)\r\n4. Open the solution, wait for any build progress to complete such as\r\n   `Updating resources...`, etc.\r\n5. Restore NuGet packages via `Project->Restore NuGet Packages`\r\n6. Open `MainPage.xaml`: designer displays a gray rectangle that says\r\n   \"AndroidFormsPreviewerRenderer\"\r\n\r\nDoing a full Build solves the problem, but this is the whole point of\r\nthe \"build-less\" designer/previewer feature in Dev16.\r\n\r\nBehind the scenes, the failure is the `SetupDependenciesForDesigner`\r\nMSBuild target. Opening the designer's log file, there are lots and\r\nlots of `javac` errors, such as:\r\n\r\n    ERROR: :   :  error: cannot find symbol\r\n        public Toolbar_NavigationOnClickEventDispatcher (android.support.v7.widget.Toolbar p0)\r\n    symbol:   class Toolbar\r\n    location: package android.support.v7.widget\r\n\r\nDoing more digging, I was able to reproduce the problem with a bash\r\nscript:\r\n\r\n    PROJ='App72/App72.Android/App72.Android.csproj'\r\n    SLN='App72.sln'\r\n    MSBUILD_ARGS='/nologo /v:quiet /p:DesignTimeBuild=True /p:BuildingInsideVisualStudio=True'\r\n    DESIGNER_ARGS='/p:AndroidUseManagedDesignTimeResourceGenerator=False'\r\n    MSBUILD=msbuild\r\n\r\n    # If you have a local xamarin-android build\r\n    MSBUILD=\"$HOME/Desktop/Git/xamarin-android/bin/Debug/bin/xabuild\"\r\n\r\n    rm logs.zip *.binlog\r\n    rm -r App72/App72.Android/obj App72/App72.Android/bin\r\n\r\n    $MSBUILD $PROJ $MSBUILD_ARGS \\\r\n        /t:UpdateAndroidResources /bl:dtb1.binlog\r\n\r\n    $MSBUILD $SLN $MSBUILD_ARGS /t:Restore /bl:restore.binlog\r\n\r\n    $MSBUILD $PROJ $MSBUILD_ARGS $DESIGNER_ARGS \\\r\n        /t:SetupDependenciesForDesigner /bl:designer2.binlog\r\n\r\n    zip logs.zip *.binlog\r\n\r\nAt this point, I could also reproduce the problem with\r\nxamarin-android/master. So, this is a not something we've fixed in\r\nmaster.\r\n\r\nNow... We have `DesignerTests.DesignerBeforeNuGetRestore` which does\r\nalmost *exactly* what this script is doing!\r\n\r\nBut then I tried splitting apart the NuGet restore, to more closely\r\nmatch the script. When calling `/t:Restore` in a separate MSBuild\r\ncall, the existing test we have failed in the exact same way as the\r\nscript: many `javac` errors.\r\n\r\nI reviewed the `binlog` file, looking for any interesting MSBuild\r\ntargets that were skipped:\r\n\r\n    Skipping target \"_BuildLibraryImportsCache\" because all output files are up-to-date with respect to the input files.\r\n\r\nGoing back through @alanmcgovern's notes, he could resolve the problem\r\nby deleting this file:\r\n\r\n    obj/Debug/designtime/libraryimports.cache.stamp\r\n\r\nBut then reviewing, the `Inputs` for `_BuildLibraryImportsCache`, they\r\ndidn't seem to be correct?\r\n\r\n    <Target Name=\"_BuildLibraryImportsCache\"\r\n        Inputs=\"$(MSBuildProjectFullPath);@(ReferencePath);@(ReferenceDependencyPaths);$(_AndroidBuildPropertiesCache)\"\r\n        Outputs=\"$(_AndroidLibraryImportsCache).stamp\">\r\n      <GetImportedLibraries ... CacheFile=\"$(_AndroidLibraryImportsCache)\" />\r\n      <Touch Files=\"$(_AndroidLibraryImportsCache).stamp\" AlwaysCreate=\"True\" />\r\n\r\nIf `<GetImportedLibraries/>` operates on\r\n`$(_AndroidLibraryProjectImportsCache)`, shouldn't it be an `Input`?\r\n\r\nSure enough, adding one more input solved the problem.\r\n\r\nI looked through our git history, and these `Inputs` have been this\r\nway at least since 2016.
