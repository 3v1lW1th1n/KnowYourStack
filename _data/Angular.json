The most common case that I have seen is that developers want to tweak the contrast colors of a specific theme. \r\n1. However, it is also common to need to change just 1 or 2 colors, in an existing palette, slightly to match company branding.\r\n1.

There are a number of gotchas and ways to get implementing a custom theme wrong. Having a schematic for this would help streamline that experience and fits well without our goals for Angular Material schematics.\r\n\r\nIt's likely that a good deal of our existing `ng add` logic for adding a custom theme could be re-used. It looks like the `ng add` logic already handles things like adding a custom theme to a project that only uses CSS (it adds a `custom-theme.scss` file and then adds that to the `styles` array in the `angular.json`).\r\n\r\nThere may be a need to allow the caller to point to the files where they import their prebuilt theme, as they may have moved it out of `src/styles.scss`. But maybe it's possible to walk the imports to find it?\r\n\r\n#### Proposal\r\n\r\n`ng g @angular/material:customTheme`","Url":"https://github.com/angular/components/issues/16416","RelatedDescription":"Open issue \"schematic(theme): migrate project from prebuilt to custom theme\" (#16416)"},{"Id":"462775604","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2019-07-01T15:23:20","Actor":"d3-yaroslav-zakharov","Number":"16415","RawContent":null,"Title":"dummy component","State":"closed","Body":"Do not merge just for example","Url":"https://github.com/angular/components/pull/16415","RelatedDescription":"Closed or merged PR \"dummy component\" (#16415)"},{"Id":"462558950","IsPullRequest":false,"CreatedAt":"2019-07-01T07:34:38","Actor":"olegdunkan","Number":"16414","RawContent":null,"Title":"Tabs selected index ","State":"open","Body":"#### Reproduction\r\n\r\nSteps to reproduce:\r\n1. https://stackblitz.com/edit/angular-dj4jrm\r\n2. click on tab with label \"...\"\r\n3. add new tab\r\n#### Expected Behavior\r\n\r\nWhat behavior were you expecting to see?\r\nI expected that active tab won't change. \r\n\r\n#### Actual Behavior\r\n\r\nWhat behavior did you actually see?\r\n\r\nThe active tab are changed and getting with the label \"...\", but selectedIndex aren't changed.\r\nWe see inconsistent state - active tab with index that is not the same as selectedIndex.\r\n\r\n\r\n","Url":"https://github.com/angular/components/issues/16414","RelatedDescription":"Open issue \"Tabs selected index \" (#16414)"},{"Id":"462455913","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2019-06-30T22:59:52","Actor":"jysoo","Number":"16413","RawContent":null,"Title":"fix(sort): let MatSort method animate MatSortHeader arrow","State":"open","Body":"fixes #15715","Url":"https://github.com/angular/components/pull/16413","RelatedDescription":"Open PR \"fix(sort): let MatSort method animate MatSortHeader arrow\" (#16413)"},{"Id":"462445758","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2019-06-30T20:55:52","Actor":"literalpie","Number":"16412","RawContent":null,"Title":"refactor: add virtual scroll repeater interface","State":"open","Body":"taking over for PR #14287 which has gone a while without updates.

Since no dense mode and since we have a custom looking material inputs, I had to make my own customization on the scss theme of the form field. The problem appeared when I changed the font size and the font itself of the floating label. Suddenly I saw that the borders are overlapping the text.\r\n```\r\nconst floatingLabelScale = 0.75;\r\nconst outlineGapPadding = 5;\r\n```\r\nthese values are based on some assumption that the label size will never be customized.\r\nNow, in order to override this behavior I had to create my own directive that changes the values \r\nand recalculate the gaps. \r\nSo I would like to request a change of this logic to calculate gaps dynamically, or to expose these 2 numbers as inputs or something that can be changed from outside.
