Alpine is much smaller than Debian, which we have used for the .NET Core base image to date. There have been many requests for an Alpine image. We are pleased to make it available. Please check out [.NET Core Docker Alpine Production Sample (Preview)](https://github.com/dotnet/dotnet-docker-samples/blob/master/dotnetapp-prod-alpine-preview/README.md) to see examples of using this image.\r\n\r\nWe have added two new images:\r\n\r\n- `2.1-runtime-alpine`\r\n- `2.1-runtime-deps-alpine`\r\n\r\nAlpine support is part of the .NET Core 2.1 release. .NET Core 2.1 images are currently provided at the [microsoft/dotnet-nightly](https://hub.docker.com/r/microsoft/dotnet-nightly/) repo, including the new Alpine images. .NET Core 2.1 images will be promoted to the [microsoft/dotnet](https://hub.docker.com/r/microsoft/dotnet/) repo when .NET Core 2.1 is shipped as a Preview, expected to be early 2018.\r\n\r\n## Discussion\r\n\r\nPlease share your thoughts on this change and see what others are saying at:\r\n\r\n* [dotnet/dotnet-docker-nightly #500](https://github.com/dotnet/dotnet-docker-nightly/issues/500)\r\n\r\n## Details\r\n\r\n* [dotnet/dotnet-docker-nightly #480](https://github.com/dotnet/dotnet-docker-nightly/pull/480)\r\n* [dotnet/announcements #20](https://github.com/dotnet/announcements/issues/20)\r\n* [dotnet/dotnet-docker-samples #94](https://github.com/dotnet/dotnet-docker-samples/pull/94)\r\n\r\nThe primary goal of Alpine is very small deployments. We have been considering various design decisions to make .NET Core Alpine base images as small as possible to align with that. In this first iteration, we enabled [.NET Core 2.0 Globalization Invariant Mode](https://github.com/dotnet/announcements/issues/20) in order to reduce the default size of the image. This change reduced the image by ~30MB. You can see the reduction in size for .NET Core images relative to Debian in the following table.\r\n\r\n|2.1 Image|Debian|Alpine|\r\n|-----    |------|------|\r\n|`-deps`   |153MB (68MB compressed) |13.8 MB (6MB compressed)|\r\n|`-runtime`|222MB (96MB compressed) |82.5 (34MB compressed)|\r\n\r\nNote: The compressed size is what you will see in a [registry](https://hub.docker.com/r/microsoft/dotnet-nightly/tags/) and is the wire-size cost.\r\n\r\nWe are also considering saving more space by native-compiling fewer assemblies. .NET Core runtime assemblies are native-compiled with the [crossgen tool](https://github.com/dotnet/coreclr/blob/master/Documentation/building/crossgen.md) in the [Ready2Run format](https://github.com/dotnet/coreclr/blob/master/Documentation/botr/readytorun-overview.md). Native-compiled code delivers superior startup performance but at the cost of 2-3x larger files. We have the opportunity to compile less, skipping compiling assemblies in part or in whole. We believe that we can save at least another 10MB through compiling less without a material drop in performance. For scenarios that value size over startup or where wire cost is significant, it may be valuable to aggressively reduce the number/% of compilation.\r\n\r\nAlpine images are only available for .NET Core 2.1. At the current time, only Runtime images are available. We intend to offer SDK images at a later date.\r\n\r\nUse cases that cannot tolerate Globalization invariant mode can reset the `DOTNET_SYSTEM_GLOBALIZATION_INVARIANT` environment variable and install the ICU package. Please check out [.NET Core Docker Alpine Production Sample (Preview)](https://github.com/dotnet/dotnet-docker-samples/blob/master/dotnetapp-prod-alpine-preview/README.md) to see examples of using this image with and without Globalization Invariant Mode enabled.\r\n\r\n## Call to Action\r\n\r\nPlease test your workloads with the new Alpine image. In particular, we want to know if enabling .NET Core Globalization Invariant Mode is acceptable/appreciated.\r\n"}],"ResultType":"GitHubEvent"},"CoreCLR":{"Events":[{"Id":"7026511115","Type":"PullRequestEvent","CreatedAt":"2017-12-24T04:52:42","Actor":"benaadams","Repository":"dotnet/coreclr","Organization":"dotnet","RawContent":null,"RelatedAction":"opened","RelatedUrl":"https://github.com/dotnet/coreclr/pull/15629","RelatedDescription":"Opened pull request \"[WIP] Reduce EC Save+Restore for Default context\" (#15629) at dotnet/coreclr","RelatedBody":"Alternative approach to https://github.com/dotnet/coreclr/pull/11100 as suggested by @kouvel https://github.com/dotnet/coreclr/pull/11100#discussion_r113028941\r\n\r\nResolves #11126; would need corresponding corert changes to non-shared AsyncMethodBuilder/Thread"},{"Id":"7026358551","Type":"PullRequestEvent","CreatedAt":"2017-12-24T01:43:28","Actor":"ahsonkhan","Repository":"dotnet/coreclr","Organization":"dotnet","RawContent":null,"RelatedAction":"merged","RelatedUrl":"https://github.com/dotnet/coreclr/pull/15557","RelatedDescription":"Merged pull request \"Make DangerousGetPinnableReference internal and remove DangerousTryGetArray\" (#15557) at dotnet/coreclr","RelatedBody":"Fixes:\r\nhttps://github.com/dotnet/corefx/issues/25412\r\nhttps://github.com/dotnet/corefx/issues/25615\r\n\r\nAlso fixes https://github.com/dotnet/corefx/issues/23881\r\n\r\n**Blocked until all uses of DangerousGetPinnableReference and DangerousTryGetArray are replaced with MemoryMarshal APIs (in progress).**\r\n\r\nRelated corefx PR: https://github.com/dotnet/corefx/pull/25964\r\n\r\nFollowing the staging plan from here: https://github.com/dotnet/corefx/issues/23881#issuecomment-343767740\r\n\r\n- [x] Add MemoryExtensions.GetReference/TryGetArray\r\n- [x] Convert all uses of DangerousGetPinnableReference/DangerousTryGetArray in coreclr, corefx, corert, corefxlab, aspnet, ... to MemoryExtensions.GetReference\r\n- [x] Change DangerousGetPinnableReference to whatever we like to make it fit the pinning pattern and remove DangerousTryGetArray.\r\n\r\nDoing it this way will avoid the need for complex staging or things being on the floor for extensive periods of time.\r\n\r\ncc @jkotas, @stephentoub, @KrzysztofCwalina, @davidfowl "},{"Id":"7026333903","Type":"PullRequestEvent","CreatedAt":"2017-12-24T01:14:31","Actor":"dotnet-maestro-bot","Repository":"dotnet/coreclr","Organization":"dotnet","RawContent":null,"RelatedAction":"opened","RelatedUrl":"https://github.com/dotnet/coreclr/pull/15628","RelatedDescription":"Opened pull request \"Update CoreClr to preview1-26024-01 (master)\" (#15628) at dotnet/coreclr","RelatedBody":"/cc @dotnet/coreclr-auto-update-notify"},{"Id":"7026329053","Type":"IssuesEvent","CreatedAt":"2017-12-24T01:08:21","Actor":"itadapter","Repository":"dotnet/coreclr","Organization":"dotnet","RawContent":null,"RelatedAction":"closed","RelatedUrl":"https://github.com/dotnet/coreclr/issues/15626","RelatedDescription":"Closed issue \"OrdinalCaseSensitiveComparer is ISerializable but missing deserialization .ctor(streamingcontext ...etc...)\" (#15626) at dotnet/coreclr","RelatedBody":"https://github.com/dotnet/coreclr/blob/da8b7181dbe362fbfe64c7ef72ff3a4a7db68f24/src/mscorlib/shared/System/StringComparer.cs#L327\r\n\r\nCauses binary deserialization (since there is no .ctor) problems need to add the .ctor complementing \r\n`GetObjectData(SerializationInfo info, StreamingContext context)`\r\n"},{"Id":"7026226342","Type":"PullRequestEvent","CreatedAt":"2017-12-23T23:09:10","Actor":"RussellHaley","Repository":"dotnet/coreclr","Organization":"dotnet","RawContent":null,"RelatedAction":"opened","RelatedUrl":"https://github.com/dotnet/coreclr/pull/15627","RelatedDescription":"Opened pull request \"Changes to tests build system for FreeBSD integration \" (#15627) at dotnet/coreclr","RelatedBody":"This is a preliminary review of the changes that I have made to progress the coreclr FreeBSD tests.
