However, if the user navigates to another component (map2) that also creates an Amchart map in its ngOnInit(), the map in the second component is not created and I get only an empty div (confirmed also by inspecting the dom). \r\n\r\nAmcharts requires that we provide the id of the div that it will use to create the chart when we call its makeChart function.  The chart/map is created as a child element of that div.\r\nexample: `<div id=\"chartdiv\" class=\"map\"></div>`\r\n\r\nI have noticed that the problem only occurs when the divs used in both compoments (map1 and map2) have the same id.  If I use different ids, the map is always created as expected.\r\nexample: \r\nMap1 template:\r\n`<div id=\"chartdiv1\" class=\"map\"></div>`\r\nMap2 template:\r\n`<div id=\"chartdiv2\" class=\"map\"></div>`\r\n\r\nI have also noticed that when I use the same Id for both divs, and I therefore have the problem, I can briefly see that the map gets created a fraction of a second before leaving the component when I navigate from a component with a failed map (empty div) to another component that creates a map in a div with the same Id.\r\n\r\nThe behavior described above leads me to believe that, with Ivy, when I navigate to another component, the code in ngOnInit() starts its execution in the context of the template of the previous component that has not yet been deleted.  That would explain why the map is not created when I navigate from one component having a map to another one that tries to create one.\r\n\r\nThe workaround involving having different div's id works in this context but If I were to refactor the application to encapsulate the map in a dedicated component and insert that component in both map1 and map2 components it would likely not work because again a div with the same id would exist in two different routes.\r\n\r\n## üî¨ Minimal Reproduction\r\nI have created a minimal reproduction in the following repo: [TestIvyRc4](https://github.com/MakesNine/TestIvyRc4)\r\n\r\n- The master branch contains the code that generates the error.\r\nng serve, open the app on localhost:4200, click the link \"Navigate to first component with a map\" than click the other link, \"Navigate to second component with a map\".\r\n\r\n- The ivy-false branch contains the same code but Ivy set to false in the angularCompilerOptions.  You can verify that the problem doesn't occur with this branch.\r\n\r\n- In the third branch named fix-chartdiv, you have the same code as in master except for the different ids provided in the templates of both map components.  The changed ids are also used accordingly in the createChart function of these components.  You can use this branch to confirm that the error goes away using a different id for each div.\r\n\r\n\r\n## üî• Exception or Error\r\nThe application doesn't throw an exception/ error.  You can see however that the map isn't created.\r\n\r\n\r\n## üåç  Your Environment\r\n\r\n**Angular Version:**\r\n   / \\   _ __   __ _ _   _| | __ _ _ __     / ___| |   |_ _|\r\n   / ‚ñ≥ \\ | '_ \\ / _` | | | | |/ _` | '__|   | |   | |    | |\r\n  / ___ \\| | | | (_| | |_| | | (_| | |      | |___| |___ | |\r\n /_/   \\_\\_| |_|\\__, |\\__,_|_|\\__,_|_|       \\____|_____|___|\r\n                |___/\r\n\r\n\r\nAngular CLI: 9.0.0-rc.4\r\nNode: 10.15.0\r\nOS: win32 x64\r\n\r\nAngular: 9.0.0-rc.4\r\n... animations, cli, common, compiler, compiler-cli, core, forms\r\n... language-service, platform-browser, platform-browser-dynamic\r\n... router\r\nIvy Workspace: Yes\r\n\r\nPackage                            Version\r\n------------------------------------------------------------\r\n@angular-devkit/architect          0.900.0-rc.4\r\n@angular-devkit/build-angular      0.900.0-rc.4\r\n@angular-devkit/build-ng-packagr   0.900.0-rc.4\r\n@angular-devkit/build-optimizer    0.900.0-rc.4\r\n@angular-devkit/build-webpack      0.900.0-rc.4\r\n@angular-devkit/core               9.0.0-rc.4\r\n@angular-devkit/schematics         9.0.0-rc.4\r\n@ngtools/webpack                   9.0.0-rc.4\r\n@schematics/angular                9.0.0-rc.4\r\n@schematics/update                 0.900.0-rc.4\r\nng-packagr                         9.0.0-rc.2\r\nrxjs                               6.5.3\r\ntypescript                         3.6.4\r\nwebpack                            4.41.2\r\n\r\nOther information:\r\nWe do have a workaround for the map creation problem, but I'm afraid that we will encounter other synchronization problems if it is confirmed that ngOnInit code can execute in the context of the template of a previous route.","Url":"https://github.com/angular/angular/issues/34139","RelatedDescription":"Open issue \"Ivy: html elements from previous route are still in the DOM when ngOnInit and ngAfterViewInit are executed\" (#34139)"},{"Id":"530054543","IsPullRequest":false,"CreatedAt":"2019-11-28T19:26:03","Actor":"Wintermoose","Number":"34138","RawContent":null,"Title":"ngcc cannot handle UMD factory without parameters ( renderFactoryParameters )","State":"open","Body":"\r\n# üêû bug report\r\n\r\n### Affected Package\r\nThe issue is caused by package @angular/compiler-cli\r\n\r\n### Is this a regression?\r\n\r\nDon't know\r\n\r\n### Description\r\n\r\nAs part of our internal library, we have simple module that has no dependencies (two of them actually, but here I'll pick the primitive one).

It would be nice if a more descriptive text could be added for the angular dependencies especially if they are downloaded by over a million people every week.","Url":"https://github.com/angular/angular-cli/issues/16319","RelatedDescription":"Open issue \"Description for \"@angular-devkit/build-angular\"\" (#16319)"},{"Id":"530287008","IsPullRequest":false,"CreatedAt":"2019-11-29T14:20:33","Actor":"nickbullock","Number":"16315","RawContent":null,"Title":"[9.0.0-rc.4] angular/devkit: input.match is not a function (caused by raw-loader)","State":"closed","Body":"<!--üîÖüîÖüîÖüîÖüîÖüîÖüîÖüîÖüîÖüîÖüîÖüîÖüîÖüîÖüîÖüîÖüîÖüîÖüîÖüîÖüîÖüîÖüîÖüîÖüîÖüîÖüîÖüîÖüîÖüîÖüîÖ\r\n\r\nOh hi there! üòÑ\r\n\r\nTo expedite issue processing please search open and closed issues before submitting a new one.\r\nExisting issues often contain information about workarounds, resolution, or progress updates.\r\n\r\nüîÖüîÖüîÖüîÖüîÖüîÖüîÖüîÖüîÖüîÖüîÖüîÖüîÖüîÖüîÖüîÖüîÖüîÖüîÖüîÖüîÖüîÖüîÖüîÖüîÖüîÖüîÖüîÖüîÖüîÖüîÖüîÖüîÖ-->\r\n\r\n# üêû Bug report\r\n\r\n### Command (mark with an `x`)\r\n<!-- Can you pin-point the command or commands that are effected by this bug? -->\r\n<!-- ‚úçÔ∏èedit: -->\r\n\r\n- [ ] new\r\n- [ ] build\r\n- [x] serve\r\n- [ ] test\r\n- [ ] e2e\r\n- [ ] generate\r\n- [ ] add\r\n- [ ] update\r\n- [ ] lint\r\n- [ ] xi18n\r\n- [ ] run\r\n- [ ] config\r\n- [ ] help\r\n- [ ] version\r\n- [ ] doc\r\n\r\n\r\n### Is this a regression?\r\n\r\n<!-- Did this behavior use to work in the previous version? -->\r\n<!-- ‚úçÔ∏è--> Yes, the previous version in which this bug was not present was: 9.0.0-rc2\r\n\r\n\r\n### Description\r\n\r\n<!-- ‚úçÔ∏è--> I've got this problem in storybook/angular (but it is not a storybook problem, because it uses @angular/devkit webpack configuration)\r\n\r\nstyles configuration in rc2:\r\n```\r\n  test: /\\.less$/,\r\n  use: [\r\n    { loader: 'raw-loader' },\r\n    { loader: 'postcss-loader', options: [Object] },\r\n    { loader: 'less-loader', options: [Object] }\r\n  ]\r\n\r\n```\r\nin rc4:\r\n```\r\n  test: /\\.less$/,\r\n  use: [\r\n    {\r\n      loader: '/Users/nikita.balakirev/Desktop/Projects/ccm_portal/node_modules/@angular-devkit/build-angular/node_modules/raw-loader/dist/cjs.js'\r\n    },\r\n    {\r\n      loader: '/Users/nikita.balakirev/Desktop/Projects/ccm_portal/node_modules/postcss-loader/src/index.js',\r\n      options: [Object]\r\n    },\r\n    {\r\n      loader: '/Users/nikita.balakirev/Desktop/Projects/ccm_portal/node_modules/less-loader/dist/cjs.js',\r\n      options: [Object]\r\n    }\r\n  ]\r\n\r\n```\r\nI have `\"raw-loader\": \"0.5.1\"` (which was used in rc2 because of not direct loader import), but in rc4 version of raw-loader forced to `4.0.0` and it causes for me following problem - raw loader loads `component.less` files as es modules and not as strings (it was expected).\r\nThis problem is similar to https://github.com/webpack-contrib/style-loader/issues/123 when some guys needed to call `require(component.css).toString()` directly.

I'd like to introduce a feature that allows us to define a `prebuild` script in `angular.json`.\r\nThat is useful and powerful for solving build process issues like this:\r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/angular/angular-cli/issues/4318\r\n\r\nCurrently, Angular CLI doesn't have hooks on its commands. To execute preprocessing scripts like code-generation before `ng build`, developers have to do it manually.\r\n\r\nIn general, `ng build` is often aliased as `npm run build`. And for production build, often `ng build --prod` is aliased as a different command like `npm run build:prod`. Then my `package.json` becomes like below;\r\n\r\n```json\r\n{\r\n  \"scripts\": {\r\n    \"build\": \"ng build\",\r\n    \"build:prod\": \"ng build --prod\"\r\n  }\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nIn that case, for adding preprocess script, I have to add it into each scripts like this;\r\n\r\n```json\r\n{\r\n  \"scripts\": {\r\n    \"build\": \"npm run codegen && ng build\",\r\n    \"build:prod\": \"npm run codegen && ng build --prod\",\r\n    \"codegen\": \"...\"\r\n  }\r\n}\r\n```\r\nI can use `pre-` hook of npm-scripts, however, a problem is there are two build scripts. It brings a lot of scripts in `package.json`. \r\n\r\n```json\r\n{\r\n  \"scripts\": {\r\n    \"prebuild\": \"npm run codegen\",\r\n    \"build\": \"ng build\",\r\n    \"prebuild:prod\": \"npm run prebuild\",\r\n    \"build:prod\": \"ng build --prod\",\r\n    \"codegen\": \"...\"\r\n  }\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nThis problem can be more serious in a workspace having multiple projects. Each build commands have to take project identifier and often these are separated as different npm-scripts.\r\n\r\n```json\r\n{\r\n  \"scripts\": {\r\n    \"build:appA\": \"ng build appA\",\r\n    \"build:appA:prod\": \"ng build appA --prod\",\r\n    \"build:appB\": \"ng build appB\",\r\n    \"build:appB:prod\": \"ng build appB --prod\",\r\n  }\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nToo many npm-scripts are hard to maintain. So I'd like to propose Angular CLI's command hook feature.\r\n\r\n### Describe the solution you'd like\r\n\r\n**CLI command hook** is a mechanism to execute a script before/after running CLI's command. It is not only for `ng build` but all command. \r\n\r\nWith the hook, pre-build code-generation is able to be configured in `angular.json` like below;\r\n\r\n```json\r\n{\r\n  \"projects\": {\r\n    \"appA\": {\r\n      \"architect\": {\r\n        \"build\": {\r\n          \"hooks\": {\r\n            \"pre\": \"npm run codegen\"\r\n          },\r\n          \"configurations\": {\r\n             \"production\": {\r\n                \"hooks\": {\r\n                   \"pre\": \"npm run codegen:prod\",\r\n                 }\r\n              }\r\n           }\r\n        }\r\n      }\r\n    }\r\n  }\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nOnce configuring this, it can work with `--prod` or any `--configuration`s because each configuration can have its own `hooks` option to override.\r\nAnd any architect commands can be configured as well as `build`. Each architect author doesn't have to know about that.\r\n\r\nEach hook script will be executed at the location of `angular.json`. The initial `CWD` is the workspace root.","Url":"https://github.com/angular/angular-cli/issues/16308","RelatedDescription":"Closed issue \"Proposal: pre/post-commands for Angular CLI\" (#16308)"},{"Id":"529759741","IsPullRequest":false,"CreatedAt":"2019-11-28T08:21:31","Actor":"florian-kittel","Number":"16307","RawContent":null,"Title":"ng update does not update @angular-devkit/schematics","State":"open","Body":"<!--üîÖüîÖüîÖüîÖüîÖüîÖüîÖüîÖüîÖüîÖüîÖüîÖüîÖüîÖüîÖüîÖüîÖüîÖüîÖüîÖüîÖüîÖüîÖüîÖüîÖüîÖüîÖüîÖüîÖüîÖüîÖ\r\n\r\nOh hi there! üòÑ\r\n\r\nTo expedite issue processing please search open and closed issues before submitting a new one.\r\nExisting issues often contain information about workarounds, resolution, or progress updates.\r\n\r\nüîÖüîÖüîÖüîÖüîÖüîÖüîÖüîÖüîÖüîÖüîÖüîÖüîÖüîÖüîÖüîÖüîÖüîÖüîÖüîÖüîÖüîÖüîÖüîÖüîÖüîÖüîÖüîÖüîÖüîÖüîÖüîÖüîÖ-->\r\n\r\n\r\n# üêû Bug report\r\n\r\n### Command (mark with an `x`)\r\n<!-- Can you pin-point the command or commands that are effected by this bug? -->\r\n<!-- ‚úçÔ∏èedit: -->\r\n\r\n- [x] update\r\n\r\n\r\n### Is this a regression?\r\n\r\n<!-- Did this behavior use to work in the previous version? -->\r\n<!-- ‚úçÔ∏è--> Not working in previous versions as well.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Description\r\n\r\n<!-- ‚úçÔ∏è--> I have a library project and @angular-devkit/schematics was installed automatically by ng generate library <name>.

I've now no solution to setup CI for my Angular project in Microsoft Visual Studio Team Foundation Server.\r\n\r\n#### What I've tried:\r\n[Official solution](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli/blob/f8fe4b0ee82d880396119a2594f3cee8dadb2947/docs/design/analytics.md#disabling-usage-analytics): \r\n * using ng analytics off (or changing the global configuration file yourself). This is the same as answering \"No\" to the prompt.\r\n> I cannot use ng analytics off command since ng is not installed on my CI environment.\r\n * There is an NG_CLI_ANALYTICS environment variable that overrides the global configuration. That flag is a string that represents the User ID. If the string \"false\" is used it will disable analytics for this run. If the string \"ci\" is used it will show up as a CI run (see below).\r\n> I can set NG_CLI_ANALYTICS to `'false'` on my server but in Microsoft Visual Studio Team Foundation Server, the npm install task seems to be in another environment scope.\r\n\r\n### Describe the solution you'd like\r\nIt would be nice to add a command argument to disable this prompt, or maybe to remove this prompt and add a variable in angular settings to enable ng analytics.\r\nAt this point, I'm hard stuck. I cannot setup my CI environment and it bothering my client.\r\n\r\n### Describe alternatives you've considered\r\nI have no alternative at this point.\r\n","Url":"https://github.com/angular/angular-cli/issues/16295","RelatedDescription":"Open issue \"Add a command argument to disable the analytics prompt\" (#16295)"},{"Id":"529144764","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2019-11-27T06:28:34","Actor":"renovate[bot]","Number":"16294","RawContent":null,"Title":"build: update core-js to version 3.4.5","State":"open","Body":"This PR contains the following updates:\n\n| Package | Type | Update | Change |\n|---|---|---|---|\n| [core-js](https://togithub.com/zloirock/core-js) | dependencies | patch | [`3.4.3` -> `3.4.5`](https://renovatebot.com/diffs/npm/core-js/3.4.3/3.4.5) |\n\n---\n\n### Release Notes\n\n<details>\n<summary>zloirock/core-js</summary>\n\n### [`v3.4.5`](https://togithub.com/zloirock/core-js/blob/master/CHANGELOG.md#&#8203;345---20191128)\n\n[Compare Source](https://togithub.com/zloirock/core-js/compare/v3.4.4...v3.4.5)\n\n-   Detect incorrect order of operations in `Object.assign`, MS Edge bug\n-   Detect usage of `ToLength` in `Array#{ filter, map }`, FF48-49 and MS Edge 14- issues\n-   Detect incorrect MS Edge 17-18 `Reflect.set` which allows setting the property to object with non-writable property on the prototype\n-   Fixed `inspectSource` helper with multiple `core-js` copies and some related features like some edge cases of `Promise` feature detection\n\n### [`v3.4.4`](https://togithub.com/zloirock/core-js/blob/master/CHANGELOG.md#&#8203;344---20191127)\n\n[Compare Source](https://togithub.com/zloirock/core-js/compare/v3.4.3...v3.4.4)\n\n-   Added feature detection for Safari [non-generic `Promise#finally` bug](https://bugs.webkit.org/show_bug.cgi?id=200829) **(critical for `core-js-pure`)**\n-   Fixed missed `esnext.string.code-points` in `core-js/features/string` entry point\n-   Updated `Iterator` proposal feature detection for the case of non-standard `Iterator` in FF44-\n\n</details>\n\n---\n\n### Renovate configuration\n\n:date: **Schedule**: \"after 10pm every weekday,before 4am every weekday,every weekend\" in timezone America/Tijuana.\n\n:vertical_traffic_light: **Automerge**: Disabled by config.

For our use case we were only using it on a details page for 2 records + on some reports if they happened to have a map. It required some heavy changes to make all google map related calls actually start from a promise/observable which loads the sdk first if it isn't already present.\r\n\r\nI get that there is the `async` and other script tags to defer loading but still once you need this feature it is basically a must have and it also requires some hard API changes so I'd really hope it's could be applied sooner rather than later.\r\n\r\nI currently have directives/components for the following:\r\n- routes\r\n- markers\r\n- heat maps\r\n- the map itself\r\n\r\n@mbehrlich From release notes I think you are the primary person working on maps.
