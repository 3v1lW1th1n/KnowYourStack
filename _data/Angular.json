Instead, the code above is a variable assignment to `ts.BinaryExpression` which includes `ts.ClassExpression`.\r\n\r\nThere are 2 solutions to this issue:\r\n\r\n1. Make `ivy-ngcc` to able to recognise class declaration like this.\r\n2. Tell library authors to use `angularCompilerOptions.annotationsAs` as `static fields` during packaging.\r\n\r\nMy voice is with solution 2, though.\r\n\r\n\r\n## 🔬 Minimal Reproduction\r\nN/A\r\n\r\n## 🔥 Exception or Error\r\nN/A\r\n\r\n\r\n## 🌍  Your Environment\r\n\r\n**Angular Version:**\r\n<pre><code>\r\n<!-- run `ng version` and paste output below -->\r\n8.0.0-beta.6\r\n\r\n</code></pre>\r\n\r\n**Anything else relevant?**\r\n<!-- ✍️Is this a browser specific issue?

Inside a mat-sidenav-content, the scroll-event gets triggered (as observed by logging output with enableTracing), but the page does not get scrolled.\r\n\r\n## 🔬 Minimal Reproduction\r\nThis here does not work. The component in router-outlet is identical to the one used here: https://www.bennadel.com/blog/3545-enabling-the-second-click-of-a-routerlink-fragment-using-onsameurlnavigation-reload-in-angular-7-1-3.htm\r\n\r\n```\r\n    <mat-sidenav-container>\r\n      <mat-sidenav mode=\"side\" opened>\r\n        <navigation-sidenav></navigation-sidenav>\r\n      </mat-sidenav>\r\n      <mat-sidenav-content>\r\n        <router-outlet></router-outlet>\r\n      </mat-sidenav-content>\r\n    </mat-sidenav-container>\r\n```\r\n\r\nWhen I comment out the sidenav-part and leave only the router-outlet, then the anchor/fragment-scrolling works.\r\n\r\nI am not sure if this is a known issue and if there is a workaround.

After that, the `registration` is created from the previous pipes.\r\n\r\nWhat happens if the `serviceworker.controller` is `null` in all `controllerchange` events? (At the moment you are thinking that couldn't happen, but yes 🎉it happens!!!🎉. \r\nThen if the app is started with `serviceworker.controller = null `and `requestSubscription` is called a few minutes later, the promise won't never be resolved.\r\nhttps://github.com/angular/angular/blob/c0757d1d440d6f934436418add9755e7d630bbcf/packages/service-worker/src/push.ts#L93-L99\r\n\r\n**Possible solution**\r\nMerging `registration`observable with `serviceworker.ready`but I'm not sure if breaks something.\r\nhttps://github.com/angular/angular/blob/c0757d1d440d6f934436418add9755e7d630bbcf/packages/service-worker/src/low_level.ts#L81-L82\r\n\r\n## 🔬 Minimal Reproduction\r\nThe problem reproduction is explained in the previous section. But if you want to get crazy to Chrome to test the bug, you can do the following:\r\n\r\nYou can test this on Chrome 72 Windows, the steps are not going to work on Chrome Mac. But I have logs that prove the bug happens in other Chrome version and platforms, maybe, doing different steps, but the state is the same, `serviceworker.controller` is `null`.\r\n\r\nSteps Chrome Windows.\r\n1. Create a app with a checkbox or switch button to activate/descativate notifications.\r\n2. Check the switch in your app will call `requestSubscription()`\r\n3. When the popup is shown, press Block.\r\n4. Go to de addressbar, click in the lock :lock:. Change the notifications state to Allow. Chrome will say you that the page should be reloaded.\r\n6. Reload the page.\r\n7. If you call `requestSubscription()`again, you won't get the popup. Or if you write in the console `serviceworker.controller` you will get `null`.\r\n\r\nHere is an example image. The app is started, `serviceworker.controller` is `null`, but I can get the service worker registration and the push subscription, so `serviceworker.controller` is not needed to get it.

I have spent several hours testing that this code is valid in Repl.it for both JavaScript and TypeScript.\r\n\r\nMy code without object Deconstruction compiles fine:\r\n\r\n```\r\n this.data.getScore(this.titleUrl).subscribe(data => {\r\n  this.avgRating=data['avgrating'];\r\n  this.numReviews=data['numOfReviews'];\r\n  this.posterUrl = data['posterUrl']'  \r\n``` \r\n     \r\n\r\n\r\nMy code with either object Deconstruction below throws an error:\r\n\r\n```\r\n this.data.getScore(this.titleUrl).subscribe(data => {\r\n  ({avgrating: this.avgRating, numOfReviews: this.numReviews, posterUrl: this.posterUrl}= data) \r\n```\r\n     \r\n\r\n\r\n```\r\nthis.data.getMovieInfo(this.titleUrl).subscribe(({id, title, poster_url, backdrop_url}) => {\r\n        this.title=title;\r\n        this.posterUrl=poster_url;\r\n        this.backdropUrl=backdrop_url;\r\n```\r\nThe errors I get back are:\r\n\r\nERROR in src/app/app.component.ts(84,11): error TS2459: Type 'Object' has no property 'poster_Url' and no string index signature. \r\n\r\nI have tested this in multiple ways to try a workaround with Destructuring this but all have failed even though almost exact code can be reproduced in Repl.it with either javascript or typescript and it passes.  \r\n It seems the bug is the fact that the compiler doesn't know what is on the data object as it is coming from my BackEnd API even though I do know what will be on the object and refuses to build.\r\n\r\n## 🔬 Minimal Reproduction\r\nTo reproduce you must do the following:\r\n1. Create a new service connecting to some api:\r\n\r\n```\r\nexport class DataService {\r\n\r\n  constructor(private http: HttpClient) { }\r\n\r\n  getScore(titleUrl) {\r\n    return this.http.get(`${environment.url}cr/score/${titleUrl}`);\r\n\r\n  }\r\n```\r\n\r\n2. Create a component that accesses that service and try to deconstruct the return value on the object.\r\nimport {DataService} from './data.service';\r\n\r\n```\r\n@Component({\r\n  selector: 'app-root',\r\n  templateUrl: './app.component.html',\r\n  styleUrls: ['./app.component.css'],\r\n})\r\n\r\nexport class AppComponent implements OnInit {\r\n//declaration of variables to display\r\n...\r\n    constructor(private data: DataService) {\r\n\r\n    }\r\n\r\n   ngOnInit() {\r\n    this.data.getScore(this.titleUrl).subscribe(data => {\r\n   ({avgrating: this.avgRating, numOfReviews: this.numReviews, posterUrl: this.posterUrl}= data) \r\n   }\r\n     \r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\n\r\n<!--\r\n\r\n-->\r\n\r\n## 🔥 Exception or Error\r\n<pre><code>\r\nERROR in src/app/app.component.ts(84,11): error TS2459: Type 'Object' has no property 'poster_Url' and no string index signature. \r\n\r\n</code></pre>\r\n\r\n\r\n","Url":"https://github.com/angular/angular-cli/issues/13803","RelatedDescription":"Closed issue \"ES6 Destructuring Issue with Data from API\" (#13803)"},{"Id":"416330775","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2019-03-02T00:28:20","Actor":"clydin","Number":"13802","RawContent":null,"Title":"fix(@angular-devkit/build-angular): remove index option as required","State":"open","Body":"It is not a required option and is allowed to be undefined ([relevant code](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli/blob/master/packages/angular_devkit/build_angular/src/angular-cli-files/models/webpack-configs/browser.ts#L39)).
