For example, a excel file has a formula cell A3=sum(A1:A2), if we need insert a row of data after row1, the formula should change to sum(A1:A3) . \r\nThis can be done automatically either in excel application or in office automation solution. But with OpenXML SDK, we need to do by programming, it's not a simple task because we need parse all the formula elements completely and compose it again.\r\nThis is just a simple example about the topic, actually there are many scenarios like this.  It's very appreciate if OpenXML SDK provides calculation mechanism.\r\n"},{"Id":"8036403904","Type":"IssuesEvent","CreatedAt":"2018-07-30T09:02:06","Actor":"xiangxingze","Repository":"OfficeDev/Open-XML-SDK","Organization":"OfficeDev","RawContent":null,"RelatedAction":"opened","RelatedUrl":"https://github.com/OfficeDev/Open-XML-SDK/issues/518","RelatedDescription":"Opened issue \"I have a question, who can help me?\" (#518) at OfficeDev/Open-XML-SDK","RelatedBody":"Sorry for disturbing you!\r\nOpen XML SDK is similar to Microsoft.Office.Interop.Word\r\nHow to move the cursor to wrap\r\nObject extend = Word.WdMovementType.wdExtend;\r\n                 Object unit = Word.WdUnits.wdCell;\r\n                 Object count = 1;\r\n                 wApp.Selection.MoveRight(ref unit, ref count, ref extend);"},{"Id":"8036034119","Type":"IssuesEvent","CreatedAt":"2018-07-30T07:44:23","Actor":"jason8232590","Repository":"OfficeDev/Open-XML-SDK","Organization":"OfficeDev","RawContent":null,"RelatedAction":"closed","RelatedUrl":"https://github.com/OfficeDev/Open-XML-SDK/issues/517","RelatedDescription":"Closed issue \" Could not load assembly 'System.IO.Packaging' during Xamarin startup registration\" (#517) at OfficeDev/Open-XML-SDK","RelatedBody":"-**Description**\r\n\r\nI created a new project in Visual Studio 2017 for windows (15.5.4) and import the 'DocumentFormat.OpenXml(2.8.1)' then debug it , but it  could not be debugged in My android phone.
