So we'd like to be able to provide a list of packages to restore which will be downloaded if they aren't already in the package cache, but that won't otherwise affect the restore operation.\r\n\r\nThese packages could be represented as a new item (such as `DownloadOnlyPackage`), or as metadata on the exsiting `PackageReference` item (such as `DownloadOnly=\"true\"`).\r\n\r\nWe imagine it would work as follows:\r\n\r\n- The restore operation should download the \"download only\" packages (if they aren't already present)\r\n- \"Download only\" packages should not affect the package graph in any way\r\n  - It should be possible to specify multiple \"download only\" packages with the same package ID but different versions, and the restore operation should download them both\r\n  - Dependencies of packages \"download only\" packages should be ignored by the restore operation.  (In the case of Targeting Packs and Runtime Packs, we would author the packages so they have no dependencies specified.)\r\n  - Restore would only download the exact version specified.  If that version is not available, it would error out (instead of rolling forward to a later available version).\r\n- \"Download only\" packages would not affect the assets file\r\n- \"Download only\" packages inputs would not affect the noop restore fingerprint / cache.\r\n  - IE, if a project had been restored, and then was restored again with no changes except the addition of \"download only\" packages (which is what we would expect if a project had been built and now was being published as a self-contained app), then NuGet would download the packages specified via \"download only\" packages if they were not already available locally, but in any case would treat the rest of the restore operation as a no-op restore.\r\n- NuGet would provide a way (via an API and/or an MSBuild task) to resolve the local path to a given package's contents (ie in the packages folder, the fallback folder, or elsewhere where NuGet could resolve it from).\r\n\r\nDownload only package support is especially important for self-contained publish.  The .NET Core runtime assets required for a self-contained publish depend on the RID being published for as well as the latest patch of .NET Core.  Currently, a command line self-contained publish invalidates the assets file, and a self-contained publish from Visual Studio restores using a different assets path.  Neither case is ideal and both of them result in extra non-noop restores running.  \"Download only\" package support would allow us to tell NuGet to download the correct runtime pack when restoring for a self-contained publish without affecting the assets file that was generated from the restore during build."},{"Id":"8334789950","Type":"IssuesEvent","CreatedAt":"2018-09-27T22:30:06","Actor":"nkolev92","Repository":"NuGet/Home","Organization":"NuGet","RawContent":null,"RelatedAction":"opened","RelatedUrl":"https://github.com/NuGet/Home/issues/7338","RelatedDescription":"Opened issue \"Plugin trust cross platform\" (#7338) at NuGet/Home","RelatedBody":"### NuGet.exe on Mono\r\n\r\n- Microsoft certs are not by default trusted on Linux/OSX machines. Similarly whatever the trusted root CA is of the authenticode signature is not necesarilly trusted on the host machine. \r\n- On OSX, the Mono authenticode implementation uses the shared cert store. By adding the cert to the same store, Authenticode might work OSX.  \r\n- On Linux there is no unique certificate store.\r\n- On Linux, the Mono authenticode implementation uses it's own store. It's more challenging to add the certificate to that store. \r\n\r\n### dotnet.exe \r\n\r\n- There is no approach that could work on both Linux and OSX.\r\n\r\n### Different perspective\r\n\r\nWe have been thinking about the solutions on a per product level. We can consider a per platform approach. \r\n\r\nThe issues we have been facing on OSX and Linux can be categorized in 2 buckets. \r\n\r\n1. Trust \r\n    Whatever signing approach is used, we need to make sure that the signer chains to a trusted root on that machine. \r\n    Microsoft certificates are not trusted by default on either OSX/Linux. There's a Microsoft-wide effort to get our certs trusted on different machines.\r\n    This might be years down the line and still wouldn't be completely. \r\n\r\n1. Signature Validation\r\n    The NuGet client needs to be able to verify the signature on disk. \r\n\r\n### Apple Code Signing Services\r\n \r\nWe can consider using Apple Code Signing, OSX's standard for signing executables. \r\nOSX does not validate the signature prior to execution. We would need to do that manually. \r\n\r\nThere are ways to validate the signature with Obj C code and/or by invoking additional OSX command. \r\nWe need to investigate this approach furher to determine it's viability. \r\n\r\n### Detached signatures\r\n\r\nWe can consider detached signatures. Current cryptographic APIs should be sufficient to allow us to verify that signature safely in .NET Core. \r\nThis however still doesn't solve the trust problem. \r\nWe would need to define our own certicate store/re-use a well known if possible. \r\nIf we were to define our own certificate store, we would need to work out a setup story.\r\nCarrying a list of well known certificates would mean we wouldn't do revocation and that could be security risk.\r\n\r\n- Consider ACS as a valid approach for OSX. Investigate how to do the signature validation and how it plays with Authenticode. Furthemore whatever signing approach we end up doing later for Linux needs to not break ACS/Authenticode scenarios. \r\n\r\n- Consider whatever the .NET Core runtime comes up with regarding Authenticode like alternatives. That still wouldn't solve the trust problems, so there is no clear direction here. \r\n\r\n- Consider doing detached signatures and building our signing/verification strategy. This would require a comprehensive design and crypto board reviews. \r\n\r\n### Open Questions\r\n\r\n- Can authenticode and ACS live together in the same assembly? \r\n- Can we do ACS signature verification from within C#? \r\n- What's the progress on Microsoft certs being trusted by default on OSX/Linux? \r\nWhich Linux distros are targetted? Timeline? \r\n- Apple Code sign services [Link](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/security/code_signing_services)"}],"ResultType":"GitHubEvent"},"Announcements":{"Events":[{"Id":"8059595751","Type":"IssuesEvent","CreatedAt":"2018-08-02T22:42:29","Actor":"anangaur","Repository":"NuGet/Announcements","Organization":"NuGet","RawContent":null,"RelatedAction":"opened","RelatedUrl":"https://github.com/NuGet/Announcements/issues/30","RelatedDescription":"Opened issue \"Show source repository information for packages on nuget.org\" (#30) at NuGet/Announcements","RelatedBody":"The spec to **Show source repository information for packages on nuget.org** , is ready for **review**:\r\n\r\n|Spec wiki|Discussion issue|\r\n|:----------|:------------------|\r\n|[Show source repository information for packages on nuget.org](https://github.com/NuGet/Home/wiki/Show-source-repository-information-for-packages-on-nuget.org) | https://github.com/NuGet/NuGetGallery/issues/4941 |\r\n\r\n**Note**: This is a short term feature to just light up the repository information on nuget.org using the `<repository>`  metadata in the nuspec.
