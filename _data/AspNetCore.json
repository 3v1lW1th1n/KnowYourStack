Please describe.\r\nI have been experimenting with loading plugins dynamically into a blazor client app.\r\n\r\nFew reasons for this experiment:\r\n\r\n1. App size can be large. By only allowing assemblies for features that user is interested in using (i.e ones they have enabled), the number of assemblies that need to be loaded into the browser can be kept as low as possible.\r\n2. I wanted to see if a kind of \"progressive enhancement\" was possible. I.e my blazor client app would quickly present an empty shell, which progressively populates as each plugin is then dynamically loaded into it, so the UI builds up in front of you.\r\n\r\nI've thrown together a quick POC here with a readme with a few screenshots https://github.com/dazinator/BlazorPlugins\r\n\r\nIt dynamically loads the plugin from the server when you click the button, and the plugin adds an item to the menu called \"weather\".\r\n\r\nHowever there are a couple of problem areas I have hit in Blazor that prevent this from being a success endeavour, one which I believe I can work around and another which is a blocker:\r\n\r\n1. I can't see a way to unload a plugin assembly, and netstandard2.0 doesn't let me work with the full power of AppDomains i.e no CreateInstanceAndUnwrap() or any of that good old stuff. I beleive I can workaround this problem area though.. when a user enable or disables a plugin, they will have to trigger a reload of the entire app (i.e full page refresh) at which point the shell will load from scratch, but this time only load up the newly approved list of plugins during startup. \r\n\r\n2. Blocker: the plugin assembly that I am loading dynamically, includes a Blazor component with the /page directive. However the Router never sees that route (because the router only looks at assemblies referenced from the main assembly) and I am not sure how I can register this assembly with the router. \r\n\r\n### Describe the solution you'd like\r\nI'd like to see a way to register dynamically loaded assemblies with blazor so that pages and components can be picked up from them. Similar to how we can achieve this with ApplicationParts in MVC.\r\n","Url":"https://github.com/aspnet/AspNetCore/issues/11463","RelatedDescription":"Open issue \"Blazor Plugins\" (#11463)"},{"Id":"459424118","IsPullRequest":false,"CreatedAt":"2019-06-22T02:47:16","Actor":"Tratcher","Number":"11462","RawContent":null,"Title":"Forwarded authentication handlers always run ClaimsTransformation twice","State":"open","Body":"If you configure one authentication handler to forward to another via ForwardAuthenticate, ForwardDefault or ForwardDefaultSelector it ends up running ClaimsTransformation twice, once for the original handler and once for the forwarded one.\r\nhttps://github.com/aspnet/AspNetCore/blob/4ef204e13b88c0734e0e94a1cc4c0ef05f40849e/src/Http/Authentication.Core/src/AuthenticationService.cs#L77-L82\r\nhttps://github.com/aspnet/AspNetCore/blob/4ef204e13b88c0734e0e94a1cc4c0ef05f40849e/src/Security/Authentication/Core/src/AuthenticationHandler.cs#L131-L135\r\n\r\nProposal: Find a way to suppress the redundant claims transformation when forwarding.\r\n\r\nI found this because the Negotiate auth handler is going to forward to the server auth handler when possible: https://github.com/aspnet/AspNetCore/pull/11421","Url":"https://github.com/aspnet/AspNetCore/issues/11462","RelatedDescription":"Open issue \"Forwarded authentication handlers always run ClaimsTransformation twice\" (#11462)"},{"Id":"459420804","IsPullRequest":false,"CreatedAt":"2019-06-22T01:58:00","Actor":"w152013768","Number":"11461","RawContent":null,"Title":"build the solution, can not download the preview sdk","State":"open","Body":"When I am going to build the solution with the restore.ps, It  will go to error : can not download from https://dotnetcli.azureedge.net/dotnet/Sdk/3.0.100-preview5-011568/dotnet-sdk-3.0.100-preview5-011568-win-x64.zip.

Please describe.\r\n\r\nIn my blazor client-side app, when I make an outgoing http request using `HttpClient` from some component, to some web api, and then receive a response back,\r\nI find myself needing to extend what happens to the request before it gets sent over the wire, and likewise, intercept the response before it makes its way back into my component. \r\n\r\n**Update**: see below comment's - the pipeline already exists in the form of HttpClient's `DelegatingHandler`'s - but i'd like to see parity with asp.net core server side in being able to configure this pipeline with `.UseXzy()` extension methods in blazor client app, within `startup.cs`\r\n\r\nFor example, I want to append the current Authentication Header to all request that are sent - I don;t want each component to have to bother itself with that concern, instead I want all requests to flow through the same, configurable pipeline, managed as a separate concern, similar to asp.net core server side web apps today.\r\n\r\nI want to intercept all responses so I can detect a particular response header indicating that the server has \"pending upgrades\" - so I can display a friendly message to the user, again I don't want each component to have to worry about that.\r\n\r\nLastly, and this is the key point really.. Rather than write my own wrapper around `HttpClient` that has all this prescriptive logic in for use within my app alone, I want to write re-usable \"middleware\" components that be added to anyones blazor client app, that sit in this processing pipeline and do things like add Jwt headers, or intercept responses and do things.

Fixes #8204","State":"open","Body":"This is the rather nontrivial solution to a multitude of related async-binding and diff-inconsistency issues. As of this change, two-way bindings have a stricter behavior whereby they:\r\n\r\n * Find out from the JS code what the latest state in the DOM is, and apply that to the old render tree\r\n * Consequently, produce a diff output that may be smaller (no need to tell the client to perform changes it has already performed, which fixes the laggy typing thing), or may be larger (maybe we need to tell the client to revert its change, which fixes the \"moving checkboxes\" case we had reported by a customer)\r\n\r\nIn most ways this is purely advantageous. Various cases where the behavior was bizarre or broken before are now fixed (e.g., binding a checkbox to a property whose value is fixed as `true` or `false` before didn't reflect that in the UI - now the checkbox will forcibly revert itself to \"checked\" or \"unchecked\" as appropriate\"). Also it's much safer to revert invalid edits to number fields, because now the user can see exactly how their input is being interpreted - previously they had no way to know if their edit was being ignored because it was considered invalid.\r\n\r\nHowever the extra strictness will make developers go through extra hoops in a few cases. The most notable one is textboxes bound to non-nullable `int`/`double/`etc that use `bind-value:event=\"oninput\"`. These will no longer allow unparseable values such as being empty or just containing `-`, so developers will have to either:\r\n\r\n * Not use `bind-value:event=\"oninput\"` for non-nullable numbers, since you don't want to prevent the invalid intermediate states. Just use the default change event which is \"change\".\r\n * Or, use a nullable version of your number, or even bind to a `string` so you can do whatever you want with the invalid intermediate states\r\n * Or, use `<InputNumber>` which already handles this nicely. In the future we might extend that to support `bind-value:event=\"oninput\"`, and it will do what you expect because behind the scenes it's binding to a `string` and handling parsing separately so it can record validation errors.","Url":"https://github.com/aspnet/AspNetCore/pull/11438","RelatedDescription":"Open PR \"For two-way bindings, enforce consistency between .NET model and DOM by patching old tree.

My problem is that its not doing what we would expect it to do.   \r\n\r\nManagement expects when a user logs in and clicks remember me that they will then not be required to type their login and password again for a month.

VS 2019 is about to be released in around early 2019\r\n2. ASP.NET Core 1.0/1.1 is not going to be supported anymore, based on [this page](https://github.com/dotnet/core/blob/master/microsoft-support.md).\r\n3. Creating new ASP.NET Core 1.0/1.1 will always install the .NET Core 1.0/1.1 web tooling, and this is not necessary when previous reason has reached the unsupported period and it's quite near or might be the same time of VS 2019 release.\r\n4. Based on the problem mentioned above, VS 2017 has no \"built in\" tooling when creating new ASP.NET Core 1.0/1.1 project, but the external tooling may help. Therefore for those that still need to maintain ASP.NET Core 1.0/1.1 projects, we could use VS 2017 as long as the VS 2017 is still in support lifecycle or in mainstream support lifecycle.\r\n\r\nI

This advisory also provides guidance on what developers can do to update their applications to remove this vulnerability.\r\n\r\nMicrosoft is aware of a denial of service vulnerability exists when ASP.NET Core improperly handles web requests. An attacker who successfully exploited this vulnerability could cause a denial of service against an ASP.NET Core web application. The vulnerability can be exploited remotely, without authentication.\r\n\r\nA remote unauthenticated attacker could exploit this vulnerability by issuing specially crafted requests to the ASP.NET Core application.\r\n\r\nThe update addresses the vulnerability by correcting how the ASP.NET Core web application handles web requests.\r\n\r\n## Discussion\r\n\r\nDiscussion for this issue can be found at https://github.com/aspnet/AspNetCore/issues/10238\r\n\r\n### <a name=\"mitigation-factors\"></a>Mitigation factors\r\n\r\nMicrosoft has not identified any mitigating factors for this vulnerability.\r\n\r\n## <a name=\"affected-software\"></a>Affected software\r\n\r\nAny ASP.NET Core based application that uses any of following vulnerable packages:\r\n\r\nPackage name | Vulnerable versions | Secure versions\r\n------------ | ------------------- | -------------------------\r\nMicrosoft.AspNetCore.SignalR.Protocols.MessagePack | 1.0.0, 1.0.1, 1.0.2, 1.0.3, 1.0.4<br/>1.1.0 | 1.0.11<br/>1.1.5\r\n\r\n## <a name=\"advisory-faq\"></a>Advisory FAQ\r\n\r\n### <a name=\"how-affected\"></a>How do I know if I am affected?\r\n\r\nThe affected assemblies are also available separately as a NuGet package. If you are not using `Microsoft.AspNetCore.SignalR.Protocols.MessagePack` directly you may still be affected if you are using SignalR and the package is a transitive dependency.\r\n\r\n#### Direct dependencies\r\n\r\nDirect dependencies are discoverable by examining your `csproj` file. They can be fixed by [editing the project file](#fixing-direct-dependencies) or using NuGet to update the dependency.\r\n\r\n#### Transitive dependencies\r\n\r\nTransitive dependencies occur when you add a package to your project that in turn relies on another package. For example, if Contoso publishes a package `Contoso.Utility` which, in turn, depends on `Contoso.Internals` and you add the `Contoso.Utility` package to your project now your project has a direct dependency on `Contoso.Utility` and, because `Contoso.Utility` depends 'Contoso.Internals', your application gains a transitive dependency on the `Contoso.Internals` package.\r\n\r\nTransitive dependencies are reviewable in two ways:\r\n\r\n* In the Visual Studio Solution Explorer window, which supports searching.\r\n* By examining the `project.assets.json` file contained in the obj directory of your project for `csproj` based projects\r\n\r\nThe `project.assets.json` files are the authoritative list of all packages used by your project, containing both direct and transitive dependencies.\r\n\r\nThere are two ways to view transitive dependencies. You can either [use Visual Studio’s Solution Explorer](#vs-solution-explorer), or you can review [the `project.assets.json` file](#project-assets-json)).\r\n\r\n##### <a name=\"vs-solution-explorer\"></a>Using Visual Studio Solution Explorer\r\n\r\nTo use Solution Explorer, open the project in Visual Studio, and then press Ctrl+; to activate the search in Solution Explorer. Search for the [vulnerable package](#affected-software) and make a note of the version numbers of any results you find.\r\n\r\nFor example, searching for `Microsoft.AspNetCore.Mvc.Core` in an example project that contains a package that takes a dependency on `Microsoft.AspNetCore.Mvc` shows the following results in Visual Studio 2017:\r\n\r\n![Screenshot of search results in Visual Studio 2017](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/796298/25858816/8ecdc2b4-3491-11e7-9363-746804bb9832.png)\r\n\r\nThe search results appear as a tree. In the previous results, you can see that a reference to `Microsoft.AspNetCore.Mvc.Core` version 1.1.2 is discovered.\r\n\r\nUnder the Dependencies node is a NuGet node. Under the NuGet node is the list of packages you have directly taken a dependency on and their versions.\r\nIn screenshot, the application takes a direct dependency on `Microsoft.AspNetCore.Mvc`. `Microsoft.AspNetCore.Mvc` in turn has leaf nodes that list its dependencies and their versions.\r\nThe `Microsoft.AspNetCore.Mvc` package takes a dependency on a version of `Microsoft.AspNetCore.Mvc.ApiExplorer`, that in turn takes a dependency on a version of `Microsoft.AspNetCore.Mvc.Core`.\r\n\r\n##### <a name=\"project-assets-json\"></a> Manually reviewing project.assets.json\r\n\r\nOpen the *project.assets.json* file from your project’s obj directory in your editor. We suggest you use an editor that understands JSON and allows you to collapse and expand nodes to review this file.\r\nVisual Studio and Visual Studio Code provide JSON friendly editing.\r\n\r\nSearch the *project.assets.json* file for the [vulnerable package](#affected-software), using the format `packagename/` for each of the package names from the preceding table. If you find the assembly name in your search:\r\n\r\n* Examine the line on which they are found, the version number is after the `/`.\r\n* Compare to the [vulnerable versions table](#affected-software).\r\n\r\nFor example, a search result that shows `System.IO.Pipelines/4.5.0` is a reference to version 4.5.0 of `System.IO.Pipelines`.\r\n\r\nIf your *project.assets.json* file includes references to the [vulnerable package](#affected-software), then you need to fix the transitive dependencies.\r\n\r\nIf you have not found any reference to any vulnerable packages, this means either\r\n\r\n* None of your direct dependencies depend on any vulnerable packages, or\r\n* You have already fixed the problem by updating the direct dependencies.\r\n\r\n### <a name=\"how-fix\"></a>How do I fix the issue?\r\n\r\n#### <a name=\"fixing-direct-dependencies\"></a>Fixing direct dependencies\r\n\r\nOpen *projectname.csproj* in your editor. If you're using Visual Studio, right-click the project and choose **Edit projectname.csproj** from the context menu, where projectname is the name of your project. Look for `PackageReference` elements. The following shows an example project file:\r\n\r\n```xml\r\n<Project Sdk=\"Microsoft.NET.Sdk.Web\">\r\n  <PropertyGroup>\r\n    <TargetFramework>netcoreapp2.1</TargetFramework>\r\n  </PropertyGroup>\r\n  <ItemGroup>\r\n    <PackageReference Include=\"Microsoft.AspNetCore.SignalR.Protocols.MessagePack\" Version=\"1.0.0\" />\r\n  </ItemGroup>\r\n</Project>\r\n```\r\n\r\nThe preceding example has a reference to the [vulnerable package](#affected-software), as seen by the single `PackageReference` element. The name of the package is in the `Include` attribute.\r\nThe package version number is in the `Version` attribute. The previous example shows a single direct dependency on `System.IO.Pipelines` version 4.5.0\r\n\r\nTo update the version to the secure package, change the version number to the updated package version as listed on the table [previously](#affected-software).\r\nIn this example, update `System.IO.Pipelines` to the appropriate [fixed package number](#affected-software) for your major version. Save the *csproj* file. The example *csproj* now looks as follows:\r\n\r\n```xml\r\n<Project Sdk=\"Microsoft.NET.Sdk.Web\">\r\n  <PropertyGroup>\r\n    <TargetFramework>netcoreapp2.1</TargetFramework>\r\n  </PropertyGroup>\r\n  <ItemGroup>\r\n    <PackageReference Include=\"Microsoft.AspNetCore.SignalR.Protocols.MessagePack\" Version=\"1.0.11\" />\r\n  </ItemGroup>\r\n</Project>\r\n```\r\n\r\nIf you're using Visual Studio and you save your updated *csproj* file, Visual Studio will restore the new package version.\r\nYou can see the restore results by opening the **Output** window (Ctrl+Alt+O) and changing the **Show output from** drop-down list to **Package Manager**.\r\n\r\nIf you're not using Visual Studio, open a command line and change to your project directory. Execute the `dotnet restore` command to restore the updated dependencies.\r\n\r\nNow recompile your application. If after recompilation you see a *Dependency conflict warning*, you must update your other direct dependencies to versions that take a dependency on the updated package.\r\n\r\n#### <a name=\"transitive-dependencies\"></a>Fixing transitive dependencies\r\n\r\nIf your transitive dependency review found references to the [vulnerable package](#affected-software), you must add a direct dependency to the updated package to your *csproj* file to override the transitive dependency.\r\n\r\nOpen *projectname.csproj* in your editor. If you're using Visual Studio, right-click the project and choose **Edit projectname.csproj** from the context menu, where projectname is the name of your project.\r\nLook for `PackageReference` nodes, for example:\r\n\r\n```xml\r\n<Project Sdk=\"Microsoft.NET.Sdk.\">\r\n  <PropertyGroup>\r\n    <TargetFramework>net461</TargetFramework>\r\n  </PropertyGroup>\r\n  <ItemGroup>\r\n    <PackageReference Include=\"ThirdParty.NotUpdatedYet\" Version=\"2.0.0\" />\r\n  </ItemGroup>\r\n</Project>\r\n```\r\n\r\nYou must add a direct dependency to the updated version of the [vulnerable package](#affected-software) by adding it to the *csproj* file.\r\nYou do this by adding a new line to the dependencies section, referencing the fixed version.\r\nFor example, if your search showed a transitive reference to a vulnerable `System.ServiceModel.Http` version, you'd add a reference to the [fixed package number](#affected-software).\r\n\r\n```xml\r\n<Project Sdk=\"Microsoft.NET.Sdk.Web\">\r\n  <PropertyGroup>\r\n    <TargetFramework>net461</TargetFramework>\r\n  </PropertyGroup>\r\n  <ItemGroup>\r\n    <PackageReference Include=\"Microsoft.AspNetCore.SignalR.Protocols.MessagePack\" Version=\"1.0.11\" />\r\n    <PackageReference Include=\"ThirdParty.NotUpdatedYet\" Version=\"2.0.0\" />\r\n  </ItemGroup>\r\n</Project>\r\n```\r\n\r\nAfter you've added the direct dependency reference, save your *csproj* file.\r\n\r\nIf you're using Visual Studio, save your updated *csproj* file and Visual Studio will restore the new package versions.\r\nYou can see the restore results by opening the **Output** window (Ctrl+Alt+O) and changing the **Show output from** drop-down list to **Package Manager**.\r\n\r\nIf you're not using Visual Studio, open a command line and change to your project directory. Execute the `dotnet restore` command to restore the new dependencies.\r\n\r\n##### Rebuilding your application\r\n\r\nFinally, you must rebuild your application, test, and redeploy.\r\n\r\n## Other Information\r\n\r\n### Reporting Security Issues\r\n\r\nIf you have found a potential security issue in .NET Core, please email details to secure@microsoft.com.
