The documentation describes their availability (see link to docs above)\r\n\r\n### Actual behavior\r\nThrows an error that $hero-body-padding is undefined.

I as a user love the way of how variables are organized and even though most of the variables are available, some appear to not be available when including the bulma source in the root scss.
