I have only handled 2xx responses before\r\n\r\n### Description\r\n\r\nIn a request being made with Angular 7 running server side on node express, Angular is issuing an API request, with observe: response, to an endpoint which is returning a 303. That 303 is then automatically called and the result of the 303 shows up in the interceptor, but the 303 itself does not. We want to intercept the 303 itself.\r\n\r\n<pre><code>\r\nPackage                           Version\r\n-----------------------------------------------------------\r\n@angular-devkit/architect         0.12.4\r\n@angular-devkit/build-angular     0.12.4\r\n@angular-devkit/build-optimizer   0.12.4\r\n@angular-devkit/build-webpack     0.12.4\r\n@angular-devkit/core              7.2.4\r\n@angular-devkit/schematics        7.3.1\r\n@angular/cli                      7.3.1\r\n@angular/compiler-cli             7.2.7\r\n@ngtools/webpack                  7.2.4\r\n@schematics/angular               7.3.1\r\n@schematics/update                0.13.1\r\nrxjs                              6.4.0\r\ntypescript                        3.1.6\r\nwebpack                           4.28.4\r\n</code></pre>\r\n\r\n**Anything else relevant?**\r\nSSR with Universal\r\n","Url":"https://github.com/angular/angular/issues/29037","RelatedDescription":"Open issue \"HttpInterceptor catchError cannot see a 303 response\" (#29037)"},{"Id":"415749777","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2019-02-28T20:08:43","Actor":"kyliau","Number":"29032","RawContent":null,"Title":"fix(bazel): ng serve should always watch","State":"closed","Body":"## PR Checklist\r\nPlease check if your PR fulfills the following requirements:\r\n\r\n- [x] The commit message follows our guidelines: https://github.com/angular/angular/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md#commit\r\n- [ ] Tests for the changes have been added (for bug fixes / features)\r\n- [ ] Docs have been added / updated (for bug fixes / features)\r\n\r\n\r\n## PR Type\r\nWhat kind of change does this PR introduce?\r\n\r\n<!-- Please check the one that applies to this PR using \"x\". -->\r\n\r\n- [x] Bugfix\r\n- [ ] Feature\r\n- [ ] Code style update (formatting, local variables)\r\n- [ ] Refactoring (no functional changes, no api changes)\r\n- [ ] Build related changes\r\n- [ ] CI related changes\r\n- [ ] Documentation content changes\r\n- [ ] angular.io application / infrastructure changes\r\n- [ ] Other...

One of the scenario where function is not behaving properly is as follow;\r\n\r\n- If a combination of Korean language( ko, ko-KR cultures) and 12 hour format('mediumTime' or 'hh:mm:ss a') is selected then it is not showing AM/PM in Korean culture. It simply prints output as **'PM 6:02:16'** , whereas, the expected output is **'오후 6:02:16'** \r\n\r\nIf you set the locale as German then it properly converts the AM/PM.\r\n\r\nI've verified that findLocaleData() for 'kr' culture has relevant data available, however, it is returning AM-PM instead of culture related values.\r\n\r\n## 🔬 Minimal Reproduction\r\nHere is a reproduction of above mentioned [issue](https://stackblitz.com/edit/angular-issue-repro2-nmw5gc).\r\n\r\n## 🌍 Environment\r\n**Angular Version:**\r\n<pre><code>\r\nAngular CLI: 7.1.1\r\nNode: 10.14.1\r\nOS: win32 x64\r\nAngular: 7.1.0\r\n... animations, cdk, common, compiler, compiler-cli, core, forms\r\n... http, language-service, material, platform-browser\r\n... platform-browser-dynamic, router\r\n\r\nPackage                            Version\r\n------------------------------------------------------------\r\n@angular-devkit/architect          0.10.6\r\n@angular-devkit/build-angular      0.10.6\r\n@angular-devkit/build-ng-packagr   0.10.7\r\n@angular-devkit/build-optimizer    0.10.6\r\n@angular-devkit/build-webpack      0.10.6\r\n@angular-devkit/core               7.0.6\r\n@angular-devkit/schematics         7.1.1 (cli-only)\r\n@ngtools/json-schema               1.1.0\r\n@ngtools/webpack                   7.0.6\r\n@schematics/angular                7.1.1 (cli-only)\r\n@schematics/update                 0.11.1 (cli-only)\r\nng-packagr                         4.4.5\r\nrxjs                               6.3.3\r\ntypescript                         3.1.6\r\nwebpack                            4.19.1\r\n</code></pre>\r\n\r\n","Url":"https://github.com/angular/angular/issues/29025","RelatedDescription":"Open issue \"Korean culture specific AM/PM text isn't coming for formatted time\" (#29025)"},{"Id":"415607257","IsPullRequest":false,"CreatedAt":"2019-02-28T12:48:34","Actor":"EddyP23","Number":"29024","RawContent":null,"Title":"Http Response 400 returning `StatusText=OK` when no Status Code","State":"open","Body":"# 🐞 bug report\r\n\r\n### Affected Package\r\n<!-- Can you pin-point one or more @angular/* packages as the source of the bug? -->\r\n<!-- ✍️edit: --> The issue is caused by package @angular/http\r\n\r\n### Description\r\n\r\nWhen you call an HTTP endpoint that returns a response without a status code, e.g. \"400\", but not \"404 Not Found\", Angular by default sets `statusCode` to `OK` which is weird and misleading.\r\n\r\n## 🔬 Minimal Reproduction\r\n```\r\nimport { Component } from '@angular/core';\r\nimport { HttpClient, HttpErrorResponse } from '@angular/common/http';\r\nimport { catchError } from 'rxjs/operators';\r\n\r\n@Component({\r\n  selector: 'app-root',\r\n  templateUrl: './app.component.html',\r\n  styleUrls: ['./app.component.css']\r\n})\r\nexport class AppComponent {\r\n  constructor( http: HttpClient) {\r\n    http\r\n      .get('https://reqres.in/api/users/23')\r\n      .pipe(\r\n        catchError(this.handleError)\r\n      ).subscribe();\r\n  }\r\n\r\n  private handleError(error: HttpErrorResponse) {\r\n    console.log(error.statusText); // Prints 'OK';\r\n\r\n    return null;\r\n  }\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nIn the example above I am using a random public endpoint that doesn't return status text with status code: https://reqres.in/api/users/23\r\n\r\nIn Chrome console it looks like:\r\n```\r\nRequest URL: https://reqres.in/api/users/23\r\nRequest Method: GET\r\nStatus Code: 404 \r\n```\r\n\r\nSome investigation lead me to this file https://github.com/angular/angular/blob/7.2.0/packages/common/http/src/response.ts\r\nBut it looks like it should set default statusCode to 'Unknown Error', but it doesn't for some reason.\r\n\r\n## 🌍  Your Environment\r\n\r\n**Angular Version:**\r\n<pre><code>\r\n<!-- run `ng version` and paste output below -->\r\n<!-- ✍️-->\r\nAngular CLI: 6.1.5\r\nNode: 9.6.1\r\nOS: win32 x64\r\nAngular: 6.1.10\r\n... animations, common, compiler, compiler-cli, core, forms\r\n... http, language-service, platform-browser\r\n... platform-browser-dynamic, router\r\n\r\nPackage                           Version\r\n-----------------------------------------------------------\r\n@angular-devkit/architect         0.7.5\r\n@angular-devkit/build-angular     0.7.5\r\n@angular-devkit/build-optimizer   0.7.5\r\n@angular-devkit/build-webpack     0.7.5\r\n@angular-devkit/core              0.7.5\r\n@angular-devkit/schematics        0.7.5\r\n@angular/cli                      6.1.5\r\n@ngtools/webpack                  6.1.5\r\n@schematics/angular               0.7.5\r\n@schematics/update                0.7.5\r\nrxjs                              6.4.0\r\ntypescript                        2.7.2\r\nwebpack                           4.9.2\r\n</code></pre>\r\n","Url":"https://github.com/angular/angular/issues/29024","RelatedDescription":"Open issue \"Http Response 400 returning `StatusText=OK` when no Status Code\" (#29024)"},{"Id":"415571869","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2019-02-28T11:16:23","Actor":"alan-agius4","Number":"29023","RawContent":null,"Title":"fix(bazel): ng_module don't generate tsdoc metadata","State":"open","Body":"\r\n## PR Checklist\r\nPlease check if your PR fulfills the following requirements:\r\n\r\n- [x] The commit message follows our guidelines: https://github.com/angular/angular/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md#commit\r\n- [ ] Tests for the changes have been added (for bug fixes / features)\r\n- [ ] Docs have been added / updated (for bug fixes / features)\r\n\r\n\r\n## PR Type\r\nWhat kind of change does this PR introduce?\r\n\r\n<!-- Please check the one that applies to this PR using \"x\". -->\r\n\r\n- [ ] Bugfix\r\n- [ ] Feature\r\n- [ ] Code style update (formatting, local variables)\r\n- [ ] Refactoring (no functional changes, no api changes)\r\n- [ ] Build related changes\r\n- [ ] CI related changes\r\n- [ ] Documentation content changes\r\n- [ ] angular.io application / infrastructure changes\r\n- [ ] Other...
