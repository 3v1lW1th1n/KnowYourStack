CPS batches them all and runs all targets in a single msbuild instance.\r\n\r\nThe generation of the .g.i.cs is done by a target called DesignTimeMarkupCompilation and that wants to run only during a DT build - to do that it only runs if `$(BuildingProject)` == 'true'`. Normally BuildingProject is false. However there's a target to get the PDB output group that sets it to true. Since it's the same msbuild instance that runs both targets, DesignTimeMarkupCompilation is being skipped. \r\n\r\nNot sure what the right fix is here - the DesignTimeMarkupCompilation can check the `$(DesignTimeBuild)` property instead of BuildingInProject. Or maybe CPS needs to batch the targets into multiple batches.\r\n\r\nA workaround to get this working is to add something like this to the project or to some import:\r\n```xml\r\n  <Target Name=\"WorkaroundForXAMLIntellisenseBuildIssue\" AfterTargets=\"_CheckCompileDesignTimePrerequisite\">\r\n    <PropertyGroup>\r\n       <BuildingProject>false</BuildingProject>\r\n    </PropertyGroup>\r\n  </Target>\r\n```\r\n\r\nThis explicitly sets BuildingProject to false just before we run the CompileDesignTime target.\r\n\r\n\r\n\n\n---\n\n@srivatsn commented on [Thu Jun 22 2017](https://github.com/dotnet/project-system/issues/2488#issuecomment-310503116)\n\n@tmat - can you please put in this workaround in the repo toolset when you move project system repo to repo toolset?

The latter is probably easier to trigger and reproduce.\n\n","Url":"https://github.com/dotnet/wpf/issues/1915","RelatedDescription":"Open issue \"XAML intellisense file generation doesn't work in CPS projects\" (#1915)"},{"Id":"494783539","IsPullRequest":false,"CreatedAt":"2019-09-17T18:30:47","Actor":"vatsan-madhavan","Number":"1914","RawContent":null,"Title":"Remove the \"BuildingProject\" directive completely  from WinFx.targets","State":"open","Body":"I think we should just remove the \"BuildingProject\" directive completely - it just adds confusion to this block as to when it is set/not set.

Instead of relying on a fixed set of system themes (e.g. Aero, Luna, etc.) and related sub-themes (e.g. Luna.Metallic), partially forced by System settings and events, I suggest opening up this mechanism to allow application designers to fully control the actual default styles for their application.\r\n\r\nThe problem is that not being able to easily create/set default styles via themeing causes a great deal of downstream headaches for developers and designers when attempting to devise an entire replacement skin for an application:\r\n* You can't replace the Default Style of a control. As a result, any use of Styles in local application code causes the style to be reverted to Default + Local Style. While `BasedOn` does allow for Style inheritance, this relies on downstream users of a theme to be intimately familiar with how the theme resources are constructed and laid out.\r\n* There are potential workarounds that involve Reflection and hooking the Windows Message loop (e.g. http://northhorizon.net/2010/how-to-actually-change-the-system-theme-in-wpf) but that is fragile code that is subject to breaking if any part of that mechanism breaks down.\r\n\r\nIf it's already possible to do what I'm suggesting, then consider this a documentation improvement request, as it isn't clear at all from the documentation as to how one would go about replacing the actual default styles.","Url":"https://github.com/dotnet/wpf/issues/1913","RelatedDescription":"Open issue \"Expose facilities for contributing to/controlling the WPF Themeing engine\" (#1913)"},{"Id":"494572664","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2019-09-17T12:40:53","Actor":"dotnet-maestro[bot]","Number":"1911","RawContent":null,"Title":"[master] Update dependencies from dotnet/winforms","State":"closed","Body":"This pull request updates the following dependencies\r\n\r\n[marker]: <> (Begin:256c8be3-de58-46f5-d219-08d6ba11f126)\r\n## From https://github.com/dotnet/winforms\r\n- **Build**: 20190917.4\r\n- **Date Produced**: 9/17/2019 11:24 AM\r\n- **Commit**: ccba9d25609fb8bf0e6280ee2122fe03db626605\r\n- **Branch**: refs/heads/master\r\n- **Updates**:\r\n  - **Microsoft.Private.Winforms** -> 5.0.0-alpha1.19467.4\r\n\r\n[marker]: <> (End:256c8be3-de58-46f5-d219-08d6ba11f126)\r\n\r\n","Url":"https://github.com/dotnet/wpf/pull/1911","RelatedDescription":"Closed or merged PR \"[master] Update dependencies from dotnet/winforms\" (#1911)"},{"Id":"494585217","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2019-09-17T12:12:44","Actor":"dotnet-maestro[bot]","Number":"1912","RawContent":null,"Title":"[master] Update dependencies from dnceng/internal/dotnet-wpf-int","State":"open","Body":"This pull request updates the following dependencies\r\n\r\n[marker]: <> (Begin:46a15fe4-6c2c-480d-9cdd-08d71053b252)\r\n## From https://dev.azure.com/dnceng/internal/_git/dotnet-wpf-int\r\n- **Build**: 20190916.24\r\n- **Date Produced**: 9/17/2019 3:47 AM\r\n- **Commit**: 78f46784fe0dcf3f37213eee5741e34905c37e0a\r\n- **Branch**: refs/heads/master\r\n- **Updates**:\r\n  - **Microsoft.DotNet.Wpf.DncEng** -> 5.0.0-alpha1.19466.24\r\n\r\n[marker]: <> (End:46a15fe4-6c2c-480d-9cdd-08d71053b252)\r\n\r\n","Url":"https://github.com/dotnet/wpf/pull/1912","RelatedDescription":"Open PR \"[master] Update dependencies from dnceng/internal/dotnet-wpf-int\" (#1912)"},{"Id":"494552913","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2019-09-17T11:25:40","Actor":"dotnet-maestro[bot]","Number":"1910","RawContent":null,"Title":"[release/3.1] Update dependencies from dotnet/winforms","State":"closed","Body":"This pull request updates the following dependencies\r\n\r\n[marker]: <> (Begin:fd5f4619-cca3-4e12-8f56-08d72a4ce301)\r\n## From https://github.com/dotnet/winforms\r\n- **Build**: 20190917.3\r\n- **Date Produced**: 9/17/2019 10:44 AM\r\n- **Commit**: 4ff3c2f149c677fc7172acf26a674b5c47cefda9\r\n- **Branch**: refs/heads/release/3.1\r\n- **Updates**:\r\n  - **Microsoft.Private.Winforms** -> 4.8.1-preview1.19467.3\r\n\r\n[marker]: <> (End:fd5f4619-cca3-4e12-8f56-08d72a4ce301)\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n","Url":"https://github.com/dotnet/wpf/pull/1910","RelatedDescription":"Closed or merged PR \"[release/3.1] Update dependencies from dotnet/winforms\" (#1910)"},{"Id":"494543934","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2019-09-17T11:20:44","Actor":"dotnet-maestro[bot]","Number":"1909","RawContent":null,"Title":"[master] Update dependencies from dotnet/winforms","State":"closed","Body":"This pull request updates the following dependencies\r\n\r\n[marker]: <> (Begin:256c8be3-de58-46f5-d219-08d6ba11f126)\r\n## From https://github.com/dotnet/winforms\r\n- **Build**: 20190917.1\r\n- **Date Produced**: 9/17/2019 10:21 AM\r\n- **Commit**: 1a1fd3c9f39b6e2b267d602ea3a882c13cd592a8\r\n- **Branch**: refs/heads/master\r\n- **Updates**:\r\n  - **Microsoft.Private.Winforms** -> 5.0.0-alpha1.19467.1\r\n\r\n[marker]: <> (End:256c8be3-de58-46f5-d219-08d6ba11f126)\r\n\r\n","Url":"https://github.com/dotnet/wpf/pull/1909","RelatedDescription":"Closed or merged PR \"[master] Update dependencies from dotnet/winforms\" (#1909)"},{"Id":"494405829","IsPullRequest":false,"CreatedAt":"2019-09-17T05:18:08","Actor":"dotMorten","Number":"1908","RawContent":null,"Title":"CompositionTarget.Rendering event slows down when there are no UI updates","State":"open","Body":"* .NET Core Version:3.0.100-rc1-014190\r\n* Windows version: 1903\r\n* Does the bug reproduce also in WPF for .NET Framework 4.8?: Yes\r\n* Is this bug related specifically to tooling in Visual Studio (e.g. XAML Designer, Code editing, etc...)?

Monitor the output window for framerate updates every 0.5 seconds.\r\n\r\n`MainWindow.xaml`:\r\n```xml\r\n<Window x:Class=\"FrameRateTest.MainWindow\"\r\n        xmlns=\"http://schemas.microsoft.com/winfx/2006/xaml/presentation\"\r\n        xmlns:x=\"http://schemas.microsoft.com/winfx/2006/xaml\"\r\n        xmlns:d=\"http://schemas.microsoft.com/expression/blend/2008\"\r\n        xmlns:mc=\"http://schemas.openxmlformats.org/markup-compatibility/2006\"\r\n        xmlns:local=\"clr-namespace:FrameRateTest\"\r\n        mc:Ignorable=\"d\"\r\n        Title=\"MainWindow\" Height=\"450\" Width=\"800\">\r\n        <Window.Resources>\r\n            <Storyboard x:Key=\"sb\" RepeatBehavior=\"Forever\">\r\n               <DoubleAnimation Storyboard.TargetName=\"tt\" \r\n                       Storyboard.TargetProperty=\"X\" From=\"-250\" To=\"250\" \r\n                       Duration=\"0:0:5\" BeginTime=\"0:0:0\"/>\r\n               <DoubleAnimation Storyboard.TargetName=\"tt\" \r\n                       Storyboard.TargetProperty=\"X\" From=\"250\" To=\"-250\" \r\n                       Duration=\"0:0:5\" BeginTime=\"0:0:5\"/>\r\n            </Storyboard>\r\n        </Window.Resources>\r\n\r\n    <Grid>\r\n        \r\n        <Button HorizontalAlignment=\"Left\" VerticalAlignment=\"Top\" Content=\"Toggle Animation\" Click=\"ToggleAnimation_Click\" />\r\n        \r\n        <Ellipse Width=\"30\" Height=\"30\" Fill=\"Red\" HorizontalAlignment=\"Center\" VerticalAlignment=\"Center\">\r\n           <Ellipse.RenderTransform>\r\n              <TranslateTransform x:Name=\"tt\" />\r\n           </Ellipse.RenderTransform>\r\n        </Ellipse>\r\n    </Grid>\r\n    \r\n</Window>\r\n```\r\n\r\n`MainWindow.xaml.cs`:\r\n```cs\r\nusing System;\r\nusing System.Collections.Generic;\r\nusing System.Diagnostics;\r\nusing System.Windows;\r\nusing System.Windows.Media;\r\nusing System.Windows.Media.Animation;\r\n\r\nnamespace FrameRateTest\r\n{\r\n    /// <summary>\r\n    /// Interaction logic for MainWindow.xaml\r\n    /// </summary>\r\n    public partial class MainWindow : Window\r\n    {\r\n        public MainWindow()\r\n        {\r\n            InitializeComponent();\r\n            CompositionTarget.Rendering += OnRender;\r\n            stopwatch.Start();\r\n        }\r\n\r\n        Stopwatch stopwatch = new Stopwatch();\r\n        TimeSpan lastFrame = TimeSpan.Zero;\r\n        MovingAverage avr = new MovingAverage(60);\r\n        int frame = 0;\r\n        public void OnRender(object sender, EventArgs e)\r\n        {\r\n            frame++;\r\n            var ts = stopwatch.Elapsed;\r\n            avr.AddSample((ts -

Enabling the spellchecker in the RichTextBox component causes text to  disappear randomly, sometimes whilst scrolling, sometimes whilst  writing. The text is still there, it's just invisible.  The invisible text can be selected, the caret can be placed in it, and  writing causes it to become visible and sometimes the next line then  becomes invisible. The code to reproduce is quite simple, all that is  required is the RTB component with the spellchecker  enabled. I was unable to find anything similar to this problem, is this  a known issue? Is there a workaround?</p> <pre> Code to reproduce (xaml): \n</pre><pre>&lt;Window x:Class=&quot;WpfTestRtb.MainWindow&quot;\n        xmlns=&quot;http://schemas.microsoft.com/winfx/2006/xaml/presentation&quot;\n        xmlns:x=&quot;http://schemas.microsoft.com/winfx/2006/xaml&quot;\n        xmlns:d=&quot;http://schemas.microsoft.com/expression/blend/2008&quot;\n        xmlns:mc=&quot;http://schemas.openxmlformats.org/markup-compatibility/2006&quot;\n        xmlns:local=&quot;clr-namespace:WpfTestRtb&quot;\n        mc:Ignorable=&quot;d&quot;\n        Title=&quot;MainWindow&quot; Height=&quot;450&quot; Width=&quot;800&quot;&gt;\n        &lt;Grid&gt;\n          &lt;Grid.ColumnDefinitions&gt;\n              &lt;ColumnDefinition Width=&quot;*&quot;/&gt;\n          &lt;/Grid.ColumnDefinitions&gt;\n          &lt;Grid.RowDefinitions&gt;\n              &lt;RowDefinition Height=&quot;*&quot;/&gt;\n          &lt;/Grid.RowDefinitions&gt;\n          &lt;RichTextBox Grid.Column=&quot;0&quot; Grid.Row=&quot;0&quot; SpellCheck.IsEnabled=&quot;True&quot; HorizontalAlignment=&quot;Stretch&quot; VerticalAlignment=&quot;Stretch&quot; VerticalScrollBarVisibility=&quot;Auto&quot; /&gt;\n      &lt;/Grid&gt;\n&lt;/Window&gt;</pre><p>Code to reproduce (cs):</p><pre>usingSystem;\nusingSystem.Collections.Generic;\nusingSystem.Linq;usingSystem.Text;\nusingSystem.Threading.Tasks;\nusingSystem.Windows;\nusingSystem.Windows.Controls;\nusingSystem.Windows.Data;\nusingSystem.Windows.Documents;\nusingSystem.Windows.Input;\nusingSystem.Windows.Media;\nusingSystem.Windows.Media.Imaging;\nusingSystem.Windows.Navigation;\nusingSystem.Windows.Shapes;\nnamespace WpfTestRtb\n{     \n       /// &lt;summary&gt;     \n       /// Interaction logic for MainWindow.xaml     \n       /// &lt;/summary&gt;     \n       publicpartialclassMainWindow:Window     \n      {         \n              publicMainWindow()         \n              {             \n                   InitializeComponent();        \n              }     \n      }\n}</pre><p>It's important to note that this error doesn't occur immediately,  sometimes you have to write for a while for it to show up, but it does  show up. One solution that I have found is that putting the RTB in a ScrollViewer  causes the problem to go away. This is not something I can do, however,  as from my understanding the scrollviewer breaks virtualization in the  editor which slows the RTB down when there's  a lot of text. I need the editor to retain its speed whilst showing  spelling errors. A closing note, this happens in .NET version  &gt;= 4.0, I tested on 3.x and the error did not occur. </p><p>Example image #1, invisible text:</p><p><a href=\"https://developercommunityapi.westus.cloudapp.azure.com/storage/attachments/92997-example-01.png\"> Image:92997-example-01.png</a></p><p>Example #2, the invisible text is selected: </p><p><a href=\"https://developercommunityapi.westus.cloudapp.azure.com/storage/attachments/92998-example-02.png\"> Image:92998-example-02.png</a></p><p>Example #3, writing in the selection causes some of the lines to become visible:</p><p> <a href=\"https://developercommunityapi.westus.cloudapp.azure.com/storage/attachments/92999-example-03.png\"> Image:92999-example-03.png</a></p> <p>I will also include sample RTF that causes this error:</p> <p><a href=\"https://developercommunityapi.westus.cloudapp.azure.com/storage/attachments/93000-rtf.zip\">rtf.zip</a></p>\n\n---\n### Original Comments\n\n#### Nathan Kawalec on 9/13/2019, 03:00 PM: \n\n<p>I found <a target='_blank' href=\"https://social.msdn.microsoft.com/Forums/windows/en-US/f3074871-3901-44c6-8bb0-40afafd49a43/why-is-text-disappearing-in-richtextbox?forum=winforms\">another question</a> with the same problem, the question is old and I don't think any workarounds were found (apart from not using the RTB). </p>\n\n\n---\n### Original Solutions\n(no solutions)","Url":"https://github.com/dotnet/wpf/issues/1898","RelatedDescription":"Open issue \"Enabling SpellChecker in RichTextEditor causes text to become invisible [WPF]\" (#1898)"},{"Id":"493866000","IsPullRequest":false,"CreatedAt":"2019-09-16T06:18:21","Actor":"vsfeedback","Number":"1897","RawContent":null,"Title":"XamlParseException after updating to 16.2.5","State":"open","Body":"_This issue has been moved from [a ticket on Developer Community](https://developercommunity.visualstudio.com/content/problem/732981/xamlparseexception-after-updating-to-1625.html)._\n\n---\nAfter updating to VS 2019 v16.2.5, I started getting XamlParseExceptions in areas where they have never occurred before (It's happening in Debug mode only).
