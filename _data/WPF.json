When we upgrade to Visual Studio 2019 (MSBuild 16.0) we can remove this. See https://github.com/Microsoft/msbuild/issues/1648--&gt;\n  &lt;/Target&gt;\n\nTo reproduce the issue on the command line build the project\n\nmsbuild WpfAppAlwaysRebuilds.sln /t:Build\n\nThen launch the Solution in Visual Studio and build you will see this in diganostic verbosity:\n\nProject 'WpfAppAlwaysRebuilds' is not up to date. Input file 's:\\temp\\markupbug\\wpfappalwaysrebuilds\\wpfappalwaysrebuilds\\obj\\debug\\mainwindow.g.cs' is modified after output file ''.\n------ Build started: Project: WpfAppAlwaysRebuilds, Configuration: Debug Any CPU ------\n\nNote that in order to repeat it a second time you MUST delete the contents of the /obj/ folder to start &quot;clean&quot; again. Once it has built in Visual Studio once MSBuild will happily report that it is up to date.\n\nExpected behavior\n\nThe expected behavior is that this project will report as &quot;up-to-date&quot;\n\nActual behavior\n\nThe project rebuilds because it determines that it is not &quot;up-to-date&quot;\n\n@livarcocc The Workflow Fix requires the coordination between Dev16; however if you notice bullet 2 I have already worked around this; this is a NEW issue (even after the workflow one is corrected).\n\nHere is the rebuild trigger:\n\n1&gt;Project 'WpfAppAlwaysRebuilds' is not up to date. Input file 'r:\\wpfappalwaysrebuilds\\wpfappalwaysrebuilds\\wpfappalwaysrebuilds\\obj\\debug\\mainwindow.g.cs' is modified after output file ''.\n\nIf this had been the workflow issue it would have been complaining about a *TemporaryGenerated.cs file.\n\nThis issue ends up being the same as the reference issue (although it took me a lot longer to get to that point in the reference issue):\n\n    When MSBuild compiles a WPF Application MarkupCompilePass1 is called PRIOR to all Compile inputs being calculated. One such task that adds additional compile items is GenerateTargetFrameworkMonikerAttribute\n    In Visual Studio GenerateTargetFrameworkMonikerAttribute is called PRIOR to MarkupCompilePass1\n    Because of the design of MarkupCompilePass1 there is another layer of incremental build caching: it is looking at the number of files used as inputs (as well as taking the hashes of their file names) to determine if it should run again or not. Because this added an additional Compile item in Visual Studio it will always rebuild.\n\nThe work around is to apply this into the ProjectFile which will temporarily fix you; but the real fix needs to happen in MSBuild to correctly call GenerateTargetFrameworkMonikerAttribute prior to MarkupCompilePass1:\n\n  &lt;PropertyGroup&gt;\n    &lt;!--This is a hack to try and fix https://github.com/Microsoft/msbuild/issues/4228--&gt;\n    &lt;MarkupCompilePass1DependsOn&gt;$(MarkupCompilePass1DependsOn);GenerateTargetFrameworkMonikerAttribute&lt;/MarkupCompilePass1DependsOn&gt;\n  &lt;/PropertyGroup&gt;\n\nIts unclear who owns this; its either gotta be Visual Studio or the MSBuild team that changes to make this consistent otherwise you will ALWAYS rebuild in WPF.\n\n_This issue has been moved from https://developercommunity.visualstudio.com/content/problem/503048/wpf-application-always-rebuilds-in-visual-studio.html\nVSTS ticketId: 826388_\n_These are the original issue comments:_\n(no comments)\n_These are the original issue solutions:_\n(no solutions)","Url":"https://github.com/dotnet/wpf/issues/460","RelatedDescription":"Open issue \"WPF Application Always Rebuilds In Visual Studio\" (#460)"},{"Id":"424493792","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2019-03-23T12:09:42","Actor":"dotnet-maestro[bot]","Number":"459","RawContent":null,"Title":"[master] Update dependencies from dotnet/arcade","State":"closed","Body":"This pull request updates the following dependencies\r\n\r\n## From https://github.com/dotnet/arcade\r\n- **Build**: 20190321.6\r\n- **Date Produced**: 3/22/2019 4:35 AM\r\n- **Commit**: 2eb45ff0eed6f86f1071b16b11a447cadeeeec59\r\n- **Branch**: refs/heads/master\r\n- **Updates**:\r\n  - **Microsoft.DotNet.Arcade.Sdk** -> 1.0.0-beta.19171.6\r\n\r\n","Url":"https://github.com/dotnet/wpf/pull/459","RelatedDescription":"Closed or merged PR \"[master] Update dependencies from dotnet/arcade\" (#459)"},{"Id":"423530321","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2019-03-22T22:06:04","Actor":"skendrot","Number":"454","RawContent":null,"Title":"Fix documentation typo and punctuation","State":"closed","Body":"Fixes a typo in the class summary documentation and adds punctuation where needed","Url":"https://github.com/dotnet/wpf/pull/454","RelatedDescription":"Closed or merged PR \"Fix documentation typo and punctuation\" (#454)"},{"Id":"423952869","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2019-03-22T16:51:47","Actor":"mmitche","Number":"457","RawContent":null,"Title":"Add coherent parent attributes","State":"closed","Body":"Adds a new dependency (not actually used) on Microsoft.NETCore.App and then ties the existing corefx dependencies to that Microsoft.NETCore.App.  This ensures that corefx binaries do not get ahead of a core-setup that has actually ingested those binaries.

Now, we will have two options: 1) add a new bool property named `IsNotA`; 2) add a new converter named `NotBooleanToVisibilityConverter`. But I think we have a third choice: use a custom markup extension named `ComposeExtension` for it, like below: \r\n```xml\r\n<TextBlock Visibility={Binding IsA, Converter={markup:Compose {StaticResource NotOperator}, {StaticResource BooleanToVisibilityConverter}}} ...\r\n```\r\nIt can compose a series of converters to one converter. The data enters from the first converter, then flows through each converter in turn, and then flows out of the last converter. I think there are still many scenes that need it. (see [here](https://github.com/DingpingZhang/WpfExtensions/blob/master/WpfExtensions.Xaml/Markup/ComposeExtension.cs) for its implementation)\r\n\r\nAnother higher frequency requirement is to use conditional expression (`<bool>?<true value>:<false value>`) in xaml. I know we can use the `Trigger` to implement it, like below:\r\n```xml\r\n    <Button>\r\n        <Button.Style>\r\n            <Style TargetType=\"Button\" BasedOn=\"{StaticResource {x:Type Button}}\">\r\n                <Setter Property=\"Content\" Value=\"{StaticResource LoadingImage}\" />\r\n                <Style.Triggers>\r\n                    <DataTrigger Binding=\"{Binding IsLoaded}\" Value=\"True\">\r\n                        <Setter Property=\"Content\" Value=\"{StaticResource LoadedImage}\" />\r\n                    </DataTrigger>\r\n                </Style.Triggers>\r\n            </Style>\r\n        </Button.Style>\r\n    </Button>\r\n```\r\nBut I think the above code is too long. If we have the `IfExtension`, we can write it in the following form: (see [here](https://github.com/DingpingZhang/WpfExtensions/blob/master/WpfExtensions.Xaml/Markup/IfExtension.cs) for its implementation)\r\n```xml\r\n<Button Content=\"{markup:If {Binding IsLoaded}, {StaticResource LoadedImage}, {StaticResource LoadingImage}}\" />\r\n```\r\n\r\nBut the implementation of `IfExtension` has a known issue: I chose to implement `IfExtension` with `MultiBinding`, in order to get the correct `DataContext` when the values of `IfExtension.True` and `IfExtension.False` are binding, but `MultiBinding.Converters` CANNOT accept values of `MultiBinding` type, so I cannot set a derived class of `MultiBinding` for `IfExtension.True` and `IfExtension.False` , or use `IfExtension` in a nested form.\r\n\r\nI don't quite understand how to create a custom markup extension that gets the correct `DataContext` when the markup needs to accept some `BindingBase` type values. I found that there are many methods to implement `Binding` or `MultiBinding` 's code is `internal` (e.g.: `CreateBindingExpression()`, see [here](https://referencesource.microsoft.com/#PresentationFramework/src/Framework/System/Windows/Data/MultiBinding.cs)), and I'm not sure if I need to use these internal functions perfectly to implement `IfExtension`.\r\n\r\nIn addition, I also want to know what other interesting custom markup extensions you often use, I hope you can share them here, thank you! :)","Url":"https://github.com/dotnet/wpf/issues/455","RelatedDescription":"Open issue \"Provide more built-in markup extensions\" (#455)"},{"Id":"423475428","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2019-03-20T22:12:49","Actor":"stevenbrix","Number":"453","RawContent":null,"Title":"fix publishing","State":"closed","Body":"Fixes #452 ","Url":"https://github.com/dotnet/wpf/pull/453","RelatedDescription":"Closed or merged PR \"fix publishing\" (#453)"},{"Id":"423474296","IsPullRequest":false,"CreatedAt":"2019-03-20T22:12:48","Actor":"stevenbrix","Number":"452","RawContent":null,"Title":"Missing pipeline properties","State":"closed","Body":"These need to be added to azure-pipelines.yml to ensure our publishing works properly:\r\n\r\n  _PublishUsingPipelines: false\r\n  _DotNetArtifactsCategory: .NETCore","Url":"https://github.com/dotnet/wpf/issues/452","RelatedDescription":"Closed issue \"Missing pipeline properties\" (#452)"},{"Id":"423036621","IsPullRequest":false,"CreatedAt":"2019-03-20T02:28:32","Actor":"vsfeedback","Number":"451","RawContent":null,"Title":"WPF: Calendar.DisplayDate Dependency Property","State":"open","Body":"<p>Please see the attached example, there is a <strong>Calendar</strong> and a <strong>Button</strong>.</p><pre>        &lt;Calendar SelectedDate=&quot;{Binding DateTimeTest, Mode=TwoWay}&quot;\n                  DisplayDate=&quot;{Binding DateTimeTest, Mode=OneWay}&quot; /&gt;\n        &lt;Button Command=&quot;{Binding TodayCommand}&quot;\n                Content=&quot;Today&quot; /&gt;\n</pre><p>The <b>Button</b> set the property <b>DateTimeTest</b> to <strong>DateTime.Today</strong>.</p><p></p><p><em>The workflow of the issue:</em></p><ol><li>Select the date 19. 3. 2010 via Calendar via selecting year from the top part (important).</li><li>Press Today Button.</li><li>The selected date of Calendar is not updated.</li></ol><p><b>.NET Framework 4.7.1</b></p>\n\n_This issue has been moved from https://developercommunity.visualstudio.com/content/problem/498724/wpf-calendardisplaydate-dependency-property.html\nVSTS ticketId: 823387_\n_These are the original issue comments:_\n(no comments)\n_These are the original issue solutions:_\n(no solutions)","Url":"https://github.com/dotnet/wpf/issues/451","RelatedDescription":"Open issue \"WPF: Calendar.DisplayDate Dependency Property\" (#451)"},{"Id":"420462240","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2019-03-19T12:10:17","Actor":"dotnet-maestro[bot]","Number":"441","RawContent":null,"Title":"[master] Update dependencies from dotnet/arcade","State":"closed","Body":"This pull request updates the following dependencies\r\n\r\nUpdates from https://github.com/dotnet/arcade\r\n\r\n- Microsoft.DotNet.Arcade.Sdk - 1.0.0-beta.19162.7\r\n\r\nUpdates from https://github.com/dotnet/arcade\r\n\r\n- Microsoft.DotNet.Arcade.Sdk - 1.0.0-beta.19162.7\r\n\r\nUpdates from https://github.com/dotnet/arcade\r\n\r\n- Microsoft.DotNet.Arcade.Sdk - 1.0.0-beta.19162.7\r\n\r\nUpdates from https://github.com/dotnet/arcade\r\n\r\n- Microsoft.DotNet.Arcade.Sdk - 1.0.0-beta.19162.7\r\n\r\nUpdates from https://github.com/dotnet/arcade\r\n\r\n- Microsoft.DotNet.Arcade.Sdk - 1.0.0-beta.19162.7\r\n\r\nUpdates from https://github.com/dotnet/arcade\r\n\r\n- Microsoft.DotNet.Arcade.Sdk - 1.0.0-beta.19162.7\r\n\r\nUpdates from https://github.com/dotnet/arcade\r\n\r\n- Microsoft.DotNet.Arcade.Sdk - 1.0.0-beta.19167.10\r\n\r\n","Url":"https://github.com/dotnet/wpf/pull/441","RelatedDescription":"Closed or merged PR \"[master] Update dependencies from dotnet/arcade\" (#441)"},{"Id":"422526634","IsPullRequest":false,"CreatedAt":"2019-03-19T03:25:19","Actor":"vsfeedback","Number":"450","RawContent":null,"Title":"Touches from dialog window get \"stuck\" in main window","State":"open","Body":"<p>I asked this question already in the other forums but still haven't been able to get a solution for it or even have somebody looking at it, so I'll try it again here (this is copy paste from other post <a href=\"https://social.msdn.microsoft.com/Forums/vstudio/en-US/2defee3c-fcbd-4e3f-afa1-aae21933f129/touches-from-dialog-window-get-quotstuckquot-in-main-window\" target=_blank>here</a>):</p><br><p>We are having quite a problem with our WPF app on touch devices. Sometimes after closing a modal window (opened with ShowDialog()) the buttons on our main window respond correctly to triggers on AreAnyTouchesOver, but they never fire a Click event or command when tapped. After quite some trail and error we believe we have found the issue causing this. The following scenario makes the issue appear.<br><br>Open a modal window and then make the UI thread busy for a while.<br>On the modal window there's a button that closes the window.<br>Now tap the close button and then any locations in the modal window (the close button or even some other place) WHILE the UI thread is still busy.<br>When the UI thread has done it's work it will see the click on the close button and close the window. All touches that came after the first tap on close appear now on the main window. However ONLY the (Preview)TouchDown events are raised in the main window and NO (Preview)TouchUp is ever occurring. This makes the main window think there are still fingers over itself while in reality they are not, and as a result when you tap a button this is seen as &quot;1 more finger&quot; instead of just a single finger tapping the screen.<br><br><a href=\"https://1drv.ms/u/s%21AhqurxiexJWri5EleIA1-J6XZ0aKvA\" target=_blank>https://1drv.ms/u/s!AhqurxiexJWri5EleIA1-J6XZ0aKvA</a><br><br>This sample app is a minimal repro. After the dialog closes you can see that the PreviewTouchDown handler of the main window is fired the same number of times you tapped the dialog after you pressed close for the first time. The PreviewTouchUp handler is never fired. You can see that every time the PreviewTouchDown handler is fired a TouchDevice is added to the TouchesOver collection.<br><br>For some reason after a &quot;random&quot; amount of interactions with the app the number of devices decreases and from the moment all &quot;ghost fingers&quot; are gone the buttons work as expected again.<br><br>We did not yet find a solution to resolve this issue.<br><br>We tried looping over PeekMessage (from User32.dll) to remove all touches in the queue but both WM_TOUCH and WM_GESTURE don't appear in there, even after calling RegisterTouchWindow. PeekMessage works fine for mouse though but we don't have mouse problems.<br><br>We also tried putting an in-between-window between the main window and our modal dialog. This works in the sense that we see the rogue touches coming to the in-between-window, and after we close it the main window will have 0 TouchesOver. But still this does not resolve the issue. We even tried using reflection in the in-between-window to call ReportUp and Deactivate on every TouchDevice in TouchesOver of the in-between-window. And we can see that it has an effect because they are 1 by 1 removed from TouchesOver. But even then after the in-between-window closes and with 0 TouchesOver on any window our main window does not correctly handle touch.</p><p>I did find something very suspicious in the .NET source code: <a href=\"https://referencesource.microsoft.com/#PresentationCore/Core/CSharp/System/Windows/Input/TouchDevice.cs%2c720\">https://referencesource.microsoft.com/#PresentationCore/Core/CSharp/System/Windows/Input/TouchDevice.cs,720</a></p><p><br>So... if anyone has a robust solution this would be very welcome. If not we have to revert to set IsChecked, raise Click event, run Commands, etc all manually in global TouchUp handlers for all buttons.<br><br>Regards,<br>Stan</p>\n\n_This issue has been moved from https://developercommunity.visualstudio.com/content/problem/496835/touches-from-dialog-window-get-stuck-in-main-windo.html\nVSTS ticketId: 822709_\n_These are the original issue comments:_\n(no comments)\n_These are the original issue solutions:_\n(no solutions)","Url":"https://github.com/dotnet/wpf/issues/450","RelatedDescription":"Open issue \"Touches from dialog window get \"stuck\" in main window\" (#450)"},{"Id":"422084915","IsPullRequest":false,"CreatedAt":"2019-03-18T08:09:11","Actor":"vsfeedback","Number":"449","RawContent":null,"Title":"Errors appear in the error list from a WPF project that is not currently being edited or compiled, even though I choose Build Only","State":"open","Body":"VSF_TYPE_MARKDOWNI have a solution with many projects.\n\nI chose to build a class library that has nothing to do with XML.\n\nI set the Error List to show WPF errors for &quot;Build Only&quot;\n\nErrors appear in the error list from a WPF project that is not currently being edited or compiled.\n\n_This issue has been moved from https://developercommunity.visualstudio.com/content/problem/495348/errors-appear-in-the-error-list-from-a-wpf-project.html\nVSTS ticketId: 822269_\n_These are the original issue comments:_\n(no comments)\n_These are the original issue solutions:_\n(no solutions)","Url":"https://github.com/dotnet/wpf/issues/449","RelatedDescription":"Open issue \"Errors appear in the error list from a WPF project that is not currently being edited or compiled, even though I choose Build Only\" (#449)"},{"Id":"422084288","IsPullRequest":false,"CreatedAt":"2019-03-18T08:07:06","Actor":"vsfeedback","Number":"448","RawContent":null,"Title":"no template could be found with the group identity","State":"open","Body":"VSF_TYPE_MARKDOWNI have installed the visual studio community 2019 preview for the first time.
