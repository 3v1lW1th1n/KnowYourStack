The diffs are due to:\r\n\r\n * Mono changing things in their `driver.c` drop\r\n * Me factoring out our customizations into a new file, `driver_blazor.c`.

Fixes #844 and #845","State":"closed","Body":"Previously we were handling relative URLs in various inconsistent ways. Sometimes they were assumed to start with slashes, and other times they were assumed not to do so. Likewise, APIs that were meant to match or return relative URLs did inconsistent things.\r\n\r\nIn this PR I've done a pass through (hopefully) everything that is or handles relative URLs, standardizing on a consistent pattern that:\r\n\r\n * Base URLs always have a trailing slash (just like a `<base href>` value must do, if it's going to behave as people expect)\r\n * Base-relative URLs do not have a leading slash (because if they did, they are root-relative not base-relative)\r\n\r\nThere are still a couple of edge cases:\r\n\r\n * If your site has the base href `/somedir/`, we want anyone visiting `http://yoursite/somedir` to be treated the same as if they were visiting `http://yoursite/somedir/` (i.e., so the same page would be selected and the same nav links would be highlighted). That's because devs often don't have control over the webserver config and might not be able to enforce the trailing slash as canonical.\r\n * With the `@page` directive, people will still typically give values with leading-slashes (e.g., `@page \"/\"`, not `@page \"\"`). We ignore the presence or absence of a leading slash there, because it could never have any meaning, and because people will find it hard to understand what an empty string value would mean.\r\n\r\nAltogether this fixes #844 and #845, plus is just more consistent internally.\r\n\r\n@rynowak @javiercn I'm adding you for review, but I know the contents here won't be hugely interesting as it has limited overlap with your areas. Totally fine if you want to ignore this - I'll just merge it tomorrow unless anyone raises specific concerns.","Url":"https://github.com/aspnet/Blazor/pull/878","RelatedDescription":"Closed or merged PR \"Clean up use of relative URLs.

However, many JavaScript APIs are asynchronous (return `Promise`). It would be great to have built-in ability to call such async JavaScript methods from C#.\r\nTo design convenient API you may consider the utility classes I've created to address the issue:\r\n\r\n_registerAsyncFunction.js:_\r\n```js\r\nconst platform = Blazor.platform;\r\nconst assemblyName = ...;\r\nconst namespace = ...;\r\nconst typeName = \"JsInterop\";\r\n\r\nconst setResultMethod = platform.findMethod(assemblyName, namespace, typeName, \"SetResult\");\r\nconst setResult = (key, result) => {\r\n    if (!result) {\r\n        result = null;\r\n    }\r\n    platform.callMethod(setResultMethod, null, [platform.toDotNetString(key), platform.toDotNetString(JSON.stringify(result))]);\r\n};\r\n\r\nconst setExceptionMethod = platform.findMethod(assemblyName, namespace, typeName, \"SetException\");\r\nconst setException = (key, e) => platform.callMethod(setExceptionMethod, null, [platform.toDotNetString(key), platform.toDotNetString(e.toString())]);\r\n\r\n\r\nmodule.exports = function (identifier, getPromise) {\r\n    Blazor.registerFunction(identifier,\r\n        async (key, argsJson) => {\r\n            key = platform.toJavaScriptString(key); // to resist possible garbage collection of the key in mono\r\n            const args = JSON.parse(platform.toJavaScriptString(argsJson));\r\n            try {\r\n                const result = await getPromise.apply(null, args);\r\n                setResult(key, result);\r\n            } catch (e) {\r\n                setException(key, e);\r\n            }\r\n        });\r\n}\r\n```\r\nUsage from JavaScript side:\r\n```js\r\nconst registerAsyncFunction = require(\"./registerAsyncFunction\");\r\nregisterAsyncFunction(\"FuncName\", (arg1, arg2) => new Promise((resolve, reject) => {\r\n    resolve(result);\r\n}));\r\n```\r\n_JsInterop.cs:_\r\n```c#\r\npublic static class JsInterop\r\n{\r\n    private static long _counter;\r\n    private static readonly ConcurrentDictionary<string, (Action<string> SetResult, Action<Exception> SetException)> TaskCompletions = new ConcurrentDictionary<string, (Action<string>, Action<Exception>)>();\r\n\r\n    public static Task<T> InvokeRegisteredAsyncFunction<T>(string identifier, params object[] args)\r\n    {\r\n        var key = Interlocked.Increment(ref _counter).ToString(CultureInfo.InvariantCulture);\r\n        var taskCompletionSource = new TaskCompletionSource<T>();\r\n        var tuple = ((Action<string>)(json => taskCompletionSource.SetResult(JsonConvert.DeserializeObject<T>(json))), (Action<Exception>)taskCompletionSource.SetException);\r\n        TaskCompletions.TryAdd(key, tuple);\r\n        try\r\n        {\r\n            RegisteredFunction.InvokeUnmarshalled<object>(identifier, key, JsonConvert.SerializeObject(args));\r\n        }\r\n        catch (JavaScriptException e)\r\n        {\r\n            TaskCompletions.TryRemove(key, out _);\r\n            throw;\r\n        }\r\n        return taskCompletionSource.Task;\r\n    }\r\n\r\n    private static void SetResult(string key, string json)\r\n    {\r\n        TaskCompletions.TryRemove(key, out var tuple);\r\n        tuple.SetResult(json);\r\n    }\r\n\r\n    private static void SetException(string key, string message)\r\n    {\r\n        TaskCompletions.TryRemove(key, out var tuple);\r\n        tuple.SetException(new JavaScriptException(message));\r\n    }\r\n}\r\n```\r\nUsage from C# side:\r\n```c#\r\nvar result = await JsInterop.InvokeRegisteredAsyncFunction<TResult>(\"FuncName\", arg1, arg2);\r\n```\r\n","Url":"https://github.com/aspnet/Blazor/issues/861","RelatedDescription":"Closed issue \"registerAsyncFunction is wanted\" (#861)"},{"Id":"324703107","IsPullRequest":false,"CreatedAt":"2018-05-22T09:18:54","Actor":"a-student","Number":"862","RawContent":null,"Title":"Ability to run Blazor code inside web worker is needed","State":"closed","Body":"Currently Blazor startup code is tighted to `window` and `document` objects, but worker global object does not have these.\r\nBy the way, some optimization to startup inside a worker can be made [because](https://webassembly.org/getting-started/js-api)\r\n> A WebAssembly.Module object is stateless and supports structured cloning which means that the compiled code can be stored in IndexedDB and/or shared between windows and workers via postMessage\r\n\r\nAt the present time I am using the workaround:\r\n```js\r\nconst xhr = require(\"xhr\");\r\nconst parse5 = require(\"parse5\");\r\n\r\n// index.html content: <script type=\"blazor-boot\"></script>\r\nxhr(\"index.html\", (error, response, body) => {\r\n    if (error) {\r\n        console.log(error);\r\n        return;\r\n    }\r\n\r\n    const script = parse5.parseFragment(body).childNodes[0];\r\n    const src = script.attrs.find(x => x.name === \"src\").value;

I have created the duplicate with the hope that experts here can help me to tune the performance of the code build with Blazor. I am using Blazor version 0.3.0.\r\n\r\n\r\nIt is stated [here](https://webassembly.org) that\r\n> WebAssembly aims to execute at native speed\r\n\r\nTherefore, **mono-wasm** is expected to perform nearly the same as on desktop. Unfortunately, mono for WebAssembly is far away in performance than expected, it is on average 200x slower.\r\n\r\nConsider this code:\r\n```C#\r\nvar sw = Stopwatch.StartNew();\r\nvar a = Math.PI;\r\nfor (var i = 0; i < 1080; i++) {\r\n    for (var j = 0; j < 1000000; j++) {\r\n        a += Math.PI;\r\n    }\r\n}\r\nConsole.WriteLine(\"Elapsed \" + sw.Elapsed);\r\n```\r\nIt prints\r\n`Elapsed 00:00:00.9990513` when running in **.NET Core**\r\n`Elapsed 00:00:02.9962702` when running in **mono** on desktop\r\n`Elapsed 00:21:38.9038000` when running in **Blazor** (Google Chrome browser). This is >400x slower than mono on desktop!\r\n\r\nThe same code in JavaScript shows almost the same performance as in .NET Core:\r\n```JavaScript\r\nlet t = performance.now();\r\nlet a = Math.PI;\r\nfor (let i = 0; i < 1080; i++) {\r\n    for (let j = 0; j < 1000000; j++) {\r\n        a += Math.PI;\r\n    }\r\n}\r\nt = performance.now() - t;\r\nconsole.log(\"Elapsed \" + t + \" milliseconds\");\r\n```\r\nIt prints\r\n`Elapsed 1179.1999999986729 milliseconds`\r\n\r\nBy the way, mono-wasm in the latest Firefox shows better performance than in Chrome (`Elapsed 00:01:13.5770000`), but still very slow on average.\r\n\r\nSo my questions are:\r\n1.
