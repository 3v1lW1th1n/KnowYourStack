In those cases, we fall into logic that resets state for the next navigation. One piece of this resetting is to set the `browserUrlTree` to the most recent `urlAfterRedirects`i.\r\n\r\nHowever, there was bug in this logic because in some cases the `urlAfterRedirects` is a stale value. This happens any time a URL won't be processed, and the previous URL will also not be processed. This creates unpredictable behavior, not the least of which ends up being a broken `back` button.\r\n\r\nThis PR kicks off new navigations with the current value the router assumes is in the browser. All the logic around how to handle future navigations is based on this value compared to the current transition, so it's important to kick off all new navigations with the current value so in the edge case described above we don't end up with an old value being set into `browserUrlTree`.\r\n\r\nFixes #30340\r\nRelated to #30160\r\n","Url":"https://github.com/angular/angular/pull/30344","RelatedDescription":"Open PR \"fix(router): ensure navigations start with the current URL value inca‚Ä¶\" (#30344)"},{"Id":"441965700","IsPullRequest":false,"CreatedAt":"2019-05-08T22:53:19","Actor":"KyleVassella","Number":"30343","RawContent":null,"Title":"Angular.io's documentation is esoteric and not helpful","State":"open","Body":"Just look at the official documentation for the @ViewChild decorator.

However, the value is stale due to the above description.\r\n\r\nThe next navigation they are performing in the test is hitting `back`, which goes to the root.

The reason for the failures is that downgraded components are no-longer rendered in AngularJS tests after calling `$compile`.\r\nThe cause seems to be the introduction of `Promise.all` at https://github.com/angular/angular/commit/bc0ee01#diff-fbe3a53baaa7090c3afd629acfd73fccR207\r\n\r\n## üî¨ Minimal Reproduction\r\n<!--\r\nPlease create and share minimal reproduction of the issue starting with this template: https://stackblitz.com/fork/angular-issue-repro2\r\n-->\r\n\r\n<!--\r\nIf StackBlitz is not suitable for reproduction of your issue, please create a minimal GitHub repository with the reproduction of the issue.\r\nA good way to make a minimal reproduction is to create a new app via `ng new repro-app` and add the minimum possible code to show the problem. \r\nShare the link to the repo below along with step-by-step instructions to reproduce the problem, as well as expected and actual behavior.\r\n\r\nIssues that don't have enough info and can't be reproduced will be closed.\r\n\r\nYou can read more about issue submission guidelines here: https://github.com/angular/angular/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md#-submitting-an-issue\r\n-->\r\nIt will be very hard to create minimal reproduction environment due to the co-existence of angular & AngularJS in the app and considering our complex setup.\r\nIn a nutshell we use `$compile` to compile templates containing downgraded components and than we call `$scope.$apply()`.\r\nAfter that we perform some verification of the rendered html. It seems that after this change `doDowngrade` is called well after the verification completes. In a sense this change is breaking the synchronous nature of Angular 1's `$compile` as stated in the jsdoc of `ParentInjectorPromise`.\r\n\r\nWe are using `UpgradeAppType.Static`. In our case `finalParentInjector` & `finalModuleInjector` are the same injector so I did an experiment and reverted back to having `parentInjector.then(downgradeFn);` and all tests started passing again.\r\n## üî• Exception or Error\r\n<pre><code>\r\n<!-- If the issue is accompanied by an exception or an error, please share it below: -->\r\n<!-- ‚úçÔ∏è-->\r\n\r\n</code></pre>\r\n\r\n\r\n## üåç  Your Environment\r\n\r\n**Angular Version:**\r\n<pre><code>\r\n<!-- run `ng version` and paste output below -->\r\n<!-- ‚úçÔ∏è-->\r\n     _                      _                 ____ _     ___\r\n    / \\   _ __   __ _ _   _| | __ _ _ __     / ___| |   |_ _|\r\n   / ‚ñ≥ \\ | '_ \\ / _` | | | | |/ _` | '__|   | |   | |    | |\r\n  / ___ \\| | | | (_| | |_| | | (_| | |      | |___| |___ | |\r\n /_/   \\_\\_| |_|\\__, |\\__,_|_|\\__,_|_|       \\____|_____|___|\r\n                |___/\r\n\r\n\r\nAngular CLI: 7.3.7\r\nNode: 8.11.1\r\nOS: win32 x64\r\nAngular: 7.2.14\r\n... animations, common, compiler, compiler-cli, core, forms\r\n... http, language-service, platform-browser\r\n... platform-browser-dynamic, router, upgrade\r\n\r\nPackage                            Version\r\n------------------------------------------------------------\r\n@angular-devkit/architect          0.13.7\r\n@angular-devkit/build-angular      0.13.8\r\n@angular-devkit/build-ng-packagr   0.13.8\r\n@angular-devkit/build-optimizer    0.13.8\r\n@angular-devkit/build-webpack      0.13.8\r\n@angular-devkit/core               7.3.7\r\n@angular-devkit/schematics         7.3.7\r\n@angular/cli                       7.3.7\r\n@ngtools/json-schema               1.1.0\r\n@ngtools/webpack                   7.3.8\r\n@schematics/angular                7.3.7\r\n@schematics/update                 0.13.7\r\nng-packagr                         4.7.1\r\nrxjs                               6.2.2\r\ntypescript                         3.2.4\r\nwebpack                            4.29.0\r\n\r\n\r\n</code></pre>\r\n\r\n**Anything else relevant?**\r\n<!-- ‚úçÔ∏èIs this a browser specific issue?

These files should be in the `deps` instead.

Additionally while im in a fortuitous position to make adjustments to the server side layer, I know many many many others do not have that luxury. \r\n\r\nI also know Flask isn't unique in this scenario, it's just the one affecting me right now. \r\n\r\nThe react-app I just replaced with Angular, had the following directory structure\r\n\r\n```\r\nclient_build\r\n|_ index.html\r\n|_ static/\r\n   |_ media/\r\n      |_ *.png\r\n   |_ js/\r\n      |_ *.js\r\n   |_ css/\r\n      |_ *.css\r\n```\r\nWhen placed verbatim into a Flask configuration such as \r\n\r\n```\r\ntemplate_dir = os.path.abspath('client_build')\r\nstatic_dir = os.path.abspath('client_build/static')\r\n\r\napp = Flask(\r\n    __name__,\r\n    template_folder=template_dir,\r\n    static_folder=static_dir,\r\n)\r\n```\r\n\r\nit works perfectly. Everything is found, everything functions as it should. \r\n\r\nWhen I place the angular distribution in there, the `index.html` loads fine, but everything else fails to load, js/css/images included. \r\n\r\nI've been monkeying with Flask and angular-cli for days now trying to find the sweet spot configuration wise, but it still isn't quite there. \r\n\r\ncurrently I have as modified build options\r\n```\r\n    \"build-dev\": \"ng build --watch --deploy-url=/assets/\",\r\n    \"build\": \"ng build --deploy-url=/assets/ && cp ../src/client_build/assets/* ../src/client_build/ && rm -rf ../src/client_build/assets\",\r\n    \"build-prod\": \"ng build --prod --build-optimizer --delete-output-path --optimization --progress --vendor-chunk --aot --deploy-url=/assets/ && cp ../src/client_build/assets/* ../src/client_build/ && rm -rf ../src/client_build/assets\",\r\n    \r\n```\r\n\r\nwith a flask config like\r\n\r\n```\r\ntemplate_dir = os.path.abspath(\"client_build\")\r\nstatic_dir = os.path.abspath(\"client_build\")\r\nstatic_url = \"/assets\"\r\n\r\napp = Flask(\r\n    __name__,\r\n    template_folder=template_dir,\r\n    static_folder=static_dir,\r\n    static_url_path=static_url,\r\n)\r\n```\r\n\r\nand the problem I face now, is that all of my everything is in the root directory, images included, AND, with the `build-dev` script, the app works but all the images are missing because the `--watch` doesn't know to manipulate the output directory every time. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nI know this isn't a Flask help thread, but if I could just tell `angular-cli` where to put things (like I feel I should be able too..) I would be a much happier camper.   Not every hosting situation for angular output is going to be like throwing the distribution into an s3 bucket and calling it a day.
