I am noticing that I can get deprecation information about a given package if the metadata was obtained by invoking `PackageMetadataResource.GetMetadataAsync`. However, the deprecation information for the same pakage is null if the metadata was obtained by invoking `PackageSearchResource.SearchAsync`.\r\n\r\nHere is C# code to reproduce the problem:\r\n```csharp\r\nvar packageId = \"Cake.Tfs\";\r\n\r\n// Prepare the nuget client\r\nvar providers = new List<Lazy<INuGetResourceProvider>>();\r\nproviders.AddRange(NuGet.Protocol.Core.Types.Repository.Provider.GetCoreV3());  // Add v3 API support\r\nvar packageSource = new PackageSource(\"https://api.nuget.org/v3/index.json\");\r\nvar nugetRepository = new SourceRepository(packageSource, providers);\r\n\r\n// Fetch the package metadata using the 'GetMetadataAsync' method\r\nvar nugetPackageMetadataClient = await nugetRepository.GetResourceAsync<PackageMetadataResource>().ConfigureAwait(false);\r\nvar getMetadataResult = await nugetPackageMetadataClient.GetMetadataAsync(packageId, true, false, new SourceCacheContext(), NullLogger.Instance, CancellationToken.None).ConfigureAwait(false);\r\nvar packageMetadata = getMetadataResult.OrderByDescending(p => p.Published).First();\r\nvar packageMetadataDeprecationInfo = await packageMetadata.GetDeprecationMetadataAsync().ConfigureAwait(false);\r\n\r\n// Search for the package\r\nvar filters = new SearchFilter(true) { IncludeDelisted = false };\r\nvar nugetSearchClient = nugetRepository.GetResource<PackageSearchResource>();\r\nvar searchResult = await nugetSearchClient.SearchAsync(packageId, filters, 0, 1000, NullLogger.Instance, CancellationToken.None).ConfigureAwait(false);\r\nvar searchMetadata = searchResult.Single(r => r.Identity.Id == packageId);\r\nvar searchMetadataDeprecationInfo = await searchMetadata.GetDeprecationMetadataAsync().ConfigureAwait(false);\r\n\r\n// Display what we found\r\nConsole.WriteLine($\"Package {packageId} deprecated when using the 'GetMetadataAsync' method: {packageMetadataDeprecationInfo != null}\");\r\nConsole.WriteLine($\"Package {packageId} deprecated when using the 'SearchAsync' method: {searchMetadataDeprecationInfo != null}\");\r\n```\r\n\r\nThe following is output to the console:\r\n```\r\nPackage Cake.Tfs deprecated when using the 'GetMetadataAsync' method: True\r\nPackage Cake.Tfs deprecated when using the 'SearchAsync' method: False\r\n```\r\n\r\nAs you can see, the result is different based on how the metadata was obtained. My expectation is that the deprecation information should be the same no matter how I retrieve the package metadata.\r\n\r\nThe code sample I presented in this issue is a simplified version of my actual scenario. In my scenario I use the `SearchAsync` method to retrieve the metadata about several packages (about 400 or so) so I would hate to have to loop through a list of 400 package and invoke the `GetMetadataAsync` for each one.

We have made continuous investments to make it more reliable, performant and secure. Going forward, we plan to bring all new features and improvements only to the newer `V3 APIs`. As part of this strategy, we are deprecating the usage of `OData` queries. Subsequently, we plan to **disable the `OData` queries starting Feb 5th, 2020**.\r\n\r\n**Call to Action: Transition to V3 APIs**\r\n\r\nHere are some resources to help you with the migration:\r\n* [NuGet Server `V3 APIs` reference](https://devblogs.microsoft.com/nuget/switching-from-wcf-odata-to-web-api/)\r\n* [Guide to transition from NuGet `V2 API` to `V3 API`](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/nuget/guides/api/query-for-all-published-packages). \r\n* [Blog post: Switching from WCF OData to Web API](https://devblogs.microsoft.com/nuget/switching-from-wcf-odata-to-web-api/)\r\n\r\nIf you need further help in moving your use case to `V3 APIs`, do reach out to us at [support@nuget.org](mailto:support@nuget.org).\r\n"},{"Id":"10115721045","Type":"IssuesEvent","CreatedAt":"2019-07-30T22:44:31","Actor":"shoter","Repository":"NuGet/Announcements","Organization":"NuGet","RawContent":null,"RelatedAction":"closed","RelatedUrl":"https://github.com/NuGet/Announcements/issues/36","RelatedDescription":"Closed issue \"Replace reference to codeplex issue numer 3072\" (#36) at NuGet/Announcements","RelatedBody":"This is copy of codeplex issue number 3072 as it is referenced inside code.
