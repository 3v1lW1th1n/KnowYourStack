issue \"DocumentBuilder merges numbering definitions referencing the same abstract numbering definition\" (#84) at OfficeDev/Open-Xml-PowerTools","RelatedBody":"When building a document, `DocumentBuilder` merges [numbering definition instances](https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/documentformat.openxml.wordprocessing.numberinginstance.aspx) referencing the same [abstract numbering definition](https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/documentformat.openxml.wordprocessing.abstractnum.aspx). This leads to bugs if the numbering definitions contain [numbering level definition overrides](https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/documentformat.openxml.wordprocessing.leveloverride.aspx).\n\nFor an example, see the [example document](https://github.com/OfficeDev/Open-Xml-PowerTools/files/434902/Example.of.numbering.definitions.with.same.abstract.numering.definition.docx) and the [processed version](https://github.com/OfficeDev/Open-Xml-PowerTools/files/434917/Example.of.numbering.definitions.with.same.abstract.numering.definition-processed.docx). When opened in Word, the example document displays three lists, each numbered from 1 to 3. After being included in a document built with `DocumentBuilder`, however, the processed version displays as three lists with a consecutive numbering from 1 to 9.\n\nTechnically, this is due to the `CopyNumbering` method in `WordBuilder` only creating a new numbering definition if it can't find one using the same abstract numbering definition. Instead, it should use a map like `CopyComments`.\n\nThis issue is the cause of a bug in our system, so I'll will start working on a fix.\n"},{"Id":"7253804158","Type":"PullRequestEvent","CreatedAt":"2018-02-16T08:10:59","Actor":"kimsey0","Repository":"OfficeDev/Open-Xml-PowerTools","Organization":"OfficeDev","RawContent":null,"RelatedAction":"closed","RelatedUrl":"https://github.com/OfficeDev/Open-Xml-PowerTools/pull/114","RelatedDescription":"Closed pull request \"Use a map when copying numbering definition instances in DocumentBuil…\" (#114) at OfficeDev/Open-Xml-PowerTools","RelatedBody":"Use a map when copying numbering definition instances in DocumentBuilder instead of identifying instances by the abstract numbering id.\r\n\r\nFixes OfficeDev/Open-Xml-PowerTools#84\r\n\r\nSupersedes OfficeDev/Open-Xml-PowerTools#86"},{"Id":"7252827588","Type":"PullRequestEvent","CreatedAt":"2018-02-16T00:58:36","Actor":"EricWhiteDev","Repository":"OfficeDev/Open-Xml-PowerTools","Organization":"OfficeDev","RawContent":null,"RelatedAction":"merged","RelatedUrl":"https://github.com/OfficeDev/Open-Xml-PowerTools/pull/206","RelatedDescription":"Merged pull request \"Add code to protect against situation when Word saves a document with…\" (#206) at OfficeDev/Open-Xml-PowerTools","RelatedBody":"… a duplicate style"},{"Id":"7252827142","Type":"PullRequestEvent","CreatedAt":"2018-02-16T00:58:27","Actor":"EricWhiteDev","Repository":"OfficeDev/Open-Xml-PowerTools","Organization":"OfficeDev","RawContent":null,"RelatedAction":"opened","RelatedUrl":"https://github.com/OfficeDev/Open-Xml-PowerTools/pull/206","RelatedDescription":"Opened pull request \"Add code to protect against situation when Word saves a document with…\" (#206) at OfficeDev/Open-Xml-PowerTools","RelatedBody":"… a duplicate style"},{"Id":"7246580995","Type":"PullRequestEvent","CreatedAt":"2018-02-14T22:11:15","Actor":"EricWhiteDev","Repository":"OfficeDev/Open-Xml-PowerTools","Organization":"OfficeDev","RawContent":null,"RelatedAction":"merged","RelatedUrl":"https://github.com/OfficeDev/Open-Xml-PowerTools/pull/205","RelatedDescription":"Merged pull request \"Fix issue where ignorable attribute was getting set incorrectly.\" (#205) at OfficeDev/Open-Xml-PowerTools","RelatedBody":""},{"Id":"7246580234","Type":"PullRequestEvent","CreatedAt":"2018-02-14T22:11:06","Actor":"EricWhiteDev","Repository":"OfficeDev/Open-Xml-PowerTools","Organization":"OfficeDev","RawContent":null,"RelatedAction":"opened","RelatedUrl":"https://github.com/OfficeDev/Open-Xml-PowerTools/pull/205","RelatedDescription":"Opened pull request \"Fix issue where ignorable attribute was getting set incorrectly.\" (#205) at OfficeDev/Open-Xml-PowerTools","RelatedBody":""},{"Id":"7246313809","Type":"PullRequestEvent","CreatedAt":"2018-02-14T21:12:31","Actor":"EricWhiteDev","Repository":"OfficeDev/Open-Xml-PowerTools","Organization":"OfficeDev","RawContent":null,"RelatedAction":"merged","RelatedUrl":"https://github.com/OfficeDev/Open-Xml-PowerTools/pull/110","RelatedDescription":"Merged pull request \"Remove dependency on MediaDataPartType, which doesn't contain MP4\" (#110) at OfficeDev/Open-Xml-PowerTools","RelatedBody":"MediaDataPartType isn't really needed.
