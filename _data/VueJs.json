[I ran into an issue where the build was failing](https://forum.vuejs.org/t/documentation-js-build-command-choking-on-weird-vue-template-compiler-error/58770) because `vue-template-compiler` was throwing a \"Vue packages version mismatch\" error. \r\n\r\nI did not have vue installed globally or in the `node_modules/` of my project's root directory, and it took me a while to figure out how the package was determining the version of vue and where it was resolving on my machine (I had accidentally installed an npm project in a parent directory creating a `node_modules/` folder with the vue package in it). \r\n\r\nIt would be helpful, when the `vue-template-compiler` throws the \"version mismatch\" error, to display the path the to `vue` package that has been resolved. That way, it would be immediately clear which specific `vue` package on the dev's machine the compiler is comparing its version to. \r\n\r\nIn the Vue Forum discussion, I asked Linus Borg if he thought a pull request to add this feature would be helpful, and he said it might be. I have [created a fork](https://github.com/mcmillenb/vue) and [updated the error message](https://github.com/mcmillenb/vue/blob/dev/packages/vue-template-compiler/index.js) on that forked repo. I'm submitting this feature request to be approved before making the pull request. I also am not sure how to write a unit test for the build error messaging and would appreciate guidance.\r\n\r\n### What does the proposed API look like?\r\nUpdated error message looks like this: \r\n\r\n```\r\nVue packages version mismatch:\r\n\r\n- vue@2.5.22\r\n- vue-template-compiler@2.6.8\r\n\r\nPath to vue package: /Users/brianmcmillen/tests/docs-test/node_modules/vue/dist/vue.runtime.common.js\r\n\r\nThis may cause things to work incorrectly. Make sure to use the same version for both.\r\nIf you are using vue-loader@>=10.0, simply update vue-template-compiler.\r\nIf you are using vue-loader@<10.0 or vueify, re-installing vue-loader/vueify should bump vue-template-compiler to the latest.\r\n```\r\n\r\n<!-- generated by vue-issues.

So, the issue is the following:\r\n\r\n**routes.js**\r\n\r\n```\r\n{\r\n    path:'/',\r\n    components:{\r\n        allPageView:LytSPA\r\n    },\r\n    meta:{\r\n        requiresAuth:true\r\n    },\r\n    children:[\r\n        {\r\n            path:'',\r\n            name:'admin',\r\n            components:{\r\n                sectionView:AdminDashboard\r\n            }\r\n        },\r\n        {\r\n            name:'admin.users',\r\n            path:'usuarios',\r\n            components:{\r\n                sectionView:Users\r\n            },\r\n            children:[\r\n                {\r\n                    name:'admin.users.create',\r\n                    path:'crear', \r\n                    components:{\r\n                        sectionView:UsersCreateEdit\r\n                    }\r\n                }\r\n            ]\r\n        }]}\r\n```\r\n\r\nSo, the paths are: / , /usuarios and /usuarios/crear.\r\n\r\nMy views are: App.vue (with a named view), LytSPA.vue (with a named view), AdminDashboard.vue, Users.vue, UsersCreateEdit. So, I have 2 node views and 3 leaf views.\r\n\r\n**App.vue**\r\n\r\n```\r\n<template>\r\n<router-view name=\"allPageView\"></router-view>\r\n</template>\r\n```\r\n\r\n**LytSPA.vue**\r\n\r\n```\r\n<template>\r\n<div>\r\n    <header>\r\n        <header-view></header-view>\r\n    </header>\r\n    <transition name=\"slide-left-aside\">\r\n        <aside v-show=\"!collapsed\">\r\n            <aside-view @collapse=\"collapseAside\"></aside-view>\r\n        </aside>\r\n    </transition>\r\n    <transition name=\"slide-expand-button\">\r\n        <b-button @click=\"collapseAside(false)\" id=\"btnExpand\" v-show=\"collapsed\">\r\n            <font-awesome-icon icon=\"chevron-right\"/>\r\n        </b-button>\r\n    </transition>\r\n    <section id=\"sectionSPA\" :class=\"{collapsed: collapsed}\">\r\n        <breadcrumb-view></breadcrumb-view>\r\n        <router-view name=\"sectionView\" key=\"$route.fullPath\"></router-view>\r\n    </section>\r\n</div></template>\r\n```\r\n\r\nAs you can see, in **LayoutSPA.vue** I dropped my main views in the container **sectionView**, thus:\r\n\r\n - when the path is / load the Dashboard view.\r\n - when the path is /usuarios load the Users view.\r\n\r\nAnd here comes the problem, when the path is /usuarios/crear doesn´t load the UsersCreateEdit view, else it keeps the last one (Users.vue). However, the routing is working because I put a redirect validation for unknown URLs, since the url usuarios/crear doesn´t change so that's work but doesn´t load the view.\r\n\r\nI have already worked of this way with UI-Router in AngularJS and there wasn´t any problem because it works with inheritance of states, but I want to know if exists any way to do the same in Vue???\r\n\r\n\r\n### What is expected?\r\nShow the view UserCreateEdit.vue\r\n\r\n### What is actually happening?\r\nShow the view Users.vue ,this is incorrect, because it shows the same view for 2 different paths.\r\n\r\n---\r\nNote: I have an alternative solution but I don´t like it, because I have to put the admin.users.create route as a sibling of admin.users and it works but I need that it be nested because I need to retrieve the matched routes to build my breadcrumb and I don't want to parse the path to build it.\r\n\r\nImage of running application: https://i.stack.imgur.com/3ZC1c.png\r\n\r\n<!-- generated by vue-issues.

If I create a function and attach it to a click event (e.g. on a Button) such as shown below, I have no issues.

Is there reason to have this inconsistency?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nProblem occurs when you try to watch getters\r\nexample:\r\n```\r\nwatch: {\r\n  '$store.state.user.name': {\r\n    handler(name) {\r\n      console.log(name)\r\n    },\r\n  },\r\n  '$store.getters[user/fullName]': { // not working\r\n    handler(fullName) {\r\n      console.log(fullName)\r\n    },\r\n  },\r\n}\r\n```\r\nCurrent solution Is to use mapGetters() helper for getters only. Why? because of weird api.\r\nPlease note that we try to avoid mapGetters, mapState helpers... due to explicitly in large app\r\n\r\n### What does the proposed API look like?\r\nAdd api for getters same as is for state.\r\n\r\nExample:\r\n`$store.gettters.user.fullName`\r\n\r\n<!-- generated by vue-issues.
