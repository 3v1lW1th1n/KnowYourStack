For example, \"one thousand decimal 5\" would be formatted like:\r\n\r\n- 1,000.5 in the US (using a comma to separate thousands a point as the decimal separator) and\r\n- 1.000,5 in Germany (using a point to separate thousands and a comma as the decimal separator).\r\n\r\nSimply using `number.ToString()` will produce different results for different cultures. To get the same result when comparing numbers in string format on machines with different locale / culture settings, you must use `number.ToString(CultureInfo.InvariantCulture)`.\r\n\r\n**Observed**\r\n\r\nThe above-mentioned unit tests fail on machines using number formats different from those used in the US (invariant culture).\r\n\r\n**Expected**\r\n\r\nThe above-mentioned unit tests pass regardless of the local number formats."},{"Id":"7575649678","Type":"PullRequestEvent","CreatedAt":"2018-04-24T02:54:25","Actor":"twsouthwick","Repository":"OfficeDev/Open-XML-SDK","Organization":"OfficeDev","RawContent":null,"RelatedAction":"merged","RelatedUrl":"https://github.com/OfficeDev/Open-XML-SDK/pull/487","RelatedDescription":"Merged pull request \"Make simple types comparable and equatable\" (#487) at OfficeDev/Open-XML-SDK","RelatedBody":"In conjunction with #485, this commit introduces two base classes,\r\n`OpenXmlComparableReferenceType` and `OpenXmlComparableValueType`, which\r\nimplement the `IComparable`, `IComparable<T>`, and `IEquatable<T>`\r\ninterfaces. With the exception of `EnumValue` and `ListValue`, all children\r\nor descendants of `OpenXmlSimpleType` are changed to become subclasses of\r\none of those two base classes.\r\n\r\nThis commit further adds unit tests for the new behavior. The core\r\ntests are contained in the `OpenXmlComparableReferenceTypeTests` and\r\n`OpenXmlComparableValueTypeTests` base classes. For each concrete simple\r\ntype, subclasses of those base classes create the concrete values to be\r\nused in the generic unit tests.\r\n\r\nLastly, this commit fixes existing unit tests within the `SimpleTypeTest`\r\nand `OpenXmlSimpleValueTest` classes, because those unit tests asserted\r\nthat two instances with same value but constructed separately are NOT\r\nequal.\r\n\r\nNote that the implementation is not yet complete as it lacks comments\r\nfor some public methods, for example. We might also have to add further\r\nunit tests."},{"Id":"7568877244","Type":"IssuesEvent","CreatedAt":"2018-04-23T00:21:55","Actor":"twsouthwick","Repository":"OfficeDev/Open-XML-SDK","Organization":"OfficeDev","RawContent":null,"RelatedAction":"opened","RelatedUrl":"https://github.com/OfficeDev/Open-XML-SDK/issues/491","RelatedDescription":"Opened issue \"Convert FileFormatVersions to non-flags enum or even simply a constant\" (#491) at OfficeDev/Open-XML-SDK","RelatedBody":"I've added an item to investigate switch the FileFormatVersions enum to a non-flags enum or simply constants.
