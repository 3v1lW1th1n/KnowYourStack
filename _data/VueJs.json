Webpack creates ~40 bundles for us. Altogether, these weigh ~20MB. The way  `VueSSRServerPlugin` plugin works, as you know, is it combines all of these files into a single `vue-ssr-server-bundle.json` file. Reading that file in node is fast (5ms on average) for us, but after reading it we need to `JSON.parse` it before providing to `createBundleRenderer` and _that_ takes ~400ms.\r\n\r\nInitially I was thinking of using webpack's `splitChunks`, to reduce the file-size (our router dynamically imports top-level pages, so each chunk could benefit from not having to bring in common component) but `VueSSRServerPlugin` does not support that (and throws the \"Server-side bundle should have one single entry file\" error).\r\n\r\n### What does the proposed API look like?\r\nI'm not exactly sure what to do here at this point as I just noticed this issue. I'm concerned that as the app grows, the json parse time will increase adding seconds to the load-time in development.\r\n\r\n<!-- generated by vue-issues.

This would be a great addition to vue-router, router link elements.\r\n\r\nThe following points are cited from the vue-router documents: \r\n>It works the same way in both HTML5 history mode and hash mode, so if you ever decide to switch mode, or when the router falls back to hash mode in IE9, nothing needs to be changed.\r\n\r\n>In HTML5 history mode, router-link will intercept the click event so that the browser doesn't try to reload the page.\r\n\r\n>When you are using the base option in HTML5 history mode, you don't need to include it in to prop's URLs.\r\n\r\nHowever, there are cases where the user may wish to open a router-link in a new window, in order to maximize productivity. For example, our team is currently rebuilding an internal campaign management system. There are several sections to this, which can be viewed simultaneously by our end users. The users prefer the option to open multiple tabs, in order to see sets of data side-by-side. \r\n\r\nAt present, there is no context menu associated with view router links--right-clicks open the standard browser context menu. This prevents offering the user the *option* to navigate to a link in a new tab. \r\n\r\n# Proposal\r\n\r\nAdd an optional context menu feature to router-link elements. The feature would include the following: \r\n- mimic browser's native right-click context menu for anchor tags\r\n- open a router-link using the `target=_blank` method, when option selected by user from context menu\r\n- open router-links in same tab by default\r\n- optional: only include the context menu if a property is set to true within the code (TBD) \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n### What does the proposed API look like?\r\n`<router-link to=\"/my-route\" has-context-menu=\"true\"></router-link>`\r\n\r\n<!-- generated by vue-issues.

I don't think this line of reasoning holds in the Vue/Vuex world. In almost all other aspects of Vue/Vuex, the API looks straight forward (e.g. just getting and setting properties), but under the hood a lot of additional logic runs (dependency tracking, etc.). So there is really no need to make committing mutations more cumbersome than they need to be.\r\n\r\nIn addition to making the code harder to read, this leads to additional rules about argument passing.\r\n\r\nMoreover, it is very hard to spot typos in the mutation name early on, as the mutation name is just a string - let alone checking that the call to `commit()` received the correct arguments according to the mutation function. These types of errors should be easy to spot at compile time, but with the current syntax, these are all pushed into runtime.\r\n\r\nFinally, this cumbersome syntax might be (correctly) perceived as boilerplate, especially to beginners. Hence, replacing the commit syntax with a more straight forward syntax might improve the adoption of Vuex.\r\n\r\n### What does the proposed API look like?\r\nInstead of:\r\n\r\n    this.$store.commit('someMutation', args...)\r\n\r\none should be allowed to write:\r\n\r\n    this.$store.someMutation(args...)\r\n\r\nMoreover, it would be great if looking at `this.$store` in the developer console all available mutation methods are shown. That is, the methods should be real properties of this.$store, collected once at program start.\r\n\r\nUnder the hood, of course, these methods might all call some central commit() function.\r\n\r\nAlternative syntax: The above syntax might introduce some name collisions. For example, someone might name one of their mutations \"state\", for whatever reason, making \"this.$store.state\" ambiguous. For the sake of simplicity, these names should just be forbidden as mutation names. But if this is not an option for whatever reason, an intermediate object might do the trick as well. This would be less beautiful, but still better than what we have today:\r\n\r\n    this.$store.commit.someMutation(args...)\r\n\r\nor shorter:\r\n\r\n    this.$store.c.someMutation(args...)\r\n\r\nAs an additional proposal, the old `this.$store.commit()` syntax should be marked deprecated.  And removed in future Vuex versions. This generic call is not needed. Any generic commit call might as well be formulated as `this.$store[mutationName](args...)`, which is still easy to understand and even shorter than `this.$store.commit(mutationName, args...)`.\r\n\r\n<!-- generated by vue-issues.
