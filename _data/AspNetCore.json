I am using BenchmarkDotNet to do so. BenchmarkDotNet builds a dll per benchmark which then runs via dotnet like so:\r\ndotnet 55330d8b-483a-457c-a103-e28f178488e4.dll\r\n\r\nThis then runs the web application, and because the benchmarking project is separate from the web application project, the current working directory now differs from the web application project directory.\r\n\r\nThe working directory path is:\r\nc:\\dev\\techtransform\\ev.web.ui.pharma\\benchmark\\bin\\Release\\netcoreapp2.0\r\n\r\nI really want it to be:\r\nc:\\dev\\techtransform\\ev.web.ui.pharma\\bin\\Release\\netcoreapp2.0\r\n\r\nWhen `IWebHostBuilder.UseContentRoot(Directory.GetCurrentDirectory())` is invoked during a call to `WebHost.CreateDefaultBuilder()` the path to the content root and the web root are set to the directory of the benchmark dll.

I admit that I could probably raise this as an issue with BenchmarkDotNet but I'd like to raise the issue here first in case there is an obvious solution I've overlooked, or plans that I'm not privvy to as of yet.\r\n\r\nIs the an alternative, recommended method, to work around this problem?"}],"ResultType":"GitHubEvent"},"SignalR":{"Events":[{"Id":"7294938156","Type":"PullRequestEvent","CreatedAt":"2018-02-26T03:30:55","Actor":"mikaelm12","Repository":"aspnet/SignalR","Organization":"aspnet","RawContent":null,"RelatedAction":"opened","RelatedUrl":"https://github.com/aspnet/SignalR/pull/1492","RelatedDescription":"Opened pull request \"Restrict HubProtocol on Server\" (#1492) at aspnet/SignalR","RelatedBody":"Adding the ability to restrict the HubProtocol on the server\r\nIssue: https://github.com/aspnet/SignalR/issues/854"},{"Id":"7294024706","Type":"PullRequestEvent","CreatedAt":"2018-02-25T19:49:13","Actor":"mikaelm12","Repository":"aspnet/SignalR","Organization":"aspnet","RawContent":null,"RelatedAction":"opened","RelatedUrl":"https://github.com/aspnet/SignalR/pull/1491","RelatedDescription":"Opened pull request \"Don't log message data\" (#1491) at aspnet/SignalR","RelatedBody":"Issue: https://github.com/aspnet/SignalR/issues/1449\r\nWe don't want to log message content on the client.

The below issues affect Visual Studio 2015 Update 1 with ASP.NET 5 Release Candidate 1.\n#### tl;dr\n- Please fix nesting rules for `.less`, `.scss` and `.sass`, so those files are nested under `.html`.\n- Please fix incorrect nesting that sometimes appear after renaming/moving/copying files and folders.\n- Please provide an option to disable all file nesting, and eventually, options to configure nesting rules.\n- Please fix other critical Solution Explorer issues - this is just one of them, and there are many more.\n#### File nesting is inconsistent when nesting files under `.html`.\n\nThe `.less` and `.scss` files should be nested under `.html`. Those files compile to `.css` just like `.ts` compile to `.js` and they are just as much part of the view component. \n![less-not-nested-under-html](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/6388663/11942660/6452782c-a838-11e5-9a44-d7ab6a2e5fc9.png)\n![scss-not-nested-under-html](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/6388663/11942664/66bbd3a6-a838-11e5-8e3c-f1c369d5e1de.png)\nIn fact, if we only have a `.css` file in there, then it _is_ nested as expected, so clearly `.less` and `.scss` should also be nested:\n![css-is-nested-as-expected](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/6388663/11942670/6be4bdd4-a838-11e5-99b1-1dcc43238459.png)\n\nWhile the above is clearly a bug, and a very annoying one at that, the rules for other file types are less obvious, but should maybe also be considered... maybe `.json` should also be nested under `.html`?\nIt probably contains either settings, string resources, or data for that view component, so it seems resonable to me, although I consider this far less important than getting the style sheet nesting fixed.\n![json-not-nested-under-html](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/6388663/11939884/4a1bb224-a825-11e5-9ff6-631b4e8fed39.png)\n\nThose nesting rules have been inconsistent ever since they were introduced in ASP.NET 5, and **it really needs to be fixed**. Sure, everything compiles just fine, but I'm getting really pissed off looking at this mess in my Solution Explorer every day. Inconsistencies like this makes the whole concept of nesting seem like an annoyance more than a help, as it raises the obvious question \"if only some files are nested, then why nest anything at all - that's just an extra click to get to the .ts file\". Which brings me to...\n#### File nesting can be annoying\n\nWhile the fundamental idea of file nesting is not nessesarily bad, it can be _very_ annoying at times, which is why, as a _minimum_, **I want an option to disable all file nesting** - and ideally, options to configure the nesting rules.\n\nConsider this folder structure, where the folder already represents a container for the component:\n![file-nesting-is-annoying](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/6388663/11940913/ff28392a-a82b-11e5-86b4-571bc70d21bb.png)\nHere the file nesting provides no benefit at all, and actually just introduces a _really_ annoying extra click to get to the `.ts` file. A possible fix for this might be to only nest files if the folder name is different from the name of the `.html` file, but this might also be wrong - for example, a folder named `tabs` representing some fancy `tabs` component might actually contain multiple elements that work together, e.g. `tabs.html/js`, `tab-pane.html/js` and `tab-button.html/js`, and in this case we _do_ want nesting for all three of those. Therefore, I strongly believe an option to simply disable all nesting is the best option here - and it is very much needed, because despite this example, we do have projects in which the nesting provides absolutely no value and represents a major annoyance.\n\nOne could also argue that the `.html` file should actually be nested under the `.js` file.\nConsider an Angular 2 application, where the `.ts` file represents the actual Component, annotated with metadata specifying either the path to the `.html` file representing its view, or if the view is small, a string representing the markup of the view. Same for styles, where the metadata in the `.ts` file specifies either the path to the `.css` file, or a string representing the style rules. Here, both the view and the style sheet is clearly dependencies of the `.ts` file, so it would make sense to nest them below that...\n##### An alternative idea\n\nAlternatively, you could consider a completely different approach to nesting, where the part of the file name the files have in common, is used to show a \"virtual folder\" containing all the files - then file nesting could be used only for things like transpiler generated files. The image below is a concept I mocked up to illustrate this idea:\n![virtual-folder-concept](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/6388663/11942319/042b84ea-a836-11e5-80f1-b5941cfbdfa7.png)\nHere, all the files have the \"foo\" part of their name in common, and is therefore nested under a \"foo\" node in Solution Explorer. However, in the file system, the actual files are all located in the components folder, so in the code the path would be `app/components/foo.js` - nice an clean, works for any file type, and makes no assumptions about whether `.html` or `.js` is more important.\n\nGoing further with this idea, the IDE could also be smart, so when selecting this \"virtual folder\", it could maybe somehow open all the `foo.*` files in a split view (ignoring transpilation output of course), thus providing a quick way to see all the component code at once. Just a thought...\n### File nesting is broken\n\nNot only is file nesting inconsistent, and sometimes annoying, but it is also broken.\nHere are two cases of incorrect behavior I managed to reproduce - unfortunately, this does not seem to fail consistently, so it can be hard to reproduce - but it does happen often enough to be annoying.\n![file-nested-on-drag-copy](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/6388663/11943207/4749c9e8-a83c-11e5-9f15-304cb16e8419.png)\n![nesting-broken-when-folder-is-renamed](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/6388663/11943211/4c807074-a83c-11e5-8e71-4bed0bd4353c.png)\n\nPlease take those Solution Explorer issues seriously - I've provided feedback about multiple critical issues several several months ago, and thus far _nothing_ has improved. Solution Explorer still hangs or crashes the whole IDE when a large number of files is modified/moved/copied/renamed, it still has annoying, inconsistent and buggy file nesting, and it still constantly gets out of sync with the file system, crashing first the project system and eventually the whole IDE. I'm more that a little concerned about seeing a release candidate label on something this buggy and unpolished - if this is indeed what you intend to release, then we intend to find another IDE for our frontend development.\n"},{"Id":"7187586381","Type":"IssuesEvent","CreatedAt":"2018-02-02T06:15:37","Actor":"simonpbond","Repository":"aspnet/Tooling","Organization":"aspnet","RawContent":null,"RelatedAction":"closed","RelatedUrl":"https://github.com/aspnet/Tooling/issues/292","RelatedDescription":"Closed issue \"Publish ASP.NET 5 Web Application to remote IIS \" (#292) at aspnet/Tooling","RelatedBody":"In Visual Studio 2015, I can successfully preview / publish to a remote IIS server with a 4.6 Web application.

The ASP.NET team's development resources are finite, and we think we can deliver more valuable features to ASP.NET developers by focusing elsewhere.\r\n\r\nSo:\r\n\r\n* The `Microsoft.DotNet.Web.Spa.ProjectTemplates` package, containing **Angular**, **React**, and **React+Redux** templates, is **not affected**. This ships in the .NET Core SDK and is officially supported. We continue to invest development effort in this package. We can put *more* time and effort into these SPA templates now the effort isn't so spread out.\r\n* If you have an existing Aurelia/Knockout/Vue project based on our SPA templates, you're not directly affected because these templates are only used to create new projects. You can continue building and shipping your app forever. Obviously we still support and enhance the underlying ASP.NET Core APIs (such as those in JavaScriptServices) that you are using.\r\n* The `Microsoft.AspNetCore.SpaTemplates` package, containing Aurelia, Knockout, and Vue templates, continues to be available, but we'll no longer update it or work on issues related to it.\r\n* We encourage enthusiastic community members to [ship your own `dotnet new` templates](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/core/tools/custom-templates). The `dotnet new` system is extensible for this exact reason. If you want to own the go-to Aurelia/Knockout/Vue project template, now's your chance! You could [fork the ones from `Microsoft.AspNetCore.SpaTemplates`](https://github.com/aspnet/templating/tree/dev/src/Microsoft.AspNetCore.SpaTemplates), or start from scratch depending on what you prefer.\r\n* In the long term, if another JavaScript SPA framework becomes dominant, we will of course consider adding a template for it to the SDK templates package.\r\n\r\nI know this will be irritating to some people, especially those who have worked on PRs for the Aurelia/Knockout/Vue templates. I'm sorry about that! I hope you can understand that our goal is to offer the overall maximum benefit for ASP.NET developers based on the resources available."}],"ResultType":"GitHubEvent"},"Twitter":{"ResultType":"TwitterTimeline","Tweets":[{"Id":"966009382377897985","CreatedAt":"2018-02-20T17:59:19+00:00","UserScreenname":"aspnet","Text":"Starting now! \n\nJoin the #ASPNET Community Standup at https://t.co/4Ioo9jNSN2","Source":"<a href=\"https://about.twitter.com/products/tweetdeck\" rel=\"nofollow\">TweetDeck</a>","RetweetCount":11,"FavoriteCount":8,"RawContent":null},{"Id":"965988674474188800","CreatedAt":"2018-02-20T16:37:01+00:00","UserScreenname":"aspnet","Text":"Catch the #ASPNET Community Standup today at 10 AM Pacific / 18:00 GMT with Javier C Nelson showing a preview of Ra… https://t.co/Fg8NoQJtJp","Source":"<a href=\"https://about.twitter.com/products/tweetdeck\" rel=\"nofollow\">TweetDeck</a>","RetweetCount":14,"FavoriteCount":4,"RawContent":null},{"Id":"965964952442933249","CreatedAt":"2018-02-20T15:02:46+00:00","UserScreenname":"aspnet","Text":"Jeff is working with cognitive services and Bots today on stream... check it out! https://t.co/HVyIw0Wcgd","Source":"<a href=\"https://about.twitter.com/products/tweetdeck\" rel=\"nofollow\">TweetDeck</a>","RetweetCount":7,"FavoriteCount":8,"RawContent":null},{"Id":"963791622822612994","CreatedAt":"2018-02-14T15:06:43+00:00","UserScreenname":"aspnet","Text":"Join our @csharpfritz this FRIDAY at 10am / 15:00 UTC for a free online workshop to get started with ASPNet Core.… https://t.co/qtufFsbfmc","Source":"<a href=\"https://about.twitter.com/products/tweetdeck\" rel=\"nofollow\">TweetDeck</a>","RetweetCount":24,"FavoriteCount":16,"RawContent":null},{"Id":"963559608869568512","CreatedAt":"2018-02-13T23:44:47+00:00","UserScreenname":"aspnet","Text":"The #ASPNET Community Standup is starting now!
