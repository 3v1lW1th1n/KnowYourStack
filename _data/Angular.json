Everything compiles like it should, all files are visible inside `dist` folder and they even work correctly when imported via lib. name.\r\n```ts\r\nimport { ExampleModule, SecondaryModule } from \"example-lib-name\";\r\n```\r\nBut when i trying to import it directly from a folder (just to keep my imports more precised) \r\n```ts\r\nimport { ExampleModule} from \"example-lib-name\";\r\nimport { SecondaryModule } from \"example-lib-name/subfolder\";\r\n```\r\ni getting error about missing module despite file being where it should. ( detailed message bellow )\r\nVisual Studio doesn't complain about missing files, in fact you can without any problem navigate into it by clicking on import path.\r\n\r\nI got the same error when importing that created package via npm.

The `@ngtools/webpack` package can not be resolved. This happens due to a yarn monorepo structure, in which `@ngtools/webpack` will not be placed in the root `./node_modules` folder due conflicts with other dependencies, so it gets placed under `./node_modules/@angular-devkit/build-angular/node_modules`. And then it can not be found during build.\r\n\r\nI tracked down the issue and found the source. You can see the problem also in issue #10220. It was fixed by @hansl in the old single repo: https://github.com/angular/devkit/pull/647 but didn't get copied to the new monorepo? --> https://github.com/angular/angular-cli/blob/master/packages/angular_devkit/build_angular/src/angular-cli-files/models/webpack-configs/typescript.ts#L23\r\n\r\n**Can we do this change once again?**\r\n\r\nIf I change those lines locally the build is successful, but I do not know if we can simply change this without other problems?\r\n\r\nNote: If you have a monorepo with only one angular application this problem should not happen, but in my case the monorepo has also some angularjs applications and multiple webpack configurations. So multiple webpack, loader and angular dependency versions are around, not all aligned.\r\n\r\n\r\n## 🔬 Minimal Reproduction\r\n\r\nReproduction repo: https://github.com/fabianbru/angular-cli-bug-reproduction\r\nThis repo is a striped down repo, so there are many dependencies without real code.\r\n\r\nStep-by-Step guide:\r\n- Node 10 (Node version should not matter)\r\n- yarn 1.13.0\r\n- Checkout\r\n- run `yarn` in the root to install all dependencies\r\n- run `yarn dev` in the root\r\n--> ERROR will occur\r\n- change lines 7-9 locally in `node_modules/@angular-devkit/build-angular/src/angular-cli-files/models/webpack-configs/typescript.js` to:\r\n```\r\nconst webpackLoader = require.resolve('@ngtools/webpack')\r\n```\r\n---> build should be successful\r\n\r\n## 🔥 Exception or Error\r\n<pre><code>\r\n<!-- If the issue is accompanied by an exception or an error, please share it below: -->\r\nERROR in multi <workspace-path>/angular-cli-bug-reproduction/node_modules/webpack-dev-server/client?http://0.0.0.0:0 webpack/hot/dev-server ./src/main.ts\r\nModule not found: Error: Can't resolve '@ngtools/webpack' in '<workspace-path>/angular-cli-bug-reproduction/packages/angular'\r\nERROR in multi ./src/polyfills.ts\r\nModule not found: Error: Can't resolve '@ngtools/webpack' in '<workspace-path>/angular-cli-bug-reproduction/packages/angular'\r\n\r\n<workspace-path> is the path to my workspace, like `/Users/xyz/workspace`\r\n</code></pre>\r\n\r\n\r\n## 🌍 Your Environment\r\n<pre><code>\r\n<!-- run `ng version` and paste output below -->\r\nAngular CLI: 7.2.3\r\nNode: 10.15.0\r\nOS: darwin x64\r\nAngular: 7.2.2\r\n... animations, cdk, common, compiler, compiler-cli, core, forms\r\n... http, language-service, material, platform-browser\r\n... platform-browser-dynamic, platform-server, router\r\n\r\nPackage                           Version\r\n-----------------------------------------------------------\r\n@angular-devkit/architect         0.12.3\r\n@angular-devkit/build-angular     0.12.3\r\n@angular-devkit/build-optimizer   0.12.3\r\n@angular-devkit/core              7.2.3\r\n@angular-devkit/schematics        7.2.3\r\n@angular/cli                      7.2.3\r\n@angular/flex-layout              7.0.0-beta.23\r\n@schematics/angular               7.2.3\r\n@schematics/update                0.12.3\r\nrxjs                              6.3.3\r\ntypescript                        3.2.4\r\nwebpack                           4.29.0\r\n</code></pre>\r\n\r\n**Anything else relevant?**","Url":"https://github.com/angular/angular-cli/issues/13539","RelatedDescription":"Open issue \"Can't resolve '@ngtools/webpack' in yarn monorepo\" (#13539)"},{"Id":"403854098","IsPullRequest":false,"CreatedAt":"2019-01-28T16:17:25","Actor":"jsdiaz19","Number":"13535","RawContent":null,"Title":"how resolve unchanged chunks angular cli","State":"closed","Body":"when i run command 'npm start', its dont excetue the lastest changes and the console show this:\r\n\r\n7 unchanged chunks\r\nchunk {main} main.js, main.js.map (main) 73.7 kB [initial] [rendered]\r\ni ｢wdm｣: Compiled successfully.\r\n\r\n¿what mean unchanged chunks?\r\nwith this error, i cant work\r\n\r\n","Url":"https://github.com/angular/angular-cli/issues/13535","RelatedDescription":"Closed issue \"how resolve unchanged chunks angular cli\" (#13535)"},{"Id":"403851631","IsPullRequest":false,"CreatedAt":"2019-01-28T16:16:33","Actor":"jsdiaz19","Number":"13534","RawContent":null,"Title":"how resolve unchanged chunks in angular cli","State":"closed","Body":"<!--🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅\r\n\r\nOh hi there! 😄\r\n\r\nTo expedite issue processing please search open and closed issues before submitting a new one.\r\nExisting issues often contain information about workarounds, resolution, or progress updates.\r\n\r\n🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅-->\r\n\r\n\r\n# 🐞 Bug report\r\n\r\n### Command (mark with an `x`)\r\n<!-- Can you pin-point the command or commands that are effected by this bug? -->\r\n<!-- ✍️edit: -->\r\n```\r\n- [ ] new\r\n- [ ] build\r\n- [ ] serve\r\n- [ ] test\r\n- [ ] e2e\r\n- [ ] generate\r\n- [ ] add\r\n- [ ] update\r\n- [ ] lint\r\n- [ ] xi18n\r\n- [ ] run\r\n- [ ] config\r\n- [ ] help\r\n- [ ] version\r\n- [ ] doc\r\n```\r\n\r\n### Is this a regression?\r\n\r\n<!-- Did this behavior use to work in the previous version? -->\r\n<!-- ✍️--> Yes, the previous version in which this bug was not present was: ....\r\n\r\n\r\n### Description\r\n\r\n<!-- ✍️--> A clear and concise description of the problem...\r\n\r\n\r\n## 🔬 Minimal Reproduction\r\n<!--\r\nSimple steps to reproduce this bug.\r\n\r\nPlease include: commands run (including args), packages added, related code changes.\r\n\r\nIf reproduction steps are not enough for reproduction of your issue, please create a minimal GitHub repository with the reproduction of the issue.
