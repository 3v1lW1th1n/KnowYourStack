However, now that the error is happening on the Build Server it is essential that I get a remedy. There are a lot of discussions on the forums about this, including mine. None of the recommended solutions have worked for me.</p><p>What happens is that when I run a clean-and-build or a rebuild the error happens. However, a subsequent build will work. That’s how I worked around it all that time; I just pressed Ctrl-Shift-B over and over until all the offending errors went away. I can’t do that repetitive build scheme on the build server, so this needs to be addressed.</p><p>It only happens with projects that contain xaml files, but not all projects that contain xaml files are affected. It may be due to the first pass of the markup compiler locking the DLL such that the second pass can’t unlock it. There seems to be a correspondence between projects that produce a [[name]_[random]_wpftmp.[proj]](https://developercommunity.visualstudio.com/content/problem/210156/msbuild-is-adding-a-random-hash-and-wpftmp-to-my-a.html) file.
