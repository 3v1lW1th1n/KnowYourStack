Create a new component, which expects a single property (in the example, `color`)\r\n2. Create a `data` property, based on the bound property (`data-color`)\r\n3. Create a `computed` property, based on the bound property (`computed-color`)\r\n4. Note that the `data-color` and `computed-color` values are correct when the component is first loaded\r\n5. Update the bound property value\r\n6. Note that the `computed-color` value updates as expected, but **the `data-color` value does not update**\r\n\r\n### What is expected?\r\nThe `data-color` value should change when the bound property upon which it is based changes, [as described in the documentation](https://vuejs.org/v2/guide/components-props.html):\r\n\r\n> ...every time the parent component is updated, all props in the child component will be refreshed with the latest value.\r\n\r\n### What is actually happening?\r\nThe `data-color` value does not change.\r\n\r\n<!-- generated by vue-issues.

Presently, I think this can be achieved by Manual Asset Injection (https://ssr.vuejs.org/guide/build-config.html#client-config) but if the only thing a user wants to control is which bundle gets injected in a multi-compiler Webpack setup, then this creates A LOT of extra work for them as they try to duplicate all the things that vue-server-renderer would do for them by default.\r\n\r\nMy specific use case is that I'm generating a JS bundle for each language that we want our application to support using i18n-webpack-plugin. When using vue-server-renderer, the last language bundle generated is automatically injected. This feature would allow me to instead add logic to `createContext` that looks at a request's locale header, generates a filter function based on that header, and uses that filter function to assure that a matching (or a default) bundle is injected in the returned page.\r\n\r\n### What does the proposed API look like?\r\nAdding this variable to the `renderScripts` method:\r\n```js\r\nconst jsFilter = context.jsFilter || (({ file }) => isJS(file))\r\n```\r\nAnd passing `jsFilter` to the filter calls in that method instead of the default, `({ file }) => isJS(file)`.\r\n\r\n<!-- generated by vue-issues.

But right now it can (accidentally) be circumvented with closures, by adding a function to the state.\r\n\r\n```javascript\r\n// Create a closure\r\nconst myFunctionFactory = () => {\r\n\tconst myValues = {\r\n\t\tfoo: 0,\r\n\t};\r\n\r\n\treturn () => {\r\n\t\tmyValues.foo  = 1;\r\n\t\treturn myValues.foo;\r\n\t};\r\n};\r\n\r\n// Get the function inside the closure\r\nconst myFunction = myFunctionFactory();\r\n\r\n// Add the function to the state\r\nVue.set( state, 'myFunction', myFunction );\r\n\r\n// New each time the function is called, a different result is returned\r\nstate.myFunction(); // => 1;\r\nstate.myFunction(); // => 2;\r\nstate.myFunction(); // => 3;\r\nstate.myFunction(); // => 4;\r\n```\r\n\r\nThis can introduce really subtle bugs and also makes time travel unusable.

Having a way to check if the namespace path is already occupied would allow the code to either, register to a different namespace (ick!), unregister and re-register the existing namespace or avoid registration of the namespace altogether. \r\n\r\nThis condition can be easily reproduced by dynamically registering a namespaced module and issuing a hotreload or attempting to register that module more than once to the same path. \r\n\r\nEnd users would not see errors on hot-load or, if for some reason, the code attempts multiple registrations in the same session.\r\n\r\nThe only workaround at this point is to check the private member _modulesNamespaceMap.
