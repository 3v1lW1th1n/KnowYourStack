By modifying the URL value to a malicious site, an attacker may successfully launch a phishing scam and steal user credentials. Because the server name in the modified link is identical to the original site, phishing attempts have a more trustworthy appearance.\r\n\r\nRemediation\r\nThe easiest and most effective way to prevent vulnerable open redirects would be to not let the user control where your page redirects him to. If you have to redirect the user based on URLs, you should always use an ID which is internally resolved to the respective URL.\r\n\r\nTo the extent possible, use relative URLs as absolute URLs are more vulnerable. \r\nWith relative URLs, it can be ensured that the request cannot go to external sites, which is not the case with absolute URLs. \r\nThe following instances of the vulnerability have been reported in platform code, and need to be mitigated.\r\n\r\nDeveloper(s) looking into mitigating the reported vulnerability have the following options. \r\na) Modify the code to mitigate the vulnerability if it is ascertained that a vulnerability exists.\r\nb) Modify the code to add defensive code if there is a possibility of vulnerability. \r\nc) Provide feedback to say that there is no vulnerability with the following options.\r\n\r\nPotential False Positive\r\nMitigated by Design\r\nMitigated by OS environment\r\nMitigated by Network environment\r\n\r\nCWE-601 has been reported against the code listed below.\r\n\r\n14061 nodemodule_@angular.jsa browser.js: 101 1 Path\r\n14116 nodemodule_@angular.jsa browser.js: 1125 1 Path\r\n14057 nodemodule_@angular.jsa browser.js: 2516 1 Path\r\n14115 nodemodule_@angular.jsa browser.js: 2569 1 Path\r\n14082 nodemodule_@angular.jsa browser.js: 2579 1 Path\r\n14071 nodemodule_@angular.jsa browser.js: 2609 1 Path\r\n14101 nodemodule_@angular.jsa browser.js: 2620 1 Path\r\n14065 nodemodule_@angular.jsa browser.js: 2655 1 Path\r\n14122 nodemodule_@angular.jsa browser.js: 3469 1 Path\r\n14109 nodemodule_@angular.jsa browser.js: 3479 1 Path\r\n14098 nodemodule_@angular.jsa browser.js: 3480 1 Path\r\n14058 nodemodule_@angular.jsa compiler.js: 628 1 Path\r\n14099 nodemodule_@angular.jsa compiler.js: 656 1 Path\r\n14107 nodemodule_@angular.jsa compiler.js: 7379 1 Path\r\n14120 nodemodule_@angular.jsa compiler.js: 7382 1 Path\r\n14083 nodemodule_@angular.jsa compiler.js: 8928 1 Path\r\n14124 nodemodule_@angular.jsa compiler.js: 16168 1 Path\r\n14114 nodemodule_@angular.jsa compiler.js: 16252 1 Path\r\n14112 nodemodule_@angular.jsa compiler.js: 18294 1 Path\r\n14104 nodemodule_@angular.jsa compiler.js: 18521 1 Path\r\n14118 nodemodule_@angular.jsa compiler.js: 18886 1 Path\r\n14096 nodemodule_@angular.jsa compiler.js: 19389 1 Path\r\n14076 nodemodule_@angular.jsa compiler.js: 19393 1 Path\r\n14128 nodemodule_@angular.jsa compiler.js: 19495 1 Path\r\n14079 nodemodule_@angular.jsa compiler.js: 19551 1 Path\r\n14077 nodemodule_@angular.jsa compiler.js: 19555 1 Path\r\n14092 nodemodule_@angular.jsa compiler.js: 19559 1 Path\r\n14095 nodemodule_@angular.jsa compiler.js: 21294 1 Path\r\n14062 nodemodule_@angular.jsa compiler.js: 22691 1 Path\r\n14123 nodemodule_@angular.jsa compiler.js: 22699 1 Path\r\n14121 nodemodule_@angular.jsa compiler.js: 23098 1 Path\r\n14084 nodemodule_@angular.jsa compiler.js: 23306 1 Path\r\n14102 nodemodule_@angular.jsa compiler.js: 23311 1 Path\r\n14100 nodemodule_@angular.jsa compiler.js: 23565 1 Path\r\n14113 nodemodule_@angular.jsa compiler.js: 23645 1 Path\r\n14089 nodemodule_@angular.jsa compiler.js: 23654 1 Path\r\n14067 nodemodule_@angular.jsa compiler.js: 25101 1 Path\r\n14106 nodemodule_@angular.jsa compiler.js: 25407 1 Path\r\n14059 nodemodule_@angular.jsa compiler.js: 25410 1 Path\r\n14097 nodemodule_@angular.jsa compiler.js: 25431 1 Path\r\n14105 nodemodule_@angular.jsa compiler.js: 25436 1 Path\r\n14087 nodemodule_@angular.jsa compiler.js: 25534 1 Path\r\n14075 nodemodule_@angular.jsa core.js: 16224 1 Path\r\n14111 nodemodule_@angular.jsa core.js: 16627 1 Path\r\n14070 nodemodule_@angular.jsa http.js: 204 1 Path\r\n14074 nodemodule_@angular.jsa http.js: 215 1 Path\r\n14119 nodemodule_@angular.jsa http.js: 378 1 Path\r\n14093 nodemodule_@angular.jsa http.js: 401 1 Path\r\n14110 nodemodule_@angular.jsa http.js: 407 1 Path\r\n14073 nodemodule_@angular.jsa router.js: 2700 1 Path\r\n14117 nodemodule_@angular.jsa router.js: 2865 1 Path\r\n14125 nodemodule_@angular.jsa router.js: 4935 1 Path","Url":"https://github.com/angular/angular/issues/32162","RelatedDescription":"Open issue \"[SECURITY] URL Redirection to Untrusted Site ('Open Redirect') CWE ID 601\" (#32162)"},{"Id":"481446599","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2019-08-16T05:23:17","Actor":"crisbeto","Number":"32160","RawContent":null,"Title":"fix(ivy): ngTemplateOutlet error when switching between null and template value","State":"open","Body":"Fixes an error that is thrown by `ngTemplateOutlet` under Ivy when switching from a template to null and back to a template.

There in, I use the replace feature to replace different manifest and index files depending on the configuration I choose when I build/serve the project.\r\n\r\nI would like to add a version field to the manifest and index meta tags.

Service is prepended in the hungarian-like system I like, but it also has to be appended to comply with angular convention.\r\n3 - it doesn't seem possible to programmatically or humanly know whether a folder under app refers to a component, service, module...by looking at the folder name when generating a non-flat entity.\r\n\r\n### Describe the solution you'd like\r\n<!-- ✍️--> If you have a solution in mind, please describe it.\r\n1 - An option to have the files generated with flipped naming like component.x.ts and service.y.ts\r\n2 - A different option to allow type to be added to the folder name without redundancy. So normal mode is `x-component/x.component.ts` and flipped is `component-x/component.x.ts`\r\n\r\n\r\n### Describe alternatives you've considered\r\n<!-- ✍️--> Have you considered any alternative solutions or workarounds?\r\nI'm personally OK with the redundant naming but my team isn't. So a key workaround would be having a component called ComponentThingComponent or ServiceSomeService.\r\n\r\n\r\nref: https://github.com/angular/angular/issues/32158","Url":"https://github.com/angular/angular-cli/issues/15351","RelatedDescription":"Closed issue \"CLI File Naming Options\" (#15351)"},{"Id":"481411469","IsPullRequest":false,"CreatedAt":"2019-08-16T06:15:25","Actor":"rlalbario","Number":"15350","RawContent":null,"Title":"Stuck in Angular CLI when creating project","State":"closed","Body":"Hello Mam/Sir,\r\n\r\nI'm creating to create a project using Angular CLI, however, Its stuck on creating a project.

This is not happening when `--aot` is not passed. Also everything works fine on macOS and Linux.\r\n\r\n## 🔬 Minimal Reproduction\r\n<!--\r\nSimple steps to reproduce this bug.\r\n\r\nPlease include: commands run (including args), packages added, related code changes.\r\n\r\nIf reproduction steps are not enough for reproduction of your issue, please create a minimal GitHub repository with the reproduction of the issue. \r\nA good way to make a minimal reproduction is to create a new app via `ng new repro-app` and add the minimum possible code to show the problem. \r\nShare the link to the repo below along with step-by-step instructions to reproduce the problem, as well as expected and actual behavior.\r\n\r\nIssues that don't have enough info and can't be reproduced will be closed.\r\n\r\nYou can read more about issue submission guidelines here: https://github.com/angular/angular-cli/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md#-submitting-an-issue\r\n-->\r\nYou can find a sample project reproducing the issue here: https://github.com/rosen-vladimirov/angular-scss-windows-aot-issue\r\n\r\nThe project was created with `ng new --style scss`, without router. After that I've included the partial scss file and used it in `app.component`. \r\nRun `ng serve --aot` **on Windows** and apply a change in the partial scss file.
