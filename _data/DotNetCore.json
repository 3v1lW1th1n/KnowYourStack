[5 fields](https://github.com/OlegAxenow/FastGuid/blob/master/FastGuid/Uuid.cs) added for ```Equals``` and ```CompareTo``` methods. [16 (byte) fields](https://github.com/OlegAxenow/FastGuid/blob/master/FastGuid/Uuid.Formattable.cs) added for ```ToString``` and ```TryParseExact``` methods.\r\n2. ```Equals``` and ```CompareTo``` methods have become faster due to less comparisons (with less fields).\r\n3. ```ToString``` and ```TryParseExact``` methods have become faster due to using [static arrays](https://github.com/OlegAxenow/FastGuid/blob/master/FastGuid/StaticData.cs).\r\n\r\n\r\n## Benchmarks\r\n\r\n* \"Guid\" prefix used for original ```System.Guid``` methods, \"Uuid\" — for ```FastGuid.Uuid``` methods.\r\n* For ```CompareTo``` and ```Equals``` two benchmarks used for each struct to see the difference between comparing the same and different identifiers.\r\n* For ```CompareTo``` and ```Equals``` appropriate methods called thrice like ```_guid1.CompareTo(_guid2) ^ _guid2.CompareTo(_guid3) ^ _guid3.CompareTo(_guid1)```.\r\n* For ```ToString``` last letter means one of the [standard guid formats](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/api/system.guid.tostring?view=netcore-2.1) — D, B, N or X.\r\n\r\n### CompareTo\r\n\r\n|               Method |      Mean |
