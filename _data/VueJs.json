Basically, you need two components that are subsequently created and destroyed. The first component registers an event with the global event bus and de-registers it when destroyed. The second component, only has the de-registration in it's BeforeDestroy. When going from 1st component, to second component, then back to first component, the first component is created, the event is registered, the second component is destroyed and array of listeners for that event is set to null when the de-registration is done.\r\nI know this is bad coding. But could happen to anyone. This took us two days to figure out. I wanted to learn more about the issue, so wrote the codepen to illustrate the issue and to test various versions of Vue.\r\nThis issue does not occur in v2.5.2 or earlier. It started with v2.5.3 and is present in latest (v2.6.11).\r\n\r\n\r\n### What is expected?\r\nVue should keep track of $on/$off listeners and ignore $off if no corresponding $on - at least don't set the listeners array to null.\r\nWith the link to reproduce the bug, I have done the latest (2.6.11) and back to 2.5.3 - this is NOT a bug in 2.5.2 as the reproduction works in that version, so quite possibly something changed.\r\n\r\n### What is actually happening?\r\nThe listeners array for the event is set to null. Therefore, no other listeners can receive the event messages from the global event bus.\r\n\r\n---\r\nBefore a jr dev left our company, he was doing some clean up. In the mounted() he remove some code `this.$root.$on('alarms:new', this.myFunc)` but forgot to remove in the `BeforeDestroy` this `this.$root.$off('alarms:new', this.myFunc)`. Subsequently, we stopped getting this particular event with other components. \r\nWhat we found is that the innocuous code, when calling $root.$off does not have a matching $root.$on, so the event array for the listeners is set to null.\r\n\r\n<!-- generated by vue-issues.

Tested on an i7/24GB machine on Chrome, 40 times scrolling, ran separately not simultaneously.\r\n\r\n---\r\nA little context, I was refactoring the components in my project to use functional components, hoping that it would improve the performance. As it turns out, it is seemingly slower than before the refactor. I am not sure where the bottleneck is, which is why I created the sandbox with minimal repro.\r\n\r\nThe main components are the `SimpleSVG` component and the `Container` component. When the page loads, the query param toggles the component to either be rendered as functional or non-functional component. The component itself is simple, reading the props and rendering them using the render function. No lifecycle or other kinds of data involved. The `Items` component then would render a list of items using the two components. The `App` component renders everything, including the sidebar to print out the scroll value and simulate the scrolling then measure the average time.\r\n\r\nThere is [one similar issue on this](https://github.com/vuejs/vue/issues/5070#issuecomment-283778369) but in that issue, the components are being altered, while in my sandbox the rendered components do not change at all. It is still slower in functional components. It is also mentioned in that issue that by rendering a non-functional component inside a functional component, it would lose the perf benefit, but I did try with both and it seems like it has no effect in this case.\r\n\r\nGranted, the scroll event itself is expensive, it should have been debounced to improve the performance, removing the printed-out `scrollTop` value from the template would also improve the performance, but this still doesn't explain the root cause of the slowness. Also, it might be a given that rendering that many items would cause slowness at some point, but this is done only to show the differences between the two types of component. In my project, there are loads of side effects that would in turn contribute to the overall performance of the app. Getting the performance benefit right at the rendering level is IMO important since it affects the rest of the process.\r\n\r\nSome further questions:\r\n- Maybe I made a mistake in implementing the functional component, in which the result is in fact a false positive. Any pointers?\r\n- If there's no mistake, is this to be expected from functional component, or is this performance issue a bug?\r\n\r\nThank you for looking into this.\r\n\r\n<!-- generated by vue-issues.

Setup\r\n`install` could be an instance function on `VueRouter` so that one could register it like that:\r\n```js\r\nlet router = new VueRouter(/* routes, options */);  // <- actual, usable router\r\ncreateApp(MyApp)\r\n  .use(router)\r\n  .mount('#app');\r\n```\r\n\r\nWhat `install` does is:\r\n- Register global components `router-link` and `router-view`;\r\n- Provide value `Router` at the root of application.\r\n- :question: Do we want to provide a `Route` ref as well? It's available through the router object.\r\n\r\nI'll talk more about injecting value next.\r\nIf someone wants more control (e.g. use different name for components or not register them globally), those tasks can easily be made manually instead of using `.use(router)`.\r\n\r\n#### 2. Accessing the router\r\nThere is no global mixins `$router`, `$route` anymore.\r\n\r\nIf a component (userland, or internally in `router-view` and `router-link`) needs to access the router, e.g. to navigate, it injects the router in setup: `let router = inject('Router')`.\r\n\r\nThe route can be found on the router, or could be provided as `Route` (ref).\r\nNesting routers can be done be re-providing those keys.\r\n\r\n#### 3. Guards\r\nThis is what I'm having most trouble with. \r\nCurrently `vue-router` does some ugly hacks to get hold of component instances that are navigated to/from, in order to call `beforeRouteEnter`, `beforeRouteUpdate` and `beforeRouteLeave`.\r\n\r\nI'm hoping the new API could look something like:\r\n```js\r\nimport { beforeRouteLeave } from 'vue-router';\r\n\r\nexport default {\r\n  setup() {\r\n    beforeRouteLeave(() => ...);\r\n  }\r\n}\r\n```\r\nbut I'm not clear about how fine details would work. Such as: \r\n- where/how is the component defined in routing actually created? \r\n- is `setup` always called, even when using `keep-alive`?\r\n\r\nWith some feedback on the design and a few pointers for the last point, I can have a try at porting this component.\r\n\r\nBTW: 300Mo of dependencies to build a 20Ko lib is crazy :(\r\n\r\n<!-- generated by vue-issues.

When the dynamic module is installed with the `installModule` function and the `hot` option is enabled, the current implementation skips creating any state for the new module.  This introduces side effects, where the module is registered in the vuex store but the state can't be retrieved if there was no state previously present.\r\n\r\nThe [_vuex-persist_](https://github.com/championswimmer/vuex-persist) lib is in use, but it is used to hydrate any past state down to _vuex_.  The store, while using the _vuex-persist_ lib, has the data initialised in the following order.\r\n\r\n1. The store is created by _vuex_ and any known modules are initialised with their default values.\r\n2. If there are data in the local storage within the browser, it is loaded into the store state replacing the default state data.\r\n3. Dynamic modules are added as they are needed.\r\n\r\nUpon modifying the `installModule` function, to check if the state of the new dynamic module exists, the problem is resolved.  Essentially, if the state of the module doesn't currently exist in the `parentState` within the store, then the default module state is created and registered.\r\n\r\nOne set of changes that fix this case are as follows.\r\n\r\nIn [`src/store.js`](https://github.com/vuejs/vuex/blob/dev/src/store.js) the following code seems to be the offending code.\r\n\r\n```js\r\n// set state\r\nif (!isRoot && !hot) {\r\n  const parentState = getNestedState(rootState, path.slice(0, -1))\r\n  const moduleName = path[path.length - 1]\r\n  store._withCommit(() => {\r\n    if (process.env.NODE_ENV !== 'production') {\r\n      if (moduleName in parentState) {\r\n        console.warn(\r\n          `[vuex] state field \"${moduleName}\" was overridden by a module with the same name at \"${path.join('.')}\"`\r\n        )\r\n      }\r\n    }\r\n    Vue.set(parentState, moduleName, module.state)\r\n  })\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nWhen modified, the default state is created when the `moduleName` isn't found in the `parentState`.\r\n\r\n```js\r\n// set state\r\nvar parentState = getNestedState(rootState, path.slice(0, -1));\r\nvar moduleName = path[path.length - 1];\r\nvar moduleStateExists = moduleName in parentState\r\nif (!isRoot && (!hot || !moduleStateExists )) {\r\n store._withCommit(function () {\r\n   {\r\n     if (moduleStateExists) {\r\n       console.warn(\r\n         (\"[vuex] state field \\\"\"   moduleName   \"\\\" was overridden by a module with the same name at \\\"\"   (path.join('.'))   \"\\\"\")\r\n       );\r\n     }\r\n   }\r\n   Vue.set(parentState, moduleName, module.state);\r\n });\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nThere may be other ways to fix this issue, this is one potential solution that was discovered after some investigation.\r\n\r\n<!-- generated by vue-issues.
