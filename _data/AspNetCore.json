Perhaps it would be better to separate these projects completely since they don't really share any concerns, but I digress.  The solution we had was pretty much what's shown here: https://stackoverflow.com/questions/49378474/different-domain-in-the-same-app-asp-net-core-2-0\r\nWhen upgrading to 2.2 and setting the compat flag to 2.2, the subdomain constraints no longer work.  Disabling Endpoint Routing makes it work it again.\r\n\r\n### To Reproduce\r\nSteps to reproduce the behavior:\r\n1. Using ASP.NET Core 2.2 with Endpoint Routing Enabled\r\n2. Setup routes with different Subdomain constraints as in SO link above\r\n3. Observe that routes that are supposed to be restricted to a certain subdomain are actually available regardless of subdomain.\r\n\r\n### Expected behavior\r\nI understand Endpoint Routing is a big change, I'm just wondering if there is a way to do this with Endpoint Routing enabled, or if I should just separate these apps.","Url":"https://github.com/aspnet/AspNetCore/issues/4414","RelatedDescription":"Open issue \"Endpoint Routing does not allow for subdomain constraints\" (#4414)"},{"Id":"387532544","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2018-12-05T02:24:10","Actor":"hvanbakel","Number":"4408","RawContent":null,"Title":"Update OpenIdConnectOptions.cs","State":"closed","Body":"Fixes #4407 \r\n","Url":"https://github.com/aspnet/AspNetCore/pull/4408","RelatedDescription":"Closed or merged PR \"Update OpenIdConnectOptions.cs\" (#4408)"},{"Id":"387531514","IsPullRequest":false,"CreatedAt":"2018-12-05T02:24:10","Actor":"hvanbakel","Number":"4407","RawContent":null,"Title":"Documentation on OpenIdConnectOptions.RemoteSignOutPath is really misleading","State":"closed","Body":"### Describe the bug\r\nDocumentation on OpenIdConnectOptions is really misleading. \r\n\r\nThe [documentation](https://github.com/aspnet/AspNetCore/blob/master/src/Security/src/Microsoft.AspNetCore.Authentication.OpenIdConnect/OpenIdConnectOptions.cs#L236) says:\r\n`this path will cause the handler to invoke SignOut using the SignInScheme`\r\n\r\nHowever the implementation of the [handler](https://github.com/aspnet/AspNetCore/blob/master/src/Security/src/Microsoft.AspNetCore.Authentication.OpenIdConnect/OpenIdConnectHandler.cs#L148) says:\r\n`await Context.SignOutAsync(*Options.SignOutScheme*);`\r\n\r\n\r\n","Url":"https://github.com/aspnet/AspNetCore/issues/4407","RelatedDescription":"Closed issue \"Documentation on OpenIdConnectOptions.RemoteSignOutPath is really misleading\" (#4407)"},{"Id":"387563152","IsPullRequest":false,"CreatedAt":"2018-12-05T02:13:37","Actor":"shapeh","Number":"4413","RawContent":null,"Title":"Could not find inprocess request handler.

This is an invalid response and HTTP.Sys aborts the response with HTTP_1_1_REQUIRED. Web browsers like chrome explicitly show the error HTTP_1_1_REQUIRED when returning a 204. Other browser still have the issue, but they retry a HTTP/1.1 request afterwards. \r\n\r\nThis means that all HTTP responses which:\r\n- Set a status code of 204\r\n- Use HTTPS\r\n- Support HTTP/2\r\n\r\nwill explicitly fail in chrome and silently fail/retry in other browsers.\r\n\r\n### Customer Impact\r\n\r\nIf customers want to use the 204 response code, they will have to add a middleware to set ContentLength=0 on responses with status code 204. \r\n\r\nFor example:\r\n```c#\r\napp.Use(async (ctx, next) =>\r\n{\r\n  await next();\r\n  if (ctx.Response.StatusCode == 204)\r\n  {\r\n    ctx.Response.ContentLength = 0;\r\n  }\r\n});\r\n```\r\n\r\n### Regression?\r\n\r\nRegression from all of our server behavior (Kestrel, ANCM + Kestrel).\r\n\r\n### Risk:\r\nLow. The change only affects 204, 205, and 304 status code responses, which aren't allowed to have a body anyways.

My problem is that its not doing what we would expect it to do.   \r\n\r\nManagement expects when a user logs in and clicks remember me that they will then not be required to type their login and password again for a month.  Whether or not they will still have to type in the 2fa code is up for debate.\r\n\r\nWhat is actually happening is that i can close the browser reboot and come back for about an hour and 15 minutes and then i will be forced to type my password again.    This still happens even with a valid `.AspNetCore.Identity.Application` cookie set that is not due to expire for another month.\r\n\r\nAfter digging around in the code i found that Remember me is actually isPersistent and it is defined as.\r\n\r\n>Flag indicating whether the sign-in cookie should persist after the browser is closed.\r\n\r\nWhich brings you to:\r\n\r\nThere are two different types of Cookies:\r\n\r\n- session cookies, held in memory, and which expire once the browser exits\r\n- persistent cookies, which have a time-to-live, are persisted on disk, and are sent by the browser until their time-to-live has elapsed.\r\n\r\nAll this being said remember machine 2fa works as expected i am not prompted again for the 2fa and i have a cookie on my machine `Identity.TwoFactorRememberMe`.\r\n\r\nSo I guess my question is why are we not getting a `Identity.FactorRememberMe` or why isn't sign in respecting a long life time of the `AspNetCore.Identity.Application` cookie?\r\n\r\nHow is this supposed to work exactly?

I saw that there's already a couple of GitHub issues related to this, but I think the experience still needs some work. [This post on StackOverflow](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/50802781/where-are-the-login-and-register-pages-in-an-aspnet-core-scafolded-app) exemplifies exactly what I went through earlier today. I wanted to share some feedback.\r\n\r\nThe idea of packaging UI in a library, especially UI as involved as authentication, is intriguing. But it hasn't been done in an ASP.net template before (that I'm aware of), so when you create a starter project and you see register and login forms that appear nowhere in your project files, it's quite disorienting. Like the poster in the StackOverflow question, I searched for that string to find the source, but found nothing. Other pages like the landing page, About, etc. do exist, but the account pages are there as if by magic.\r\n\r\nThe source of the UI, the AddDefaultIdentity statement in Startup.cs, gives no hints that it comes with UI included. The previous method of including AddDefaultUI in your service configuration at least had UI in the name.\r\n\r\nMentioning the existence of Identity UI in the documentation or somewhere in the template would help. I'm not sure what the main entry point to Razor pages is as far as documentation goes, but I was using this article: [Introduction to Identity on ASP.NET Core](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/aspnet/core/security/authentication/identity). That might be a good place for a heads up about this new thing called Identity UI, which is the component that causing those authentication forms to appear. But you may be aware of a better place to put it.","Url":"https://github.com/aspnet/Identity/issues/2071","RelatedDescription":"Open issue \"Make the presence of Identity UI more explicit in the starter template or documentation\" (#2071)"},{"Id":"380931030","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2018-11-14T23:29:46","Actor":"pranavkm","Number":"2070","RawContent":null,"Title":"Use 3.0 configuration in RCLs","State":"closed","Body":"","Url":"https://github.com/aspnet/Identity/pull/2070","RelatedDescription":"Closed or merged PR \"Use 3.0 configuration in RCLs\" (#2070)"},{"Id":"380813149","IsPullRequest":false,"CreatedAt":"2018-11-14T17:43:50","Actor":"vankampenp","Number":"2068","RawContent":null,"Title":"Consider HasClaimAsync or GetClaimAsync","State":"open","Body":"It is easy to get a claim from a logged in user, but not from a user that is not (yet) logged in.\r\n\r\nWhen generating a JWT token for my API, I want to check if the user for which the credentials are provided has the right claim to allow access to the API. Without such a check the token is provided, but than using the token fails because the access policy checks the claim. \r\n\r\nWhen using Roles you can use IsInRoleAsync(). But there is no equivalent for claims.\r\n\r\nSo when getting the user:\r\n\r\n`  var user = await _userManager.FindByNameAsync(model.Email);\r\n          `\r\n\r\nI would like to do something like:\r\n```\r\nif (!await _userManager.HasClaimAsync(user, \"IsApiUser\", \"true\"))\r\n            {\r\n                               return BadRequest(\"Invalid user or password\");\r\n            }\r\n```\r\nI have now written my own extension method:\r\n\r\n ```\r\npublic static async Task<bool> HasClaimAsync(this UserManager<ApplicationUser> userManager,  ApplicationUser user, string claimType, string value)\r\n        {\r\n            var claims = await userManager.GetClaimsAsync(user);\r\n            var claim = claims.FirstOrDefault(c => c.Type == claimType);\r\n            return claim !=null &&  claim.Value == value;\r\n        }\r\n```\r\n\r\nI understand that HasClaim is based on cookies rather than database access, so much cheaper for logged in users:\r\n`var valid = User.HasClaim(c => c.Type == \"IsApiUser\" && c.Value == \"true\");\r\n`\r\nBut I think the HasClaimAsync or an more generic GetClaimAsync is missing for cases such as the above. \r\n","Url":"https://github.com/aspnet/Identity/issues/2068","RelatedDescription":"Open issue \"Consider HasClaimAsync or GetClaimAsync\" (#2068)"},{"Id":"380198930","IsPullRequest":false,"CreatedAt":"2018-11-14T17:33:59","Actor":"blankenbush","Number":"2065","RawContent":null,"Title":"Spelling error DeletePersonalData.cshtml.cs ","State":"closed","Body":"The word \"deleteing\" is wrong.

mentioned on this [page](https://github.com/aspnet/Tooling/blob/master/known-issues-vs2017.md#to-create-aspnet-core-10--11-projects-install-visual-studios-net-core-10---11-developer-tools-for-web-component) about .NET Core 1.0/1.1 tooling is installed when creating new ASP.NET Core 1.0/1.1 project should not happen or should not be supported in VS 2019.\r\n\r\nThese are my main concerns:\r\n\r\n1. VS 2019 is about to be released in around early 2019\r\n2. ASP.NET Core 1.0/1.1 is not going to be supported anymore, based on [this page](https://github.com/dotnet/core/blob/master/microsoft-support.md).\r\n3. Creating new ASP.NET Core 1.0/1.1 will always install the .NET Core 1.0/1.1 web tooling, and this is not necessary when previous reason has reached the unsupported period and it's quite near or might be the same time of VS 2019 release.\r\n4. Based on the problem mentioned above, VS 2017 has no \"built in\" tooling when creating new ASP.NET Core 1.0/1.1 project, but the external tooling may help. Therefore for those that still need to maintain ASP.NET Core 1.0/1.1 projects, we could use VS 2017 as long as the VS 2017 is still in support lifecycle or in mainstream support lifecycle.\r\n\r\nI

You can think of this as constituting the ASP.NET Core “platform.” It will be fully [source buildable by anybody via GitHub](https://github.com/dotnet/source-build) and will continue to bring all the existing benefits of .NET Core shared frameworks to your applications moving forward (smaller deployment size, centralized patching, faster startup time, etc.). \r\n\r\nAs part of this change, some notable breaking changes will be made in Microsoft.AspNetCore.App 3.0.\r\n\r\n## Removal of some sub-components\r\n\r\nAs part of this change, some notable sub-components will be removed from the ASP.NET Core shared framework in 3.0: \r\n\r\n* Json.NET (Newtonsoft.Json)\r\n* Entity Framework Core (Microsoft.EntityFrameworkCore.\\*) \r\n* Microsoft.CodeAnalysis (Roslyn)\r\n\r\nEntity Framework Core will ship as “pure” NuGet packages in 3.0. This makes its shipping model the same as all other data access libraries on .NET, and allows it the simplest path to continue innovation while providing support for all the various .NET platforms customers enjoy it on today. Note, Entity Framework Core moving out of the shared framework has no impact on its status as a Microsoft developed, supported, and serviceable library, and it will continue to be covered by the [.NET Core support policy.](https://www.microsoft.com/net/platform/support-policy)\r\n\r\n**Please note** that this does not mean Json.NET or Entity Framework Core will no longer work with ASP.NET Core. These features will continue exist, but they will not be\r\n\"in the box\" with the shared framework.\r\n\r\nPlease see [\"The future of JSON in .NET Core 3.0\"](https://github.com/dotnet/announcements/issues/90) for details on our plans to remove the dependency from ASP.NET Core to Json.NET and replace it with high-performance JSON APIs.\r\n\r\nWe have separately posted [a complete list of exact binaries][items-removed-from-fx] that are being removed. This list may fluctuate as we continue to work on ASP.NET Core 3.0.\r\n\r\n## Removal of the PackageReference to Microsoft.AspNetCore.App\r\n\r\nStarting in ASP.NET Core 3.0, references to Microsoft.AspNetCore.App will no longer be a `<PackageReference>` element in the project file. The .NET Core SDK will support a new item called\r\n`<FrameworkReference>` which will replace the use of PackageReference. Changes to support this new item type are already under way. \r\n\r\nSee [aspnet/AspNetCore#3612](https://github.com/aspnet/AspNetCore/issues/3612) for more details.\r\n\r\n## Reducing the duplication between NuGet packages and shared frameworks\r\n\r\nAs result these changes, it will not be necessary for projects to consume assemblies in Microsoft.AspNetCore.App as NuGet packages. To simplify the way in which consumers target and use the ASP.NET Core shared framework, we will stop producing many of the NuGet packages that we have been shipping since ASP.NET Core 1.0. The API those packages provide are still available to apps by using a `<FrameworkReference>` to Microsoft.AspNetCore.App. This includes commonly referenced API, such as Kestrel, Mvc, Razor, and others.\r\n\r\n**Please note** that this does not apply to all binaries that are pulled in via Microsoft.AspNetCore.App in 2.x. Notable exceptions include:\r\n\r\n* Microsoft.Extensions libraries which continue to target .NET Standard will be available as NuGet packages (see https://github.com/aspnet/Extensions)\r\n* API produced by the ASP.NET Core team which is not part of Microsoft.AspNetCore.App. For example, Entity Framework Core, API which provides 3rd party integration, experimental features, or API which has dependencies that could not [satisy the requirements to be in the shared framework][shared-fx-guidance] will ship as NuGet packages and not in the shared framework.\r\n* Extensions to MVC that maintain support for Json.NET. We intend to provide API as a NuGet package to support using Json.NET and MVC.\r\n* The SignalR .NET client will continue to support .NET Standard and ship as NuGet package because it is intended for use on many .NET runtimes, like Xamarin and UWP.\r\n\r\nFor more details, please see the [complete list of packages that will only be obsolete in favor of `<FrameworkReference>`.][packages-removed-from-fx] This list may fluctuate as we continue to work on ASP.NET Core 3.0.\r\n\r\nPlease see [the blog post from earlier today][aspnet-blog] for more details on the motivation for this change.\r\n\r\nPlease use [aspnet/AspNetCore#3757][discussion] for discussion.\r\n\r\n[2.1-lts]: https://www.microsoft.com/net/download/dotnet-core/2.1\r\n[aspnet-blog]: https://blogs.msdn.microsoft.com/webdev/2018/10/29/a-first-look-at-changes-coming-in-asp-net-core-3-0\r\n[discussion]: https://github.com/aspnet/AspNetCore/issues/3757\r\n[items-removed-from-fx]: https://github.com/aspnet/AspNetCore/issues/3755\r\n[packages-removed-from-fx]: https://github.com/aspnet/AspNetCore/issues/3756\r\n[shared-fx-guidance]: https://github.com/aspnet/AspNetCore/blob/4e44e5bcbedd961cc0d4f6b846699c7c494f5597/docs/SharedFramework.md\r\n","Url":"https://github.com/aspnet/Announcements/issues/325","RelatedDescription":"Open issue \"Breaking changes to Microsoft.AspNetCore.App in 3.0\" (#325)"},{"Id":"375240026","IsPullRequest":false,"CreatedAt":"2018-10-29T22:16:36","Actor":"natemcmaster","Number":"324","RawContent":null,"Title":"ASP.NET Core 3.0 will only run on .NET Core","State":"open","Body":"_This change is one of several which were [announced earlier today on the ASP.NET blog.][aspnet-blog]_\r\n\r\nAs announced on the [.NET Blog earlier this month][dotnet-blog], .NET Framework will get fewer of the newer platform and language features that come to .NET Core moving forward, due to the in-place update nature of .NET Framework and the desire to limit changes there that might break existing applications.

This advisory also provides guidance on what developers can do to remove current security restrictions added by ASP.NET to their applications to become compatible with iOS12.\r\n\r\n## Discussion\r\n\r\nDiscussion for this issue can be found at https://github.com/aspnet/Identity/issues/1984 for ASP.NET Core Identity\r\nDiscussion for this issue can be found at https://github.com/aspnet/Security/issues/1864 for ASP.NET Core Cookie Authentication\r\n\r\n## <a name=\"advisory-faq\"></a>Advisory FAQ\r\n\r\n### <a name=\"how-affected\"></a>What has changed\r\n\r\nThe recent iOS12 update has changed Safari's handling of [SameSite](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc6265) cookies. The SameSite attribute allows a developer to control when cookies are sent to a web site, enabling the flow to only occur when requests are from the same site. This standard was introduced to reduce exposure to Cross Site Request Forgery (CSRF) attacks. By default ASP.NET Core 2.0 and later protects its authentication cookies using the SameSite property. The change on Apple's part is not limited to ASP.NET Core applications, it is affecting multiple frameworks and authentication software which relay on HTTP forms in a browser, for example authenticating to a third party via Facebook, Twitter or browser based Open ID Connect (OIDC) mechanism.\r\n\r\nApple have stated they believe [their change is correct behavior](https://bugs.webkit.org/show_bug.cgi?id=188165), and that the fault lies in every other browser's implementation.\r\n\r\nWhile we take no stance on the correctness of browser behavior we feel that removing the SameSite protections would expose our customers, and their customers to a wider risk, as it would remove the protection provided everywhere, for all users, in any browser.\r\n\r\n### <a name=\"how-affected\"></a>How do I know if I am affected?\r\n\r\nIf your users can no longer login to your web application on iOS12 using Safari then you are affected.\r\n\r\n### <a name=\"how-fix\"></a>How do I fix this?\r\n\r\nDevelopers can allow iOS12 Safari users to log into their applications by turn off SameSite protection in `ConfigureServices()`.\r\n\r\nIf you are using ASP.NET Core Identity you disable the protection by configuring cookies with the following code\r\n\r\n```c#\r\nservices.ConfigureExternalCookie(options =>\r\n{\r\n    // Other options\r\n    options.Cookie.SameSite = SameSiteMode.None;\r\n});\r\nservices.ConfigureApplicationCookie(options =>\r\n{\r\n    // Other options\r\n    options.Cookie.SameSite = SameSiteMode.None;\r\n});\r\n```\r\n\r\nIf you are using cookie authentication without ASP.NET Core identity you can turn off the protection with the following code\r\n\r\n```c#\r\nservices.AddCookie(CookieAuthenticationDefaults.AuthenticationScheme, options =>\r\n{\r\n    // Other options\r\n    options.Cookie.SameSite = Microsoft.AspNetCore.Http.SameSiteMode.None;\r\n})\r\n```\r\n\r\nIf you are using external OIDC providers you may be able to avoid the issue by changing the response mode your provider uses from a POST to a GET request, using the following code. Not all providers may support this.\r\n\r\n```c#\r\n.AddOpenIdConnect(\"myOIDProvider\", options => {\r\n    // Other options\r\n    options.ResponseType = \"code\";\r\n    options.ResponseMode = \"query\";\r\n};\r\n```\r\n\r\n_Note that in making these changes protection is removed for all users and all browsers. You should ensure that all your actions that make state changes are protected with [CSRF anti-forgery mechanisms](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/aspnet/core/security/anti-request-forgery) built into ASP.NET Core.\r\n\r\n#### Rebuilding your application\r\n\r\nAfter making these configuration changes you rebuild your application, test, and redeploy.\r\n\r\n## Other Information\r\n\r\n### Reporting Security Issues\r\n\r\nIf you have found a potential security issue in .NET Core, please email details to secure@microsoft.com. Reports may qualify for the .NET Core Bug Bounty.

To check the current installed runtimes open a command prompt and run the `dotnet --info` command. If you have a 2.1 or greater runtime installed you will see output like the following;\r\n\r\n```\r\n.NET Core SDK (reflecting any global.json):\r\n Version:   2.1.401\r\n Commit:    91b1c13032\r\n\r\nRuntime Environment:\r\n OS Name:     Windows\r\n OS Version:  10.0.17134\r\n OS Platform: Windows\r\n RID:         win10-x64\r\n Base Path:   C:\\Program Files\\dotnet\\sdk\\2.1.401\\\r\n\r\nHost (useful for support):\r\n  Version: 2.1.3\r\n  Commit:  124038c13e\r\n\r\n.NET Core SDKs installed:\r\n  2.1.4 [C:\\Program Files\\dotnet\\sdk]\r\n  2.1.401 [C:\\Program Files\\dotnet\\sdk]\r\n\r\n.NET Core runtimes installed:\r\n  Microsoft.AspNetCore.All 2.1.3 [C:\\Program Files\\dotnet\\shared\\Microsoft.AspNetCore.All]\r\n  Microsoft.AspNetCore.App 2.1.3 [C:\\Program Files\\dotnet\\shared\\Microsoft.AspNetCore.App]\r\n  Microsoft.NETCore.App 2.1.3 [C:\\Program Files\\dotnet\\shared\\Microsoft.NETCore.App]\r\n\r\nTo install additional .NET Core runtimes or SDKs:\r\n  https://aka.ms/dotnet-download\r\n```\r\n\r\nIf the highest .NET Core SDK version is less that 2.1.402 or the highest `Microsoft.AspNetCore.App` runtime version is less that 2.1.4 you are vulnerable to this issue. You may not see any SDK versions if you have only installed the runtime.\r\n\r\nTo update ASP.NET Core 2.1 you should [download](https://www.microsoft.com/net/download) and install the .NET Core SDK 2.1.402 on your development machines and build servers, and the .NET Core Runtime 2.1.4 on your deployment servers. Your application will roll forward to these versions on an application restart.\r\n\r\n#### Applications not using Microsoft.AspNetCore.App or Microsoft.AspNetCore.All\r\n\r\nSystem.IO.Pipelines is distributed both in ASP.NET Core 2.1 and separately as a NuGet package. If you are not using Microsoft.AspNetCore.App or .All, you may still be affected if you are referencing the System.IO.Pipelines package.\r\n\r\n##### Direct dependencies\r\n\r\nDirect dependencies are discoverable by examining your `csproj` file. They can be fixed by [editing the project file](#fixing-direct-dependencies) or using NuGet to update the dependency.\r\n\r\n##### Transitive dependencies\r\n\r\nTransitive dependencies occur when you add a package to your project that in turn relies on another package. For example, if Contoso publishes a package `Contoso.Utility` which, in turn, depends on `Contoso.Internals` and you add the `Contoso.Utility` package to your project now your project has a direct dependency on `Contoso.Utility` and, because `Contoso.Utility` depends 'Contoso.Internals', your application gains a transitive dependency on the `Contoso.Internals` package.\r\n\r\nTransitive dependencies are reviewable in two ways:\r\n\r\n* In the Visual Studio Solution Explorer window, which supports searching.\r\n* By examining the `project.assets.json` file contained in the obj directory of your project for `csproj` based projects\r\n\r\nThe `project.assets.json` files are the authoritative list of all packages used by your project, containing both direct and transitive dependencies.\r\n\r\nThere are two ways to view transitive dependencies. You can either [use Visual Studio’s Solution Explorer](#vs-solution-explorer), or you can review [the `project.assets.json` file](#project-assets-json)).\r\n\r\n##### <a name=\"vs-solution-explorer\"></a>Using Visual Studio Solution Explorer\r\n\r\nTo use Solution Explorer, open the project in Visual Studio, and then press Ctrl+; to activate the search in Solution Explorer. Search for the [vulnerable package](#affected-software) and make a note of the version numbers of any results you find.\r\n\r\nFor example, searching for `Microsoft.AspNetCore.Mvc.Core` in an example project that contains a package that takes a dependency on `Microsoft.AspNetCore.Mvc` shows the following results in Visual Studio 2017:\r\n\r\n![Screenshot of search results in Visual Studio 2017](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/796298/25858816/8ecdc2b4-3491-11e7-9363-746804bb9832.png)\r\n\r\nThe search results appear as a tree. In the previous results, you can see that a reference to `Microsoft.AspNetCore.Mvc.Core` version 1.1.2 is discovered.\r\n\r\nUnder the Dependencies node is a NuGet node. Under the NuGet node is the list of packages you have directly taken a dependency on and their versions.\r\nIn screenshot, the application takes a direct dependency on `Microsoft.AspNetCore.Mvc`. `Microsoft.AspNetCore.Mvc` in turn has leaf nodes that list its dependencies and their versions.\r\nThe `Microsoft.AspNetCore.Mvc` package takes a dependency on a version of `Microsoft.AspNetCore.Mvc.ApiExplorer`, that in turn takes a dependency on a version of `Microsoft.AspNetCore.Mvc.Core`.\r\n\r\n##### <a name=\"project-assets-json\"></a> Manually reviewing project.assets.json\r\n\r\nOpen the *project.assets.json* file from your project’s obj directory in your editor. We suggest you use an editor that understands JSON and allows you to collapse and expand nodes to review this file.\r\nVisual Studio and Visual Studio Code provide JSON friendly editing.\r\n\r\nSearch the *project.assets.json* file for the [vulnerable package](#affected-software), using the format `packagename/` for each of the package names from the preceding table. If you find the assembly name in your search:\r\n\r\n* Examine the line on which they are found, the version number is after the `/`.\r\n* Compare to the [vulnerable versions table](#affected-software).\r\n\r\nFor example, a search result that shows `System.IO.Pipelines/4.5.0` is a reference to version 4.5.0 of `System.IO.Pipelines`.\r\n\r\nIf your *project.assets.json* file includes references to the [vulnerable package](#affected-software), then you need to fix the transitive dependencies.\r\n\r\nIf you have not found any reference to any vulnerable packages, this means either\r\n\r\n* None of your direct dependencies depend on any vulnerable packages, or\r\n* You have already fixed the problem by updating the direct dependencies.\r\n\r\n### <a name=\"how-fix\"></a>How do I fix the issue?\r\n\r\n#### <a name=\"fixing-direct-dependencies\"></a>Fixing direct dependencies\r\n\r\nOpen *projectname.csproj* in your editor. If you're using Visual Studio, right-click the project and choose **Edit projectname.csproj** from the context menu, where projectname is the name of your project. Look for `PackageReference` elements. The following shows an example project file:\r\n\r\n```xml\r\n<Project Sdk=\"Microsoft.NET.Sdk.Web\">\r\n  <PropertyGroup>\r\n    <TargetFramework>netcoreapp2.1</TargetFramework>\r\n  </PropertyGroup>\r\n  <ItemGroup>\r\n    <PackageReference Include=\"System.IO.Pipelines\" Version=\"4.5.0\" />\r\n  </ItemGroup>\r\n</Project>\r\n```\r\n\r\nThe preceding example has a reference to the [vulnerable package](#affected-software), as seen by the single `PackageReference` element. The name of the package is in the `Include` attribute.\r\nThe package version number is in the `Version` attribute. The previous example shows a single direct dependency on `System.IO.Pipelines` version 4.5.0\r\n\r\nTo update the version to the secure package, change the version number to the updated package version as listed on the table [previously](#affected-software).\r\nIn this example, update `System.IO.Pipelines` to the appropriate [fixed package number](#affected-software) for your major version. Save the *csproj* file. The example *csproj* now looks as follows:\r\n\r\n```xml\r\n<Project Sdk=\"Microsoft.NET.Sdk.Web\">\r\n  <PropertyGroup>\r\n    <TargetFramework>netcoreapp2.1</TargetFramework>\r\n  </PropertyGroup>\r\n  <ItemGroup>\r\n    <PackageReference Include=\"System.IO.Pipelines\" Version=\"4.5.1\" />\r\n  </ItemGroup>\r\n</Project>\r\n```\r\n\r\nIf you're using Visual Studio and you save your updated *csproj* file, Visual Studio will restore the new package version.\r\nYou can see the restore results by opening the **Output** window (Ctrl+Alt+O) and changing the **Show output from** drop-down list to **Package Manager**.\r\n\r\nIf you're not using Visual Studio, open a command line and change to your project directory. Execute the `dotnet restore` command to restore the updated dependencies.\r\n\r\nNow recompile your application. If after recompilation you see a *Dependency conflict warning*, you must update your other direct dependencies to versions that take a dependency on the updated package.\r\n\r\n#### <a name=\"transitive-dependencies\"></a>Fixing transitive dependencies\r\n\r\nIf your transitive dependency review found references to the [vulnerable package](#affected-software), you must add a direct dependency to the updated package to your *csproj* file to override the transitive dependency.\r\n\r\nOpen *projectname.csproj* in your editor. If you're using Visual Studio, right-click the project and choose **Edit projectname.csproj** from the context menu, where projectname is the name of your project.\r\nLook for `PackageReference` nodes, for example:\r\n\r\n```xml\r\n<Project Sdk=\"Microsoft.NET.Sdk.\">\r\n  <PropertyGroup>\r\n    <TargetFramework>net461</TargetFramework>\r\n  </PropertyGroup>\r\n  <ItemGroup>\r\n    <PackageReference Include=\"ThirdParty.NotUpdatedYet\" Version=\"2.0.0\" />\r\n  </ItemGroup>\r\n</Project>\r\n```\r\n\r\nYou must add a direct dependency to the updated version of the [vulnerable package](#affected-software) by adding it to the *csproj* file.\r\nYou do this by adding a new line to the dependencies section, referencing the fixed version.\r\nFor example, if your search showed a transitive reference to a vulnerable `System.ServiceModel.Http` version, you'd add a reference to the [fixed package number](#affected-software).\r\n\r\n```xml\r\n<Project Sdk=\"Microsoft.NET.Sdk.Web\">\r\n  <PropertyGroup>\r\n    <TargetFramework>net461</TargetFramework>\r\n  </PropertyGroup>\r\n  <ItemGroup>\r\n    <PackageReference Include=\"System.IO.Pipelines\" Version=\"4.5.1\" />\r\n    <PackageReference Include=\"ThirdParty.NotUpdatedYet\" Version=\"2.0.0\" />\r\n  </ItemGroup>\r\n</Project>\r\n```\r\n\r\nAfter you've added the direct dependency reference, save your *csproj* file.\r\n\r\nIf you're using Visual Studio, save your updated *csproj* file and Visual Studio will restore the new package versions.\r\nYou can see the restore results by opening the **Output** window (Ctrl+Alt+O) and changing the **Show output from** drop-down list to **Package Manager**.\r\n\r\nIf you're not using Visual Studio, open a command line and change to your project directory. Execute the `dotnet restore` command to restore the new dependencies.\r\n\r\n#### Rebuilding your application\r\n\r\nFinally you must rebuild your application, test, and redeploy.\r\n\r\n## Other Information\r\n\r\n### Reporting Security Issues\r\n\r\nIf you have found a potential security issue in .NET Core, please email details to secure@microsoft.com.

The Razor SDK is on by default and no gesture is required to start using it.\r\n\r\nIn 3.0, we plan to remove the earlier MVC precompilation tool. Earlier versions of the package will continue receiving important bug and security fixes as part of our patch release. \r\n\r\nFor users of ASP.NET Core 2.1 or later, we recommend migrating to the Razor SDK if you haven't already. If you're currently using the precompilation tool and are unable to migrate to the Razor SDK due to bugs or missing features, please file an issue at https://github.com/aspnet/Razor/issues.\r\n\r\nPlease use https://github.com/aspnet/Mvc/issues/8313 for discussions.","Url":"https://github.com/aspnet/Announcements/issues/315","RelatedDescription":"Open issue \"3.0: Deprecating MvcPrecompilation tool \" (#315)"},{"Id":"349340221","IsPullRequest":false,"CreatedAt":"2018-08-10T00:56:39","Actor":"natemcmaster","Number":"314","RawContent":null,"Title":"3.0: deprecating Microsoft.AspNetCore.All","State":"open","Body":"Earlier this year, we announced the Microsoft.AspNetCore.App metapackage (see https://github.com/aspnet/Announcements/issues/287).

This feature is on by default and allows build time verification of the correctness of Razor files, and also faster startup performance. Additionally, MVC watches for changes to cshtml files and seamlessly updates build-time compiled views with runtime compiled views. This allows editing cshtml files and then refreshing the browser to see the changes.\r\n\r\nMVC uses the app's compilation context, details about the references and settings that were used to compile the source code (.cs) in the app, to compile views at runtime. In addition to the compilation context, MVC exposes options such as [RazorViewEngineOptions.CompilationCallback](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/api/microsoft.aspnetcore.mvc.razor.razorviewengineoptions.compilationcallback?view=aspnetcore-2.1) and [AdditionalCompilationReferences](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/api/microsoft.aspnetcore.mvc.razor.razorviewengineoptions.additionalcompilationreferences?view=aspnetcore-2.1) that allow configuring compilation specifically for runtime. \r\n\r\nRuntime specific customizations are unavailable at build time and consequently the two outputs could be different.\r\n\r\nTo address this inconsistency, we plan on removing APIs in MVC that change or modify runtime compilation. For 2.2.0, we're marking these APIs obsolete with the intent to remove them in 3.0.0.

Direct dependencies are dependencies where you specifically add a package to your project, transitive dependencies occur when you add a package to your project that in turn relies on another package.\r\n\r\nFor example, the `Microsoft.AspNetCore.Mvc` package depends on the `Microsoft.AspNetCore.Mvc.Core` package. When you add a dependency on `Microsoft.AspNetCore.Mvc` in your project, you're taking a transitive dependency on `Microsoft.AspNetCore.Mvc.Core`.\r\n\r\nAny application that has a direct or transitive dependency on the [affected package](#affected-software) can be exposed to the vulnerability if it does not meet any of the [mitigation factors](#mitigation-factors).\r\n\r\n### <a name=\"how-fix\"></a>How do I fix the issue?\r\n\r\n### ASP.NET Core 2.1\r\n\r\nTo update ASP.NET Core 2.1 you should [download](https://www.microsoft.com/net/download) and install the .NET Core SDK 2.1.302 on your development machines and build servers, and the .NET Core Runtime 2.1.2 on your deployment servers. Your application will roll forward to these versions on an application restart.\r\n\r\n### ASP.NET Core 2.0\r\n\r\nIf you're targeting ASP.NET Core 2.0 and using the `Microsoft.AspNetCore.All` metapackage update its version number to 2.0.9 to update the `Microsoft.AspNetCore.Server.Kestrel.Core` package, recompile, and redeploy. On your deployment servers, you should [download](https://github.com/dotnet/core/blob/master/release-notes/download-archives/2.0.9-download.md) and install the .NET Core 2.0.9 using the Windows Server Hosting Bundle for Windows and the `dotnet-hosting-2.0.9` package for Linux servers.\r\n\r\n### ASP.NET 2.0 & 2.1 not targeting the meta-packages\r\n\r\n.NET Core projects have two types of dependencies: direct and transitive. You must update your projects using the following instructions to address both types of dependency.\r\n\r\n#### Direct dependencies\r\n\r\nDirect dependencies are discoverable by examining your `csproj` file. They can be fixed by [editing the project file](#direct-dependencies) or using NuGet to update the dependency.\r\n\r\n#### Transitive dependencies\r\n\r\nTransitive dependencies occur when you add a package to your project that in turn relies on another package. For example, if Contoso publishes a package `Contoso.Utility` which, in turn, depends on `Contoso.Internals` and you add the `Contoso.Utility` package to your project now your project has a direct dependency on `Contoso.Utility` and, because `Contoso.Utility` depends 'Contoso.Internals', your application gains a transitive dependency on the `Contoso.Internals` package.\r\n\r\nTransitive dependencies are reviewable in three ways, depending on your [project format](#project-format):\r\n\r\n* In the Visual Studio Solution Explorer window, which supports searching.\r\n* By examining the `project.assets.json` file contained in the obj directory of your project for `csproj` based projects.\r\n\r\nThe `project.assets.json`files are the authoritative list of all packages used by your project, containing both direct and transitive dependencies.\r\n\r\n#### <a name=\"direct-dependencies-vs2017\"></a>Fixing direct dependencies in Visual Studio 2017\r\n\r\nOpen *projectname.csproj* in your editor. If you're using Visual Studio, right-click the project and choose **Edit projectname.csproj** from the context menu, where projectname is the name of your project. Look for `PackageReference` elements. The following shows an example project file:\r\n\r\n```xml\r\n<Project Sdk=\"Microsoft.NET.Sdk.Web\">\r\n  <PropertyGroup>\r\n    <TargetFramework>netcoreapp2.0</TargetFramework>\r\n  </PropertyGroup>\r\n  <ItemGroup>\r\n    <PackageReference Include=\"Microsoft.AspNetCore.All\" Version=\"2.0.8\" />\r\n  </ItemGroup>\r\n</Project>\r\n```\r\n\r\nThe preceding example has a reference to the [vulnerable package](#affected-software), as seen by the single `PackageReference` element. The name of the package is in the `Include` attribute.\r\nThe package version number is in the `Version` attribute. The previous example shows a single direct dependency on `Microsoft.AspNetCore.All` version 2.0.0.\r\n\r\nTo update the version to the secure package, change the version number to the updated package version as listed on the table [previously](#affected-software).\r\nIn this example, update `Microsoft.AspNetCore.All` to the appropriate [fixed package number](#affected-software) for your major version. Save the *csproj* file. The example *csproj* now looks as follows:\r\n\r\n```xml\r\n<Project Sdk=\"Microsoft.NET.Sdk.Web\">\r\n  <PropertyGroup>\r\n    <TargetFramework>netcoreapp2.0</TargetFramework>\r\n  </PropertyGroup>\r\n  <ItemGroup>\r\n    <PackageReference Include=\"Microsoft.AspNetCore.All\" Version=\"2.0.9\" />\r\n  </ItemGroup>\r\n</Project>\r\n```\r\n\r\nIf you're using Visual Studio and you save your updated *csproj* file, Visual Studio will restore the new package version.\r\nYou can see the restore results by opening the **Output** window (Ctrl+Alt+O) and changing the **Show output from** drop-down list to **Package Manager**.\r\n\r\nIf you're not using Visual Studio, open a command line and change to your project directory. Execute the `dotnet restore` command to restore the updated dependencies.\r\n\r\nNow recompile your application. If after recompilation you see a *Dependency conflict warning*, you must update your other direct dependencies to versions that take a dependency on the updated package.\r\n\r\n#### Discovering and fixing transitive dependencies\r\n\r\nThere are two ways to view transitive dependencies. You can either [use Visual Studio’s Solution Explorer](#vs-solution-explorer), or you can review [the `project.assets.json` file](#project-assets-json) .\r\n\r\n##### <a name=\"vs-solution-explorer\"></a>Using Visual Studio Solution Explorer\r\n\r\nTo use Solution Explorer, open the project in Visual Studio, and then press Ctrl+; to activate the search in Solution Explorer. Search for the [vulnerable package](#affected-software) and make a note of the version numbers of any results you find.\r\n\r\nFor example, searching for `Microsoft.AspNetCore.Mvc.Core` in an example project that contains a package that takes a dependency on `Microsoft.AspNetCore.Mvc` shows the following results in Visual Studio 2017:\r\n\r\n![Screenshot of search results in Visual Studio 2017](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/796298/25858816/8ecdc2b4-3491-11e7-9363-746804bb9832.png)\r\n\r\nThe search results appear as a tree. In the previous results, you can see that a reference to `Microsoft.AspNetCore.Mvc.Core` version 1.1.2 is discovered.\r\n\r\nUnder the Dependencies node is a NuGet node. Under the NuGet node is the list of packages you have directly taken a dependency on and their versions.\r\nIn screenshot, the application takes a direct dependency on `Microsoft.AspNetCore.Mvc`. `Microsoft.AspNetCore.Mvc` in turn has leaf nodes that list its dependencies and their versions.\r\nThe `Microsoft.AspNetCore.Mvc` package takes a dependency on a version of `Microsoft.AspNetCore.Mvc.ApiExplorer`, that in turn takes a dependency on a version of `Microsoft.AspNetCore.Mvc.Core`.\r\n\r\n##### <a name=\"project-assets-json\"></a> Manually reviewing project.assets.json\r\n\r\nOpen the *project.assets.json* file from your project’s obj directory in your editor. We suggest you use an editor that understands JSON and allows you to collapse and expand nodes to review this file.\r\nVisual Studio and Visual Studio Code provide JSON friendly editing.\r\n\r\nSearch the *project.assets.json* file for the [vulnerable package](#affected-software), using the format `packagename/` for each of the package names from the preceding table. If you find the assembly name in your search:\r\n\r\n* Examine the line on which they are found, the version number is after the `/`.\r\n* Compare to the [vulnerable versions table](#affected-software).\r\n\r\nFor example, a search result that shows `Microsoft.AspNetCore.Server.Kestrel.Core/2.0.0` is a reference to version 2.0.0 of `Microsoft.AspNetCore.Server.Kestrel.Core`.\r\nIf your *project.assets.json* file includes references to the [vulnerable package](#affected-software), then you need to fix the transitive dependencies.\r\n\r\nIf you have not found any reference to any vulnerable packages, this means either\r\n\r\n* None of your direct dependencies depend on any vulnerable packages, or\r\n* You have already fixed the problem by updating the direct dependencies.\r\n\r\nIf your transitive dependency review found references to the [vulnerable package](#affected-software), you must add a direct dependency to the updated package to your *csproj* file to override the transitive dependency.\r\n\r\nOpen *projectname.csproj* in your editor. If you're using Visual Studio, right-click the project and choose **Edit projectname.csproj** from the context menu, where projectname is the name of your project.\r\nLook for `PackageReference` nodes, for example:\r\n\r\n```xml\r\n<Project Sdk=\"Microsoft.NET.Sdk.\">\r\n  <PropertyGroup>\r\n    <TargetFramework>net461</TargetFramework>\r\n  </PropertyGroup>\r\n  <ItemGroup>\r\n    <PackageReference Include=\"ThirdParty.NotUpdatedYet\" Version=\"2.0.0\" />\r\n  </ItemGroup>\r\n</Project>\r\n```\r\n\r\nYou must add a direct dependency to the updated version of the [vulnerable package](#affected-software) by adding it to the *csproj* file.\r\nYou do this by adding a new line to the dependencies section, referencing the fixed version.\r\nFor example, if your search showed a transitive reference to a vulnerable `Microsoft.AspNetCore.Server.Kestrel.Core` version, you'd add a reference to the [fixed package number](#affected-software).\r\n\r\n```xml\r\n<Project Sdk=\"Microsoft.NET.Sdk.Web\">\r\n  <PropertyGroup>\r\n    <TargetFramework>net461</TargetFramework>\r\n  </PropertyGroup>\r\n  <ItemGroup>\r\n    <PackageReference Include=\"Microsoft.AspNetCore.Server.Kestrel.Core\" Version=\"2.0.34 />\r\n    <PackageReference Include=\"ThirdParty.NotUpdatedYet\" Version=\"2.0.0\" />\r\n  </ItemGroup>\r\n</Project>\r\n```\r\n\r\nAfter you've added the direct dependency reference, save your *csproj* file.\r\n\r\nIf you're using Visual Studio, save your updated *csproj* file and Visual Studio will restore the new package versions.\r\nYou can see the restore results by opening the **Output** window (Ctrl+Alt+O) and changing the **Show output from** drop-down list to **Package Manager**.\r\n\r\nIf you're not using Visual Studio, open a command line and change to your project directory. Execute the `dotnet restore` command to restore the new dependencies.\r\n\r\n#### Rebuilding your application\r\n\r\nFinally you must rebuild your application, test, and redeploy.\r\n\r\n## Other Information\r\n\r\n### Reporting Security Issues\r\n\r\nIf you have found a potential security issue in .NET Core, please email details to secure@microsoft.com.

Your application will roll forward to these versions on an application restart.\r\n\r\n### ASP.NET Core 2.0\r\n\r\nIf you're targeting ASP.NET Core 2.0 and using the `Microsoft.AspNetCore.All` metapackage update its version number to 2.0.9 to update the `Microsoft.AspNetCore.Identity` package, recompile, and redeploy. On your deployment servers, you should [download](https://github.com/dotnet/core/blob/master/release-notes/download-archives/2.0.9-download.md) and install the .NET Core 2.0.9 using the Windows Server Hosting Bundle for Windows and the `dotnet-hosting-2.0.9` package for Linux servers.\r\n\r\n### ASP.NET Core 1.0, 1.1 or 2.0 not targeting the metapackage.\r\n\r\n.NET Core projects have two types of dependencies: direct and transitive. You must update your projects using the following instructions to address both types of dependency.\r\n\r\n### <a name=\"project-format\"></a>.NET Core Project formats\r\n\r\n.NET Core has two different project file formats, depending on what software created the project.\r\n\r\n1. `project.json` is the format used in .NET Core 1.0 and Microsoft Visual Studio 2015.\r\n2. `csproj` is the format used in .NET Core 1.1, .NET Core 2.0 and Microsoft Visual Studio 2017.\r\n\r\n#### Direct dependencies\r\n\r\nDirect dependencies are discoverable by examining your `csproj` file or your `project.json` file. They can be fixed by [editing the project file](#direct-dependencies) or using NuGet to update the dependency.\r\n\r\n#### Transitive dependencies\r\n\r\nTransitive dependencies occur when you add a package to your project that in turn relies on another package. For example, if Contoso publishes a package `Contoso.Utility` which, in turn, depends on `Contoso.Internals` and you add the `Contoso.Utility` package to your project now your project has a direct dependency on `Contoso.Utility` and, because `Contoso.Utility` depends 'Contoso.Internals', your application gains a transitive dependency on the `Contoso.Internals` package.\r\n\r\nTransitive dependencies are reviewable in three ways, depending on your [project format](#project-format):\r\n\r\n* In the Visual Studio Solution Explorer window, which supports searching.\r\n* By examining the `project.assets.json` file contained in the obj directory of your project for `csproj` based projects *OR*.\r\n* By examining the `project.lock.json` file contained in the root directory of your project for `project.json` based projects.\r\n\r\nThe `project.assets.json` and `project.lock.json` files are the authoritative list of all packages used by your project, containing both direct and transitive dependencies.\r\n\r\n#### <a name=\"direct-dependencies-vs2017\"></a>Fixing direct dependencies in a csproj based project / Visual Studio 2017\r\n\r\nOpen *projectname.csproj* in your editor.

The following shows an example project file:\r\n\r\n```xml\r\n<Project Sdk=\"Microsoft.NET.Sdk.Web\">\r\n  <PropertyGroup>\r\n    <TargetFramework>netcoreapp2.0</TargetFramework>\r\n  </PropertyGroup>\r\n  <ItemGroup>\r\n    <PackageReference Include=\"Microsoft.AspNetCore.Identity\" Version=\"2.0.0\" />\r\n  </ItemGroup>\r\n</Project>\r\n```\r\n\r\nThe preceding example has a reference to the [vulnerable package](#affected-software), as seen by the single `PackageReference` element. The name of the package is in the `Include` attribute.\r\nThe package version number is in the `Version` attribute. The previous example shows a single direct dependency on `Microsoft.AspNetCore.Identity` version 2.0.0.\r\n\r\nTo update the version to the secure package, change the version number to the updated package version as listed on the table [previously](#affected-software).\r\nIn this example, update `Microsoft.AspNetCore.Identity` to the appropriate [fixed package number](#affected-software) for your major version. Save the *csproj* file. The example *csproj* now looks as follows:\r\n\r\n```xml\r\n<Project Sdk=\"Microsoft.NET.Sdk.Web\">\r\n  <PropertyGroup>\r\n    <TargetFramework>netcoreapp2.0</TargetFramework>\r\n  </PropertyGroup>\r\n  <ItemGroup>\r\n    <PackageReference Include=\"Microsoft.AspNetCore.Identity\" Version=\"2.0.4\" />\r\n  </ItemGroup>\r\n</Project>\r\n```\r\n\r\nIf you're using Visual Studio and you save your updated *csproj* file, Visual Studio will restore the new package version.\r\nYou can see the restore results by opening the **Output** window (Ctrl+Alt+O) and changing the **Show output from** drop-down list to **Package Manager**.\r\n\r\nIf you're not using Visual Studio, open a command line and change to your project directory. Execute the `dotnet restore` command to restore the updated dependencies.\r\n\r\nNow recompile your application. If after recompilation you see a *Dependency conflict warning*, you must update your other direct dependencies to versions that take a dependency on the updated package.\r\n\r\n#### <a name=\"direct-dependencies-vs2015\"></a> Fixing Direct Dependencies in project.json based project / Visual Studio 2015\r\n\r\nOpen your `project.json` file in your editor. Look for the dependencies section. Below is an example dependencies section:\r\n\r\n``` json\r\n    \"dependencies\": {\r\n      \"Microsoft.NETCore.App\": {\r\n        \"version\": \"1.0.1\",\r\n        \"type\": \"platform\"\r\n      },\r\n     \"Microsoft.AspNetCore.Mvc.Core\": \"1.0.6\",\r\n     \"Microsoft.AspNetCore.Identity\" : \"1.0.5\"\r\n    }\r\n```\r\n\r\nThis example has three direct dependencies: `Microsoft.NETCore.App`, `Microsoft.AspNetCore.Mvc.Core` and `Microsoft.AspNetCore.Identity`.\r\n\r\n`Microsoft.NetCore.App` is the platform the application targets, you should ignore this. The other packages expose their version to the right of the package name. In our example, our non-platform packages are version 1.0.1.\r\n\r\nReview your direct dependencies for any instance of the packages and versions listed above. In the example above, there is a direct dependency on a vulnerable package, `Microsoft.AspNetCore.Identity` version 1.0.5.\r\n\r\nTo update to the fixed package, change the version number to be the appropriate package for your release. In the example, this would be updating `Microsoft.AspNetCore.Identity` to 1.0.6.\r\n\r\nAfter updating the vulnerable package versions, save your `project.json` file.\r\n\r\nThe dependencies section in our example `project.json` would now look as follows:\r\n\r\n```json\r\n  \"dependencies\": {\r\n    \"Microsoft.NETCore.App\": {\r\n      \"version\": \"1.0.1\",\r\n      \"type\": \"platform\"\r\n    },\r\n    \"Microsoft.AspNetCore.Mvc.Core\": \"1.0.6\",\r\n    \"Microsoft.AspNetCore.Identity \": \"1.0.6\"\r\n  }\r\n```\r\n\r\nIf you are using Visual Studio and save your updated `project.json` file, Visual Studio will restore the new package version. You can see the restore results by opening the Output Window (Ctrl+Alt+O) and changing the Show output from drop-down list to Package Manager.\r\n\r\nIf you are not using Visual Studio, open a command line and change to your project directory. Execute the `dotnet restore` command to restore your new dependency.\r\n\r\nAfter you have addressed all of your direct dependencies, you must also review your transitive dependencies.\r\n\r\nAfter you've addressed all of your direct dependencies, you must review your transitive dependencies.\r\n\r\n#### Discovering and fixing transitive dependencies\r\n\r\nThere are two ways to view transitive dependencies. You can either [use Visual Studio’s Solution Explorer](#vs-solution-explorer), or you can review [the `project.assets.json` file](#project-assets-json) or the [the `project.lock.json` file](#project-lock-json).\r\n\r\n##### <a name=\"vs-solution-explorer\"></a>Using Visual Studio Solution Explorer\r\n\r\nTo use Solution Explorer, open the project in Visual Studio, and then press Ctrl+; to activate the search in Solution Explorer. Search for the [vulnerable package](#affected-software) and make a note of the version numbers of any results you find.\r\n\r\nFor example, searching for `Microsoft.AspNetCore.Mvc.Core` in an example project that contains a package that takes a dependency on `Microsoft.AspNetCore.Mvc` shows the following results in Visual Studio 2017:\r\n\r\n![Screenshot of search results in Visual Studio 2017](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/796298/25858816/8ecdc2b4-3491-11e7-9363-746804bb9832.png)\r\n\r\nThe search results appear as a tree. In the previous results, you can see that a reference to `Microsoft.AspNetCore.Mvc.Core` version 1.1.2 is discovered.\r\n\r\nUnder the Dependencies node is a NuGet node. Under the NuGet node is the list of packages you have directly taken a dependency on and their versions.\r\nIn screenshot, the application takes a direct dependency on `Microsoft.AspNetCore.Mvc`. `Microsoft.AspNetCore.Mvc` in turn has leaf nodes that list its dependencies and their versions.\r\nThe `Microsoft.AspNetCore.Mvc` package takes a dependency on a version of `Microsoft.AspNetCore.Mvc.ApiExplorer`, that in turn takes a dependency on a version of `Microsoft.AspNetCore.Mvc.Core`.\r\n\r\n##### <a name=\"project-assets-json\"></a> Manually reviewing project.assets.json (csproj/VS2017)\r\n\r\nOpen the *project.assets.json* file from your project’s obj directory in your editor. We suggest you use an editor that understands JSON and allows you to collapse and expand nodes to review this file.\r\nVisual Studio and Visual Studio Code provide JSON friendly editing.\r\n\r\nSearch the *project.assets.json* file for the [vulnerable package](#affected-software), using the format `packagename/` for each of the package names from the preceding table. If you find the assembly name in your search:\r\n\r\n* Examine the line on which they are found, the version number is after the `/`.\r\n* Compare to the [vulnerable versions table](#affected-software).\r\n\r\nFor example, a search result that shows `Microsoft.AspNetCore.Identity/2.0.0` is a reference to version 2.0.0 of `Microsoft.AspNetCore.Identity`.\r\nIf your *project.assets.json* file includes references to the [vulnerable package](#affected-software), then you need to fix the transitive dependencies.\r\n\r\nIf you have not found any reference to any vulnerable packages, this means either\r\n\r\n* None of your direct dependencies depend on any vulnerable packages, or\r\n* You have already fixed the problem by updating the direct dependencies.\r\n\r\nIf your transitive dependency review found references to the [vulnerable package](#affected-software), you must add a direct dependency to the updated package to your *csproj* file to override the transitive dependency.\r\n\r\nOpen *projectname.csproj* in your editor. If you're using Visual Studio, right-click the project and choose **Edit projectname.csproj** from the context menu, where projectname is the name of your project.\r\nLook for `PackageReference` nodes, for example:\r\n\r\n```xml\r\n<Project Sdk=\"Microsoft.NET.Sdk.\">\r\n  <PropertyGroup>\r\n    <TargetFramework>net461</TargetFramework>\r\n  </PropertyGroup>\r\n  <ItemGroup>\r\n    <PackageReference Include=\"ThirdParty.NotUpdatedYet\" Version=\"2.0.0\" />\r\n  </ItemGroup>\r\n</Project>\r\n```\r\n\r\nYou must add a direct dependency to the updated version of the [vulnerable package](#affected-software) by adding it to the *csproj* file.\r\nYou do this by adding a new line to the dependencies section, referencing the fixed version.\r\nFor example, if your search showed a transitive reference to a vulnerable `Microsoft.AspNetCore.Identity` version, you'd add a reference to the [fixed package number](#affected-software).\r\n\r\n```xml\r\n<Project Sdk=\"Microsoft.NET.Sdk.Web\">\r\n  <PropertyGroup>\r\n    <TargetFramework>net461</TargetFramework>\r\n  </PropertyGroup>\r\n  <ItemGroup>\r\n    <PackageReference Include=\"Microsoft.AspNetCore.Identity\" Version=\"2.0.4\" />\r\n    <PackageReference Include=\"ThirdParty.NotUpdatedYet\" Version=\"2.0.0\" />\r\n  </ItemGroup>\r\n</Project>\r\n```\r\n\r\nAfter you've added the direct dependency reference, save your *csproj* file.\r\n\r\nIf you're using Visual Studio, save your updated *csproj* file and Visual Studio will restore the new package versions.\r\nYou can see the restore results by opening the **Output** window (Ctrl+Alt+O) and changing the **Show output from** drop-down list to **Package Manager**.\r\n\r\nIf you're not using Visual Studio, open a command line and change to your project directory. Execute the `dotnet restore` command to restore the new dependencies.\r\n\r\n##### <a name=\"project-lock-json\"></a> Manually reviewing project.lock.json (project.json/VS2015)\r\n\r\nOpen the `project.lock.json` file in your editor. We suggest you use an editor that understands json and allows you to collapse and expand nodes to review this file; both Visual Studio and Visual Studio Code provide this functionality.\r\n\r\nIf you are using Visual Studio the `project.lock.json` file is “under” the `project.json` file. Click the right pointing triangle, ▷, to the left of the `project.json` file to expand the solution tree to expose the `project.lock.json` file. The following image shows a project with the `project.json` file expanded to show the `project.lock.json` file.\r\n\r\n![project lock json](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/796298/25858179/f6e01200-348f-11e7-8a77-7176d8dd3f03.png)\r\n\r\nSearch the `project.lock.json` file for the vulnerable packages, using the format `packagename/`, using each of the package names from the table above. If you find any vulnerable assembly name in your search examine the line on which they are found, the version number is after the `/` and compare to the vulnerable versions table above. For example a search result that shows `Microsoft.AspNetCore.Identity/1.0.1` is a reference to v1.0.1 of `Microsoft.AspNetCore.Identity`.   If your `project.lock.json` file includes references to any of the package versions shown above then you will need to fix the transitive dependencies.\r\n\r\nIf you have not found any reference to a vulnerable version of  `Microsoft.AspNetCore.Identity` this means none of your direct dependencies depend on any vulnerable packages or you have already fixed the problem by updating the direct dependencies.\r\n\r\nIf your transitive dependency review found references to any of the vulnerable packages you must add a direct dependency to the updated package to your `project.json` file to override the transitive dependency. Open your `project.json` and find the dependencies section. For example:\r\n\r\n``` json\r\n  \"dependencies\": {\r\n    \"Microsoft.NETCore.App\": {\r\n      \"version\": \"1.0.1\",\r\n      \"type\": \"platform\"\r\n    },\r\n    \"Microsoft.AspNetCore.Mvc\": \"1.0.0\"\r\n  }\r\n```\r\n\r\nFor each of the vulnerable packages your search returned you must add a direct dependency to the updated version by adding it to the `project.json` file. You do this by adding a new line to the dependencies section, referring the fixed version. For example, if your search showed a transitive reference to the vulnerable `Microsoft.AspNetCore.Identity` version 1.0.0 you would add a reference to the appropriate fixed version, 1.0.6. Edit the `project.json` file as follows:\r\n\r\n``` json\r\n  \"dependencies\": {\r\n    \"Microsoft.NETCore.App\": {\r\n      \"version\": \"1.0.1\",\r\n      \"type\": \"platform\"\r\n    },\r\n    \"Microsoft.AspNetCore.Identity\": \"1.0.6\",\r\n    \"Microsoft.AspNetCore.Mvc\": \"1.0.0\"\r\n  }\r\n```\r\n\r\nAfter you have added direct dependencies to the fixed packages, save your `project.json` file.\r\n\r\nIf you are using Visual Studio save your updated `project.json` file and Visual Studio will restore the new package versions. You can see the restore results by opening the Output Window (Ctrl+Alt+O) and changing the Show output from drop-down list to Package Manager.\r\n\r\nIf you are not using Visual Studio open a command line and change to your project directory. Execute the `dotnet restore` command to restore your new dependencies.\r\n\r\n#### Rebuilding your application\r\n\r\nFinally you must rebuild your application, test, and redeploy.\r\n\r\n## Other Information\r\n\r\n### Reporting Security Issues\r\n\r\nIf you have found a potential security issue in .NET Core, please email details to secure@microsoft.com.

We are concentrating most of our efforts to add new functionality on the 3.0 release. Still, you can expect 2.2 to include lots of bugs fixes, community contributions and small improvements.\r\n\r\nYou can access the list of issues currently assigned to the 2.2 milestone using [this query](https://github.com/aspnet/EntityFrameworkCore/issues?q=is%3Aopen+is%3Aissue+milestone%3A2.2.0+sort%3Areactions-%2B1-desc) on our issue tracking system.  \r\n\r\n## Schedule\r\nThe schedule of EF Core 2.2 will align with the schedule of .NET Core and ASP.NET Core 2.2. See [the ASP.NET Core 2.2 Roadmap announcement](https://github.com/aspnet/Announcements/issues/307).\r\n\r\nOur current plan is to have three previews before we ship RTM near the end of 2018:\r\n\r\n- August – Preview 1\r\n- September - Preview 2\r\n- October - Preview 3\r\n- Before end-of-year – RTM\r\n\r\n As usual, this post reflects our current plan, but things may change as we make progress. \r\n\r\n## New features\r\n\r\n### Reverse engineering of database views into query types (This feature was postponed. See update at https://github.com/aspnet/Announcements/issues/308#issuecomment-432395781)\r\n\r\nIn EF Core 2.1 we added query types, which allow mapping .NET objects to views and tables without keys. In 2.2, we plan to leverage this new capability to automatically map existing database views to query types. \r\n\r\nYou can track the progress of this at https://github.com/aspnet/EntityFrameworkCore/issues/1679.\r\n\r\n###  Support for collections of owned entities\r\n\r\nIn EF Core 2.0 we added the concept of owned entity types, which allows modeling ownership relationship that are common between entities that are part of the same document in document-oriented databases or the same aggregate if you use Domain-Driven Design concepts in your model.\r\n\r\nUntil now, we only support reference navigation properties to owned entities. In EF Core 2.2, we plan to enhance this functionality to map collection navigation properties to owned entities. \r\n\r\nYou can track the progress of this at https://github.com/aspnet/EntityFrameworkCore/issues/8172.\r\n\r\n## Other work\r\n\r\nThere are some additional work items that are not strictly EF Core 2.2 features, but we still track as part of the 2.2 milestone because we are doing the work in the same timeframe:\r\n\r\n### Cosmos DB provider\r\n\r\nA lot of our efforts are going into productizing an EF Core provider for the SQL API in Cosmos DB.\r\nWe have already created a prototype, which we have shown in demos such as in this [this EF Core 2.1 talk](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k55kDH_ixrQ) we did at the Microsoft Build conference.\r\n\r\nDue to competing priorities, releasing a preview of this provider has taken more than what we originally planned, but we are working on it now, and the current plan is to release a stable version by the end of this calendar year.\r\n\r\nYou can track our progress on this issue: https://github.com/aspnet/EntityFrameworkCore/issues/12086. \r\n\r\n### Preview of spatial support for SQL Server\r\n\r\nWe are also focusing on adding spatial support as an extension to the SQL Server provider for EF Core.\r\nNote that the PostgreSQL provider (Npgsql) already added support in EF Core 2.1. Beside implementing this functionality for SQL Server, we are working closely with the developers of Npgsql to try to achieve a consistent and hopefully improved experience across providers.\r\n\r\nNote that we aren't committing to having a final version of the spatial support for the end of the current calendar year. But we are actively working on this now, and as we make progress, we should be able to provide a more precise estimate.   \r\n\r\nYou can track our progress on this issue: https://github.com/aspnet/EntityFrameworkCore/issues/1100.\r\n\r\n### Improve test coverage for LINQ and reduce query regressions in future releases\r\n\r\nIn the last few releases, we have seen that when we commit improvements to our LINQ implementation, we often break queries that were previously working. The main challenge is that LINQ defines a huge space of possible queries to test, and it is very complex to measure what level of test coverage we have, even for a specific query operator. In the 2.2 timeframe, we will be investing on improving test coverage for this huge space. We also plan to experiment with new approaches to add appropriate coverage, and to reduce the likelihood of introducing regressions in future releases.\r\n\r\nYou can track our progress on this at https://github.com/aspnet/EntityFrameworkCore/issues/12046. \r\n\r\nFor discussion on this roadmap, please use https://github.com/aspnet/EntityFrameworkCore/issues/12465. ","Url":"https://github.com/aspnet/Announcements/issues/308","RelatedDescription":"Open issue \"EF Core 2.2 Roadmap\" (#308)"},{"Id":"335571873","IsPullRequest":false,"CreatedAt":"2018-06-25T21:19:36","Actor":"glennc","Number":"307","RawContent":null,"Title":"ASP.NET Core 2.2 Roadmap","State":"open","Body":"We have grouped the ASP.NET Core 2.2 release into a few themes:\r\n\r\n- APIs & Services\r\n- Server improvements\r\n- SignalR\r\n\r\n## Rough Schedule\r\nWe are currently planning to have 3 previews before RTM:\r\n - August – Preview 1\r\n - September - Preview 2\r\n - October - Preview 3\r\n - Before End-of-year – RTM\r\n\r\nAs with our previous roadmap posts this is what we intend right now, but it's subject to change as we continue development.\r\n\r\n## APIs and Services\r\n\r\nThe 'north star' for this version is to generate better metadata about your app and use that data to make your dev experience better and more productive. This is the main focus for 2.2.\r\n\r\n### API Controller conventions\r\nIn 2.1 we added controller specific conventions that make Web API development more convenient with the [ApiController attribute](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/aspnet/core/web-api/index?view=aspnetcore-2.1#annotate-class-with-apicontrollerattribute). In 2.2 we want to expand on this concept to provide metadata for API Explorer and provide a better end-to-end API documentation experience.\r\n\r\nWe want to make it possible for all MVC Core applications to have a good Swagger/OpenAPI definition by default. By following common patterns, your actions will produce rich metadata without falling into 'attribute soup' where you list every possible status code that every action in your app could return. We will include a default set of conventions that match what ASP.NET Core scaffolding generations. It will also be possible to write and share your own conventions to reflect your desired contracts. \r\n\r\nWe will include a set of analyzers that will help you find cases where code that doesn't match the API Explorer metadata, and a code-fix that provides options to explicitly specify the response type metadata, create a new convention with a different pattern, or just let you write code to satisfy the convention.\r\n\r\nAs a concrete example, you could write a convention that says \"every action method that starts with 'Create' will return an HTTP 201\". If you wrote the following code, then you would receive a warning.\r\n\r\n```csharp\r\n[HttpPost(\"/orders\")]\r\npublic ActionResult<Order> CreateOrder(OrderData orderData)\r\n{\r\n    ....\r\n    return Ok(new Order() {...});\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nThis code doesn't match your Swagger/OpenAPI metadata (from the convention) - which says that this action returns a 201. Once you see this, you could `ctrl + .` to add the attributes for what we do know about this method, opting out of conventions, or you could change the code.\r\n\r\nThe analyzer will also be able to 'check your work' if you are being explicit about status codes and results using the existing attributes - it does not require you to use the conventions. Details for how this will all work can be discussed here: https://github.com/aspnet/Mvc/issues/7802\r\n\r\nLet's look at a more fleshed-out out example. The following code snippet is what is required to generate a reasonable Open API document for an action method that will get an item by ID or return a 404:\r\n\r\n```csharp\r\n[ApiController]\r\npublic class CatalogController : ControllerBase\r\n{\r\n    [HttpGet]\r\n    [Route(\"items/{id:int}\")]\r\n    [ProducesResponseType((int)HttpStatusCode.NotFound)]\r\n    [ProducesResponseType(typeof(CatalogItem),(int)HttpStatusCode.OK)]\r\n    public async Task<ActionResult<CatalogItem>> GetItemById(int id)\r\n    {\r\n    }\r\n    ...\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nIn 2.2 with the default conventions the following code should generate the same Open API document that the above code sample does, and this shipped analyzers will give you hints when you do something that doesn't match so you know to go and add attributes or change the conventions:\r\n\r\n```csharp\r\n[ApiController]\r\npublic class CatalogController : ControllerBase\r\n{\r\n    [HttpGet]\r\n    [Route(\"items/{id:int}\")]\r\n    public async Task<ActionResult<CatalogItem>> GetItemById(int id)\r\n    {\r\n    }\r\n    ...\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\n### OpenAPI generation\r\nWith the conventions described above it will be possible for code that uses the API Explorer to generate Open API documents to be better by default, since the code you write will either follow the conventions or have attributes allowing generators to create better documents.\r\n\r\n### Dispatcher\r\nIn 2.2 we will introduce a new routing system that will expand the set of scenarios where routing is useful – tentatively called Dispatcher. \r\n\r\nThe current routing system was designed to support MVC’s historical scenarios without much thought to how routing and the composable middleware pipeline will work together. The Dispatcher is designed to run the URL matching step very early in the pipeline so that middleware can see the Endpoint that was selected as well as metadata that is associated with that endpoint. Like existing routing, the dispatcher will branch and call the actual endpoint at the end of the pipeline.\r\n\r\nA concrete example of how this helps us is with CORS. Today there is both a CORS middleware AND a CORS feature of MVC (https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/aspnet/core/security/cors?view=aspnetcore-2.1). Because routing information is deeply integrated with MVC we can't apply CORS policies that only apply to specific controllers until after we know what controller has been selected. However, if you also want CORS policies to apply to other parts of your pipeline then you need the middleware. This has been a source of confusion for many and we can simplify it if all of the middleware pipeline can have as much information about routing as MVC does today.\r\n\r\nWe’re also using this opportunity to make improvements to the performance of routing and dispatching for MVC and other scenarios.\r\n\r\n### HTTP API REPL tooling\r\nToday there are no tools built into Visual Studio or the dotnet CLI to help you execute HTTP verbs against your API. We have a great language, debugger, and framework but they are somewhat limited when it's difficult to send a POST to my app to see what happens. In 2.2 we want to build a CLI experience for exploring HTTP APIs to imcrease your API inner loop productivity. The CLI builds on all the features we've talked about above as some of its advanced features, like listing all routes in your app, are enabled by consuming the metadata we have about your app via Open API documents. That means the CLI should be useful for executing any HTTP verb, but really shines when you feed it more data like Open API docs. We intend to start by shipping this as a standalone global tool while we explore its feature set and potential.\r\n\r\nYou can see a demo and description of this in Scott Hunter and Scott Hanselman's BUILD talk here: https://youtu.be/KAIJ3ezQb3c?t=18m\r\n\r\n### API client generation (C# & TypeScript)\r\nOnce you have an API with rich metadata and done exploring and testing it, then you need to go and write some client code to call and make use of your API. We are going to build an experience for generating this code based on the same data and documentation described above. We envision a few pieces for this story, one part is a dotnet tool that can generate code from an Open API document, the other is MSBuild SDK work to allow a `ServiceReference` to another project in a solution. That reference will cause build time client code generation to happen via the tool that can generate code. We expect this to work in a similar way to the EF Core tooling experience, where your application is built and most of your startup code executed but instead of running it we use the data we have about your code to generate a client.\r\n\r\n### Authorization Server\r\nOne of the largest gaps we’ve had has been around authorization for applications beyond a simple forms based login. We plan to fill that gap with a simple to use OpenID Connect based authorization server, which will allow your ASP.NET application to act as an authentication point for your projects, be they web site to API, SPA to API, native application to an API or, for distributed applications API to API. As we are concentrating on first party applications we can make the code you need to plumb in trivial, getting as close to zero configuration as you can,  we’re not aiming to replace the excellent third-party solutions out there which enable richer scenarios like third-party applications or which provide a flexibility in configuration and authentication flow.\r\n\r\n## Server Improvements\r\n\r\n### Health Checks\r\nThis feature is a way to trivially setup an endpoint in your application that can be used to check the health of your application, potentially taking into account things like memory consumption or database availability as well as just \"can I accept a HTTP request\".\r\n\r\n### HTTP/2 in Kestrel & HttpClient\r\nThe title says it all in this case. HTTP/2 support for all. We started this work some time ago, and have had the protocol mostly implemented for a while but not compiled into the product since it wasn't ready. This version we will finish that work and implement the missing features.\r\n\r\n### In-proc ANCM\r\nRunning ASP.NET Core applications in-process in IIS, giving a significant performance boost.\r\n\r\n## SignalR\r\n\r\n### Add Java & C++ clients\r\nAllow customers using Java or C++ to connect to SignalR servers, and the [Azure SignalR Service](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/blog/azure-signalr-service-a-fully-managed-service-to-add-real-time-functionality/).\r\n\r\n## Other\r\nAs with all releases there is a large tail of bug fixes, performance improvements, small features, and community PRs that we will also work on. You can see the full list of work by browsing the 2.2 milestones on the various [repositories](https://github.com/aspnet/).\r\n\r\nFor discussion on the roadmap in general, use https://github.com/aspnet/Home/issues/3265","Url":"https://github.com/aspnet/Announcements/issues/307","RelatedDescription":"Open issue \"ASP.NET Core 2.2 Roadmap\" (#307)"},{"Id":"333804954","IsPullRequest":false,"CreatedAt":"2018-06-19T19:21:13","Actor":"anurse","Number":"306","RawContent":null,"Title":"SignalR Client 2.1.1 in UWP apps with Minimum Version of 1803","State":"open","Body":"ASP.NET Core 2.1.1 contains fixes to resolve blocking issues when using the SignalR Client from UWP applications where the minimum version is set to \"Windows 10, version 1803\".

Direct dependencies are dependencies where you specifically add a package to your project, transitive dependencies occur when you add a package to your project that in turn relies on another package.\r\n\r\nFor example, the `Microsoft.AspNetCore.Mvc` package depends on the `Microsoft.AspNetCore.Mvc.Core` package. When you add a dependency on `Microsoft.AspNetCore.Mvc` in your project, you're taking a transitive dependency on `Microsoft.AspNetCore.Mvc.Core`.\r\n\r\nAny application that has a direct or transitive dependency on the [affected packages](#affected-software) can be exposed to the vulnerability.\r\n\r\n### How do I fix the issue?\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\nIf you're targeting .NET Core 2.x and the `Microsoft.AspNetCore.All` \"metapackage\":\r\n\r\n* Update its version number to 2.0.8 if you have targetted 2.0.x *OR*\r\n* Update its version number to 2.1.0-rc1-final if you have targetted previews of 2.1\r\n\r\nUpdating the metapackage will update the [affected packages](#affected-software)\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n.NET Core projects have two types of dependencies: direct and transitive. You must update your projects using the following instructions to address both types of dependency.\r\n\r\n#### Direct dependencies\r\n\r\nDirect dependencies are discoverable by examining your *csproj* file. They can be fixed by [editing the csproj file](#direct-dependencies) or using NuGet to update the dependency.\r\n\r\n#### Transitive dependencies\r\n\r\nTransitive dependencies occur when you add a package to your project that in turn relies on another package. For example, if Contoso publishes a package `Contoso.Utility` which, in turn, depends on `Contoso.Internals` and you add the `Contoso.Utility` package to your project now your project has a direct dependency on `Contoso.Utility` and, because `Contoso.Utility` depends 'Contoso.Internals', your application gains a transitive dependency on the `Contoso.Internals` package.\r\n\r\nTransitive dependencies are reviewable in two ways:\r\n\r\n* In the Visual Studio Solution Explorer window, which supports searching.\r\n* By examining the *project.assets.json* file contained in the obj directory of your project.\r\n\r\nThe *project.assets.json* files are the authoritative list of all packages used by your project, containing both direct and transitive dependencies.\r\n\r\n#### <a name=\"direct-dependencies\"></a>Fixing direct dependencies\r\n\r\nOpen *projectname.csproj* in your editor. If you're using Visual Studio, right-click the project and choose **Edit projectname.csproj** from the context menu, where projectname is the name of your project. Look for `PackageReference` elements. The following shows an example project file:\r\n\r\n```xml\r\n<Project Sdk=\"Microsoft.NET.Sdk\">\r\n  <PropertyGroup>\r\n    <TargetFramework>netcoreapp2.0</TargetFramework>\r\n  </PropertyGroup>\r\n  <ItemGroup>\r\n    <PackageReference Include=\"Microsoft.AspNetCore.Server.Kestrel.Core\" Version=\"2.0.1\" />\r\n  </ItemGroup>\r\n</Project>\r\n```\r\n\r\nThe preceding example has a reference to a [vulnerable package](#affected-software), as seen by the single `PackageReference` element. The name of the package is in the `Include` attribute.\r\nThe package version number is in the `Version` attribute. The previous example shows a single direct dependency on `Microsoft.AspNetCore.Server.Kestrel.Core` version 2.0.1.\r\n\r\nTo update the version to the secure package, change the version number to the updated package version as listed on the table [previously](#affected-software).\r\nIn this example, update `Microsoft.AspNetCore.Server.Kestrel.Core` to a [fixed package number](#affected-software). Save the *csproj* file. The example *csproj* now looks as follows:\r\n\r\n```xml\r\n<Project Sdk=\"Microsoft.NET.Sdk\">\r\n  <PropertyGroup>\r\n    <TargetFramework>netcoreapp2.0</TargetFramework>\r\n  </PropertyGroup>\r\n  <ItemGroup>\r\n    <PackageReference Include=\"Microsoft.AspNetCore.Server.Kestrel.Core\" Version=\"2.0.3 />\r\n  </ItemGroup>\r\n</Project>\r\n```\r\n\r\nIf you're using Visual Studio and you save your updated *csproj* file, Visual Studio will restore the new package version.\r\nYou can see the restore results by opening the **Output** window (Ctrl+Alt+O) and changing the **Show output from** drop-down list to **Package Manager**.\r\n\r\nIf you're not using Visual Studio, open a command line and change to your project directory. Execute the `dotnet restore` command to restore the updated dependencies.\r\n\r\nNow recompile your application. If after recompilation you see a *Dependency conflict warning*, you must update your other direct dependencies to versions that take a dependency on the updated package.\r\n\r\nAfter you've addressed all of your direct dependencies, you must review your transitive dependencies.\r\n\r\n#### Discovering and fixing transitive dependencies\r\n\r\nThere are two ways to view transitive dependencies. You can either [use Visual Studio’s Solution Explorer](#vs-solution-explorer), or you can [review the *project.assets.json* file](#project-assets-json).\r\n\r\n##### <a name=\"vs-solution-explorer\"></a>Using Visual Studio Solution Explorer\r\n\r\nTo use Solution Explorer, open the project in Visual Studio 2017, and then press Ctrl+; to activate the search in Solution Explorer. Search for each of the [vulnerable packages](#affected-software) and make a note of the version numbers of any results you find.\r\n\r\nFor example, searching for `Microsoft.AspNetCore.Mvc.Core` in an example project that contains a package that takes a dependency on `Microsoft.AspNetCore.Mvc` shows the following results in Visual Studio 2017:\r\n\r\n![Screenshot of search results in Visual Studio 2017](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/796298/25858816/8ecdc2b4-3491-11e7-9363-746804bb9832.png)\r\n\r\nThe search results appear as a tree. In the previous results, you can see that a reference to `Microsoft.AspNetCore.Mvc.Core` version 1.1.2 is discovered.\r\n\r\nUnder the Dependencies node is a NuGet node. Under the NuGet node is the list of packages you have directly taken a dependency on and their versions.\r\nIn screenshot, the application takes a direct dependency on `Microsoft.AspNetCore.Mvc`. `Microsoft.AspNetCore.Mvc` in turn has leaf nodes that list its dependencies and their versions.\r\nThe `Microsoft.AspNetCore.Mvc` package takes a dependency on a version of `Microsoft.AspNetCore.Mvc.ApiExplorer`, that in turn takes a dependency on a version of `Microsoft.AspNetCore.Mvc.Core`.\r\n\r\n##### <a name=\"project-assets-json\"></a>Manually reviewing project.assets.json\r\n\r\nOpen the *project.assets.json* file from your project’s obj directory in your editor. We suggest you use an editor that understands JSON and allows you to collapse and expand nodes to review this file.\r\nVisual Studio and Visual Studio Code provide JSON friendly editing.\r\n\r\nSearch the *project.assets.json* file for the [vulnerable package](#affected-software), using the format `packagename/` for each of the package names from the preceding table. If you find the assembly name in your search:\r\n\r\n* Examine the line on which they are found, the version number is after the `/`.\r\n* Compare to the [vulnerable versions table](#affected-software).\r\n\r\nFor example, a search result that shows `System.Security.Cryptography.Xml/4.4.0` is a reference to version 4.4.0 of `System.Security.Cryptography.Xml`.\r\nIf your *project.assets.json* file includes references to the [vulnerable package](#affected-software), then you need to fix the transitive dependencies.\r\n\r\n##### Fixing transitive dependencies\r\n\r\nIf you have not found any reference to any vulnerable packages, this means either\r\n\r\n* None of your direct dependencies depend on any vulnerable packages, or\r\n* You have already fixed the problem by updating the direct dependencies.\r\n\r\nIf your transitive dependency review found references to the [vulnerable package](#affected-software), you must add a direct dependency to the updated package to your *csproj* file to override the transitive dependency.\r\n\r\nOpen *projectname.csproj* in your editor. If you're using Visual Studio, right-click the project and choose **Edit projectname.csproj** from the context menu, where projectname is the name of your project.\r\nLook for `PackageReference` nodes, for example:\r\n\r\n```xml\r\n<Project Sdk=\"Microsoft.NET.Sdk.\">\r\n  <PropertyGroup>\r\n    <TargetFramework>net461</TargetFramework>\r\n  </PropertyGroup>\r\n  <ItemGroup>\r\n    <PackageReference Include=\"ThirdParty.NotUpdatedYet\" Version=\"2.0.0\" />\r\n  </ItemGroup>\r\n</Project>\r\n```\r\n\r\nYou must add a direct dependency to the updated version of the [vulnerable package](#affected-software) by adding it to the *csproj* file.\r\nYou do this by adding a new line to the dependencies section, referencing the fixed version.\r\nFor example, if your search showed a transitive reference to a vulnerable `Microsoft.AspNetCore.Server.Kestrel.Core` version, you'd add a reference to the [fixed package number](#affected-software).\r\n\r\n```xml\r\n<Project Sdk=\"Microsoft.NET.Sdk.Web\">\r\n  <PropertyGroup>\r\n    <TargetFramework>net461</TargetFramework>\r\n  </PropertyGroup>\r\n  <ItemGroup>\r\n    <PackageReference Include=\"Microsoft.AspNetCore.Server.Kestrel.Core\" Version=\"2.0.3\" />\r\n    <PackageReference Include=\"ThirdParty.NotUpdatedYet\" Version=\"2.0.0\" />\r\n  </ItemGroup>\r\n</Project>\r\n```\r\n\r\nAfter you've added the direct dependency reference, save your *csproj* file.\r\n\r\nIf you're using Visual Studio, save your updated *csproj* file and Visual Studio will restore the new package versions.\r\nYou can see the restore results by opening the **Output** window (Ctrl+Alt+O) and changing the **Show output from** drop-down list to **Package Manager**.\r\n\r\nIf you're not using Visual Studio, open a command line and change to your project directory. Execute the `dotnet restore` command to restore the new dependencies.\r\n\r\n#### Rebuilding your application\r\n\r\nFinally you must rebuild your application, test, and redeploy.\r\n\r\n## Other Information\r\n\r\n### Reporting Security Issues\r\n\r\nIf you have found a potential security issue in .NET Core, please email details to secure@microsoft.com.
