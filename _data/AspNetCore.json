I've even tried setting the default scheme to JWT and then setting the authorization scheme of each method back to Cookie based, but it doesn't seem to be working with any consistency and breaks my entire login mechanism for the website when I do that.\r\n\r\nThis is an extremely frustrating issue - there are seven billion different articles addressing different approaches and no unified explanation for how it should be handled. I think it should be common sense that someone would scaffold an application using Identity, then need to add a mobile application to the application stack as the business scales.\r\n\r\nI'm really regretting choosing ASP.Net Core for development  because of this. Any suggestions for how to fix this, or to allow mobile app authentication in conjunction with ASP.Net Core Identity would be much appreciated.","Url":"https://github.com/aspnet/AspNetCore/issues/12842","RelatedDescription":"Closed issue \"ASP.Net Core Application Redirects to Cookie-based Login with JWT Authentication in Header\" (#12842)"},{"Id":"476154356","IsPullRequest":false,"CreatedAt":"2019-08-03T00:24:43","Actor":"javiercn","Number":"12831","RawContent":null,"Title":"[Blazor] Broken E2E tests","State":"closed","Body":"Seems like there are a bunch of broken E2E tests in components.

It involves a bit of trickery, but it works.

So i am going to put it here in hopes of getting an answer.\r\n\r\nThe issue is the understanding of how remember me is supposed to work.    My problem is that its not doing what we would expect it to do.   \r\n\r\nManagement expects when a user logs in and clicks remember me that they will then not be required to type their login and password again for a month.  Whether or not they will still have to type in the 2fa code is up for debate.\r\n\r\nWhat is actually happening is that i can close the browser reboot and come back for about an hour and 15 minutes and then i will be forced to type my password again.    This still happens even with a valid `.AspNetCore.Identity.Application` cookie set that is not due to expire for another month.\r\n\r\nAfter digging around in the code i found that Remember me is actually isPersistent and it is defined as.\r\n\r\n>Flag indicating whether the sign-in cookie should persist after the browser is closed.\r\n\r\nWhich brings you to:\r\n\r\nThere are two different types of Cookies:\r\n\r\n- session cookies, held in memory, and which expire once the browser exits\r\n- persistent cookies, which have a time-to-live, are persisted on disk, and are sent by the browser until their time-to-live has elapsed.\r\n\r\nAll this being said remember machine 2fa works as expected i am not prompted again for the 2fa and i have a cookie on my machine `Identity.TwoFactorRememberMe`.\r\n\r\nSo I guess my question is why are we not getting a `Identity.FactorRememberMe` or why isn't sign in respecting a long life time of the `AspNetCore.Identity.Application` cookie?\r\n\r\nHow is this supposed to work exactly?

(Exception from HRESULT: 0x80131040)`\r\n\r\nWhen I checked logs on bamboo when it generates the artifacts, I can see that initially it copied the correct dll here:\r\n\r\n`build    04-Apr-2019 03:20:33      Copying file from \"E:\\agt01\\ENS-EB580-JOB1\\Bin\\Packages\\System.Collections.Immutable.1.5.0\\lib\\netstandard1.0\\System.Collections.Immutable.dll\" to \"E:\\agt01\\ENS-EB580-JOB1\\Binaries\\Release\\\\temp\\Web\\_PublishedWebsites\\MyService\\bin\\System.Collections.Immutable.dll\"`.\r\n\r\nbut then at some point, it replaced this dll with this: `build    04-Apr-2019 03:20:33      Copying file from \"E:\\agt01\\ENS-EB580-JOB1\\Bin\\Packages\\Microsoft.Net.Compilers.1.0.0\\tools\\System.Collections.Immutable.dll\" to \"E:\\agt01\\ENS-EB580-JOB1\\Binaries\\Release\\\\temp\\Web\\_PublishedWebsites\\MyService\\bin\\System.Collections.Immutable.dll\".`\r\n\r\nHow can I make sure that bamboo does not replace this dll and just uses it from the nuget package installed?","Url":"https://github.com/aspnet/Tooling/issues/1086","RelatedDescription":"Closed issue \"System.Collections.Immutable dll being replace by Microsoft.Net.Compilers\" (#1086)"},{"Id":"422330835","IsPullRequest":false,"CreatedAt":"2019-03-18T17:00:12","Actor":"vikasNew","Number":"1085","RawContent":null,"Title":"web deploy on windows 10","State":"open","Body":"Hello,\r\n\r\ncan i publish my code by using web deploy to windows 10 machine.\r\n\r\ni have setup my testing windows 10 machine for deployment, which is in local area network.\r\n\r\nSo i want to publish my code to that remote machine by using web deploy. can i do that ?\r\n\r\ni have installed web deploy and also enabled web development remote service on windows 10 but i am not able to connect to remote machine using we deploy.\r\n\r\nThis returns me the following error every-time.\r\n\"ERROR_DESTINATION_NOT_REACHABLE\"\r\n\r\ninteresting thing is i also have windows 10 on my machine & i am able to use web deploy on my local machine but it's not working with remote windows 10 machine.\r\n\r\nis web deploy only meant for Windows servers not for other normal windows?\r\n\r\nThanks \r\n","Url":"https://github.com/aspnet/Tooling/issues/1085","RelatedDescription":"Open issue \"web deploy on windows 10\" (#1085)"},{"Id":"398036850","IsPullRequest":false,"CreatedAt":"2019-01-15T05:32:59","Actor":"chrgraefe","Number":"1084","RawContent":null,"Title":"Can't add area on ASP.NET Core MVC project","State":"closed","Body":"### Describe the bug\r\nA clear and concise description of what the bug is.\r\n\r\n### To Reproduce\r\nSteps to reproduce the behavior:\r\n1.

VS 2019 is about to be released in around early 2019\r\n2. ASP.NET Core 1.0/1.1 is not going to be supported anymore, based on [this page](https://github.com/dotnet/core/blob/master/microsoft-support.md).\r\n3. Creating new ASP.NET Core 1.0/1.1 will always install the .NET Core 1.0/1.1 web tooling, and this is not necessary when previous reason has reached the unsupported period and it's quite near or might be the same time of VS 2019 release.\r\n4. Based on the problem mentioned above, VS 2017 has no \"built in\" tooling when creating new ASP.NET Core 1.0/1.1 project, but the external tooling may help. Therefore for those that still need to maintain ASP.NET Core 1.0/1.1 projects, we could use VS 2017 as long as the VS 2017 is still in support lifecycle or in mainstream support lifecycle.\r\n\r\nI welcome feedback 🙂 \r\n\r\n","Url":"https://github.com/aspnet/Tooling/issues/1078","RelatedDescription":"Closed issue \"Feedback: ensure that .NET Core 1.0/1.1 tooling only supported in VS 2017 and

Now that we've permanently branched for 3.0, we can accept a much broader set of changes. Please consider that to be an open invitation!\r\n\r\nAt present, there is no SDK or developer experience for 5.0. Switching your project file to target `netcoreapp5.0` won't do anything useful.

If you're using HttpResponse directly you should not need to make any code changes. Read further if you were wrapping or replacing HttpResponse.Body or accessing HttpContext.Features.\r\n\r\nVersion: 3.0.0-preview8\r\n\r\nBackground:\r\nHttpContext, HttpRequest, HttpResponse are backed by an abstraction called [Features](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/aspnet/core/fundamentals/request-features?view=aspnetcore-2.2). This allows functionality to be provided by different components in the pipeline without wrapping the entire HttpContext.\r\n\r\nIn 2.x there are three APIs associated with the response body: IHttpResponseFeature.Body, IHttpSendFileFeature.SendFileAsync, and IHttpBufferingFeature.DisableResponseBuffering, but the later two were rarely implemented or used.\r\n\r\nOver the course of 3.0 several new response body APIs were added:\r\nIHttpResponseBodyPipeFeature\r\nIHttpResponseStartFeature.StartAsync\r\nIHttpResponseCompleteFeature.CompleteAsync\r\n\r\nProblem: With so many APIs it became too hard for middleware to properly intercept the response body. It was also hard for calling code to rely on those features being present on all servers.\r\n\r\nFix: Consolidate the response body APIs onto a single new feature interface [IHttpResponseBodyFeature](https://github.com/aspnet/AspNetCore/blob/4aebd29abca80242f5ff9e89e07d4f1b28788a44/src/Http/Http.Features/src/IHttpResponseBodyFeature.cs). HttpResponse has been updated accordingly, and each server has been updated to provide at least a minimal implementation for all of these APIs. We'll iterate to provide more fully featured implementations in each server but that won't require any more API changes.\r\n\r\nNote if you replace HttpResponse.Body it will now replace the entire IHttpResponseBodyFeature with a wrapper around your given stream using StreamResponseBodyFeature to provide default implementations for all of the expected APIs.

If you are not using `Microsoft.AspNetCore.SignalR.Protocols.MessagePack` directly you may still be affected if you are using SignalR and the package is a transitive dependency.\r\n\r\n#### Direct dependencies\r\n\r\nDirect dependencies are discoverable by examining your `csproj` file. They can be fixed by [editing the project file](#fixing-direct-dependencies) or using NuGet to update the dependency.\r\n\r\n#### Transitive dependencies\r\n\r\nTransitive dependencies occur when you add a package to your project that in turn relies on another package. For example, if Contoso publishes a package `Contoso.Utility` which, in turn, depends on `Contoso.Internals` and you add the `Contoso.Utility` package to your project now your project has a direct dependency on `Contoso.Utility` and, because `Contoso.Utility` depends 'Contoso.Internals', your application gains a transitive dependency on the `Contoso.Internals` package.\r\n\r\nTransitive dependencies are reviewable in two ways:\r\n\r\n* In the Visual Studio Solution Explorer window, which supports searching.\r\n* By examining the `project.assets.json` file contained in the obj directory of your project for `csproj` based projects\r\n\r\nThe `project.assets.json` files are the authoritative list of all packages used by your project, containing both direct and transitive dependencies.\r\n\r\nThere are two ways to view transitive dependencies. You can either [use Visual Studio’s Solution Explorer](#vs-solution-explorer), or you can review [the `project.assets.json` file](#project-assets-json)).\r\n\r\n##### <a name=\"vs-solution-explorer\"></a>Using Visual Studio Solution Explorer\r\n\r\nTo use Solution Explorer, open the project in Visual Studio, and then press Ctrl+; to activate the search in Solution Explorer. Search for the [vulnerable package](#affected-software) and make a note of the version numbers of any results you find.\r\n\r\nFor example, searching for `Microsoft.AspNetCore.Mvc.Core` in an example project that contains a package that takes a dependency on `Microsoft.AspNetCore.Mvc` shows the following results in Visual Studio 2017:\r\n\r\n![Screenshot of search results in Visual Studio 2017](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/796298/25858816/8ecdc2b4-3491-11e7-9363-746804bb9832.png)\r\n\r\nThe search results appear as a tree. In the previous results, you can see that a reference to `Microsoft.AspNetCore.Mvc.Core` version 1.1.2 is discovered.\r\n\r\nUnder the Dependencies node is a NuGet node. Under the NuGet node is the list of packages you have directly taken a dependency on and their versions.\r\nIn screenshot, the application takes a direct dependency on `Microsoft.AspNetCore.Mvc`. `Microsoft.AspNetCore.Mvc` in turn has leaf nodes that list its dependencies and their versions.\r\nThe `Microsoft.AspNetCore.Mvc` package takes a dependency on a version of `Microsoft.AspNetCore.Mvc.ApiExplorer`, that in turn takes a dependency on a version of `Microsoft.AspNetCore.Mvc.Core`.\r\n\r\n##### <a name=\"project-assets-json\"></a> Manually reviewing project.assets.json\r\n\r\nOpen the *project.assets.json* file from your project’s obj directory in your editor. We suggest you use an editor that understands JSON and allows you to collapse and expand nodes to review this file.\r\nVisual Studio and Visual Studio Code provide JSON friendly editing.\r\n\r\nSearch the *project.assets.json* file for the [vulnerable package](#affected-software), using the format `packagename/` for each of the package names from the preceding table. If you find the assembly name in your search:\r\n\r\n* Examine the line on which they are found, the version number is after the `/`.\r\n* Compare to the [vulnerable versions table](#affected-software).\r\n\r\nFor example, a search result that shows `System.IO.Pipelines/4.5.0` is a reference to version 4.5.0 of `System.IO.Pipelines`.\r\n\r\nIf your *project.assets.json* file includes references to the [vulnerable package](#affected-software), then you need to fix the transitive dependencies.\r\n\r\nIf you have not found any reference to any vulnerable packages, this means either\r\n\r\n* None of your direct dependencies depend on any vulnerable packages, or\r\n* You have already fixed the problem by updating the direct dependencies.\r\n\r\n### <a name=\"how-fix\"></a>How do I fix the issue?\r\n\r\n#### <a name=\"fixing-direct-dependencies\"></a>Fixing direct dependencies\r\n\r\nOpen *projectname.csproj* in your editor. If you're using Visual Studio, right-click the project and choose **Edit projectname.csproj** from the context menu, where projectname is the name of your project. Look for `PackageReference` elements. The following shows an example project file:\r\n\r\n```xml\r\n<Project Sdk=\"Microsoft.NET.Sdk.Web\">\r\n  <PropertyGroup>\r\n    <TargetFramework>netcoreapp2.1</TargetFramework>\r\n  </PropertyGroup>\r\n  <ItemGroup>\r\n    <PackageReference Include=\"Microsoft.AspNetCore.SignalR.Protocols.MessagePack\" Version=\"1.0.0\" />\r\n  </ItemGroup>\r\n</Project>\r\n```\r\n\r\nThe preceding example has a reference to the [vulnerable package](#affected-software), as seen by the single `PackageReference` element. The name of the package is in the `Include` attribute.\r\nThe package version number is in the `Version` attribute. The previous example shows a single direct dependency on `System.IO.Pipelines` version 4.5.0\r\n\r\nTo update the version to the secure package, change the version number to the updated package version as listed on the table [previously](#affected-software).\r\nIn this example, update `System.IO.Pipelines` to the appropriate [fixed package number](#affected-software) for your major version. Save the *csproj* file. The example *csproj* now looks as follows:\r\n\r\n```xml\r\n<Project Sdk=\"Microsoft.NET.Sdk.Web\">\r\n  <PropertyGroup>\r\n    <TargetFramework>netcoreapp2.1</TargetFramework>\r\n  </PropertyGroup>\r\n  <ItemGroup>\r\n    <PackageReference Include=\"Microsoft.AspNetCore.SignalR.Protocols.MessagePack\" Version=\"1.0.11\" />\r\n  </ItemGroup>\r\n</Project>\r\n```\r\n\r\nIf you're using Visual Studio and you save your updated *csproj* file, Visual Studio will restore the new package version.\r\nYou can see the restore results by opening the **Output** window (Ctrl+Alt+O) and changing the **Show output from** drop-down list to **Package Manager**.\r\n\r\nIf you're not using Visual Studio, open a command line and change to your project directory. Execute the `dotnet restore` command to restore the updated dependencies.\r\n\r\nNow recompile your application. If after recompilation you see a *Dependency conflict warning*, you must update your other direct dependencies to versions that take a dependency on the updated package.\r\n\r\n#### <a name=\"transitive-dependencies\"></a>Fixing transitive dependencies\r\n\r\nIf your transitive dependency review found references to the [vulnerable package](#affected-software), you must add a direct dependency to the updated package to your *csproj* file to override the transitive dependency.\r\n\r\nOpen *projectname.csproj* in your editor. If you're using Visual Studio, right-click the project and choose **Edit projectname.csproj** from the context menu, where projectname is the name of your project.\r\nLook for `PackageReference` nodes, for example:\r\n\r\n```xml\r\n<Project Sdk=\"Microsoft.NET.Sdk.\">\r\n  <PropertyGroup>\r\n    <TargetFramework>net461</TargetFramework>\r\n  </PropertyGroup>\r\n  <ItemGroup>\r\n    <PackageReference Include=\"ThirdParty.NotUpdatedYet\" Version=\"2.0.0\" />\r\n  </ItemGroup>\r\n</Project>\r\n```\r\n\r\nYou must add a direct dependency to the updated version of the [vulnerable package](#affected-software) by adding it to the *csproj* file.\r\nYou do this by adding a new line to the dependencies section, referencing the fixed version.\r\nFor example, if your search showed a transitive reference to a vulnerable `System.ServiceModel.Http` version, you'd add a reference to the [fixed package number](#affected-software).\r\n\r\n```xml\r\n<Project Sdk=\"Microsoft.NET.Sdk.Web\">\r\n  <PropertyGroup>\r\n    <TargetFramework>net461</TargetFramework>\r\n  </PropertyGroup>\r\n  <ItemGroup>\r\n    <PackageReference Include=\"Microsoft.AspNetCore.SignalR.Protocols.MessagePack\" Version=\"1.0.11\" />\r\n    <PackageReference Include=\"ThirdParty.NotUpdatedYet\" Version=\"2.0.0\" />\r\n  </ItemGroup>\r\n</Project>\r\n```\r\n\r\nAfter you've added the direct dependency reference, save your *csproj* file.\r\n\r\nIf you're using Visual Studio, save your updated *csproj* file and Visual Studio will restore the new package versions.\r\nYou can see the restore results by opening the **Output** window (Ctrl+Alt+O) and changing the **Show output from** drop-down list to **Package Manager**.\r\n\r\nIf you're not using Visual Studio, open a command line and change to your project directory. Execute the `dotnet restore` command to restore the new dependencies.\r\n\r\n##### Rebuilding your application\r\n\r\nFinally, you must rebuild your application, test, and redeploy.\r\n\r\n## Other Information\r\n\r\n### Reporting Security Issues\r\n\r\nIf you have found a potential security issue in .NET Core, please email details to secure@microsoft.com.

This affects routing and link generation.\r\n\r\nConsider\r\n```C#\r\npublic class ProductController : Controller\r\n{\r\n    public async IActionResult ListAsync()\r\n    {\r\n        var model = await DbContext.Products.ToListAsync();\r\n        return View(model);\r\n    }\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nPrior to 3.0, the action will be routeable via `Product/ListAsync`. Link generation would require specifying the `Async` suffix e.g.\r\n\r\n`<a asp-controller=\"Product\" asp-action=\"ListAsync\">List</a>`\r\n\r\nIn 3.0, the action will be routeable via `Product/List` and link generation would require not specifying the `Async` suffix e.g.\r\n\r\n`<a asp-controller=\"Product\" asp-action=\"List\">List</a>`\r\n\r\nThis change does not affect names specified using the `ActionNameAttribute`. This behavior can be disabled by setting `MvcOptions.SuppressAsyncSuffixInActionNames` to `false` as part of the application startup:\r\n\r\n```C#\r\nservices.AddMvc(options =>\r\n{\r\n   options.SuppressAsyncSuffixInActionNames = false; \r\n});\r\n```\r\n","Url":"https://github.com/aspnet/Announcements/issues/351","RelatedDescription":"Open issue \"Async suffix for controller action names will be trimmed by default\" (#351)"},{"Id":"426009751","IsPullRequest":false,"CreatedAt":"2019-03-27T14:57:05","Actor":"scottaddie","Number":"350","RawContent":null,"Title":"For contributors: moved ASP.NET 4.x docs to new GitHub repo","State":"open","Body":"In an effort to reduce the GitHub repo size and to reduce docset build times, the [ASP.NET 4.x product documentation](https://docs.microsoft.com/aspnet/overview) has migrated from the [aspnet/Docs repo](https://github.com/aspnet/Docs) to the [aspnet/AspNetDocs repo](https://github.com/aspnet/AspNetDocs).\r\n\r\nTo continue making contributions to ASP.NET 4.x documentation, create a local clone of the aspnet/AspNetDocs repo.

Each component that emits cookies need to decide if SameSite is appropriate for their scenarios.
