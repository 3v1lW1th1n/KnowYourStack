For example, before this change, a build run under a user named \"Windows User\" would hit the following error:\r\n\r\n    'C:\\Users\\Windows' is not recognized as an internal or external\r\n    command, operable program or batch file.\r\n\r\n    C:\\source\\xamarin-android\\src\\sqlite-xamarin\\sqlite-xamarin.targets\r\n    (27,5): error MSB3073: The command \"\r\n        \"C:\\Users\\Windows User\\android-toolchain\\ndk\\ndk-build.cmd\"\r\n\r\n        SQLITE_SOURCE_DIR=\"C:\\source\\xamarin-android\\external\\sqlite\"\r\n\r\n        APP_ABI=\"armeabi-v7a x86\"\"\r\n    exited with code 1.\r\n\r\nAs a follow-up to the related conversation in https://github.com/xamarin/xamarin-android/pull/2075, I tried a few steps to resolve this issue.  Unfortunately, it turns out that the limitation goes beyond the `ndk-build.cmd` batch files.  Even if the build skipped those .cmd files and called `make.exe` directly, it would still fail because android-toolchain\\ndk\\build\\core\\build-local.mk and the other related `make` include files *also* assume the NDK path contains no spaces:\r\n\r\n    C:\\Users\\Windows User\\android-toolchain\\ndk\\build\\\\..\\build\\core\\\r\n    build-local.mk:48: User/android-toolchain/ndk/build//../build/core/\r\n    init.mk: No such file or directory\r\n\r\n    C:\\Users\\Windows User\\android-toolchain\\ndk\\build\\\\..\\build\\core\\\r\n    build-local.mk:199: /add-application.mk: No such file or directory\r\n\r\n    C:\\Users\\Windows User\\android-toolchain\\ndk\\build\\\\..\\build\\core\\\r\n    build-local.mk:213: /setup-imports.mk: No such file or directory\r\n\r\n    C:\\Users\\Windows User\\android-toolchain\\ndk\\build\\\\..\\build\\core\\\r\n    build-local.mk:213: /setup-imports.mk: No such file or directory\r\n\r\n    make: *** No rule to make target `/build-all.mk'.  Stop.\r\n\r\nIn fact, if you try to work around this issue with the .mk files by setting the working directory for `make.exe` to the NDK directory and using a relative rather than absolute path for build-local.mk, then the NDK outputs its own error explaining that spaces in the NDK path are not allowed:\r\n\r\n    Android NDK: Your Android application project path contains spaces:\r\n    'C:/Users User/android-toolchain'\r\n\r\n    build\\core\\build-local.mk:158: *** Android NDK: Aborting.    .
