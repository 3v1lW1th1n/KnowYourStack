It has a following dependency:\r\n`Owin (>= 1.0.0-prerelease && <= 1.0.0)`\r\n\r\nAnd everything worked fine and everyone was happy. Until one day, the Owin-team unlisted the prerelease-version of the package from NuGet. Now my users started to get build errors.\r\n\r\n1.0 is still there. Do you consider all pre-release versions are better than release versions?\r\n\r\nA repository to reproduce the issue is here:\r\nhttps://github.com/jomonson/OwinCompressionDependencyIssue\r\n\r\n\n\n---\n\n@joelverhagen commented on [Tue Sep 12 2017](https://github.com/NuGet/NuGetGallery/issues/4663#issuecomment-328885891)\n\nThanks for reporting this issue @Thorium. The available versions on nuget.org are 0.5.0, 0.7.0, 0.11.0, 0.12.0, 0.14.0, and 1.0.0. The 1.0.0 version of Owin is the only version that satisfies the version range in your Owin.Compression package. I am not familiar with a 1.0.0-prerelease version of the Owin package. Perhaps it was on some CI or secondary source like MyGet?\r\n\r\nConcerning the build failure, I was only able to reproduce a build warning in Visual Studio 2017:\r\n```\r\nwarning NU1603: Owin.Compression 1.0.16 depends on Owin (>= 1.0.0-prerelease && <= 1.0.0) but Owin 1.0.0-prerelease was not found. An approximate best match of Owin 1.0.0 was resolved.\r\n```\r\n\r\nThis warning is just saying that 1.0.0-prerelease was not found so 1.0.0 was used instead. NuGet prefers the lowest version in the dependency version range. Is it possible you have warnings as errors enabled?\r\n\r\nAs a side note, you can test version range compatibility using this tool:\r\nhttp://nugettoolsdev.azurewebsites.net/4.3.0-preview4/version-satisfies?versionRange=%5B1.0.0-prerelease%2C1.0.0%5D&version=1.0.0\r\n\n\n---\n\n@Thorium commented on [Tue Sep 12 2017](https://github.com/NuGet/NuGetGallery/issues/4663#issuecomment-329005118)\n\nMy customer says Owin.Compression 1.0.16 gives warning but 1.0.15 error, and it's the same dependency.\r\n\r\nI have not used CI or MyGet or any other sources than NuGet.org\r\n\r\nWhy the warning? So should I release a new package for every removed minimum dependency, saying \"no changes\" in the release notes?\n\n---\n\n@joelverhagen commented on [Tue Sep 12 2017](https://github.com/NuGet/NuGetGallery/issues/4663#issuecomment-329010617)\n\n> My customer says Owin.Compression 1.0.16 gives warning but 1.0.15 error, and it's the same dependency.\r\n\r\nI am not sure why this is happening and have been unable to reproduce the error. Do you have steps?\r\n\r\n> So should I release a new package for every removed minimum dependency, saying \"no changes\" in the release notes?\r\n\r\nYes, that's quite reasonable. \n\n---\n\n@Thorium commented on [Tue Sep 12 2017](https://github.com/NuGet/NuGetGallery/issues/4663#issuecomment-329018310)\n\n>> So should I release a new package for every removed minimum dependency, saying \"no changes\" in the release notes?\r\n\r\n> Yes, that's quite reasonable\r\n\r\nOk... How do package owners get notifications of minimum dependencies not being available anymore?\r\n\n\n---\n\n@joelverhagen commented on [Tue Sep 12 2017](https://github.com/NuGet/NuGetGallery/issues/4663#issuecomment-329019074)\n\nWe do not have a notification mechanism for package deletion since package deletions are a very rare case. Our package deletion policy is here:\r\nhttps://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/nuget/policies/deleting-packages\r\n\r\nGiven that 1.0.0 was published in 2012, I don't have any records of whether 1.0.0-prerelease ever existed at all on NuGet.org. \n\n---\n\n@forki commented on [Tue Sep 12 2017](https://github.com/NuGet/NuGetGallery/issues/4663#issuecomment-329049163)\n\n1.0.0 prerelease probably never existed but that's not the question here.\r\n\r\nThe range is >= 1.0.0-prerelease && <= 1.0.0 and there is a 1.0 of owin. 1.0 is clearly higher than any prerelease and definitely smaller or equal to 1.0. So this version clearly matches this range. Why is it even showing a warning (or crashes)? \n\n---\n\n@joelverhagen commented on [Tue Sep 12 2017](https://github.com/NuGet/NuGetGallery/issues/4663#issuecomment-329049674)\n\nAll great questions! Let's move this issue over to the NuGet client repository (https://github.com/NuGet/Home/issues) so that the client guys can give all the details.
