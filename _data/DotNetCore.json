VSEmbed hosts the editor with Roslyn's language services outside of Visual Studio and in a WPF Application.\r\n\r\nWhen I create the editor from a Console Application I receive a number of errors complaining that the `ForegroundNotificationService` can't be created by MEF and is failing here: http://source.roslyn.io/#Microsoft.CodeAnalysis.EditorFeatures/Implementation/ForegroundNotification/ForegroundNotificationService.cs,37\r\n\r\nIt looks like I have to initialize the `ForegroundThreadAffinitizedObject` as shown here: http://source.roslyn.io/#Roslyn.Services.Test.Utilities/Threading/WpfTestCase.cs,41\r\n\r\nCurrently I'm doing this via reflection as you can see here: https://github.com/AmadeusW/VSEmbed/blob/f0e8c97949bce770c7cf0564edebfb8a81df6717/PerformanceTests/BasicTypingTest.cs#L25-L38\r\n\r\nThis works, but it's obviously fragile.

issue \"Regression in 3.1.200 for dotnet test -t\" (#10926) at dotnet/sdk","RelatedBody":"Hello all. I seem to have stumbled upon a rather weird possible regression after I migrated from SDK 3.1.102 to 3.1.200.\r\n\r\n**Context**\r\nA few days ago I forked the VSCode extension [formulahendry/vscode-dotnet-test-explorer](https://github.com/formulahendry/vscode-dotnet-test-explorer) and started playing around with bringing it up to speed for Core SDK 3.1 and doing some other changes. For testing my changes, I was using the solution I work on at my job.\r\n\r\nThe extension first discovers possible test projects in a VSCode workspace and then executes `dotnet test -t -v=q [project]` against one project at a time. It waits until the execution terminates and reads the stdout in order to retrieve the list of tests. This list is further processed and displayed etc.\r\n\r\nWhile I was using the SDK 3.1.102, everything was working perfectly here. The command produced the list of tests every time without issues. However, after I updated to SDK 3.1.200, this started failing in more than 50% of executions (but not always).\r\n\r\n**The issue**\r\nIn SDK 3.1.200, the `dotnet test -t -v=q [project path]` terminates but it looks like the stdout is not properly flushed. The extension reads the stdout and only  gets as far as\r\n```\r\nTest run for [pathToDll](.NETCoreApp,Version=v3.1)\r\nMicrosoft (R) Test Execution Command Line Tool Version 16.5.0\r\nCopyright (c) Microsoft Corporation.  All rights reserved.\r\n\r\nThe following Tests are available:\r\n```\r\nAnd that's it. No tests are listed in the stdout (even though they are there, of course). If I run the same command from the command line, the output is complete (with tests), but there is an observable pause between outputting `The following Tests are available:` and the actual list of tests.\r\n\r\nTo verify the regression theory, I introduced a global.json and used it to fix a specific SDK version for the solution in question. The results are consistent - 3.1.102 works every time, 3.1.200 fails more often then not.\r\n\r\nSince the problem does not manifest every time, it feels like a possible race condition to me. If the `dotnet` process terminates too quickly, the stdout isn't flushed completely and whatever is in the buffer gets lost. But it's really just a theory.\r\n\r\n**The problematic code**\r\n``` ts\r\nfunction executeDotnetTest(testDirectoryPath: string, dotnetTestOptions: string): Promise<string> {\r\n    return new Promise((resolve, reject) => {\r\n        Logger.Log(`Executing dotnet test -t -v=q in ${testDirectoryPath}`);\r\n\r\n        let buffer = \"\";\r\n\r\n        const p = cp.spawn(\"dotnet\", [\"test\", \"-t\", \"-v=q\" ], { cwd: testDirectoryPath });\r\n        p.stdout.on(\"data\", (data) => buffer += data.toString());\r\n        p.on(\"close\", (code) => {\r\n            if (code !== 0) {\r\n                Logger.LogError(`Error while executing dotnet test -t -v=q`, code);\r\n\r\n                reject();\r\n            }\r\n\r\n            Logger.Log(buffer);\r\n\r\n            resolve(buffer);\r\n        });\r\n    });\r\n}\r\n```\r\nNow I'm not the greatest with Node.js but this should work and does work when using the older SDK. It spawns a new process with the necessary parameters, hooks to the stdout to build a buffer, then, when the process closes all its IO streams, logs the buffer and resolves the promise.\r\n\r\nMore details: the projects in question use xUnit for testing framework, but it also reproduces with MSTest.\r\n\r\n**Question**\r\nCan someone please try and clarify what's going on here? Or possibly offer a workaround?"},{"Id":"11813857966","Type":"PullRequestEvent","CreatedAt":"2020-03-19T23:41:34","Actor":"dotnet-maestro[bot]","Repository":"dotnet/sdk","Organization":"dotnet","RawContent":null,"RelatedAction":"merged","RelatedUrl":"https://github.com/dotnet/sdk/pull/10924","RelatedDescription":"Merged pull request \"[master] Update dependencies from dotnet/aspnetcore\" (#10924) at dotnet/sdk","RelatedBody":"This pull request updates the following dependencies\r\n\r\n[marker]: <> (Begin:c0c2be01-34a3-46d9-31fe-08d7a4f3bc87)\r\n## From https://github.com/dotnet/aspnetcore\r\n- **Subscription**: c0c2be01-34a3-46d9-31fe-08d7a4f3bc87\r\n- **Build**: 20200319.1\r\n- **Date Produced**: 3/19/2020 8:27 PM\r\n- **Commit**: 44812e163784c52feb1933f3a4e72948b799f3bb\r\n- **Branch**: refs/heads/master\r\n- **Updates**:\r\n  - **Microsoft.AspNetCore.DeveloperCertificates.XPlat** -> 5.0.0-preview.3.20169.1\r\n\r\n[marker]: <> (End:c0c2be01-34a3-46d9-31fe-08d7a4f3bc87)\r\n\r\n"},{"Id":"11813748024","Type":"PullRequestEvent","CreatedAt":"2020-03-19T23:19:30","Actor":"MSLukeWest","Repository":"dotnet/sdk","Organization":"dotnet","RawContent":null,"RelatedAction":"opened","RelatedUrl":"https://github.com/dotnet/sdk/pull/10925","RelatedDescription":"Opened pull request \"Adding back ComputeFilesCopiedToPublishDir item group to fix wapproj compat bug\" (#10925) at dotnet/sdk","RelatedBody":"This item group was removed in .NET 5 due to some refactoring around the single file scenario.

\r\nInstructions:\r\nThanks for your application to join the .NET Foundation. \r\n\r\n1.  Here is a checklist of steps we’ll follow during the process: [https://github.com/dotnet/foundation/blob/master/guidance/new-projects.md](https://github.com/dotnet/foundation/blob/master/guidance/new-projects.md)\r\n2.  Please fill out the application in the template below. If you prefer to submit via e-mail to keep information private, you can use this [application form](https://github.com/dotnet-foundation/projects/blob/master/OnBoardingQuestionaire.docx) and submit to contact@dotnetfoundation.org, referencing this issue number. You can also fill out the Word document and submit it as an [attachement to the issue](https://help.github.com/en/articles/file-attachments-on-issues-and-pull-requests), via Google Doc, etc. If you have questions, fill out what you know and discuss on the issue.\r\n3.  After review and comment by the advisory council, we will submit your questionnaire to the board of directors recommending we add your project.\r\n4.  We will send you a contribution agreement via DocuSign.\r\n5.  We can announce the project is joining, and work through the other steps on the checklist.\r\n\r\n\r\nSome common questions that come up on the questionnaire:\r\n\r\n*   Project Transfer Signatories section: List the top contributors, with contact e-mail. For most projects, this is the top 1-5 contributors who have contributed more than a few hundred lines of code.\r\n*   Contribution vs Assignment: The difference is in the contribution model is who actually owns the copyright. It is important, but in terms of practical operation of the project it’s pretty transparent.\r\n\r\n\r\n*   **Contribution:** The project grants the .NET Foundation a license and rights to the intellectual property and source code. The project agrees that it is their work, and the .NET Foundation can protect your copyright.\r\n*   **Assignment:** The project / company gives the .NET Foundation the project, the .NET Foundation grants it back  \r\n\r\n Normally for community projects we recommend contribution. It’s more applicable for projects that have had multiple contributors over a period of time. Assignment is more applicable for a project that was developed in-house by a company, as they have had complete and traceable ownership of the project throughout its lifespan. Either works fine and has little to no day to day impact on the project once it joins from an actual open source development / shipping software point of view. I’d honestly have to go back and check the transfer agreements for a project to tell you what contribution model they chose. So, whatever makes your lawyers happiest is best.\r\n-->\r\n\r\n## 1.   General Information\r\n\r\n**Project Name:** \r\nMarten\r\n\r\n**License:**\r\nMIT\r\n\r\n**Contributor (Company, Organization or individual name(s)):**\r\nJeremy D. Miller, Babu Annamalai, Oskar Dudycz, Joona-Pekka Kokko\r\n\r\n**Existing OSS Project? (Yes/No):**\r\nYes\r\n\r\n**Source Code URL:**\r\nhttps://github.com/JasperFx/marten\r\n\r\n**Project Homepage URL (if different):**\r\nhttps://martendb.io\r\n\r\n**Project Transfer Signatories:**\r\n_Full legal name and email address required of the individual(s) with the authority to transfer or contribute the project to the .NET Foundation. Note that if you'd prefer not to include this in the public application, it can be submitted via e-mail to contact@dotnetfoundation.org (referencing this issue number)._\r\n\r\nJeremy D. Miller jeremydmiller@yahoo.com\r\nBabu Annamalai  babu.annamalai@gmail.com\r\nOskar Dudycz oskar.dudycz@gmail.com\r\nJoona-Pekka Kokko jokokko@gmail.com\r\n\r\n## 2.   Description\r\n**Please provide a brief statement about your project in terms that are understandable to the target consumer of the library or project, i.e. an elevator pitch for the project:**\r\n\r\nMarten gives developers a multi-paradigm framework for modelling, storing and querying data on PostgreSQL. Making use of the battle hardened database engine, Marten transparently exposes the JSON(B) capabilities of PostgreSQL for managing objects and events alike, requiring no ceremony to enable friction-less development. Marten is your object (document) and event store, with bells and whistles attached, be it CRUD, Event Sourcing or anything between.\r\n\r\n**Please provide a 1 sentence (<140 character) summary of your to help users when searching the .NET Foundation projects**\r\nPolyglot Persistence providing object (document) and event store Powered by .NET and PostgreSQL\r\n\r\n## 3.   Project Governance\r\nPlease complete this section about who will be maintaining the open source project and how it will run.\r\n**Project Lead:**\r\n(Who is the primary contact point for the community and the .NET Foundation when discussing governance of the project.)\r\n\r\nName: Jeremy D. Miller\r\n Email: jeremydmiller@yahoo.com  \r\n GitHub Profile URL: https://github.com/jeremydmiller\r\n\r\n**Committers:**\r\n\r\n_Which individuals have commit / write access to the repository, what is their GitHub ID and who is their employer (if contributions are on behalf of an employer)_\r\n\r\nJeremy D. Miller https://github.com/jeremydmiller\r\n\r\nBabu Annamalai https://github.com/mysticmind\r\n\r\nOskar Dudycz https://github.com/oskardudycz\r\n\r\nJoona-Pekka Kokko https://github.com/jokokko\r\n\r\n**Governance Model:**\r\n\r\n_Please describe how new code changes are proposed to the project, how those changes are reviewed and how a decision is made to accept proposed changes. Also describe the process for identifying and appointing new committers._\r\n\r\nChanges are proposed via GH issues. All issues are reviewed and labelled with the proper type and scope. Issues that have the estimated timeline are assigned to a proper milestone. Milestones reflect the package version based on the semantic versioning. \r\nPlans for the new releases are discussed publicly in the issues (see eg. https://github.com/JasperFx/marten/issues/1307 or https://github.com/JasperFx/marten/issues/1391).\r\nQuick surveys, questions, clarifications and in general contact with community is done in dedicated Gitter channel https://gitter.im/JasperFx/marten.\r\nNormally 2 approves from maintainers are needed to merge the Pull Request. \r\nNew committers were appointed once by Jeremy based on the number and quality of commits, activity and helping the community. See more: https://jeremydmiller.com/2018/09/27/marten-3-0-is-released-and-introducing-the-new-core-team/\r\n\r\n**CLA**\r\n\r\n_If already an OSS project, was a Contribution License Agreement in place for contributions accepted? How does the project check who has signed one?_\r\n\r\nNo.\r\n\r\n**CLA Notification Alias**\r\n_Provide an email address that will receive CLA related notifications from the .NET Foundation CLA automation_\r\n\r\n**Project Transfer Type**\r\n\r\n_Projects may join the .NET Foundation in one of two ways and you should chat with your .NET Foundation contact to discuss the best mechanism for your project. You can either a) assign the copyright of the project's source code to the .NET Foundation or b) contribute the project source code to the .NET Foundation under an open source license. Assignment is the preferred approach, but licensing a project to the Foundation may be more appropriate for longer running open source projects that have not previously had a contribution license agreement and have accepted contributions from many different sources.\r\na) Assignment\r\nb) Contribution_\r\n\r\nContribution.\r\n\r\n## 4.   Repository Layout\r\n_The .NET Foundation host guidance for new projects and details on recommended structure here:\r\n[https://github.com/dotnet/home/tree/master/guidance](https://github.com/dotnet/home/tree/master/guidance)\r\n\r\nNote that the open source repository should be the master where changes are made by the core development team using the same PR process that is used for non-committer contributions.\r\n\r\nPlease define below any changes you would want to make to your repositories as part of the process of joining the .NET Foundation_\r\n\r\nI don’t think any repository changes are required as part of this process.\r\n\r\n## 5.   PR Plan\r\n_Please summarize the public relations plan for the announcement when joining the foundation (and releasing as open source if appropriate). What is the main story we wish to promote, through what channels, what issues should we be aware of?  For significant news events then please also work with your .NET Foundation contact to ensure a [full PR plan](https://dotnetfoundation.sharepoint.com/Shared%20Documents/PR/Communications%20Plan%20TEMPLATE.docx?web=1) is developed._\r\n\r\nCurrently we'll promote that through blog post, twitter announcement using twitter handle `@marten_lib` & updated website https://martendb.io. We also want to provide the newsletter and maybe more video tutorials. Contributors also speak about the Event Sourcing with .NET Core and Marten on the local meetups. We also plan to get some sponsorship plan (not clear as yet - https://github.com/JasperFx/marten/issues/1393).\r\n\r\n## 6.   Infrastructure Requirements\r\n_Please describe any infrastructure requirements for the project. For example, how will build servers be operated? Any web hosting or service hosting requirements? Do we need to set up SSL certificates or provide Authenticode Code Signing arrangement for releases?_\r\n\r\nCurrently, we're using the Azure Pipelines and AppVeyor OSS plans and we're happy with that process. We are building our documentation using Storyteller (https://storyteller.github.io/documentation/docs/)  hosted on GitHub pages and Netlify so we also don't need to change it as for now. We might need in the future SSL certificates or Authentication Code Signing.\r\n\r\n## 7.   Additional Notes\r\n_Please provide any additional information required or use this area for notes during the on boarding process. If this open source project has similarities with any other projects in this space then please detail them and why this project is different. If there are any potential issues that you feel the project might need help with early on then also state them here and discuss with your .NET Foundation Contact._\r\n\r\nMarten is sometimes compared to Entity Framework. But Marten is not an ORM, it should be treated as the .NET Document and Event Store that's just backed with PostgreSQL. Our approach to using the PostgreSQL and its sophisticated JSON(B) features is unique in .NET space. It should be more compared to RavenDB rather than Entity Framework.\r\nWe're working on the sustainability of our model (so getting sponsorship) to be able to work on the dedicated time and get more reliability in bigger Enterprise companies. Such help would be more than welcome from .NET Foundation.","Url":"https://github.com/dotnet/foundation/issues/161","RelatedDescription":"Closed issue \"Marten\"

to 3.1 - Fix handling thread abort in HelperMethodFrame","State":"open","Body":"The thread abort during func eval from a managed debugger on Linux and macOS\r\nwas sometimes causing the debuggee to exit with unhandled c++ PAL_SEHException.\r\nThe reason is that the thread abort detection that is done in the\r\nHELPER_METHOD_FRAME_BEGIN and ...END macros was done outside of the\r\nINSTALL_MANAGED_EXCEPTION_DISPATCHER / UNINSTALL_MANAGED_EXCEPTION_DISPATCHER\r\nregion and so the exception thrown when thread abort request is detected\r\nthere was not being caught and translated into a call to DispatchManagedException.\r\nSince the caller frame was a managed function frame, the C++ exception handling\r\ndidn't know how to unwind it and so it declared the exception being unhandled.\r\n\r\nThis fix moves the check for the thread abort out of the HelperMethodFrame::Push/Pop\r\ninto a new method and calls that explicitly from the HELPER_METHOD_* macros inside\r\nthe INSTALL_MANAGED_EXCEPTION_DISPATCHER / UNINSTALL_MANAGED_EXCEPTION_DISPATCHER\r\nregion.

A FuncEval may time out on entering the lock if for example it calls a virtual or interface method for the first time. Failing the FuncEval when the lock is held enables the debugger to fall back to other options for expression evaluation.\r\n- Also added polls for debugger suspension before acquiring the slot backpatching lock on background threads that often operate in preemptive GC mode. A common case in master is when the debugger breaks while the tiering delay timer is active, the timer ticks shortly afterwards (after debugger suspension completes) and if a thread pool thread is already available, the background thread would block while holding the lock. This is less common in 3.1 because the callback pulses the GC mode at the beginning, but still may occur occasionally. The poll checks for debugger suspension and pulses the GC mode to block before acquiring the lock.\r\n\r\n### Customer impact\r\n\r\n- This is a top feedback item for VS on 3.x: [feedback ticket](https://developercommunity.visualstudio.com/content/problem/855101/to-prevent-an-unsafe-abort-popup-appears-often-in.html)\r\n\r\n### Regression?\r\n\r\nYes, regression from 2.x, starting in 3.0\r\n\r\n### Testing\r\n\r\n- It's a timing issue and was reproduced by inducing specific timings in various phases of tiering\r\n- Verified that the timeout does not occur after the fix in the vast majority of cases. Instead, the FuncEval is failed when the lock is held and VS falls back to alternate means for evaluating the expression. See more in risks below.\r\n- Checked debugger-broken stacks at various phases of tiering to verify that the poll for debugger suspension is working as expected\r\n- Standard tests\r\n\r\n### Risks\r\n\r\n- The fix is only a heuristic and lessens the problem when it is detected that the lock is held by some thread. Since the lock is acquired in preemptive GC mode, it is still possible that after the check at the start of a FuncEval, another thread acquires the lock and the FuncEval may time out. The polling makes it less likely for the lock to be taken by background tiering work, for example if a FuncEval starts while rejitting a method.\r\n- The expression evaluation experience may be worse when it is detected that the lock is held, and may still happen from unfortunate timing\r\n- Low risk for the change itself\r\n\r\nPort of https://github.com/dotnet/runtime/pull/2380\r\nFix for https://github.com/dotnet/runtime/issues/1537","Url":"https://github.com/dotnet/coreclr/pull/28006","RelatedDescription":"Closed or merged PR \"[3.1] Fail FuncEval if slot backpatching lock is held by any thread\" (#28006)"},{"Id":"564203743","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2020-02-18T21:32:58","Actor":"GrabYourPitchforks","Number":"28014","RawContent":null,"Title":"[release/3.1] Port dotnet/runtime#31946 fix for string.Replace infinite loop","State":"closed","Body":"Issue https://github.com/dotnet/runtime/issues/1060 reports that in a linguistic (non-ordinal) call to `string.Replace`, if the target string contains code points with zero collation weight, the `string.Replace` logic can enter an infinite loop.\r\n\r\nThis has already been fixed in .NET 5 (see https://github.com/dotnet/runtime/pull/31946).

We did this  in order to stop using assembly re-writing and instead to use source generation. Back when we did that, we didn't catch one diff which was that our desktop runtime shims would now reference the netcoreapp vertical contracts and their assembly versions, instead of just using 0.0.0.0 as we used to do with assembly re-writing. This caused an issue that if today we service one of our OOB packages and increase the assembly version, and this assembly happens to be referenced by one of our .NET Framework shims, then now the shims will have a hard dependency on that version of the OOB package and won't work with previous versions of the package. The first instance we've seen is now in 3.1.2 when we serviced System.Data.SqlClient (new assembly version is 4.6.1.1) and it is referenced by our System.Data shim. This means that if you need to load the System.Data shim, are running in 3.1.2 runtime, and reference a System.Data.SqlClient package which is older than 4.8.1 you will hit an exception like:\r\n\r\n```\r\nSystem.IO.FileLoadException: Could not load file or assembly 'System.Data.SqlClient, Version=4.6.1.1, Culture=neutral, PublicKeyToken=b03f5f7f11d50a3a'. The located assembly's manifest definition does not match the assembly reference. (0x80131040)\r\n```\r\n\r\nThis will happen because the System.Data is trying to load System.Data.SqlClient new version, but the consuming app was referencing an older version of the package (for example: 4.8.0 which only contains 4.6.1.0 assembly)\r\n\r\nThis fix will address this regression only, by making System.Data shim to reference 4.6.1.0 version again so that package 4.8.0 will work again, however, older versions of the package will still not work (as was the case already since we initially shipped 3.0 and 3.1). There is a much larger list of assemblies that might hit this issue if they get serviced in the future, so after this regression is fixed, we will work in master branch in order to provide a future-proof fix that will work for all cases.","Url":"https://github.com/dotnet/corefx/pull/42868","RelatedDescription":"Closed or merged PR \"Fixing regression caused by servicing of System.Data.SqlClient package\" (#42868)"},{"Id":"568709225","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2020-02-21T03:13:31","Actor":"ahsonkhan","Number":"42869","RawContent":null,"Title":"[release/3.1] Do not null ref or throw index out of range exception when deserializing to char.","State":"open","Body":"Get the changes from 5.0/master found in https://github.com/dotnet/runtime/pull/528 \r\n\r\n## Description\r\n\r\nAdd a null/empty string check when deserializing JSON strings into a `char` property so that we don't null ref or throw an index of out of range exception. Intentionally left out the `string.length > 1` check as that could potentially break someone.\r\n\r\n## Customer Impact\r\n\r\nMost people are very unlikely to have a catch handler for NullReferenceException, IndexOutOfRangeException, or InvalidOperationException (and in the first two, it certainly doesn't make sense for them to). So in server scenarios customers still get an HTTP 500.\r\nNow, the the `JsonConverter<char>` throws an `InvalidOperationException` which the wraps the into an outer `JsonException` so that customers can have handlers to catch that.

The fix is a couple of lines, with the rest of the PR adding tests and test enhancement.\r\n\r\n## Customer Impact\r\n\r\nThis bug was initially reported in user-defined `JsonConverter<T>` where the user couldn't deserialize a deeply nested object graph (beyond the default max depth of 64). The issue, however, is not just specific to converters (nor just to `MaxDepth`) and will be hit whenever the caller passes in a `Utf8JsonReader` to the `JsonSerializer.Deserialize` method with non-default `JsonReaderOptions` set (which currently includes `MaxDepth`, `JsonCommentHandling`, and `AllowTrailingCommas`).\r\n\r\nFor example, this code snippet incorrectly fails with an exception:\r\n```C#\r\nvar localReader = new Utf8JsonReader(Encoding.UTF8.GetBytes(\"[null,]\"), \r\n                                       new JsonReaderOptions { AllowTrailingCommas = true });\r\n\r\nstring[] returnedValue = JsonSerializer.Deserialize<string[]>(ref localReader);\r\n\r\n// System.Text.Json.JsonException : The JSON array contains a trailing comma at the end \r\n// which is not supported in this mode. Change the reader options. Path: $[1] | \r\n// LineNumber: 0 | BytePositionInLine: 6.\r\n```\r\n\r\nIt is clear that we should be honoring the user-defined options. Otherwise, there is no way for callers to deserialize payloads containing trailing commas or comments when using the `Utf8JsonReader` with the `JsonSerializer`. We should make sure to meet user expectations here (otherwise, even debugging the issue would become difficult for them).\r\n\r\nThere is no reasonable workaround for the user. In fact, the `JsonConverter<T>` extension point is the primary workaround to change default serialization behavior, which increases the need for this fix since that isn't working as expected.\r\n\r\n## Regression\r\n\r\nNo. The bug existed in the deserialization behavior since the initial release of S.T.Json as part of 3.0.\r\n\r\n### Testing\r\n\r\nAdded several permutations within the test including customer reported scenario. The fix for the bug is only a couple of lines and only affects the read/deserialize, but I wanted to make sure we add tests to exercise the various options for both read and write. We already have decent negative test cases (where the default options throw for invalid JSON), but were missing positive test cases (where custom options worked to make the reader more flexible).\r\n\r\nThe writer tests are only there for completeness and fill a gap from when the `JsonSerializer` APIs that accept a writer were originally added (see https://github.com/dotnet/corefx/pull/38700#issuecomment-503763061). Those tests pass in master and 3.1 already with no source changes.\r\n\r\n## Risk\r\n\r\n**Low** given it is a very targeted fix with no regression. This fix only affects the deserialization behavior. One scenario where a customer could be impacted is if they accidentally relied on the default reader options to catch/throw for JSON that might contain comments/trailing commas, even when they were setting the options to be flexible. The fix for that would be to make sure the options match what you expect.\r\n\r\ncc @ericstj ","Url":"https://github.com/dotnet/corefx/pull/42867","RelatedDescription":"Open PR \"[release/3.1] Make sure original Utf8JsonReader options are honored when re-creating the reader.\" (#42867)"},{"Id":"567108141","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2020-02-19T18:37:11","Actor":"GrabYourPitchforks","Number":"42862","RawContent":null,"Title":"[release/3.1] Corresponding unit tests for dotnet/coreclr#28014","State":"closed","Body":"These are the unit tests for https://github.com/dotnet/coreclr/pull/28014, which is a customer-reported infinite loop in `string.Replace`.\r\n\r\nThe unit tests will fail (by entering an infinite loop) until that PR is checked in to coreclr and the corresponding build flows to corefx.","Url":"https://github.com/dotnet/corefx/pull/42862","RelatedDescription":"Closed or merged PR \"[release/3.1] Corresponding unit tests for dotnet/coreclr#28014\" (#42862)"},{"Id":"567714171","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2020-02-19T18:10:34","Actor":"dotnet-maestro-bot","Number":"42866","RawContent":null,"Title":"Update CoreClr, CoreFx, CoreSetup to servicing-28516-03, servicing-28516-10, stable, respectively (release/2.1)","State":"closed","Body":"/cc @dotnet/maestro-reviewers-core","Url":"https://github.com/dotnet/corefx/pull/42866","RelatedDescription":"Closed or merged PR \"Update CoreClr, CoreFx, CoreSetup to servicing-28516-03, servicing-28516-10, stable, respectively (release/2.1)\" (#42866)"},{"Id":"567225799","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2020-02-19T00:30:47","Actor":"dotnet-maestro[bot]","Number":"42865","RawContent":null,"Title":"[release/3.1] Update dependencies from dotnet/coreclr","State":"closed","Body":"This pull request updates the following dependencies\r\n\r\n[marker]: <> (Begin:dbb830b1-8f81-460f-dd40-08d72a4caef5)\r\n## From https://github.com/dotnet/coreclr\r\n- **Subscription**: dbb830b1-8f81-460f-dd40-08d72a4caef5\r\n- **Build**: 20200218.3\r\n- **Date Produced**: 2/18/2020 10:28 PM\r\n- **Commit**: c5d3d752260383fbed72ba2b4d86d82fea673c76\r\n- **Branch**: refs/heads/release/3.1\r\n- **Updates**:\r\n  - **Microsoft.NET.Sdk.IL** -> 3.1.3-servicing.20118.3\r\n  - **Microsoft.NETCore.ILAsm** -> 3.1.3-servicing.20118.3\r\n  - **Microsoft.NETCore.Runtime.CoreCLR** -> 3.1.3-servicing.20118.3\r\n\r\n[marker]: <> (End:dbb830b1-8f81-460f-dd40-08d72a4caef5)\r\n\r\n","Url":"https://github.com/dotnet/corefx/pull/42865","RelatedDescription":"Closed or merged PR \"[release/3.1] Update dependencies from dotnet/coreclr\" (#42865)"},{"Id":"567187301","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2020-02-18T23:38:05","Actor":"dotnet-maestro[bot]","Number":"42864","RawContent":null,"Title":"[release/3.1] Update dependencies from dotnet/coreclr","State":"closed","Body":"This pull request updates the following dependencies\r\n\r\n[marker]: <> (Begin:dbb830b1-8f81-460f-dd40-08d72a4caef5)\r\n## From https://github.com/dotnet/coreclr\r\n- **Subscription**: dbb830b1-8f81-460f-dd40-08d72a4caef5\r\n- **Build**: 20200218.2\r\n- **Date Produced**: 2/18/2020 9:03 PM\r\n- **Commit**: 25bb13bc33c5911c6319722203dbb83eaebe7b08\r\n- **Branch**: refs/heads/release/3.1\r\n- **Updates**:\r\n  - **Microsoft.NET.Sdk.IL** -> 3.1.3-servicing.20118.2\r\n  - **Microsoft.NETCore.ILAsm** -> 3.1.3-servicing.20118.2\r\n  - **Microsoft.NETCore.Runtime.CoreCLR** -> 3.1.3-servicing.20118.2\r\n\r\n[marker]: <> (End:dbb830b1-8f81-460f-dd40-08d72a4caef5)\r\n\r\n","Url":"https://github.com/dotnet/corefx/pull/42864","RelatedDescription":"Closed or merged PR \"[release/3.1] Update dependencies from dotnet/coreclr\" (#42864)"},{"Id":"565607813","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2020-02-18T22:07:27","Actor":"joperezr","Number":"42859","RawContent":null,"Title":"Adding netfx configuration to System.Runtime.CompilerServices.Unsafe","State":"closed","Body":"Porting #42849 relevant parts to release/3.1.

Apparently, .NET Framework BCL documentation strips out `<remarks>` on user machines, but the data is available in online documentation.\r\n\r\nVSmac has not yet inserted this week's Roslyn in order to avoid this issue on very basic types like `System.Console` and boolean literals:\r\n\r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/155076/77126773-83fe0700-6a07-11ea-8db7-780a2e224f9c.png)\r\n\r\n(Of note, the above behavior only occurs for Mono-based projects on Mac, but that includes Xamarin.iOS, etc)\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\nTo be fair, it has always been possible to make unhelpfully large QuickInfo tooltips even before this change. While I feel that we do need to seriously address the problem over large tooltips, that should probably be a separate issue.\r\n\r\nFor now, we should decide how to move forward on showing `<remarks>` content. Some proposals:\r\n\r\n1. **Remove the feature entirely.**\r\n   This would be a bummer, as it seems generally useful. But maybe it's the right thing to do if QuickInfo UX needs some new design work.\r\n2. **Add an option for this feature, and disable it by default.**\r\n   This might be the best default behavior, but many people would never discover the option.\r\n3. **Add an option for this feature, enable it by default, but allow it to be disabled on a per-buffer level**\r\n   This would require additional work from the Xamarin and VSmac teams to keep it turned off for Mono-based workspaces/buffers/whatever. These users would miss out on the feature and have no way to force it on (unless the IDE added an additional option for that). I'm not personally familiar with how to implement this for Xamarin on VSwin.\r\n4. **Disable the feature for some specific namespaces, such as `System.*`, and perhaps `UIKit.*` and other Xamarin namespaces**\r\n   Seems reasonable for most Visual Studio users, but doesn't help scenarios where namespaces we don't know about have similarly lengthy `<remarks>`.\r\n5. **Truncate content to some \"reasonable maximum\"**\r\n   This seems problematic for the case of boolean literals in Mono. It is not especially helpful to show anything beyond a simple tooltip when mousing over `false`. And conversely, I would not want to over-truncate reasonable documentation.\r\n\r\nPersonally, I'd prefer 2 or maybe 3, to be followed by more general work on what to do about too-long QuickInfo content (regardless of `<remarks>`).\r\n\r\nPrior art on huge tooltips: https://github.com/dotnet/roslyn/issues/21493","Url":"https://github.com/dotnet/roslyn/issues/42606","RelatedDescription":"Open issue \"Showing <remarks> in QuickInfo results in very large tooltips for Xamarin\" (#42606)"},{"Id":"584781960","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2020-03-20T00:53:04","Actor":"mavasani","Number":"42605","RawContent":null,"Title":"Improve performance of analyzer driver in presence of symbol start an…","State":"open","Body":"…alyzers.

-t","State":"open","Body":"Hello all. I seem to have stumbled upon a rather weird possible regression after I migrated from SDK 3.1.102 to 3.1.200.\r\n\r\n**Context**\r\nA few days ago I forked the VSCode extension [formulahendry/vscode-dotnet-test-explorer](https://github.com/formulahendry/vscode-dotnet-test-explorer) and started playing around with bringing it up to speed for Core SDK 3.1 and doing some other changes. For testing my changes, I was using the solution I work on at my job.\r\n\r\nThe extension first discovers possible test projects in a VSCode workspace and then executes `dotnet test -t -v=q [project]` against one project at a time. It waits until the execution terminates and reads the stdout in order to retrieve the list of tests. This list is further processed and displayed etc.\r\n\r\nWhile I was using the SDK 3.1.102, everything was working perfectly here. The command produced the list of tests every time without issues. However, after I updated to SDK 3.1.200, this started failing in more than 50% of executions (but not always).\r\n\r\n**The issue**\r\nIn SDK 3.1.200, the `dotnet test -t -v=q [project path]` terminates but it looks like the stdout is not properly flushed. The extension reads the stdout and only  gets as far as\r\n```\r\nTest run for [pathToDll](.NETCoreApp,Version=v3.1)\r\nMicrosoft (R) Test Execution Command Line Tool Version 16.5.0\r\nCopyright (c) Microsoft Corporation.  All rights reserved.\r\n\r\nThe following Tests are available:\r\n```\r\nAnd that's it. No tests are listed in the stdout (even though they are there, of course). If I run the same command from the command line, the output is complete (with tests), but there is an observable pause between outputting `The following Tests are available:` and the actual list of tests.\r\n\r\nTo verify the regression theory, I introduced a global.json and used it to fix a specific SDK version for the solution in question. The results are consistent - 3.1.102 works every time, 3.1.200 fails more often then not.\r\n\r\nSince the problem does not manifest every time, it feels like a possible race condition to me. If the `dotnet` process terminates too quickly, the stdout isn't flushed completely and whatever is in the buffer gets lost. But it's really just a theory.\r\n\r\n**The problematic code**\r\n``` ts\r\nfunction executeDotnetTest(testDirectoryPath: string, dotnetTestOptions: string): Promise<string> {\r\n    return new Promise((resolve, reject) => {\r\n        Logger.Log(`Executing dotnet test -t -v=q in ${testDirectoryPath}`);\r\n\r\n        let buffer = \"\";\r\n\r\n        const p = cp.spawn(\"dotnet\", [\"test\", \"-t\", \"-v=q\" ], { cwd: testDirectoryPath });\r\n        p.stdout.on(\"data\", (data) => buffer += data.toString());\r\n        p.on(\"close\", (code) => {\r\n            if (code !== 0) {\r\n                Logger.LogError(`Error while executing dotnet test -t -v=q`, code);\r\n\r\n                reject();\r\n            }\r\n\r\n            Logger.Log(buffer);\r\n\r\n            resolve(buffer);\r\n        });\r\n    });\r\n}\r\n```\r\nNow I'm not the greatest with Node.js but this should work and does work when using the older SDK. It spawns a new process with the necessary parameters, hooks to the stdout to build a buffer, then, when the process closes all its IO streams, logs the buffer and resolves the promise.\r\n\r\nMore details: the projects in question use xUnit for testing framework, but it also reproduces with MSTest.\r\n\r\n**Question**\r\nCan someone please try and clarify what's going on here? Or possibly offer a workaround?","Url":"https://github.com/dotnet/sdk/issues/10926","RelatedDescription":"Open issue \"Regression in 3.1.200 for dotnet test -t\" (#10926)"},{"Id":"584723442","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2020-03-19T23:41:33","Actor":"dotnet-maestro[bot]","Number":"10924","RawContent":null,"Title":"[master] Update dependencies from dotnet/aspnetcore","State":"closed","Body":"This pull request updates the following dependencies\r\n\r\n[marker]: <> (Begin:c0c2be01-34a3-46d9-31fe-08d7a4f3bc87)\r\n## From https://github.com/dotnet/aspnetcore\r\n- **Subscription**: c0c2be01-34a3-46d9-31fe-08d7a4f3bc87\r\n- **Build**: 20200319.1\r\n- **Date Produced**: 3/19/2020 8:27 PM\r\n- **Commit**: 44812e163784c52feb1933f3a4e72948b799f3bb\r\n- **Branch**: refs/heads/master\r\n- **Updates**:\r\n  - **Microsoft.AspNetCore.DeveloperCertificates.XPlat** -> 5.0.0-preview.3.20169.1\r\n\r\n[marker]: <> (End:c0c2be01-34a3-46d9-31fe-08d7a4f3bc87)\r\n\r\n","Url":"https://github.com/dotnet/sdk/pull/10924","RelatedDescription":"Closed or merged PR \"[master] Update dependencies from dotnet/aspnetcore\" (#10924)"},{"Id":"584754586","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2020-03-19T23:19:29","Actor":"MSLukeWest","Number":"10925","RawContent":null,"Title":"Adding back ComputeFilesCopiedToPublishDir item group to fix wapproj compat bug","State":"open","Body":"This item group was removed in .NET 5 due to some refactoring around the single file scenario.

For example, the problem described at https://github.com/tonerdo/coverlet/issues/714#issuecomment-579704498 appears to arise from this.\r\n\r\nIn that case, Coverlet wants to be able to read the source file as part of its code coverage handling. But because of this issue, alternate builds can end up failing to produce any code coverage information, because on every other build, the `Nullable.cs` file is missing.\r\n\r\nThe cause appears to be the behaviour of the `IncrementalClean` target (in `Microsoft.Common.CurrentVersion.targets`). This seems to be trying to remove any intermediate build outputs that were produced by a previous build but which it believes are no longer required. Unfortunately, in cases where the content asset in question was put in place by an earlier build, the `RunProduceContentAssets` target (in `Microsoft.PackageDependencyResolution.targets`) does not list the file in its `FileWrites` output (because the file was already there so it didn't write it), with the effect that the `IncrementalClean` has no way of knowing that this content asset is still wanted.\r\n\r\nThe result is that `IncrementalClean` removes a file because it mistakenly thinks it is a hangover from an older build that is no longer required.\r\n\r\nThis often goes unnoticed because the relevant cleanup happens after compilation, so it typically doesn't greatly matter if the file vanishes. But when parts of the build want to inspect source code later on (as Coverlet does—it wants to inspect the source as part of its instrumentation process) this overly aggressive cleanup causes problems.\r\n\r\n(This is causing some of our CI builds to fail to produce code coverage information, because we run the test with a separate `dotnet test` step after the `dotnet build`, and since that `dotnet test` is the 2nd build to occur, it falls foul of this problem. And as far as we can tell, the obvious workaround of specifying `--no-build` won't work because the coverage process relies on instrumentation that is performed as part of the build.)","Url":"https://github.com/dotnet/sdk/issues/10914","RelatedDescription":"Open issue \"MSBuild NuGet Content Asset handling alternately creates and deletes content every other build\" (#10914)"},{"Id":"584307788","IsPullRequest":false,"CreatedAt":"2020-03-19T10:24:26","Actor":"Abarbz","Number":"10913","RawContent":null,"Title":"Running publish more than once copies the wrong depencencies with .Net Core 3","State":"open","Body":"Since I updated my build server with VS2019 and .Net Core 3, my deployment pipelines are failing.\r\nThe setup on my build server:\r\n\r\n- .Net core version 3.1.200 installed\r\n\r\n- publish command uses Build Engine version 16.5.0+d4cbfca49 for .NET Core.\r\n\r\nAfter investigating, here's what I found:\r\nMy project is a rather simple self hostedAsp.Net core project, targeting net461.\r\nIf I publish it using\r\n`publish \"myAspNetCoreProject.csproj\" -o \"myOutputPath\" -c release` \r\nThe application will work as expected.\r\nIf I kill the application, and re-publish with the exact same command, then the application will start and stop immediately, without any trace, even in debug mode.\r\nAfter checking the differences in \"myOutputPath\" between the two publish operations, I found that the 2nd publish seems to copy older version of some dependencies.\r\nHere are the modification that are done: \r\n\r\nChanged dependencies          |    version after 1st publish |  version after 2nd publish\r\n------------------------|-------------------------|-----------------------------------------------\r\nSystem.AppContext.dll | 4.6.25714.01 | 4.6.23123.0\r\nSystem.Console.dll | 4.6.25714.01 | 4.6.24705.01\r\nSystem.Diagnostics.FileVersionInfo.dll | 4.6.25714.01 | 4.6.24705.01\r\nSystem.Diagnostics.StackTrace.dll | 4.6.26011.01 | 4.6.24705.01\r\nSystem.IO.Compression.dll | 4.6.26011.01 | 4.6.24705.01\r\nSystem.IO.FileSystem.dll | 4.6.25714.01 | 4.6.24705.01\r\nSystem.IO.FileSystem.Primitives.dll | 4.6.25714.01 | 4.6.24705.01\r\nSystem.Runtime.InteropServices.RuntimeInformation.dll | 4.6.26011.01 | 4.6.24705.01\r\nSystem.Security.Cryptography.Algorithms.dll | 4.6.26011.01 | 4.6.24705.01\r\nSystem.Security.Cryptography.Encoding.dll | 4.6.25714.01 | 4.6.24705.01\r\nSystem.Security.Cryptography.Primitives.dll | 4.6.25714.01 | 4.6.24705.01\r\nSystem.Security.Cryptography.X509Certificates.dll | 4.6.25714.01 | 4.6.24705.01\r\nSystem.Threading.Thread.dll | 4.6.25714.01 | 4.6.24705.01\r\nSystem.Xml.ReaderWriter.dll | 4.6.25714.01 | 4.6.24705.01\r\nSystem.Xml.XmlDocument.dll | 4.6.25714.01 | 4.6.24705.01\r\nSystem.Xml.XPath.dll | 4.6.25714.01 | .6.24705.01\r\nSystem.Xml.XPath.XDocument.dll | 4.6.26011.01 | 4.6.24705.01\r\n\r\n- If I replace only those dependencies after the 2nd publish by their version produced by the 1st publish, it works.\r\n- If I force an older version of dotnet core with a global.json containing\r\n\r\n`\"sdk\": {\r\n    \"version\": \"2.1.804\",\r\n    \"rollForward\": \"disable\"\r\n  }` it also works.\r\n\r\nAs a temporary solution, I have introduced a step that clears \"myOutputPath\"  before every publish operation, but that does not solve the root cause.\r\n\r\n\r\n","Url":"https://github.com/dotnet/sdk/issues/10913","RelatedDescription":"Open issue \"Running publish more than once copies the wrong depencencies with .Net Core 3\" (#10913)"},{"Id":"584103681","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2020-03-19T03:01:24","Actor":"dotnet-maestro[bot]","Number":"10911","RawContent":null,"Title":"[master] Update dependencies from dotnet/aspnetcore","State":"closed","Body":"This pull request updates the following dependencies\r\n\r\n[marker]: <> (Begin:c0c2be01-34a3-46d9-31fe-08d7a4f3bc87)\r\n## From https://github.com/dotnet/aspnetcore\r\n- **Subscription**: c0c2be01-34a3-46d9-31fe-08d7a4f3bc87\r\n- **Build**: 20200318.5\r\n- **Date Produced**: 3/18/2020 11:41 PM\r\n- **Commit**: 98ce12714ae68b62dd201cfe081c3c4345e44eea\r\n- **Branch**: refs/heads/master\r\n- **Updates**:\r\n  - **Microsoft.AspNetCore.DeveloperCertificates.XPlat** -> 5.0.0-preview.3.20168.5\r\n\r\n[marker]: <> (End:c0c2be01-34a3-46d9-31fe-08d7a4f3bc87)\r\n\r\n","Url":"https://github.com/dotnet/sdk/pull/10911","RelatedDescription":"Closed or merged PR \"[master] Update dependencies from dotnet/aspnetcore\" (#10911)"},{"Id":"584127555","IsPullRequest":false,"CreatedAt":"2020-03-19T02:55:54","Actor":"jnm2","Number":"10912","RawContent":null,"Title":"Autoinstall option when no SDK matches global.json","State":"open","Body":"I often clone a repo and get interrupted not having an SDK that matches the global.json file.

LTS releases are stable release which receive critical updates and are supported for at least three years. Current releases can include new features that may undergo future change based on feedback. Current releases are supported for three months after the subsequent .NET Core major or minor release. Both LTS and Current releases receive critical fixes throughout their lifecycle, for security, reliability, or to add support for new operating system versions. You must stay up-to-date with the latest patches to qualify for support. \r\n\r\n[.NET Core 2.2](https://devblogs.microsoft.com/dotnet/announcing-net-core-2-2/) was released in December 2018 as a Current release. Per the lifecycle policy, Current releases reach end of life 3 months after a subsequent release (Current or LTS). **.NET Core 3.0** released in **September 2019** and began the end of life countdown for .NET Core 2.2 that concluded on December 23, 2019. \r\n\r\n## .NET Core 2.2 Downloads\r\n\r\n.NET Core 2.2 installers, zips and tar.gzs will remain available, but unsupported. This includes existing releases available on Linux package feeds.

This means some folks will lose their Collaborator badge and the ability to interact with the CI system.*\r\n\r\nOver the years, we’ve added a bunch of folks as collaborators with read permissions to our public repos. The rationale was that we wanted to be able to assign issues to community members because GitHub only allowed assigning issues to users with an explicit permission grant for the repository. However, they changed this in [June 2019](https://github.blog/2019-06-25-assign-issues-to-issue-commenters/). Now, we can assign issues to all users with explicit permissions as well as to users that have commented on the specific issue.\r\n\r\nAlso, we recently started to audit and tighten the permissions for our organizations. As a result, it became clear that large number of repo-specific permission grants are hard to review and audit. Internally, our goal is to grant all permissions via teams instead.\r\n\r\nHence, we plan to remove all collaborators from public repos that only have read permissions (folks with triage permissions will remain). The full list of affected repos is listed below.\r\n\r\nThis shouldn’t impact your ability to work with us, but losing explicit read-only has the following implications:\r\n\r\n-   **You’ll lose the collaborator badge**. We understand that this is visually appealing and for some people it might have been a badge of honor. But given that GitHub also shows a Contributor bade for folks whose PRs got merged, we don’t think it this will be a major take back.    \r\n    ![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/5169960/70491508-43acf580-1ab6-11ea-94df-74ea2dde98b4.png)\r\n\r\n-   ~~**You lose the ability to interact with the CI system**. As a collaborator, you can use comments to [send commands to the CI system](https://github.com/dotnet/runtime/blob/master/docs/project/pullrequest-builds.md). While this can be useful at times, we generally don’t expect (or desire) contributors to do that. Of course, anyone can still access the CI logs.~~\r\n\r\n- **You might lose the ability to interact with the CI system**. Based on your feedback we have decided to give externals access to interact with the CI system *on a case by case basis*. If you believe you need to have that ability, please [leave a comment like Kevin's](https://github.com/dotnet/runtime/issues/718#issuecomment-563717478).\r\n\r\n| Public Repo                | \\#collaborators with read |\r\n|----------------------------|---------------------------|\r\n| arcade                     | 1                         |\r\n| BenchmarkDotNet            | 11                        |\r\n| cli                        | 2                         |\r\n| command-line-api           | 14                        |\r\n| coreclr                    | 18                        |\r\n| corefx                     | 180                       |\r\n| corefxlab                  | 4                         |\r\n| corert                     | 7                         |\r\n| core-sdk                   | 1                         |\r\n| docs                       | 3                         |\r\n| interactive-window         | 1                         |\r\n| machinelearning            | 1                         |\r\n| machinelearning-samples    | 1                         |\r\n| msbuild-language-service   | 1                         |\r\n| runtime                    | 128                       |\r\n| spark                      | 5                         |\r\n| standard                   | 1                         |\r\n| windowsdesktop             | 1                         |\r\n| winforms-datavisualization | 1                         |\r\n| Grand Total                | 381                       |\r\n\r\n### Discussion\r\n\r\nTo discuss this, please comment on the corresponding issue at https://github.com/dotnet/runtime/issues/718.","Url":"https://github.com/dotnet/announcements/issues/144","RelatedDescription":"Open issue \"Removal of read-collaborator access\" (#144)"},{"Id":"532249858","IsPullRequest":false,"CreatedAt":"2019-12-03T20:36:29","Actor":"MichaelSimons","Number":"143","RawContent":null,"Title":".NET Core `latest` Docker tags updated to 3.1","State":"open","Body":"# .NET Core `latest` Docker tags updated to 3.1\r\n\r\nThe `latest` tags for the [dotnet/core](https://hub.docker.com/_/microsoft-dotnet-core) repos have been updated to reference [.NET Core 3.1](https://devblogs.microsoft.com/dotnet/announcing-net-core-3-1/).\r\n\r\n## Discussion\r\n \r\nYou can share your thoughts on this change or see what others are saying at:\r\n \r\n* [dotnet/dotnet-docker#1337](https://github.com/dotnet/dotnet-docker/issues/1511)\r\n\r\n## Details\r\n\r\n* [dotnet-docker#1509](https://github.com/dotnet/dotnet-docker/pull/1509)\r\n\r\nThe `latest` tags for the [dotnet/core](https://hub.docker.com/_/microsoft-dotnet-core) repos are always intended to reference the latest supported version of .NET Core.

That means that .NET Core manifest tags are no longer usable on those Windows versions.\r\n\r\nIf you pull a manifest tag on one of the Windows versions described, you may get one of the following error messages:\r\n\r\n* `a Windows version 10.0.18362-based image is incompatible with a 10.0.17134 host`\r\n* `no matching manifest for windows/amd64 in the manifest list entries`\r\n* `no matching manifest for unknown in the manifest list entries`\r\n\r\nIf you need to still use Nano Server, version 1803 images (even though it is no longer supported), you will need to use tags that include the Nano Server version (these are non-manifest tags), for example `mcr.microsoft.com/dotnet/core/runtime:3.0-nanoserver-1803`.","Url":"https://github.com/dotnet/announcements/issues/140","RelatedDescription":"Open issue \"Windows Server, version 1803 no longer supported by .NET Core\" (#140)"},{"Id":"522994983","IsPullRequest":false,"CreatedAt":"2019-11-14T17:15:08","Actor":"leecow","Number":"139","RawContent":null,"Title":".NET Core 3.1.0 Preview 3","State":"open","Body":".NET Core 3.1.0 Preview 3 is available and https://github.com/dotnet/core/issues/3809 has been opened for discussion.\r\n\r\n[Release Notes](https://github.com/dotnet/core/blob/master/release-notes/3.1/preview/3.1.0-preview3.md)\r\n[Download](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/download/dotnet-core/3.1)\r\n\r\n**Blog posts**\r\n\r\n[.NET Core](https://devblogs.microsoft.com/dotnet/announcing-net-core-3-1-preview-3/)\r\n[ASP.NET Core](https://devblogs.microsoft.com/aspnet/asp-net-core-updates-in-net-core-3-1-preview-3/)\r\n\r\nPlease report any issues you find with .NET Core 3.1 Preview 3, either responding to this issue, creating a new issue or creating a new issue in one of the following repos:\r\n\r\n* [aspnet/Home](https://github.com/aspnet/Home) - for ASP.NET Core questions\r\n* [aspnet/EntityFrameworkCore](https://github.com/aspnet/EntityFrameworkCore) - for Entity Framework Core questions\r\n* [dotnet/cli](https://github.com/dotnet/cli/issues) - for CLI tools and questions\r\n* [dotnet/corefx](https://github.com/dotnet/corefx/issues) - for API issues and questions\r\n* [dotnet/coreclr](https://github.com/dotnet/coreclr/issues) - for runtime issues\r\n* [dotnet/core-setup](https://github.com/dotnet/core-setup/issues) - for installer issues\r\n* [dotnet/winforms](https://github.com/dotnet/winforms/issues) - for Winforms issues\r\n* [dotnet/wpf](https://github.com/dotnet/wpf/issues) - for WPF issues\r\n* [nuget/home](https://github.com/nuget/home/issues) - for NuGet questions and issues\r\n","Url":"https://github.com/dotnet/announcements/issues/139","RelatedDescription":"Open issue \".NET Core 3.1.0 Preview 3\" (#139)"},{"Id":"522864668","IsPullRequest":false,"CreatedAt":"2019-11-14T13:37:28","Actor":"TaraOverfield","Number":"138","RawContent":null,"Title":"November 2019 .NET Updates","State":"open","Body":"The following .NET updates were released on November 2019.

Our planning has reached a point where we have a schedule for the coreclr, corefx and core-setupmoves into dotnet/runtime that we want to share out with the community.\r\n\r\n### November 13th\r\nWe’ll move all changes from the original repositories into dotnet/runtime up to 5PM PST on November 13th. We’ll try to help as many pull requests as possible get merged by then. At that point, if there’s any pull requests still open we’ll have to close them. If you’d still like to continue those pull requests, we’d encourage you to bring them to dotnet/runtime in a new pull request.\r\n\r\nThe repositories themselves will be effectively archived at this point. The state of the “master” branch will be recorded with a tag, named “master-archive”, but the branch itself will be deleted. The default branch for the repositories will be named “archive” and it will be a single commit with a README.md and CONTRIBUTING.md file pointing to our dotnet/runtime repository.\r\n\r\nThe repositories will remain active for servicing changes to .NET Core 3.1 and earlier hence we will not be using the GitHub archive capability. \r\n\r\n### November 22nd\r\nThe dotnet/runtime repository will be made public and available for community contribution. Even though the repository will be created on November 13th it will take several days to get it back into a working order: fixing up our build scripts, recreating our Azure Dev Ops build definitions, etc … Until those tasks are completed it will not be possible to accept pull request and hence the repository will remain private. Once we are in a state that pull requests can be merged again the repository will be made public.\r\n\r\nOur expectation is that will occur on November 22nd. If it is ready sooner it will be made public sooner. If the work takes longer than we planned then we will add an update to this announcement with a new expected date.\r\n\r\n### December 1st-2nd\r\nAll issues, open and closed, will be migrated from corefx, coreclr and core-setup into dotnet/runtime. This will be using GitHub’s existing issue transfer feature in a bulk migration. This means all of the existing issue links will continue to function via redirects.\r\n\r\nThis does mean though that labels will not transfer with the issues. Labels will be re-applied as a post processing step by our engineering team once the issue migration completes.\r\n\r\nEven though our issues won’t be fully migrated until this time we’d like the community to begin filing issues on dotnet/runtime as soon as it’s public rather than continuing to file issues on the original repositories.\r\n\r\n### Migrating Commits\r\nThe dotnet/runtime repository will be a new commit history from the original repositories. We are using this consolidation as an opportunity to clean up our history with the goal of having a cleaner, smaller history as a starting point. This means commits will be rewritten in the following ways as they are migrated to dotnet/runtime:\r\n\r\n1. Author information, contributor information, changed file list and time stamps from the original commit will be preserved.\r\n1. Links to issues, pull requests or commits in the repository using GitHub short links will be rewritten so they continue to point the original repository. \r\n1. Every commit will be appended with a link to the original commit it was mapped from.\r\n\r\nThe actual contents of the commit though will be updated to match the new directory layout of the dotnet/runtime repository.","Url":"https://github.com/dotnet/announcements/issues/133","RelatedDescription":"Open issue \"Repository Consolidation Timeline\" (#133)"},{"Id":"513963125","IsPullRequest":false,"CreatedAt":"2019-10-29T14:32:55","Actor":"mthalman","Number":"132","RawContent":null,"Title":"Release of Alpine 3.10 Docker images","State":"open","Body":"# .NET Core Alpine Docker images updated to Alpine 3.10\r\n\r\nDocker images for .NET Core have been released that support Alpine 3.10.

With [.NET Standard 2.0](https://devblogs.microsoft.com/dotnet/announcing-net-standard-2-0/), we tried to make it much more viable to share code between .NET Framework, .NET Core, and Xamarin which resulted in approximately 38K .NET Frameworks APIs being available in .NET Core 2.0. We also built the [Windows Compatibility Pack](https://devblogs.microsoft.com/dotnet/announcing-the-windows-compatibility-pack-for-net-core/) which made another 21K .NET Framework APIs available to .NET Core, resulting in almost 60K additional APIs. And in .NET Core 3.0 we added WPF and WinForms, which increased the number of .NET Framework APIs ported to .NET Core to over 120k, which is more than half of all .NET Framework APIs.\r\n\r\nIt’s also worth pointing out that we added about 62K APIs to .NET Core that don’t exist in .NET Framework. If we compare their total number of APIs, .NET Core has about 80% of the API surface of .NET Framework.\r\n\r\n<p align=\"center\">\r\n<img src=\"https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/5169960/66777114-f8db7c80-ee7c-11e9-9161-acfe1c491586.png\" width=\"600\" align=\"center\">\r\n</p>\r\n\r\nWe announced that the [future of .NET](https://devblogs.microsoft.com/dotnet/net-core-is-the-future-of-net/) will be based on .NET Core. And at Build 2019, [Scott Hunter stated](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZlO1utbB2GQ&t=54m20s) that AppDomains, remoting, Web Forms, WCF server, and Windows Workflow won’t be ported to .NET Core.\r\n\r\nWith .NET Core 3.0, we’re at the point where we’ve ported all technologies that are required for modern workloads, be that desktop apps, mobile apps, console apps, web sites, or cloud services. That’s not to say that we don’t have any gaps or opportunities for new technologies, but we generally believe we won’t be finding them in the .NET Framework code base anymore. Moving forward, we’re focusing our resources on incorporating new technologies.\r\n\r\nSimultaneously, we’re looking into releasing more of the [.NET Framework code base under the MIT license](https://github.com/microsoft/referencesource) on GitHub to allow the community to create OSS projects for technologies we’re not intending to bring to .NET Core. For example, there already are community projects for [CoreWF](https://github.com/UiPath/corewf) and [CoreWCF](https://github.com/CoreWCF/CoreWCF).\r\n\r\nWe’d like to thank everyone who filed issues with requests for APIs being ported.

While this is still work in progress, we'd like to give you an update on where we are.\r\n\r\nSo far, we've identified the following repos:\r\n\r\n* dotnet/**runtime**\r\n\t- Will contain [coreclr](https://github.com/dotnet/coreclr), [corefx](https://github.com/dotnet/corefx), [core-setup](https://github.com/dotnet/core-setup), [aspnet/Extensions](https://github.com/aspnet/Extensions), and some of [mono/mono](https://github.com/mono/mono)\r\n* [dotnet/**sdk**](https://github.com/dotnet/sdk)\r\n\t- Will contain [toolset](https://github.com/dotnet/toolset), [sdk](https://github.com/dotnet/sdk), [cli](https://github.com/dotnet/cli)\r\n* dotnet/**installer**\r\n\t- Renamed from [core-sdk](https://github.com/dotnet/core-sdk)\r\n* dotnet/**aspnetcore**\r\n\t- Moved from [aspnet/AspNetCore](https://github.com/aspnet/AspNetCore) and will also contain [aspnet/AspNetCore-Tooling](https://github.com/aspnet/AspNetCore-Tooling)\r\n* dotnet/**efcore**\r\n\t- Moved from [aspnet/EntityFrameworkCore](https://github.com/aspnet/EntityFrameworkCore)\r\n* [dotnet/**winforms**](https://github.com/dotnet/winforms)\r\n\t- Unchanged, but listed for clarity \r\n* [dotnet/**wpf**](https://github.com/dotnet/wpf)\r\n\t- Unchanged, but listed for clarity\r\n\r\n### Name changes\r\n\r\nYou might notice that we changed our mind on naming from our [earlier announcement][ann]. Based on your feedback, we decided to go with **dotnet/runtime** instead of **dotnet/platform** and **dotnet/sdk** instead of **dotnet/cli**.\r\n\r\nSeveral people pointed out that the previous names weren't relatable to how we talk about the product, for example on download pages. So, we decided to match the product distributions as the primary design point for the new names. We generally refer to the bits you need to run your app as *the runtime* and the bits you need to build apps as *the SDK*. This also matches the naming chosen by other platforms.\r\n\r\n### New repos can't be used for .NET Core 3.x or earlier\r\n\r\nThe consolidated repositories are going to be about .NET 5 and going forward. It will not be possible to build .NET Core 3.1 or earlier from these repositories. As such, only the master branch from each of the repositories will be brought forward. There will be no porting of the individual release branches in the source repositories.\r\n\r\n### Personal names and email addresses\r\n\r\nSince we're planning on rebasing the history in the merged repositories, we can map your name and email address to new values as well. We primarily do this to support our friends in the LGBTQ+ community who have changed their names to reflect their identities. However, anybody is welcome to use this to change their email and name.\r\n\r\nWhatever your reason might be: we value your contributions and we hope this small gesture makes your life a little bit better. So if you changed your name/email – or simply prefer us to use different values – please [submit a request](mailto:dotnet@microsoft.com&subject=.NET%20repo%20consolidation%3A%20request%20for%20name%20change&body=Hey%2C%20%0A%0AI%E2%80%99d%20like%20to%20change%20my%20email%2Fdisplay%20name%20in%20the%20consolidated%20repo%20from%20%0A%0A%20%20%20%20%20%20%20%20My%20Old%20Name%20%3Cold.me%40example.org%3E%20%0A%0Ato%20%0A%0A%20%20%20%20%20%20%20%20My%20New%20Name%20%3Cnew.me%40example.org%3E%20%0A%0AThanks%21%20%0A).\r\n\r\n### More is coming\r\n\r\nWe'll share more updates in the upcoming months.
