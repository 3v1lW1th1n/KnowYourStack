Why simulation models are not part of models for machine learning? A simulation model like from MATLAB/Simulink, Amesim, Modellica, .... are basically a text based description (XML or sth else) in form of mathematical formulas for prediction. \r\n\r\nYou see - yeah maybe they look different but they are not too different from each others. A simulation model also has a signal flow / topology and parameters which need to be \"trained\" just like a neuronal network. This \"training\" is mostly done by measurement signals and by finding the parameter which produce the smallest error (like traditional regression problem). As you can see - like neuronal network. Actual in last years I often saw some articles which suggested neuronal networks for simulation - okay nice idea but .... if you think about car or airplane simulation .... such measurements are extrem expensive and most articles I saw did not connect physical laws with the network (which is a pity).\r\n\r\nI just ask myself - is such a model + parameter finding algorithm not also a kind of \"Learner\"? And if so - why most frameworks like Spark, Scikit etc. ignore them? If it is because there are too many model formats (file formats) - then just let you know : there is \"Functional Mockup Interface (FMI)\" --> a model format to rule all other formats. .NET brings different programming languages together, FMI brings different models. \r\n\r\nDo not see it as task or critical wish.

Prepare the data set once, so that it can be **re-used multiple times**.  As much as possible, any pre-training calculations should be done up front (or perhaps cached to be re-used).  For large data sets, the overhead of repeating this step each time is significant, taking as long or longer than the training itself.\r\n2. For algorithms with multiple training iterations, it should be straightforward to **retain the intermediate trained models** at each iteration (or at a specified set of iterations).  This way, it is then easy to compute metrics for the intermediate models on training and validation data sets, and ultimately select one of the intermediate models for use in production without having to re-run the training.\r\n\r\nFor example, consider training a LightGBM model.  This is the training method in `LightGbmTrainerBase.cs`:\r\n```\r\n        public void Train(RoleMappedData data)\r\n        {\r\n            Dataset dtrain;\r\n            CategoricalMetaData catMetaData;\r\n            using (var ch = Host.Start(\"Loading data for LightGBM\"))\r\n            {\r\n                using (var pch = Host.StartProgressChannel(\"Loading data for LightGBM\"))\r\n                    dtrain = LoadTrainingData(ch, data, out catMetaData);\r\n                ch.Done();\r\n            }\r\n            using (var ch = Host.Start(\"Training with LightGBM\"))\r\n            {\r\n                using (var pch = Host.StartProgressChannel(\"Training with LightGBM\"))\r\n                    TrainCore(ch, pch, dtrain, catMetaData);\r\n                ch.Done();\r\n            }\r\n            dtrain.Dispose();\r\n            DisposeParallelTraining();\r\n        }\r\n```\r\n\r\nIn order to address point 1) above, the `dtrain` object returned by `LoadTrainingData` should be available to be re-used.  This would require that the configuration parameters for data preparation are specified separately to those for training, instead of all thrown in together into the `LightGbmArguments` type.\r\n\r\nNow, in regards to point 2) above, note that the `TrainCore` method calls `WrappedLightGBMTraining.Train`, which has the following structure:\r\n```\r\n        public static Booster Train(IChannel ch, IProgressChannel pch,\r\n            Dictionary<string, object> parameters, Dataset dtrain, Dataset dvalid = null, int numIteration = 100,\r\n            bool verboseEval = true, int earlyStoppingRound = 0)\r\n        {\r\n            // create Booster.\r\n            Booster bst = new Booster(parameters, dtrain, dvalid);\r\n\r\n            for (int iter = 0; iter < numIteration; ++iter)\r\n            {\r\n                // training logic\r\n            }\r\n            return bst;\r\n        }\r\n```\r\nIn order to get the intermediate models, this method should return `Booster []` instead of just the final `Booster` (or perhaps instead in this case, the `Booster` object should support extraction of a prediction model which only contains the first `N` trees of the ensemble).\r\n\r\nPerhaps there is already the facility to do this in ML.Net, but I'm unable to find anything from my reading of the source or any of the examples.\r\n\r\nI think 99.9% of all machine learning research requires doing a parameter grid search at some stage, and hence this is essential functionality that should be as efficient as possible.","Url":"https://github.com/dotnet/machinelearning/issues/512","RelatedDescription":"Open issue \"Make grid search of parameter space more efficient\" (#512)"},{"Id":"339118249","IsPullRequest":false,"CreatedAt":"2018-07-09T22:59:41","Actor":"MrCSharp22","Number":"504","RawContent":null,"Title":"[BUG] Unable to load model file in MVC project.

Due to the nature of the changes, assuming we agree they are good ideas, it really makes sense that they ought to happen in one go, since they involve changes to the same core functionality.\r\n\r\nI am quite certain the first thing is a good idea, but the second thing I am less certain about. (Of course my confidence could be misplaced. :smile:) People that occur to me as potentially being good contributors to the discussion would be @eerhardt , @zeahmed , @shauheen , @ericstj , @glebuk . (To be clear, this is not exclusionary. Anyone can and should feel free to comment. I just want these people to get flagged is all. :smile: )\r\n\r\n## `ITrainer<TData, TPred>.Train` ought to return the predictor\r\n\r\nCurrently in order to train a predictor, there is a two step process. You call `ITrainer.Train` then call `ITrainer.GetPredictor`. As near as I can tell this arrangement was meant as some scheme to support [online training](https://github.com/dotnet/machinelearning/blob/828dc227f4d7346e11094479c7a2e443addc8102/src/Microsoft.ML.Core/Prediction/ITrainer.cs#L164), but of course that vision never came to pass, and if we were to actually support online training I have to imagine it would be through some separate interface anyway.\r\n\r\nThis arrangement seems unambiguously bad. It necessitates making `ITrainer` objects stateful for no particularly good reason. This complicates both the implementation and usage of the class, since (1) the caller can't do things like call `Train` multiple times even though a developer, seeing this interface, might reasonably suppose such a thing were possible and (2) the author of the `ITrainer` component has to protect against that misuse.\r\n\r\n## Get rid of `IValidatingTrainer`, `IIncrementalTrainer`, `IValidatingIncrementalTrainer`\r\n\r\n### The problem\r\n\r\nFirst let's talk about the problem...\r\n\r\nMost (all?) trainers implement `ITrainer<RoleMappedData>`, based on this interface here.\r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/dotnet/machinelearning/blob/828dc227f4d7346e11094479c7a2e443addc8102/src/Microsoft.ML.Core/Prediction/ITrainer.cs#L105\r\n\r\nWe have historically followed adding more inputs to the training process by declaring specialized interfaces that represent the Cartesian product of all possible permutations of inputs, as we see:\r\n\r\n* There was a discussion about adding a validation set. So we *doubled* the number of interfaces to two, `ITrainer`, and `IValidatingTrainer`.\r\n\r\n* Later on there was a discussion about adding continued training based on an initialization. So we again doubled the number of interfaces, introducing `IIncrementalTrainer` and `IValidatingIncrementalTrainer`.\r\n\r\n* There have been discussions of adding a test set to allow computing metrics as training progresses. Following the same strategy we would of course again double the number of interfaces (the full set being represented, perhaps, by `IValidatingIncrementalTestingTrainer`), for a total of eight.\r\n\r\n* If hypothetically we were to somehow allow for one more input beyond that, we'd have a total of sixteen interfaces.\r\n\r\nEtc. etc. That there is this exponential cost makes clear something is misdesigned. This has cost not only here and in the implementations of `ITrainer`, but in the usage as well. [Here we see a method that explores the cartesian product of possible interfaces so it can call the right one.](https://github.com/dotnet/machinelearning/blob/828dc227f4d7346e11094479c7a2e443addc8102/src/Microsoft.ML.Data/Commands/TrainCommand.cs#L287) It seems to me something is wrong here when just calling \"train\" requires a fairly non-obvious utility method to make sure we call the \"right\" train.\r\n\r\nThis issue incidentally is the primary reason why we haven't done anything like add support for test set metrics during training (despite the many requests). That is, it is not any technical difficulty with the idea itself, it's just that writing such a thing would make the code unmaintainable.\r\n\r\n### The possible solution(s)\r\n\r\n***So***: instead we might just have one interface, with one required input (the training dataset), and all these other things are optional.\r\n\r\nThere are two obvious ways I could imagine doing this, first explicitly as part of the method signature on `ITrainer<...>`:\r\n\r\n```csharp\r\npublic interface ITrainer<TDataset, TPredictor> {\r\n    TPredictor Train(TDataset train, TDataset validation = null, TDataset testSet = null, IPredictor initPredictor = null); }\r\n```\r\n\r\nOr else have some sort of context object. (I'm not married to any of these names, to be clear. :smile: )\r\n\r\n```csharp\r\npublic sealed class TrainContext {\r\n    public RoleMappedData Train { get; }\r\n    public RoleMappedData Validation { get; }\r\n    public RoleMappedData Test { get; }\r\n    public IPredictor InitPredictor { get; }\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nand all trainers implement `ITrainer<TrainContext>` instead of `ITrainer<RoleMappedData>`.\r\n\r\nThe latter is perhaps a bit more awkward since it involves the addition of a new abstraction (the hypothetical `TrainContext`), but it is more flexible in a forward-looking sense, since if we add more \"stuff\" to how we initialize trainers, we won't break all existing `ITrainer` implementations. (My expectation is that trainers that can't support something would simply ignore.)","Url":"https://github.com/dotnet/machinelearning/issues/509","RelatedDescription":"Open issue \"Direct API discussion: ITrainer proposed changes\" (#509)"},{"Id":"339362364","IsPullRequest":false,"CreatedAt":"2018-07-09T08:59:52","Actor":"petterton","Number":"508","RawContent":null,"Title":"How to mix categorical and numerical features in LightGbm?","State":"open","Body":"I am implementing a LightGBM example where I have a mix of categorical and numerical features, and can't figure how this should be done in ML.NET.\r\n\r\nIn Python, LightGBM accepts a 'categorical_feature' parameter, giving the possibility to specify if a feature should be handled as categorical or numerical/ordinal.
