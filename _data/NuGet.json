As we [announced](https://blog.nuget.org/20170907/Changes-to-NuGet-dot-org-service-management-and-performance-improvements-in-China.html) two weeks ago, the NuGet.org service is now a part of Microsoft. The NuGet open source codebase (both the NuGet gallery and the NuGet client) will remain open source and continue as .NET Foundation supported projects under the same terms as before.\r\n\r\nWe encourage you to read the full [Terms of Use](https://www.nuget.org/policies/Terms) and [Privacy Statement](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkId=521839), as well as the [blog post](https://blog.nuget.org/20170907/Changes-to-NuGet-dot-org-service-management-and-performance-improvements-in-China.html) about the changes. For your convenience, below is a quick summary.\r\n\r\nThere are no changes to the way you publish and consume packages from NuGet.org. The Terms of Use and Privacy Statement have been updated to reflect the change in ownership, as well as how Microsoft will process the data collected, and manage copyright and trademark infringement notices.\r\n\r\nOur goal is to provide an agile and reliable global service, and we remain fully committed to ensuring a healthy and open ecosystem around NuGet. The .NET Foundation and Microsoft want NuGet to meet the evolving needs of our community. For questions about our policies, please contact us by email at [feedback@nuget.org](mailto:feedback@nuget.org?subject=Regarding%20updates%20to%20the%20NuGet.org%20Terms%20of%20Use)."},{"Id":"6627163117","Type":"IssuesEvent","CreatedAt":"2017-09-22T23:24:56","Actor":"karann-msft","Repository":"NuGet/Announcements","Organization":"NuGet","RawContent":null,"RelatedAction":"opened","RelatedUrl":"https://github.com/NuGet/Announcements/issues/7","RelatedDescription":"Opened issue \"Package Immutability\" (#7) at NuGet/Announcements","RelatedBody":"The feature spec for the feature **Package Immutability** is ready for **review**:\r\n\r\n| Spec wiki| Discussion issue| \r\n| :------------- |:-------------| \r\n|[NuGet/Home/wiki/Package-Immutability](https://github.com/NuGet/Home/wiki/Package-Immutability)|https://github.com/NuGet/Home/issues/5917|"},{"Id":"6593148392","Type":"IssuesEvent","CreatedAt":"2017-09-14T23:05:19","Actor":"karann-msft","Repository":"NuGet/Announcements","Organization":"NuGet","RawContent":null,"RelatedAction":"opened","RelatedUrl":"https://github.com/NuGet/Announcements/issues/6","RelatedDescription":"Opened issue \"Author Package Signing\" (#6) at NuGet/Announcements","RelatedBody":"The feature spec for the feature **Author Package Signing** is ready for **review**:\r\n\r\n| Spec wiki| Discussion issue| \r\n| :------------- |:-------------| \r\n| [NuGet/Home/wiki/Author-Package-Signing](https://github.com/NuGet/Home/wiki/Author-Package-Signing) | https://github.com/NuGet/Home/issues/5889|"},{"Id":"6591956734","Type":"IssuesEvent","CreatedAt":"2017-09-14T17:58:22","Actor":"karann-msft","Repository":"NuGet/Announcements","Organization":"NuGet","RawContent":null,"RelatedAction":"opened","RelatedUrl":"https://github.com/NuGet/Announcements/issues/5","RelatedDescription":"Opened issue \"Feature: Package applicability in NuGet package manager UI\" (#5) at NuGet/Announcements","RelatedBody":"The feature spec for the feature **Package applicability in NuGet package manager UI** is ready for **review**:\r\n\r\n| Spec wiki| Discussion issue| \r\n| :------------- |:-------------| \r\n| [NuGet/Home/wiki/Package-applicability-in-NuGet-package-manager-UI](https://github.com/NuGet/Home/wiki/Package-applicability-in-NuGet-package-manager-UI) | https://github.com/NuGet/Home/issues/5725|"},{"Id":"6581243956","Type":"IssuesEvent","CreatedAt":"2017-09-12T17:38:11","Actor":"anangaur","Repository":"NuGet/Announcements","Organization":"NuGet","RawContent":null,"RelatedAction":"opened","RelatedUrl":"https://github.com/NuGet/Announcements/issues/4","RelatedDescription":"Opened issue \"Feature: Organizations on NuGet.org\" (#4) at NuGet/Announcements","RelatedBody":"The feature spec for the feature **Organizations on NuGet.org** is ready for **review**:\r\n\r\n| Spec wiki| Discussion issue| \r\n| :------------- |:-------------| \r\n| [NuGet/Home/wiki/Organizations-on-NuGet.org](https://github.com/NuGet/Home/wiki/Organizations-on-NuGet.org) | https://github.com/NuGet/NuGetGallery/issues/4627|"},{"Id":"6581236088","Type":"IssuesEvent","CreatedAt":"2017-09-12T17:36:22","Actor":"anangaur","Repository":"NuGet/Announcements","Organization":"NuGet","RawContent":null,"RelatedAction":"opened","RelatedUrl":"https://github.com/NuGet/Announcements/issues/3","RelatedDescription":"Opened issue \"Feature: 2 Factor Auth for NuGet.org sign in\" (#3) at NuGet/Announcements","RelatedBody":"The feature spec for the feature **2 Factor Auth for NuGet.org sign in** is ready for **review**:\r\n\r\n| Spec wiki| Discussion issue| \r\n| :------------- |:-------------| \r\n| [NuGet/Home/wiki/2-Factor-Auth-for-NuGet.org-sign-in](https://github.com/NuGet/Home/wiki/2-Factor-Auth-for-NuGet.org-sign-in) | https://github.com/NuGet/NuGetGallery/issues/3252|\r\n"},{"Id":"6567680066","Type":"IssuesEvent","CreatedAt":"2017-09-08T17:27:26","Actor":"anangaur","Repository":"NuGet/Announcements","Organization":"NuGet","RawContent":null,"RelatedAction":"opened","RelatedUrl":"https://github.com/NuGet/Announcements/issues/2","RelatedDescription":"Opened issue \"Changes to NuGet.org service management, and performance improvements in China\" (#2) at NuGet/Announcements","RelatedBody":"For details and discussions, please refer to the blog:\r\n[Changes to NuGet.org service management, and performance improvements in China](https://blog.nuget.org/20170907/Changes-to-NuGet-dot-org-service-management-and-performance-improvements-in-China.html)"}],"ResultType":"GitHubEvent"},"Twitter":{"ResultType":"TwitterTimeline","Tweets":[{"Id":"908469327979962368","CreatedAt":"2017-09-14T23:15:40+00:00","UserScreenname":"nuget","Text":"Signed packages coming to NuGet soon - we'd love to hear your feedback!
