In this particular case the problem is that the `history` object is not present.\r\n\r\nThis was not really a problem before, `history` was `undefined` and it didn't really matter. The current behavior is different. When an app tries to access the `history` object it completely crashes. A polyfill cannot be implemented either because of this.\r\n\r\nIt would seem the solution to this problem should be simply to stick to hash mode, but Vue Router still tries to access `history` even in hash mode. I imagine this is done to check whether the history API is present, but since hash mode is already specified, those checks are unnecessary.\r\n\r\nA couple of months ago I hacked my way through this by modifying Vue Router.
