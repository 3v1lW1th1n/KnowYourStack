Use Jest for unit testing.\r\n- Create a `mounted()` lifecycle hook in the HelloWorld.vue component.\r\n- Within `mounted()`, directly manipulate the `msg` prop to cause Vue to generate an error.\r\n- Run the default `example.spec.js` test using `npm run test:unit`.\r\n\r\n### What is expected?\r\nThe test should fail due to the error generated when directly manipulating the `msg` prop.\r\n\r\n### What is actually happening?\r\nVue catches the error and uses `console.error` to display it.  Because `console.error` does not fail Jest tests, the test pass despite the error thrown.\r\n\r\n![bug](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/8070528/48666488-99b49280-ea88-11e8-8fa8-b6d54d3a5136.jpg)\r\n\r\n---\r\nThe underlying problem is that Vue is trying to determine whether it is appropriate to catch and `console.error` an error or allow the error to remain uncaught based on if Vue believes it is in a browser. Unfortunately, because Jest emulates the browser environment, error handling does not function as intended and tests will succeed inappropriately.\r\n\r\nA fix for this would be to also check whether Vue is in a Node environment before catching the error.  This would allow Jest tests to operate as intended, and maintain the behavior of error handling in the browser.\r\n\r\nAnother fix would be to re-throw the error if `process.env.NODE_ENV === \"test\"`.\r\n\r\n<!-- generated by vue-issues.

That means the convenience is unavailable for computed properties that rely on Vuex state and methods that dispatch Vuex actions, which is a big limitation.\r\n\r\n- It requires tight coupling of components to Vuex modules, which I've found doesn't scale well to large apps. Instead, I've found it very useful to _never_ use the `mapXXX` helpers directly in my components, but in a [state helpers file](https://github.com/chrisvfritz/vue-enterprise-boilerplate/blob/master/src/state/helpers.js), which describes the public interfaces for all Vuex modules. From this file, I'll import the concerns I care about into individual components. For example:\r\n  ```js\r\n  import {\r\n    authComputed,\r\n    notificationsComputed,\r\n    notificationsMethods,\r\n    searchMethods,\r\n  } from '@state/helpers'\r\n\r\n  // ...\r\n\r\n  computed: {\r\n    ...authComputed,\r\n    ...notificationsComputed,\r\n  },\r\n  methods: {\r\n    ...notificationsMethods,\r\n    ...searchMethods,\r\n  },\r\n  ```\r\n  This prevents verbose and duplicated `mapXXX` code in components, replaced by a nice list of the global concerns this component cares about. But the benefit _really_ comes in when adding new state/getters/actions or when refactoring a Vuex module. For example, if I add a new `userLoggedIn` getter to `authComputed`, it will automatically be available in any component using `authComputed`. Or, if I rename some state or split it out into additional modules, the state helpers file allows the refactor to be done in two steps: first on the Vuex side, while updating the state helpers for compatibility, _then_ in my components (if I actually want the public interface to change as well).\r\n\r\nFor these reasons, I feel like the `mapXXX` helpers should stay and the scoped slot pattern should actually be avoided. What are others' thoughts?
