Pushes the NuGet package to NuGet.org\r\n2. Pushes the Symbols package (if present in the same folder) to SymbolSource.org (https://nuget.smbsrc.net)\r\n\r\nIf Step 2 fails, the NuGet package is already pushed to NuGet.org but the push operation returns failure. This response is not entirely correct as the primary package push did pass and any subsequent push retry by the user will be rejected by NuGet.org as the package (with version) is already present on NuGet.org. \r\n\r\n### Proposal\r\n\r\n#### Disable auto-push of symbols package to SymbolSource.org\r\nSince the 2 pushes (as mentioned above) are non-atomic (they operate independently), it makes sense to separate out these steps. This will help users identify the failure and only retry the failing operation.\r\nWe have also seen frequent issues where SymbolSource.org becomes unreachable. The project is not being actively maintained. Of late, there is  [an issue](https://github.com/NuGet/Home/issues/6082) where the SSL certificate for https://nuget.smbsrc.net is invalid (expired).  Though we are working on getting this fixed by SymbolSource.org, there is no ETA on the fix.\r\n\r\nThis solution would not prevent users to use the Symbol Server of their choice. They can continue to push symbols package separately as follows:\r\n\r\n```\r\n> nuget push MyPackage.symbols.nupkg -source <symbol server endpoint>\r\n```\r\n\r\nTo summarize, the changes proposed here are:\r\n1. Stop auto push of symbols package to SymbolSource when the symbols package (.symbols.nupkg) is present in the same folder as NuGet package (.nupkg)\r\n2. Stop defaulting to SymbolSource while pushing Symbols package.\r\n\r\n### Next steps\r\n\r\nThe NuGet team is working on improving the debugging and symbols experience holistically.

The NuGet open source codebase (both the NuGet gallery and the NuGet client) will remain open source and continue as .NET Foundation supported projects under the same terms as before.\r\n\r\nWe encourage you to read the full [Terms of Use](https://www.nuget.org/policies/Terms) and [Privacy Statement](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkId=521839), as well as the [blog post](https://blog.nuget.org/20170907/Changes-to-NuGet-dot-org-service-management-and-performance-improvements-in-China.html) about the changes. For your convenience, below is a quick summary.\r\n\r\nThere are no changes to the way you publish and consume packages from NuGet.org. The Terms of Use and Privacy Statement have been updated to reflect the change in ownership, as well as how Microsoft will process the data collected, and manage copyright and trademark infringement notices.\r\n\r\nOur goal is to provide an agile and reliable global service, and we remain fully committed to ensuring a healthy and open ecosystem around NuGet. The .NET Foundation and Microsoft want NuGet to meet the evolving needs of our community.
