It looks like the csproj file is being reverted to an earlier state when adding a NuGet package. In my case I added a NuGet package, and couldn't open the csproj in VS2019. I closed VS, made other changes to the csproj outside of VS, then commited to source control. I noticed the package wasn't added, so added it via VS2019. It didn't add the package, but it did revert my csproj file to the state before VS2019 was opened.<br><br>I was able to work around this by<br>1. Close VS2019<br>2. Delete the \".vs\" folder<br>3. Open VS2019, add the NuGet package<br>4.
