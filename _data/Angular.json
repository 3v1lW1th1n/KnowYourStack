The dev server as written only currently works with package managers that hoist the `events` shim package to an accessible location.  Hoisting is unfortunately not standardized and the assumption within the dev server will not hold true for all package managers. The actual code is only accessed when hmr is enabled which allows the 'events' import to be ignored in the non-hmr case.\r\n\r\nCloses #13680","Url":"https://github.com/angular/angular-cli/pull/13725","RelatedDescription":"Open PR \"fix(@angular-devkit/build-angular): shim node events builtin for dev server\" (#13725)"},{"Id":"412426355","IsPullRequest":false,"CreatedAt":"2019-02-20T18:14:21","Actor":"artuska","Number":"13721","RawContent":null,"Title":"Can't resolve 'router.ngfactory'","State":"closed","Body":"```\r\nERROR in ./src/app/app.module.ngfactory.js\r\nModule not found: Error: Can't resolve '../../node_modules/@angular/router/router.ngfactory' in '/private/var/www/balu/balumates-ru-frontend/src/app'\r\n```\r\n\r\nThis error throws all the time i run `ng build --configuration=production` with `\"aot\": true`.\r\n\r\nThis error throws all the time i run `ng serve --aot`.\r\n\r\nAngular — 7.2.5 // any version above 7\r\nAngular CLI — 7.3.2 // any version above 7\r\nTypeScript — 3.2.4","Url":"https://github.com/angular/angular-cli/issues/13721","RelatedDescription":"Closed issue \"Can't resolve 'router.ngfactory'\" (#13721)"},{"Id":"412497196","IsPullRequest":false,"CreatedAt":"2019-02-20T15:52:36","Actor":"patrickhrastnik","Number":"13723","RawContent":null,"Title":"Please update build-angular's dependency of webpack-dev-server to 3.2.0","State":"open","Body":"<!--🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅\r\n\r\nOh hi there! 😄\r\n\r\nTo expedite issue processing please search open and closed issues before submitting a new one.\r\nExisting issues often contain information about workarounds, resolution, or progress updates.\r\n\r\n🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅-->\r\n\r\n\r\n# 🚀 Feature request\r\n\r\n\r\n### Command (mark with an `x`)\r\n<!-- Can you pin-point the command or commands that are relevant for this feature request? -->\r\n<!-- ✍️edit: -->\r\n```\r\n- [ ] new\r\n- [ ] build\r\n- [ ] serve\r\n- [ ] test\r\n- [ ] e2e\r\n- [ ] generate\r\n- [ ] add\r\n- [ ] update\r\n- [ ] lint\r\n- [ ] xi18n\r\n- [ ] run\r\n- [ ] config\r\n- [ ] help\r\n- [ ] version\r\n- [ ] doc\r\n```\r\n\r\n### Description\r\n<!-- ✍️--> A clear and concise description of the problem or missing capability...\r\n\r\nwebpack-dev-server@3.2.0 (indirectly) supports AIX systems (because its dependencies support AIX systems after some changes).\r\n@angular-devkit/build-angular strictly requires webpack-dev-server@3.1.14 - That's why the changes of v3.2.0 are not pulled when installing an angular project via npm.\r\nSo I'm not able to install the angular dependencies on the AIX system.\r\n\r\n### Describe the solution you'd like\r\n<!-- ✍️--> If you have a solution in mind, please describe it.\r\n\r\nCould you please update the dependency of webpack-dev-server to 3.2.0 so I can use angular on AIX?

This was an important improvement, however, I am still missing a smarter build command that would `build` all the projects in a correct sequence. And the same is applicable to `test` command.\r\n\r\n**What does the correct sequence mean**\r\nUsually in a bigger monorepo workspaces developed packages can have dependencies on one another, which means that simple alphabetical order of build/test will not work.\r\n\r\n**Example**\r\n\r\n```bash\r\nLibraries & dependencies\r\n├── Library 1\r\n│   ├── Library 3\r\n├── Library 2\r\n│   ├── Library 3\r\n├── Library3\r\n```\r\n\r\nIn the example above current sequence of `ng test` would be `Library 1 - Library 2 - Library 3`, but the correct sequence would be `Library 3 - Library 1 - Library 2`\r\n\r\n\r\n### Describe the solution you'd like\r\nEvery project in a workspace already contains `package.json` (_obviously_). We could use `peerDependencies` to declare the dependencies between projects of the workspace. Then `build` and `test` commands would be able to detect the dependencies and build the libraries in the correct sequence.\r\n\r\nI have written myself a node executable that does exactly that. Follows the dependency tree and builds the libraries in the correct sequence.\r\nIf that is something you see as a valuable addition to Angular CLI I would be more than happy to contribute.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Describe alternatives you've considered\r\nCurrently, the only alternative is to write `ng build` commands in an npm script, which is practically unmaintainable in bigger workspaces.\r\n","Url":"https://github.com/angular/angular-cli/issues/13722","RelatedDescription":"Closed issue \"Build and test all projects in the correct sequence following dependencies.\" (#13722)"},{"Id":"412329192","IsPullRequest":false,"CreatedAt":"2019-02-20T09:59:28","Actor":"Destreyf","Number":"13719","RawContent":null,"Title":"Typo/missing quotes in vscode extension json template file.","State":"closed","Body":"# 🐞 Bug report\r\n\r\nI was reading the change log, and happened to see the mention of vscode extensions, being interested in what you might be recommended i went and read through the changes and found a typo/missing quotation on the tslint recommendation.\r\n\r\nthe file is here: https://github.com/angular/angular-cli/blob/master/packages/schematics/angular/workspace/files/__dot__vscode/extensions.json.template","Url":"https://github.com/angular/angular-cli/issues/13719","RelatedDescription":"Closed issue \"Typo/missing quotes in vscode extension json template file.\" (#13719)"}],"ResultType":"GitHubIssue"},"material2-Issues":{"Issues":[{"Id":"413620490","IsPullRequest":false,"CreatedAt":"2019-02-22T23:41:14","Actor":"benlesh","Number":"15285","RawContent":null,"Title":"Make filter bar chips editable","State":"closed","Body":"Copy/pasted from: https://b.corp.google.com/issues/112596639\r\n\r\nThe chips are not editable. it would be nice to be able to click on a chip to edit the value. right now i have to delete the chip and add it back with a different value, which also messes up the order of the chips.","Url":"https://github.com/angular/material2/issues/15285","RelatedDescription":"Closed issue \"Make filter bar chips editable\" (#15285)"},{"Id":"413582302","IsPullRequest":false,"CreatedAt":"2019-02-22T21:16:11","Actor":"simeyla","Number":"15284","RawContent":null,"Title":"Mat-progress-bar should gradually appear and disappear, as per material.io spec","State":"open","Body":"#### Please describe the feature you would like to request.\r\nThe material.io design spec for [progress indicators](https://material.io/design/components/progress-indicators.html#) has an ingenious solution to the problem of showing a progress bar that only appears for a fraction of a second.

This is especially important when the progress bar represents a frequent operation with an unknown duration.\r\n\r\nThis behavior would not apply to all progress bar modes.

It is possible that contrasting styles/different themes are applied (see primary vs. secondary in material design https://material.io/design/color/the-color-system.html#color-theme-creation). We should be able to apply contrasting styles to material elements in different components.
