Was not seeing this behavior in CLI 1.2.6 but am seeing it in 7.3.7\r\n\r\n### Description\r\n\r\nI am running lint, test and build simultaneously using the npm concurrently package.  This has always worked in ngcli 1.2.6.   When one of the tasks fails, concurrently issues a SIGTERM to the other tasks (fail fast), and the other tasks should shut down gracefully.  In 7.3.7 this results in an error in `ng test`. \r\n\r\nWhat is making this issue bad for me, is that when running this in a docker build (node:10.15.3-alpine) on a gitlab runner, the docker build just hangs, possibly in an infinite loop.  The gitlab runner never releases.    \r\n\r\nWhen I run the demo from macOS, I do get back to a comment prompt.  I can't explain the discrepancy.\r\n\r\n## 🔬 Minimal Reproduction\r\nThe basic reproduction steps are to use concurrently to run `ng test` and then `process.exit(1)` in another concurrently run task _after_ the tests have started to run.\r\n\r\nPlease run `npm run demo` in this reproduction.  \r\nhttps://github.com/rcollette/ngcli-test-sigterm-demo\r\n\r\nKeep in mind that the timeout in sigterm.js may need to be adjusted.   On my machine 10s was enough time to get the tests started but before they finish.\r\n\r\n## 🔥 Exception or Error\r\nOutput from an actual application build.\r\n<pre>\r\n<code>\r\n> concurrently --kill-others-on-fail \"npm:lint\" \"npm:test:server\" \"npm:build:server\" \r\n\r\n[test:server] \r\n[test:server] > embark3-ui@0.0.0 test:server /build\r\n[test:server] > ng test --code-coverage --source-map --watch=false --progress=false\r\n[test:server] \r\n[lint] \r\n[lint] > embark3-ui@0.0.0 lint /build\r\n[lint] > ng lint --type-check\r\n[lint] \r\n[build:server] \r\n[build:server] > embark3-ui@0.0.0 build:server /build\r\n[build:server] > ng build --progress=false --prod --aot --source-map --es5-browser-support=false\r\n[build:server] \r\n[lint] Linting \"embark3-ui\"...\r\n[lint] \r\n[lint] ERROR: /build/src/app/shared/modals/entitlement/entitlement-modal.component.spec.ts:67:9 - Expected property shorthand in object literal ('{startDate}').\r\n[lint] ERROR: /build/src/app/shared/modals/entitlement/entitlement-modal.component.spec.ts:68:9 - Expected property shorthand in object literal ('{endDate}').\r\n[lint] \r\n[lint] Lint errors found in the listed files.\r\n[lint] Linting \"embark3-ui-e2e\"...\r\n[lint] \r\n[lint] \r\n[lint] All files pass linting.\r\n[lint] npm ERR! code ELIFECYCLE\r\n[lint] npm ERR! errno 1\r\n[lint] npm ERR! embark3-ui@0.0.0 lint: `ng lint --type-check`\r\n[lint] npm ERR!
