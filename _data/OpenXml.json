We are using Open XML SDK version 2.5 to do some document merging in our application, and as standard is fine, however, if the Mergefield contains any sort of formatting in the .DOCX, eg bold, italics font change,  Word is automatically converting it, from a simple mergefield to a complex mergefield.\r\n\r\nWhen we run our code we’re parsing the XML for Mergefield XML Elements, but it’s not finding the complex mergefields, so the merge is not working. It just brings over the field in plain text eg [[CO_COMPANYNAME]] as opposed to the actual data.\r\n\r\nThanks\r\n\r\n"},{"Id":"6774163242","Type":"IssuesEvent","CreatedAt":"2017-10-27T09:20:25","Actor":"ukalhapu","Repository":"OfficeDev/Open-XML-SDK","Organization":"OfficeDev","RawContent":null,"RelatedAction":"opened","RelatedUrl":"https://github.com/OfficeDev/Open-XML-SDK/issues/274","RelatedDescription":"Opened

fine.\r\n\r\nWe internally reached out to the Escalation from Open XML SDK team and they have informed that Open XML SDK is open source project and not supported by Microsoft officially and is community driven.\r\n\r\nThey have requested you to please open an issue here (https://github.com/OfficeDev/Open-Xml-Sdk/issues ) and they will take it up from here as it is open source now.\r\n\r\nPlease let me know if you have any query for me.\r\n\r\nThanks,\r\nAbhinav\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"},{"Id":"6767512014","Type":"IssuesEvent","CreatedAt":"2017-10-26T03:51:48","Actor":"KPVPAPARAO","Repository":"OfficeDev/Open-XML-SDK","Organization":"OfficeDev","RawContent":null,"RelatedAction":"opened","RelatedUrl":"https://github.com/OfficeDev/Open-XML-SDK/issues/273","RelatedDescription":"Opened
