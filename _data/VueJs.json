It is impossible to actually focus the input. This is bizarre because the element is the exact same DOM node, you can confirm via logging, and that's what `key` is there to ensure.\r\n\r\n---\r\nThis example looks silly but it's a real problem when you start trying to build things like autocomplete components, where you want to render an invisible clickable backdrop to add simple \"click away\" behavior (this is how GitHub does click away, it's the only bullet proof approach I've found especially when you start using portals as well) and you also need to render the autocomplete dropdown when the input is focused.\r\n\r\n<!-- generated by vue-issues.

Ideally, $emit would be expanded to allow for bubbling to be manually controlled by the developer (As JS intends them to be done) by accepting something akin to the `customEventInit` object, this would include the added benefit of enabling ALL JS event specific features in the $emit method...\r\n\r\n<!-- generated by vue-issues.

However, in TypeScript, I get a warning because I need to pre-declare the typings for `$refs` at the top of the component, i.e.:\r\n\r\n```\r\npublic readonly $refs!: {\r\n  myComponent: VueComponent\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nWhen you log `this.$refs.myComponent` when the parent/consuming component is mounted to the console, you will see that it returns a Vue component instance. This is incompatible with the pre-existing typings for `$refs`, which only allows the following types: `Vue | Element | Vue[] | Element[]`. \r\n\r\nI propose that the typings for `$refs` by extended to:\r\n\r\n```\r\n{ [key: string]: Vue | Element | Component | Vue[] | Element[] | Component[] }\r\n```\r\n\r\n<!-- generated by vue-issues.

This would prevent unintended reading or manipulation of state which should be done through getters or actions/mutations respectively. As far as I know, there is no good way to achieve this today in Vuex.\r\n\r\n### What does the proposed API look like?\r\nThe API could look something like this:\r\n\r\nA store:\r\n```javascript\r\n{\r\n  state() {\r\n    return {\r\n      somethingPublic: ''\r\n    };\r\n  },\r\n\r\n  privateState() {\r\n    return {\r\n      somethingPrivate: []\r\n    };\r\n  },\r\n\r\n  getters: {\r\n    filtered: (state, getters, privateState) => privateState.somethingPrivate.filter(...)\r\n  }\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nIn a component:\r\n```javascript\r\n// works:\r\nthis.$store.state.somethingPublic\r\nthis.$store.getters.filtered\r\n// doesn't work:\r\nthis.$store.state.somethingPrivate\r\nthis.$store.privateState.somethingPrivate\r\n```\r\n\r\nThanks.\r\n\r\n<!-- generated by vue-issues.
