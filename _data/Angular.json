It also includes a tiny fix: ``only back up the original `prepublishOnly` script and not the overwritten one``\r\n\r\nSee the individual commit messages for more details.\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n**Notes on testing**\r\n\r\nI have added unit tests for all added/modified code except for the `ClusterMaster` class, because:\r\n- It mostly orchestrates other parts (that are independently tested).\r\n- The most important parts of its functionality are covered by integration tests.\r\n- I didn't want to spend too much time on testing it before a first review (in case the implementation changed drastically).\r\n\r\nThe integration tests at [ngcc/test/integration/ngcc_spec.ts](https://github.com/angular/angular/blob/f5bec3ff5/packages/compiler-cli/ngcc/test/integration/ngcc_spec.ts), which are run under bazel, don't play well with spawning multiple processes, so they are only run on one process (which means they don't exercise the `ClusterExecutor`).\r\n\r\nThe integration tests at [integration/ngcc/test.sh](https://github.com/angular/angular/blob/f5bec3ff5/integration/ngcc/test.sh) do run in parallel mode (and only in that mode, since that is the only option with `ivy-ngcc`).\r\n\r\nOther than that, I have manually verified that `ngcc` can successfully build angular.io in parallel mode (with various command-line argument combinations) and that the resulting `node_modules/`are identical to those produced in sync mode with the following exceptions:\r\n- `package.json > __processed_by_ivy_ngcc__` might have properties in different order.\r\n    _This is expected, since now the order is which tests are run/completed is different and non-deterministic._\r\n- Some generated variable names can be different (mostly(/only?) noticed in UMD bundles). E.g. `data_r50` vs `data_r450`.\r\n    _Not sure why that is and whether it is problematic._\r\n\r\n##\r\n**Notes on performance**\r\n\r\nFor processing angular.io, I have observed speed improvement between 1.8x (on my Windows laptop - 7 workers) to 2.6x (on Linux CI - 8 workers). This was a little surprizing, since task processing (which runs on multiple processes) takes up 80%-90% and all workers are busy most of the time (i.e. there are rarely idle workers).\r\n\r\nMore investigation is needed to better understand/improve those numbers, but this can happen after the PR lands.\r\n\r\nFun fact:\r\nThere doesn't seem to be much improvement above 4 workers. Even with up to 20 workers on CI, the duration was the same (if not worse: 29s vs 23s).\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n**TODO**\r\n\r\n- [ ] Get the PR reviewed.\r\n- [ ] Determine whether the differences in variable names (in UMD bundles?) are an issue.\r\n- [ ] Determine whether we need unit tests for `ClusterMaster`.\r\n","Url":"https://github.com/angular/angular/pull/32427","RelatedDescription":"Open PR \"perf(ngcc): add support for parallel execution of tasks\" (#32427)"},{"Id":"487670834","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2019-08-30T21:05:38","Actor":"rkirov","Number":"32425","RawContent":null,"Title":"refactor(benchpress): remove two mutable exports from largetable/util.ts","State":"open","Body":"Mutable exports, i.e. using this pattern\r\n\r\n```\r\nexport let x = 0;\r\nexport function f() {\r\n  x += 1;\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nis problematic to transpile to CommonJS and Goog.module systems, we are\r\nworking on banning it google internal codebase.

Since that issue has been closed, I am creating a new issue.\r\n\r\nWhen we set `\"bundleDependencies\": \"all\",` in `angular.json` file, which we normally do for SSR/Universal apps (specifically for .net/.net core applications its required), and also have `\"optimization\": true,`. The generated bundle throws below error:\r\n\r\n```\r\nNodeInvocationException: StaticInjectorError(AppServerModule)[InjectionToken Application Initializer -> InjectionToken DocumentToken]: \r\nStaticInjectorError(Platform: core)[InjectionToken Application Initializer -> InjectionToken DocumentToken]: \r\nRight-hand side of 'instanceof' is not an object\r\nTypeError: StaticInjectorError(AppServerModule)[InjectionToken Application Initializer -> InjectionToken DocumentToken]: \r\nStaticInjectorError(Platform: core)[InjectionToken Application Initializer -> InjectionToken DocumentToken]: \r\nRight-hand side of 'instanceof' is not an object\r\n```\r\n\r\nI believe the reason of this is the compress and mangle option of `terser` plugin.\r\n\r\nIf we set `--keep-fnames` for `terser` plugin for server bundles or when using `\"bundleDependencies\": \"all\"`, this issue can be resolved.\r\n\r\n> `--keep-fnames`  Do not mangle/drop function names.  Useful for code relying on Function.prototype.name.\r\n\r\nI have verified this and it works as mentioned here https://github.com/angular/angular-cli/issues/8616#issuecomment-526843717\r\n","Url":"https://github.com/angular/angular-cli/issues/15498","RelatedDescription":"Open issue \"Fix for 2 years old issue StaticInjectorError error when `--bundle-dependencies=all` \" (#15498)"},{"Id":"487780238","IsPullRequest":false,"CreatedAt":"2019-08-31T15:17:34","Actor":"mohammedzamakhan","Number":"15497","RawContent":null,"Title":"Dynamic Lazy Loading using imports with dynamic path is not supported","State":"open","Body":"<!--üîÖüîÖüîÖüîÖüîÖüîÖüîÖüîÖüîÖüîÖüîÖüîÖüîÖüîÖüîÖüîÖüîÖüîÖüîÖüîÖüîÖüîÖüîÖüîÖüîÖüîÖüîÖüîÖüîÖüîÖüîÖ\r\n\r\nOh hi there! üòÑ\r\n\r\nTo expedite issue processing please search open and closed issues before submitting a new one.\r\nExisting issues often contain information about workarounds, resolution, or progress updates.\r\n\r\nüîÖüîÖüîÖüîÖüîÖüîÖüîÖüîÖüîÖüîÖüîÖüîÖüîÖüîÖüîÖüîÖüîÖüîÖüîÖüîÖüîÖüîÖüîÖüîÖüîÖüîÖüîÖüîÖüîÖüîÖüîÖüîÖüîÖ-->\r\n\r\n\r\n# üêû Bug report\r\n\r\n### Command (mark with an `x`)\r\n<!-- Can you pin-point the command or commands that are effected by this bug? -->\r\n<!-- ‚úçÔ∏èedit: -->\r\n```\r\n- [ ] new\r\n- [x] build\r\n- [x] serve\r\n- [ ] test\r\n- [ ] e2e\r\n- [ ] generate\r\n- [ ] add\r\n- [ ] update\r\n- [ ] lint\r\n- [ ] xi18n\r\n- [ ] run\r\n- [ ] config\r\n- [ ] help\r\n- [ ] version\r\n- [ ] doc\r\n```\r\n\r\n### Is this a regression?\r\n\r\n<!-- Did this behavior use to work in the previous version? -->\r\n<!-- ‚úçÔ∏è--> Yes, the previous version in which this bug was not present was: ....\r\nNo\r\n\r\n### Description\r\n\r\nI want to use dynamic path in the imports, as follows,\r\n\r\n```ts\r\nconst Theme = (theme) => {\r\n  return import(`./themes/theme${theme}/theme${theme}.module`).then(mod => mod.ThemeModule);\r\n};\r\n```\r\n\r\nWebpack does understand dynamic path in imports, but its not working with Angular CLI.
