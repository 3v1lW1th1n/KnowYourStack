We have received multiple customer reports of applications that fail to start or don't run correctly after installing the July 2018 update. These reports are specific to applications that initialize a COM component and run with restricted permissions.\r\n\r\nWe have stopped distributing the .NET Framework July 2018 updates on Windows Update and are actively working on fixing and re-shipping this month's updates. If you installed the July 2018 update and have not yet seen any negative behavior, we recommend that you leave your systems as-is but closely monitor them and ensure that you apply upcoming .NET Framework updates.\r\n\r\nAs a team, we regret that this release was shipped with this flaw. This release was tested using our regular and extensive testing process. We discovered while investigating this issue that we have a test hole for the specific combination of COM activation and restricted permissions, including impersonation. We will be mitigating that gap going forward. Again, we are sorry for any inconvenience that this product flaw has caused.\r\n\r\nWe will continue to update this issue and [post](https://blogs.msdn.microsoft.com/dotnet/2018/07/20/advisory-on-july-2018-net-framework-updates/) as we have new information.\r\n\r\nDiscussion\r\nPlease share your thoughts on this change and see what others are saying at:\r\n\r\n* [microsoft/dotnet #811](https://github.com/Microsoft/dotnet/issues/811)\r\n\r\n## Technical Context\r\n\r\nThe .NET Framework runtime uses the process token to determine whether the process is being run within an elevated context. These system calls can fail if the required process inspection permissions are not present. This causes an “access denied\" error.\r\n\r\n## Workaround\r\n\r\nTemporarily uninstall the [July 2018 Security and Quality Rollup updates for .NET Framework](https://portal.msrc.microsoft.com/en-US/security-guidance/advisory/CVE-2018-8356) to restore functionality until a new update has been released to correct this problem. \r\n\r\n## Symptoms\r\n\r\nA COM component fails to load because of “access denied,” “class not registered,” or “internal failure occurred for unknown reasons” errors. \r\n\r\nThe most commonly reported failure results in the following error message:\r\n\r\n```console\r\nException type: System.UnauthorizedAccessException\r\nMessage: Access is denied. (Exception from HRESULT: 0x80070005 (E_ACCESSDENIED))\r\n```\r\n\r\n### Sharepoint\r\n\r\nWhen users browse to a SharePoint site they may see the following HTTP 403 message:\r\n\r\n```console\r\n\"The Web Site declined to show this webpage\"\r\n```\r\n\r\nThe SharePoint ULS Logs will contain a message like the following:  \r\n\r\n```console\r\nw3wp.exe (0x1894)         0x0B94  SharePoint Foundation  General 0000       High                UnauthorizedAccessException for the request. 403 Forbidden will be returned.

(WinMgmt) \r\n\r\nProgram Location:  \r\n\r\n   at System.Runtime.InteropServices.Marshal.ThrowExceptionForHRInternal(Int32 errorCode, IntPtr errorInfo) \r\n\r\n   at System.Management.ManagementObject.Get() \r\n\r\n   at Microsoft.BizTalk.SnapIn.Framework.WmiProvider.SelectInstance\r\n```\r\n\r\nUse the following guidance as a workaround:\r\n\r\n* Add “NETWORK SERVICE” to the local Administrators group. \r\n\r\n### IIS with Classic ASP\r\n\r\nIIS Hosted Classic ASP calling CreateObject for .NET COM objects may receive the following error: \"ActiveX component can't create object\". Use the following guidance as a workaround.\r\n\r\n* If your web site uses Anonymous Authentication, change the Web Site Anonymous Authentication credentials to use the \"Application pool identity\"\r\n* If your site uses Basic Authentication, log into the application once as the application pool identity and then create an instance of the .NET COM component. All subsequent activations for that .NET COM component should succeed, for any user.\r\n\r\n### .NET applications using COM and impersonation\r\n\r\n.NET Applications that creates instances of .NET COM application within an Impersonation Context may receive the following error: \"0x80040154 (REGDB_E_CLASSNOTREG)\". Use the following guidance as a workaround.\r\n\r\n* Create an instance of the .NET COM component prior to the impersonation context call. Later impersonated create instance calls should work as expected.\r\n* Run the .NET Application in the context of the impersonated user\r\n* Avoid using Impersonation when creating the .NET COM object\r\n"},{"Id":"7945147887","Type":"IssuesEvent","CreatedAt":"2018-07-10T17:00:38","Actor":"blowdart","Repository":"dotnet/announcements","Organization":"dotnet","RawContent":null,"RelatedAction":"opened","RelatedUrl":"https://github.com/dotnet/announcements/issues/73","RelatedDescription":"Opened issue \"Microsoft Security Advisory CVE-2018-8356: .NET Core Security Feature Bypass Vulnerability\" (#73) at dotnet/announcements","RelatedBody":"# Microsoft Security Advisory CVE-2018-8356: .NET Core Security Feature Bypass Vulnerability\r\n\r\n## <a name=\"executive-summary\"></a>Executive summary\r\n\r\nMicrosoft is releasing this security advisory to provide information about a vulnerability in .NET Core.

You must update your projects using the following instructions to address both types of dependency.\r\n\r\n### <a name=\"project-format\"></a>.NET Core Project formats\r\n\r\n.NET Core has two different project file formats, depending on what software created the project.\r\n\r\n1. `project.json` is the format used in .NET Core 1.0 and Microsoft Visual Studio 2015.\r\n2. `csproj` is the format used in .NET Core 1.1, .NET Core 2.0 and Microsoft Visual Studio 2017.\r\n\r\n#### Direct dependencies\r\n\r\nDirect dependencies are discoverable by examining your `csproj` file or your `project.json` file. They can be fixed by [editing the project file](#direct-dependencies) or using NuGet to update the dependency.\r\n\r\n The `System.Private.ServiceModel` package is not meant to be directly depended on and will not appear in your direct dependency list.\r\n\r\n#### Transitive dependencies\r\n\r\nTransitive dependencies occur when you add a package to your project that in turn relies on another package. For example, if Contoso publishes a package `Contoso.Utility` which, in turn, depends on `Contoso.Internals` and you add the `Contoso.Utility` package to your project now your project has a direct dependency on `Contoso.Utility` and, because `Contoso.Utility` depends 'Contoso.Internals', your application gains a transitive dependency on the `Contoso.Internals` package.\r\n\r\nTransitive dependencies are reviewable in three ways, depending on your [project format](#project-format):\r\n\r\n* In the Visual Studio Solution Explorer window, which supports searching.\r\n* By examining the `project.assets.json` file contained in the obj directory of your project for `csproj` based projects *OR*.\r\n* By examining the `project.lock.json` file contained in the root directory of your project for `project.json` based projects.\r\n\r\nThe `project.assets.json` and `project.lock.json` files are the authoritative list of all packages used by your project, containing both direct and transitive dependencies.\r\n\r\n#### <a name=\"direct-dependencies-vs2017\"></a>Fixing direct dependencies in a csproj based project / Visual Studio 2017\r\n\r\nOpen *projectname.csproj* in your editor. If you're using Visual Studio, right-click the project and choose **Edit projectname.csproj** from the context menu, where projectname is the name of your project. Look for `PackageReference` elements. The following shows an example project file:\r\n\r\n```xml\r\n<Project Sdk=\"Microsoft.NET.Sdk.Web\">\r\n  <PropertyGroup>\r\n    <TargetFramework>netcoreapp2.0</TargetFramework>\r\n  </PropertyGroup>\r\n  <ItemGroup>\r\n    <PackageReference Include=\"System.ServiceModel.Http\" Version=\"4.4.0\" />\r\n  </ItemGroup>\r\n</Project>\r\n```\r\n\r\nThe preceding example has a reference to the [vulnerable package](#affected-software), as seen by the single `PackageReference` element. The name of the package is in the `Include` attribute.\r\nThe package version number is in the `Version` attribute. The previous example shows a single direct dependency on `System.ServiceModel.Http` version 4.4.0.\r\n\r\nTo update the version to the secure package, change the version number to the updated package version as listed on the table [previously](#affected-software).\r\nIn this example, update `System.ServiceModel.Http` to the appropriate [fixed package number](#affected-software) for your major version. Save the *csproj* file. The example *csproj* now looks as follows:\r\n\r\n```xml\r\n<Project Sdk=\"Microsoft.NET.Sdk.Web\">\r\n  <PropertyGroup>\r\n    <TargetFramework>netcoreapp2.0</TargetFramework>\r\n  </PropertyGroup>\r\n  <ItemGroup>\r\n    <PackageReference Include=\"System.ServiceModel.Http\" Version=\"4.4.3\" />\r\n  </ItemGroup>\r\n</Project>\r\n```\r\n\r\nIf you're using Visual Studio and you save your updated *csproj* file, Visual Studio will restore the new package version.\r\nYou can see the restore results by opening the **Output** window (Ctrl+Alt+O) and changing the **Show output from** drop-down list to **Package Manager**.\r\n\r\nIf you're not using Visual Studio, open a command line and change to your project directory. Execute the `dotnet restore` command to restore the updated dependencies.\r\n\r\nNow recompile your application. If after recompilation you see a *Dependency conflict warning*, you must update your other direct dependencies to versions that take a dependency on the updated package.\r\n\r\n#### <a name=\"direct-dependencies-vs2015\"></a> Fixing Direct Dependencies in project.json based project / Visual Studio 2015\r\n\r\nOpen your `project.json` file in your editor. Look for the dependencies section. Below is an example dependencies section:\r\n\r\n``` json\r\n    \"dependencies\": {\r\n      \"Microsoft.NETCore.App\": {\r\n        \"version\": \"1.0.1\",\r\n        \"type\": \"platform\"\r\n      },\r\n     \"Microsoft.AspNetCore.Mvc.Core\": \"1.0.6\",\r\n     \"System.ServiceModel.Http\" : \"4.0.0\"\r\n    }\r\n```\r\n\r\nThis example has three direct dependencies: `Microsoft.NETCore.App`, `Microsoft.AspNetCore.Mvc.Core` and `System.ServiceModel.Http`.\r\n\r\n`Microsoft.NetCore.App` is the platform the application targets, you should ignore this. The other packages expose their version to the right of the package name. In our example, our non-platform packages are version 1.0.1.\r\n\r\nReview your direct dependencies for any instance of the packages and versions listed above. In the example above, there is a direct dependency on a vulnerable package, `System.ServiceModel.Http` version 4.4.0.\r\n\r\nTo update to the fixed package, change the version number to be the appropriate package for your release. In the example, this would be updating `System.ServiceModel.Http` to 4.4.3.\r\n\r\nAfter updating the vulnerable package versions, save your `project.json` file.\r\n\r\nThe dependencies section in our example `project.json` would now look as follows:\r\n\r\n```json\r\n  \"dependencies\": {\r\n    \"Microsoft.NETCore.App\": {\r\n      \"version\": \"1.0.1\",\r\n      \"type\": \"platform\"\r\n    },\r\n    \"Microsoft.AspNetCore.Mvc.Core\": \"1.0.6\",\r\n    \"System.ServiceModel.Http \": \"4.4.3\"\r\n  }\r\n```\r\n\r\nIf you are using Visual Studio and save your updated `project.json` file, Visual Studio will restore the new package version. You can see the restore results by opening the Output Window (Ctrl+Alt+O) and changing the Show output from drop-down list to Package Manager.\r\n\r\nIf you are not using Visual Studio, open a command line and change to your project directory. Execute the `dotnet restore` command to restore your new dependency.\r\n\r\nAfter you have addressed all of your direct dependencies, you must also review your transitive dependencies.\r\n\r\nAfter you've addressed all of your direct dependencies, you must review your transitive dependencies.\r\n\r\n#### Discovering and fixing transitive dependencies\r\n\r\nThere are two ways to view transitive dependencies. You can either [use Visual Studio’s Solution Explorer](#vs-solution-explorer), or you can review [the `project.assets.json` file](#project-assets-json) or the [the `project.lock.json` file](#project-lock-json).\r\n\r\n##### <a name=\"vs-solution-explorer\"></a>Using Visual Studio Solution Explorer\r\n\r\nTo use Solution Explorer, open the project in Visual Studio, and then press Ctrl+; to activate the search in Solution Explorer. Search for the [vulnerable package](#affected-software) and make a note of the version numbers of any results you find.\r\n\r\nFor example, searching for `Microsoft.AspNetCore.Mvc.Core` in an example project that contains a package that takes a dependency on `Microsoft.AspNetCore.Mvc` shows the following results in Visual Studio 2017:\r\n\r\n![Screenshot of search results in Visual Studio 2017](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/796298/25858816/8ecdc2b4-3491-11e7-9363-746804bb9832.png)\r\n\r\nThe search results appear as a tree. In the previous results, you can see that a reference to `Microsoft.AspNetCore.Mvc.Core` version 1.1.2 is discovered.\r\n\r\nUnder the Dependencies node is a NuGet node. Under the NuGet node is the list of packages you have directly taken a dependency on and their versions.\r\nIn screenshot, the application takes a direct dependency on `Microsoft.AspNetCore.Mvc`. `Microsoft.AspNetCore.Mvc` in turn has leaf nodes that list its dependencies and their versions.\r\nThe `Microsoft.AspNetCore.Mvc` package takes a dependency on a version of `Microsoft.AspNetCore.Mvc.ApiExplorer`, that in turn takes a dependency on a version of `Microsoft.AspNetCore.Mvc.Core`.\r\n\r\n##### <a name=\"project-assets-json\"></a> Manually reviewing project.assets.json (csproj/VS2017)\r\n\r\nOpen the *project.assets.json* file from your project’s obj directory in your editor. We suggest you use an editor that understands JSON and allows you to collapse and expand nodes to review this file.\r\nVisual Studio and Visual Studio Code provide JSON friendly editing.\r\n\r\nSearch the *project.assets.json* file for the [vulnerable package](#affected-software), using the format `packagename/` for each of the package names from the preceding table. If you find the assembly name in your search:\r\n\r\n* Examine the line on which they are found, the version number is after the `/`.\r\n* Compare to the [vulnerable versions table](#affected-software).\r\n\r\nFor example, a search result that shows `System.ServiceModel.Http/4.3.0` is a reference to version 4.3.0 of `System.ServiceModel.Http`.\r\n\r\nIf your *project.assets.json* file includes references to the [vulnerable package](#affected-software), then you need to fix the transitive dependencies.\r\n\r\nIf you have not found any reference to any vulnerable packages, this means either\r\n\r\n* None of your direct dependencies depend on any vulnerable packages, or\r\n* You have already fixed the problem by updating the direct dependencies.\r\n\r\nIf your transitive dependency review found references to the [vulnerable package](#affected-software), you must add a direct dependency to the updated package to your *csproj* file to override the transitive dependency.\r\n\r\nOpen *projectname.csproj* in your editor. If you're using Visual Studio, right-click the project and choose **Edit projectname.csproj** from the context menu, where projectname is the name of your project.\r\nLook for `PackageReference` nodes, for example:\r\n\r\n```xml\r\n<Project Sdk=\"Microsoft.NET.Sdk.\">\r\n  <PropertyGroup>\r\n    <TargetFramework>net461</TargetFramework>\r\n  </PropertyGroup>\r\n  <ItemGroup>\r\n    <PackageReference Include=\"ThirdParty.NotUpdatedYet\" Version=\"2.0.0\" />\r\n  </ItemGroup>\r\n</Project>\r\n```\r\n\r\nYou must add a direct dependency to the updated version of the [vulnerable package](#affected-software) by adding it to the *csproj* file.\r\nYou do this by adding a new line to the dependencies section, referencing the fixed version.\r\nFor example, if your search showed a transitive reference to a vulnerable `System.ServiceModel.Http` version, you'd add a reference to the [fixed package number](#affected-software).\r\n\r\n```xml\r\n<Project Sdk=\"Microsoft.NET.Sdk.Web\">\r\n  <PropertyGroup>\r\n    <TargetFramework>net461</TargetFramework>\r\n  </PropertyGroup>\r\n  <ItemGroup>\r\n    <PackageReference Include=\"System.ServiceModel.Http\" Version=\"4.3.2\" />\r\n    <PackageReference Include=\"ThirdParty.NotUpdatedYet\" Version=\"2.0.0\" />\r\n  </ItemGroup>\r\n</Project>\r\n```\r\n\r\nAfter you've added the direct dependency reference, save your *csproj* file.\r\n\r\nIf you're using Visual Studio, save your updated *csproj* file and Visual Studio will restore the new package versions.\r\nYou can see the restore results by opening the **Output** window (Ctrl+Alt+O) and changing the **Show output from** drop-down list to **Package Manager**.\r\n\r\nIf you're not using Visual Studio, open a command line and change to your project directory. Execute the `dotnet restore` command to restore the new dependencies.\r\n\r\n##### <a name=\"project-lock-json\"></a> Manually reviewing project.lock.json (project.json/VS2015)\r\n\r\nOpen the `project.lock.json` file in your editor. We suggest you use an editor that understands json and allows you to collapse and expand nodes to review this file; both Visual Studio and Visual Studio Code provide this functionality.\r\n\r\nIf you are using Visual Studio the `project.lock.json` file is “under” the `project.json` file. Click the right pointing triangle, ▷, to the left of the `project.json` file to expand the solution tree to expose the `project.lock.json` file. The following image shows a project with the `project.json` file expanded to show the `project.lock.json` file.\r\n\r\n![project lock json](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/796298/25858179/f6e01200-348f-11e7-8a77-7176d8dd3f03.png)\r\n\r\nSearch the `project.lock.json` file for the vulnerable packages, using the format `packagename/`, using each of the package names from the table above. If you find any vulnerable assembly name in your search examine the line on which they are found, the version number is after the `/` and compare to the vulnerable versions table above. For example a search result that shows `System.ServiceModel.Http/4.0.1` is a reference to v4.0.1 of `System.ServiceModel.Http`.   If your `project.lock.json` file includes references to any of the package versions shown above then you will need to fix the transitive dependencies.\r\n\r\nIf you have not found any reference to a vulnerable version of `System.ServiceModel.Http` this means none of your direct dependencies depend on any vulnerable packages or you have already fixed the problem by updating the direct dependencies.\r\n\r\nIf your transitive dependency review found references to any of the vulnerable packages you must add a direct dependency to the updated package to your `project.json` file to override the transitive dependency. Open your `project.json` and find the dependencies section. For example:\r\n\r\n``` json\r\n  \"dependencies\": {\r\n    \"Microsoft.NETCore.App\": {\r\n      \"version\": \"1.0.1\",\r\n      \"type\": \"platform\"\r\n    },\r\n    \"Microsoft.AspNetCore.Mvc\": \"1.0.0\"\r\n  }\r\n```\r\n\r\nFor each of the vulnerable packages your search returned you must add a direct dependency to the updated version by adding it to the `project.json` file. You do this by adding a new line to the dependencies section, referring the fixed version. For example, if your search showed a transitive reference to the vulnerable `System.ServiceModel.Http` version 1.0.0 you would add a reference to the appropriate fixed version, 1.0.6. Edit the `project.json` file as follows:\r\n\r\n``` json\r\n  \"dependencies\": {\r\n    \"Microsoft.NETCore.App\": {\r\n      \"version\": \"1.0.1\",\r\n      \"type\": \"platform\"\r\n    },\r\n    \"System.ServiceModel.Http\": \"4.1.2\",\r\n    \"Microsoft.AspNetCore.Mvc\": \"1.0.0\"\r\n  }\r\n```\r\n\r\nAfter you have added direct dependencies to the fixed packages, save your `project.json` file.\r\n\r\nIf you are using Visual Studio save your updated `project.json` file and Visual Studio will restore the new package versions. You can see the restore results by opening the Output Window (Ctrl+Alt+O) and changing the Show output from drop-down list to Package Manager.\r\n\r\nIf you are not using Visual Studio open a command line and change to your project directory. Execute the `dotnet restore` command to restore your new dependencies.\r\n\r\n#### Rebuilding your application\r\n\r\nFinally you must rebuild your application, test, and redeploy.\r\n\r\n## Other Information\r\n\r\n### Reporting Security Issues\r\n\r\nIf you have found a potential security issue in .NET Core, please email details to secure@microsoft.com.

issue \"Idea/Proposal: Split .NET Standard into multiple smaller standards by relying on tooling\" (#774) at dotnet/standard","RelatedBody":"First, let me start by saying that this is not supposed to be a final proposal, but more like a rough draft / general idea, that I hope to tranform into a valid proposal with the help of everyone here.\r\nI fear this is going to be a controversial topic, but I've had this idea in the back of my head for a few days now, and I'd like to at least try explaining it there, so as to have your feedback.\r\nSo, please bear with me until the end of this topic. 😅\r\n\r\n# Abstract\r\n\r\n[Like many others](https://github.com/dotnet/standard/issues/682), I do wish .NET Standard 2.1 was already a thing.\r\nBut I do also perfectly understand the concerns about .NET Core 2.1 being the only implementation already ahead in the standard. And because of that I do fear that .NET Standard 2.0 will be the last .NET Standard version ever. (But at the same time, I'm kinda going to propose replacing it by something else here… 😒)\r\n\r\nAside of that, the fact that .NET Standard 2.0 is not compatible with .NET 4.5 can sometimes be an obstacle in the migration process to .NET Core. (That's something we are faced with everyday in my current job)\r\n\r\nSo I wondered, what if, instead of having *one unique standard*, there were *many smaller standards* that could be implemented à-la-carte by runtimes/frameworks/NuGet ?\r\nWhat if we could already define something such as a \"Span Standard 1.0\" ?\r\n\r\nAnd yes, I know that the original design of DNX / .NET Standard 1.0 was more modular, I know that there were once such a thing as Assembly Neutral Interfaces, and I know all of this did not work out that well. This did obviously lead to the acceptable compromise that is .NET Standard 2.0.\r\n\r\nBut, I assure you, I am *not* proposing to reiterate the exact same mistakes as in .NET Standard 1 era. (Which is not to say that I'm not taking strong inspiration on what has/had already been done. 😉)\r\n\r\nWhat I'm thinking of is a mechanism that should help reduce coupling **without** requiring changes in the existing runtimes, and could work reasonably well with support in the tooling.\r\n\r\n# The general idea\r\n\r\nWe would define many ````feature```` sets that can overlap eachother. At the begining, features would likely be defined based on current .NET Standard 1.0~2.0 APIs, by splitting unrelated features away from eachother. (Basically what I call a ````feature```` here is like a much smaller .NET Standard) \r\n\r\nA ````feature```` would be defined very *similarly* to a reference assembly (i.e. no implementation), and define what API a consumer should expect when **depending** on the ````feature````.\r\n\r\nI'll take as an example the current hot topic of ````Span<T>```` and .NET Standard 2.0/2.1 to illustrate how ````features```` could help:\r\n````Span<T>```` is available to altmost anyone, but only .NET Core 2.1 supports the fast ````Span<T>```` and the new Span-based APIs:\r\n\r\n - Assume that there is no such thing as ````.NET Standard````\r\n - We could define ````Feature.Span, Version=1.0```` for the portable span, as implemented in ````System.Memory````\r\n - We could define ````Feature.Span, Version=1.1```` for the fast span, as implemented in .NET Core 2.1\r\n - Let's assume that we already have ````Feature.Sockets, Version=2.0```` representing the ````System.Net.Sockets```` feature from .NET Framework 2.0.\r\n - We could define ````Feature.Span.Sockets, Version=1.0````:\r\n   - This feature would have a feature dependecy on both ````Feature.Span, Version=1.0```` and ````Feature.Net.Sockets, Version=2.0````\r\n   - This feature would define all the new Span-related members introduced on Sockets\r\n - Let's assume that we have ````Feature.IO, Version=4.5```` representing the ````System.IO```` subset from the NuGet package with the same name.\r\n - We could define ````Feature.Span.Streams, Version=1.0````:\r\n   - This feature would have a feature dependecy on both ````Feature.Span, Version=1.0```` and ````Feature.IO, Version=4.5````\r\n   - This feature would define all the new Span-related members introduced on System.IO.Stream\r\n - We could go on with all the other places where Span-related API were introduced, but I'm sure you get the idea…\r\n\r\nℹ️ Note: Don't pay too much attention about the fictional boundaries of the features yet, I'm pretty sure I wouldn't want the feature to be shaped _exactly_ like described above. 😉\r\n\r\nWith such ````features```` defined, I could write a database client library, and declare that it depends on ````Feature.Runtime````, ````Feature.CSharp, Version=7.3````, ````Feature.Net.Sockets````, ````Feature.Span.Sockets````, ````Feature.Collections````, and ````Feature.Data.Common````.\r\nThis would allow my library to run on any runtime, provided that it at least supports all the ````features```` I used.\r\n\r\n# The (Draft) Proposal\r\n\r\n## Defining features\r\n\r\nA ````feature```` is an API shape, or contract (similar to .NET Standard), whose concrete implementation is provided by either a runtime (e.g. .NET Core) **or** by NuGet packages.\r\n\r\nWe would ideally reserve a prefix on NuGet for official .NET features. (e.g. ````Feature.````)\r\n\r\n - In the initial version, features would only ever be created by Microsoft / .NET Foundation\r\n - A ````feature```` is represented as a **single** assembly, typically exposed as a NuGet package.\r\n - A ````feature```` assembly contains only metadata (no implementation), like would any reference assembly.\r\n - A ````feature```` assembly contains only public types and members. (public types, public members and protected members)\r\n - A ````feature```` assembly can (will) have dependencies on other ````feature```` assemblies. (Dependencies would be supported via NuGet packages)\r\n - A ````feature```` assembly defines only the exact API surface that it supports\r\n   - A ````feature```` can only provide complete interface definitions. (Interface versioning problem: it is not possible to add or remove interface members)\r\n   - A ````feature```` can provide delegates. (Complete definition, not that any other form would be valid anyway)\r\n   - A ````feature```` provides only partial type definitions for structs, classes, and enums: Only publicly visible members that are provided by the ````feature````, are included in the metadata.\r\n   - ````features```` don't need to provide public constructors to type they augment\r\n   - A ````feature```` cannot add an abstract method to a pre-existing type (TBD: How can this be enforced ? Maybe based on the presence of a public constructor ?)\r\n   - (Obvious) Every type that is referenced in the ````feature```` assembly must exist either in the ````feature```` assembly itself or in one of its dependent ````feature```` assemblies.\r\n - Multiple ````features```` can provide the same member on the same type, if they both provide it for different reasons\r\n - Across ````feature```` assemblies, type identity is only determined by their full name \r\n - ````features```` follow Semantic Versioning (TBD)\r\n   - A ````feature```` of minor version M > N must always depend on the ````feature```` version N (Version M should only include the new types and members)\r\n   - A ````feature```` of major version M > N can depend on ````feature```` version N if it doesn't include breaking changes (In the current state of affairs, I expect that there would never be breaking changes)\r\n\r\nI expect that ````feature```` assemblies will never be referenced by concrete runtime, library or application assemblies.\r\n\r\nFor the rest of this proposal, I will address the proposed feature (sorry 😑) as ````feature````:\r\nA ````feature```` is either ````provided```` or ````depended upon````. Usage of any other term is likely a mistake on my part.\r\n\r\n## Wiring up features\r\n\r\n### Within libraries\r\n\r\nA new TFM ````features```` is created, acting similarly to ````netstandard```` TFMs.\r\nLibrary projects can target the TFM ````features```` like they would target .NET Standard, .NET FX, .NET Core or other TFMs.\r\n\r\nWhen targeting the TFM ````features````, the library project must reference all features it depends on:\r\n\r\n - We could assume that the TFM ````features```` provide **zero** API by default. (But maybe it provide some kind of minimal subset ?)\r\n - Features could be bundled in larger feature packages to avoid referencing hundreds of feature packages. (Similar to ````Microsoft.AspNetCore.All````)\r\n - The project can reference other libraries that are based on the ````features```` TFM, and will transitively inherit feature dependencies.\r\n\r\nAt build time, the toochain will load all ````feature```` assemblies and construct a model of the global feature set required by the library by merging all type definitions in the feature assemblies.\r\nThis can be done in the compiler or before calling the compiler, via an external tool. (I feel it might be easier to add this in the MSBuild build process than in Roslyn.)\r\n\r\nAll metadata references to ````features```` would be mapped to a non-existant and well-known ````features```` assembly (possibly signed, and in that case, the signing key would have to be public).\r\n\r\n⚠️ Important: The feature dependencies still need to be stored somewhere inside the resulting assembly… But I don't know how they should be stored. (Custom attributes, or regular .NET assembly references ?)\r\n\r\n### Within applications\r\n\r\nWhat is true today will still hold true with features: Applications are expected to target a concrete framework.\r\nHowever, application projects would gain the ability to reference features-based projects and libraries.\r\n\r\nWhen an application references a features-based project, the toolchain (NuGet & MSBuild) must always validate that the current TFMs for the project support all of the required ````features````, directly, or via compatibility NuGet packages.\r\n\r\nAt build time, the toochain will load all ````feature```` assemblies indirectly referenced by the project and construct a **shim** assembly covering all of the required ````features````:\r\n\r\n - This assembly will have the well-known name ````features```` (identical to what is referenced by ````feature````-based library projects)\r\n - This assembly will contain ````TypeForwardedToAttribute```` attributes for each and every type referenced by the features. (That's assuming that feature support has already verified for the project, so that all the members of forwarded types are guaranteed to exist)\r\n - The assembly is (likely) signed with the well-known signing key.\r\n\r\nThe generated ````features```` **shim** assembly will be bundled with the application, and act as the glue between features-based libraries and the underlying framework. (This should be very similar to how .NET Standard works, if I'm not mistaken)\r\n\r\nℹ️ NB: In the end, what I propose is that, rather than the runtime(s), the **application** is responsible for **providing** (wire-up) the features that the libraries depend upon. (But that this is handled by the toolchain)\r\n\r\n## Providing features (i.e. Concrete implementations)\r\n\r\nSplitting type definitions across multiple reference-like assemblies should not break typical .NET expectations:\r\n\r\n - A concrete type implementation can only be provided by **one** assembly\r\n - Where the concrete type implementation ends up being (i.e. in which assembly) is dependent on the runtime, and *should not matter to the library developer*\r\n - The runtime is never aware of the partial type definitions that were used to build libraries\r\n\r\nThere must exist a mapping between runtimes/frameworks and features, and features could likely be always provided via NuGet packages.\r\nThis would provide a single source of metadata for the toolchain to generate its shim assemblies.\r\n\r\nThis is basically what we could expect:\r\n\r\n - A NuGet package can declare a list of implemented ````features````.\r\n - If a NuGet package claims to **provide** a ````feature````, it must **provide** this ````feature```` entirely, even if that means that some method would throw ````NotImplementedException````\r\n   - Implementation of the feature could, however, rely on other dependencies (via ````TypeForwardedToAttribute````)\r\n   - Implementation of a feature is always relative to a valid TFM that **is not** ````features```` (but it could be ````netstandard2.0````)\r\n - For each framework, a NuGet package with the correct Major.Minor version would exist. (e.g. ````Framework.NETCoreApp, Version=2.1.0````)\r\n   - Framework NuGet packages would **not** contain the framework itself\r\n   - Framework NuGet packages would define which features the framework supports, and how they are mapped\r\n   - Framework NuGet packages could be updated incrementally to add features as they are standardized\r\n   - Framework NuGet packages would be flagged specifically\r\n\r\n## Features on the NuGet side\r\n\r\nAll of the above requirements would likely require adaptations on the NuGet side:\r\n\r\n - As said earlier, Microsoft or .NET Foundation should reserve a NuGet prefix for features (e.g. ````Feature.````) to ease discovery of features and avoid pollution\r\n - Microsoft or .NET Foundation should reserve a NuGet prefix for frameworks (e.g. ````Framework.````) to ease discovery of framework-feature mappings\r\n - A NuGet package must be identifiable as a ````feature````\r\n   - ````features```` are to be always considered framework agnostic\r\n   - ````feature```` packages should only contain one reference assembly (Named the same as the feature ?)\r\n   - ````feature```` packages should be ignored by older NuGet implementations\r\n - A NuGet package must be able to **depend on** a ````feature````\r\n   - That might be as simple as declaring a regular package dependency\r\n - A NuGet package must be able to **provide** a ````feature````\r\n   - The features which are provided must be listed in the package… (How ?)\r\n   - A NuGet package implementing one ore more feature must contain, for each TFM where it applies, exactly **one** well-known assembly named ````features````, signed with a well-known key, and containing/forwarding the implementation of all the features.\r\n - A NuGet package must be identifiable as a ````framework````\r\n   - Framework NuGet packages are not considered framework agnostic (they… are… applying to themselves, somehow)\r\n   - Framework NuGet packages follow the same rules as NuGet packages that **provide** ````features````\r\n\r\n# Remarks\r\n\r\n## How should ````features```` be sliced from .NET Standard ?\r\n\r\nThe goal of this proposal is not (yet) to propose how ````features```` should be sliced, but to propose how to allow them to be sliced.\r\nHowever, it must be noted, that there are many ways to slice an API with the feature proposed here.\r\nWhile most types will not require any special treatment, some types may be better sliced into multiple separate features, rather than exported as a single feature.\r\n\r\nWe could consider, for example, that the ````Stream```` class could be exported in a ````Feature.IO.Stream.Sync```` and ````Feature.IO.Stream.Async````, with possibly even a common feature ````Feature.IO.Stream.Core````.\r\n\r\nI'm sure that would generate a lot of discussions anyway… 🙂\r\n\r\n## Possible uses of ````features````\r\n\r\nApart from the obvious modularization of the standard, ````features```` could also be used in the following scenarios:\r\n\r\n - For framework dependencies of a .NET language such as C#: The ````feature```` for the language would be versioned in parallel with the language version, and, for each version, declare every type and member needed to fully support that version of the language.\r\n - For defining an optional standardized .NET UI API. (Whose implementation might be tied to the runtime)\r\n - Defining a new ````feature```` over a third party API, for allowing developers to more easily swap the implementation (because ````features```` apply to any .NET type, and not just only interfaces)\r\n\r\n ## Finding how ````features```` are provided\r\n\r\n While ````features```` provided by the runtime can be easy to discover (the user only would only need to import the corresponding package, and the tools might even do it automatically), it might be much harder to find that a package for supporting a feature exists on a given runtime.\r\n\r\n Given that the responsibility for ensuring that à ````feature```` is **provided** is delegated to the final user (user of the library(ies) depending on ````features````), there might be a need for some sort of mechanism helping to discover feature implementations.\r\n\r\n It would be great if NuGet coult auto import default feature-providing packages, based on some kind of repository… So that everything goes smoothly on the end-user side.\r\n\r\n# (Supposed) pros and cons of this proposal\r\n\r\n## Pros\r\n\r\n - More fine grained control over dependencies (looser coupling, maybe recovering some of the possibilities that were lost by removing Assembly Neutral Interfaces)\r\n - Ability to standardize small parts of the API surface rather than a whole framework (e.g. new Span APIs could be standardized faster on their own)\r\n - Ability to make some newer APIs compatible with old .NET versions again (That is an important scenario in some migration paths)\r\n - Ability to standardize things such as UI APIs (e.g. Windows Forms) without redefining \".NET Standard\"\r\n - This proposal does not require modifying existing runtimes\r\n\r\n## Cons\r\n\r\n - This proposal adds yet another layer of complexity to the already complicated world of framework compatibility\r\n - Consuming libraries implemented over ````features```` requires upgrading the toolchain (that is not a problem for everyone, but it can be for some)\r\n - This proposal may requires non-trivial additions to NuGet (let's hope not)\r\n - Slicing the .NET Standard API in a potentially large number of fine-grained features must be done very carefully, and may take quite a bit of time\r\n\r\n# Conclusion\r\n\r\nThank you very much for reading this to the end !\r\n\r\nI'm waiting for your feedback. 😉"},{"Id":"7997675587","Type":"IssuesEvent","CreatedAt":"2018-07-20T23:58:06","Actor":"terrajobst","Repository":"dotnet/standard","Organization":"dotnet","RawContent":null,"RelatedAction":"closed","RelatedUrl":"https://github.com/dotnet/standard/issues/705","RelatedDescription":"Closed issue \"System.Web.HttpUtility.HtmlDecode can't decode &hairsp;\" (#705) at dotnet/standard","RelatedBody":"Hello,\r\ni have a problem with the HtmlDecode Method of System.Web.HttpUtility:\r\nIt can't decode the \"`&hairsp;`\" Entity.
