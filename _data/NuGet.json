A native HttpMessageHandler, which can be used by HttpClient, does not have to be a HttpClientHandler derived class. With Xamarin.Mac the native handler is [NSUrlSessionHandler](https://github.com/xamarin/xamarin-macios/blob/master/src/Foundation/NSUrlSessionHandler.cs) which derives from HttpMessageHandler. The NSUrlSessionHandler cannot be used with the [HttpHandlerResourceV3](https://github.com/NuGet/NuGet.Client/blob/dev/src/NuGet.Core/NuGet.Protocol/HttpSource/HttpHandlerResourceV3.cs) and a null value cannot be passed since there is a null check.\r\n\r\nSearching the code it looks like the only place where this is used is in the [DownloadResourcePluginProvider](https://github.com/NuGet/NuGet.Client/blob/3803820961f4d61c06d07b179dab1d0439ec0d91/src/NuGet.Core/NuGet.Protocol/Providers/DownloadResourcePluginProvider.cs#L84) class where it is used to pass the HttpClientHandler.Proxy to the GetCredentialsRequestHandler. Is there another way we can handle this without requiring a HttpClientHandler as part of the HttpHandlerResource?\r\n\r\nFor now I can create a dummy HttpClientHandler - however if NuGet starts using the HttpClientHandler property for other things then this will likely not work if Visual Studio for Mac is using the NSUrlSessionHandler. Visual Studio for Mac can implement its own version of the HttpHandlerResourceV3Provider but having HttpHandlerResourceV3 require a HttpClientHandler is problematic here.\r\n"},{"Id":"8258743183","Type":"IssuesEvent","CreatedAt":"2018-09-13T10:08:02","Actor":"LinardAtTenForce","Repository":"NuGet/Home","Organization":"NuGet","RawContent":null,"RelatedAction":"opened","RelatedUrl":"https://github.com/NuGet/Home/issues/7297","RelatedDescription":"Opened issue \"\"Failed to resolve all items referenced by '*.csproj' \" warning shouldn't be raised when there are no Package/Project References\" (#7297) at NuGet/Home","RelatedBody":"## Details about Problem\r\nNuGet product used (NuGet.exe | VS UI | Package Manager Console | dotnet.exe): VS UI\r\nNuGet version (x.x.x.xxx): 4.8.1.5435 (latest stable)\r\nVS version (if appropriate): 2017 (15.8.4) (latest stable)\r\nOS version (i.e. win10 v1607 (14393.321)): Win10 v1803 (17134.228) (latest stable)\r\nWorked before?
