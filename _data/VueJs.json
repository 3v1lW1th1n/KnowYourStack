Often, I found it is annoying when I \"time-traveled\", there is a side-effect being performed due to the component life cycle or routing middleware try to do their \"regular\" task... this resulted in a polluted mutation records...

This locking mechanism can be unlocked if we decide to either **revert** or **traverse** to the latest state (they are basically the same).

It will cause bug easily.\r\nAnd there are duplicated namespace called `\"todos\"`. It will inhibit maintainabillity.\r\n\r\n### What does the proposed API look like?\r\nThe way to introduce it is not to suggest a new API, but to use the existing API properly.\r\nWe can use `createNamespacedHelpers` API with constants in store directory!\r\n\r\n### Example\r\n\r\n_@/store/todos/types.js_\r\n\r\n```js\r\nexport const NAMESPACE = \"todos\";\r\n```\r\n\r\n_@/store/todos/index.js_\r\n\r\n```js\r\nimport { createNamespacedHelpers } from\"vuex\";\r\nimport { NAMESPACE } from \"./types\";\r\n\r\n// Key point !\r\nconst { mapState, mapGetters, mapActions } = createNamespacedHelpers(NAMESPACE);\r\n\r\nexport { mapState, mapGetters, mapActions };\r\n\r\nexport default { /* namespaced, state, getters, mutations, actions */ }\r\n```\r\n\r\n_@/store/todos/getters.js_\r\n\r\n```js\r\n// Key point !\r\nexport const DONE_ITEMS = \"DONE_ITEMS\";\r\nexport const ACTIVE_ITEMS = \"ACTIVE_ITEMS\";\r\n\r\nexport default {\r\n  [DONE_ITEMS]: state => state.items.filter(todo => todo.isDone),\r\n  [ACTIVE_ITEMS]: state => state.items.filter(todo => !todo.isDone)\r\n};\r\n```\r\n\r\nIf we do this, we can use customized binding helpers.\r\n\r\n_my-component.vue_ (TO-BE version)\r\n\r\n```js\r\nimport * as todos from '@/store/todos'; // Key point !\r\nimport * as getters from '@/store/todos/getters'; // Key point !\r\nimport * as actions from '@/store/todos/types'; // Key point !\r\n\r\nexport default {\r\n  computed: {\r\n    ...todos.mapState({\r\n      allItems: ({ items }) => items,\r\n    }),\r\n    ...todos.mapGetters([\r\n      getters.DONE_ITEMS,\r\n      getters.ACTIVE_ITEMS,\r\n    ])\r\n  },\r\n  methods: {\r\n    ...todos.mapActions([\r\n      actions.ADD_ITEM,\r\n    ]),\r\n  }\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nHow about this? If you do not mind this, I would like to post it on the official Vuex document.\r\nYou can see the all example code in [this repository](https://github.com/JaeYeopHan/vuex-best-practice-lab)\r\n\r\nThanks!\r\n\r\n<!-- generated by vue-issues.
