Why an interface? In retrospect I'm not quite sure.\r\n\r\nHaving an interface allows for different implementations, but we've never actually really exploited that capability. Nor, even if we were of such a mind to do so, would it be clear how we could. What would they even do differently? The semantics around `Batch` and whatnot are sufficiently clear and simple as to make only one implementation obvious, and even if we did have different implementations since the resulting cursors result most often from transformers (that is, components downstream from the set creation), they couldn't really do anything radically different anyway, since to do anything implementation specific on any cursor would be to break the composability at the core of what makes `IDataView` work at all.\r\n\r\nSo: get rid of this interface, and replace all usage of it with a simple utility method *somewhere* that can be called to do the reconciliation. It needn't even be a public utility method, but there may be reasons to do so.","Url":"https://github.com/dotnet/machinelearning/issues/1867","RelatedDescription":"Open issue \"Remove IRowCursorConsolidator, replace with utility method somewhere\" (#1867)"},{"Id":"389964474","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2018-12-12T01:07:50","Actor":"wschin","Number":"1862","RawContent":null,"Title":"Warn when a graph contains a null output","State":"closed","Body":"Fixes #315.","Url":"https://github.com/dotnet/machinelearning/pull/1862","RelatedDescription":"Closed or merged PR \"Warn when a graph contains a null output\" (#1862)"},{"Id":"390016903","IsPullRequest":false,"CreatedAt":"2018-12-12T00:44:01","Actor":"najeeb-kazmi","Number":"1866","RawContent":null,"Title":"Public Constructors for ModelParameters","State":"open","Body":"During the course of fixing #1698 and deriving work items (e.g. #1699, #1701, #1702), we created public constructors for the various `ModelParameter` objects (formerly `Predictor` objects).\r\n\r\n@sfilipi raised the question whether these should be public or be made internal as the only thing that can create `ModelParameters` (`Predictors`) is training a model.

Say there was a .NET library for Apache Arrow. If the Arrow .NET data type implements IDataView, the Apache Arrow data can be passed directly into ML.NET without having to copy it into a format that ML.NET consumes.\r\n\r\nAnother example is: say we had a visualization/graphing/plotting library in .NET that could consume data using IDataView. Then we could take data that was produced by ML.NET, or Apache Arrow, and feed it directly into the graphing library. There would be no need to copy, or change the shape of the data at all. And there is no need for this graphing library to know anything about ML.NET or Apache Arrow.\r\n\r\nIn my mind, we can use IDataView in a similar manner to what [OData](https://www.odata.org/) was promised to be: An exchange format which allows producers and consumers of data to communicate in a standardized way. (Although, OData has more capabilities such as filtering, sorting, updating data, etc which I am not proposing we add to IDataView. I was just using it as an analogy.)\r\n\r\n/cc @TomFinley @Zruty0 @markusweimer @danmosemsft @stephentoub ","Url":"https://github.com/dotnet/machinelearning/issues/1860","RelatedDescription":"Open issue \"Extract IDataView into its own assembly and NuGet package\" (#1860)"},{"Id":"388752316","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2018-12-11T18:00:57","Actor":"sfilipi","Number":"1849","RawContent":null,"Title":"Add a test for 1259","State":"closed","Body":"Closes #1259 by adding the test described in the bug: OVA with the feature column named something other than \"Features\". \r\n\r\nA bit of cleanup on reusing arguments to load the test dataset.

I create a simple toy problem to try to understand how the API works (using the samples as a guide) which uses the `FastTree` binary classifier. The training data is just 2 vectors <0, 0>:0, <1, 1>:1, which should be easily be able to fit a model to. However, when I run the evaluation I get 50% accuracy. Here is my sample code:\r\n\r\n```\r\n class Program\r\n    {\r\n        public class FeatureData\r\n        {\r\n            [ColumnName(\"Label\")]\r\n            public bool Label { get; set; }\r\n\r\n            [ColumnName(\"Features\")]\r\n            public float[] Features { get; set; }\r\n        }\r\n\r\n        static void Main(string[] args)\r\n        {\r\n            MLContext mlContext = new MLContext(seed: 0);\r\n\r\n            var featuresTrainingData = new List<FeatureData>()\r\n            {\r\n                new FeatureData() { Features = new float[]{0.0f, 0.0f}, Label = false},\r\n                new FeatureData() { Features = new float[]{1.0f, 1.0f}, Label = true}\r\n            };\r\n\r\n            var schemaDef = SchemaDefinition.Create(typeof(FeatureData));\r\n            schemaDef[\"Features\"].ColumnType = new VectorType(NumberType.R4, 2);\r\n\r\n            var dataView = mlContext.CreateDataView(featuresTrainingData, schemaDef);\r\n\r\n            //Train the model\r\n            var pipeline = mlContext.BinaryClassification.Trainers.FastTree(featureColumn:\"Features\", labelColumn:\"Label\");\r\n            var model = pipeline.Fit(dataView);\r\n\r\n            //Evaluate\r\n            var predictions = model.Transform(dataView);\r\n            var metrics = mlContext.BinaryClassification.Evaluate(predictions, \"Label\");\r\n\r\n            Console.WriteLine();\r\n            Console.WriteLine(\"Model quality metrics evaluation\");\r\n            Console.WriteLine(\"--------------------------------\");\r\n            Console.WriteLine($\"Accuracy: {metrics.Accuracy:P2}\");\r\n            Console.WriteLine($\"Auc: {metrics.Auc:P2}\");\r\n            Console.WriteLine($\"F1Score: {metrics.F1Score:P2}\");\r\n            Console.WriteLine(\"=============== End of model evaluation ===============\");\r\n\r\n        }\r\n    }\r\n```\r\n\r\nWhat am I doing wrong here?\r\n\r\nThank you!","Url":"https://github.com/dotnet/machinelearning/issues/1839","RelatedDescription":"Closed issue \"FastTree cannot solve a simple toy problem when using feature arrays\" (#1839)"},{"Id":"388417893","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2018-12-06T22:04:31","Actor":"rogancarr","Number":"1844","RawContent":null,"Title":"Confidence Intervals for Permutation Feature Importance","State":"open","Body":"This PR adds an optional confidence interval calculation to the `Permutation Feature Importance` evaluator.

For speed, `PFI` uses only one permutation, and this leads to a bit of randomness in the predicted importances. For example, based on the random seed features can change orderings of importance and permutations can even end up showing to improve the model performance. These issues can be fixed by allowing the calculation of confidence intervals around the feature importance values.","Url":"https://github.com/dotnet/machinelearning/issues/1840","RelatedDescription":"Open issue \"Add confidence intervals to permutation feature importance\" (#1840)"},{"Id":"388109478","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2018-12-06T18:08:53","Actor":"TomFinley","Number":"1838","RawContent":null,"Title":"Revert \"Removed AlignedArray  (#1657)\"","State":"closed","Body":"This reverts commit 72ec121afe1a889218c750f7bda7ee5093c140b7.\r\nA bug was detected that resulted in non-deterministic calculation, since the\r\nunderlying C++ code was written in a way apparently that required alignment\r\nto produce consistent results, so of course just removing the alignment and\r\ncalling an only slightly modified algorithm compromised determinism, resulting\r\nin test failure for RFF in particular.\r\n\r\nIf we can fix that bug by other means that would be preferable, since removing `AlignedArray` is a desirable outcome.
