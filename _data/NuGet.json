This will potentially break our SHA validation as part of post restore operation with repeatable build (project lock file) feature because then if a lock file already has a unsgined package SHA and later that package is repo signed by nuget.org, then any further restore validation will fail which will also fail the restore operation.\r\n\r\nSo there are multiple suggestions to solve this issue, such as:\r\n- Write the original SHA of the package avoiding Signature file so that it's consistent with unsigned package. That way we won't need to change at multiple places but the down side is it will break existing 4.6 to 4.8 clients so we'd need to ask customers to clean their NuGet global packages folder before opting into project lock fle.\r\n\r\n- Another option is to create a new SHAFile to keep track of original SHA of the package and use that to validate post restore. This will have the advantage to not break existing clients and not needed to clean global packages folder but the downside is that we'd need to change at multiple places starting the way we figure out if package is coming from global packages folder or not, then extraction of the package, and finally the validation.\r\n\r\n- 3rd option is to continue with the existing code of writing SHA, but change the way we validate SHA of signed packages. So for signed packages, instead of using SHA from the assets file, we use SignUtility apis to get the original SHA and compare that wrt lock file. This will work with existing clients as well as won't need to change at too many places but the downside is to retrieve original SHA of the package specially when package is Author + Repo signed.\r\n\r\n- more options.....\r\n\r\n@anangaur @rrelyea @PatoBeltran @dtivel \r\n"},{"Id":"8232141275","Type":"IssuesEvent","CreatedAt":"2018-09-07T18:24:12","Actor":"rrelyea","Repository":"NuGet/Home","Organization":"NuGet","RawContent":null,"RelatedAction":"opened","RelatedUrl":"https://github.com/NuGet/Home/issues/7282","RelatedDescription":"Opened issue \"Protect users who don't use exclusively https feeds\" (#7282) at NuGet/Home","RelatedBody":"Need to brainstorm and spec this experience.\r\nDo we warn for all \"http\" and \"file\" feeds?

Update the package.\r\n\r\n**Actual Behavior:**\r\nThe package updated successfully.\r\n\r\n**Expected Behavior:**\r\nThe package should be updated with warnings.\r\n\r\n**Test Plan Link:**\r\nhttps://testrail.xamarin.com/index.php?/plans/view/56083\r\n\r\n**Test Case link:**\r\nhttps://testrail.xamarin.com/index.php?/tests/view/24974426&group_by=tests:assignedto_id&group_order=desc&group_id=95\r\n\r\n**Build info:**\r\nVisual Studio Enterprise 2017 for Mac (Preview)\r\nVersion 7.7 Preview (7.7 build 762)\r\n\r\n**Build gist:**\r\nhttps://gist.github.com/p-lad/ab57d34a0ae37e0fc10a55981abcf105\r\n\r\n**Build taken:**\r\nhttps://devdiv.visualstudio.com/_apis/resources/Containers/2290021?itemPath=drop%2FVisualStudioForMac-Preview-7.7.0.762.dmg\r\n\r\n**Package console logs:**\r\nhttps://gist.github.com/p-lad/70dd810ea3e2f398fc55fd1b9dc2058f\r\n\r\n**Screencast link:**\r\nhttps://www.screencast.com/t/l4JxRtoOPUO\r\n\r\n**Reproducibility: 100%**\r\n\r\n**Attached logs as well.**\r\n[IDE logs.zip](https://github.com/NuGet/Home/files/2359542/IDE.logs.zip)\r\n\r\n\r\n"},{"Id":"8227599389","Type":"IssuesEvent","CreatedAt":"2018-09-06T23:57:51","Actor":"PatoBeltran","Repository":"NuGet/Home","Organization":"NuGet","RawContent":null,"RelatedAction":"closed","RelatedUrl":"https://github.com/NuGet/Home/issues/7265","RelatedDescription":"Closed issue \"nuget push -noSymbols doesn't work\" (#7265) at NuGet/Home","RelatedBody":"## Details about Problem\r\n\r\n### NuGet product used (NuGet.exe | VS UI | Package Manager Console | dotnet.exe):\r\n\r\n`nuget.exe` and `dotnet.exe`\r\n\r\n### NuGet version (x.x.x.xxx):\r\n\r\n`NuGet Version: 4.7.1.5393`\r\n\r\n### dotnet.exe --version (if appropriate):\r\n\r\n```\r\n.NET Core SDK (reflecting any global.json):\r\n Version:   2.1.401\r\n Commit:    91b1c13032\r\n\r\nRuntime Environment:\r\n OS Name:     Windows\r\n OS Version:  10.0.17134\r\n OS Platform: Windows\r\n RID:         win10-x64\r\n Base Path:   C:\\Program Files\\dotnet\\sdk\\2.1.401\\\r\n\r\nHost (useful for support):\r\n  Version: 2.1.3-servicing-26724-03\r\n  Commit:  124038c13e\r\n\r\n.NET Core SDKs installed:\r\n  2.1.201 [C:\\Program Files\\dotnet\\sdk]\r\n  2.1.202 [C:\\Program Files\\dotnet\\sdk]\r\n  2.1.302 [C:\\Program Files\\dotnet\\sdk]\r\n  2.1.400 [C:\\Program Files\\dotnet\\sdk]\r\n  2.1.401 [C:\\Program Files\\dotnet\\sdk]\r\n\r\n.NET Core runtimes installed:\r\n  Microsoft.AspNetCore.All 2.1.2 [C:\\Program Files\\dotnet\\shared\\Microsoft.AspNetCore.All]\r\n  Microsoft.AspNetCore.App 2.1.2 [C:\\Program Files\\dotnet\\shared\\Microsoft.AspNetCore.App]\r\n  Microsoft.NETCore.App 2.0.7 [C:\\Program Files\\dotnet\\shared\\Microsoft.NETCore.App]\r\n  Microsoft.NETCore.App 2.0.9 [C:\\Program Files\\dotnet\\shared\\Microsoft.NETCore.App]\r\n  Microsoft.NETCore.App 2.1.2 [C:\\Program Files\\dotnet\\shared\\Microsoft.NETCore.App]\r\n  Microsoft.NETCore.App 2.1.3-servicing-26724-03 [C:\\Program Files\\dotnet\\shared\\Microsoft.NETCore.App]\r\n```\r\n\r\n### OS version (i.e. win10 v1607 (14393.321)):\r\n\r\n```\r\n OS Name:     Windows\r\n OS Version:  10.0.17134\r\n OS Platform: Windows\r\n```\r\n\r\n### Worked before?

I know that uploading both packages with one `nuget push` command doesn't work, so I am trying to upload them separately. Thought -noSymbols should do but the output above shows that it is ignored. Btw, `dotnet nuget push ... --no-symbols` fails with \"error: Missing value for option 'no-symbols'\" but if I specify `dotnet nuget push ... --no-symbols whatever` it fails as in 3 above.\r\n\r\n"}],"ResultType":"GitHubEvent"},"Announcements":{"Events":[{"Id":"8059595751","Type":"IssuesEvent","CreatedAt":"2018-08-02T22:42:29","Actor":"anangaur","Repository":"NuGet/Announcements","Organization":"NuGet","RawContent":null,"RelatedAction":"opened","RelatedUrl":"https://github.com/NuGet/Announcements/issues/30","RelatedDescription":"Opened issue \"Show source repository information for packages on nuget.org\" (#30) at NuGet/Announcements","RelatedBody":"The spec to **Show source repository information for packages on nuget.org** , is ready for **review**:\r\n\r\n|Spec wiki|Discussion issue|\r\n|:----------|:------------------|\r\n|[Show source repository information for packages on nuget.org](https://github.com/NuGet/Home/wiki/Show-source-repository-information-for-packages-on-nuget.org) | https://github.com/NuGet/NuGetGallery/issues/4941 |\r\n\r\n**Note**: This is a short term feature to just light up the repository information on nuget.org using the `<repository>`  metadata in the nuspec.
