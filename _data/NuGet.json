Should I need to include other feeds to get the `dotnet restore` to work after doing a `dotnet new xunit`? I was following this document: [Organizing and testing projects with the .NET Core command line](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/core/tutorials/testing-with-cli#testing-the-sample). Some of the references are a little old so maybe something changed? \r\n\r\n## Steps performed\r\n\r\n```\r\ndotnet new xunit\r\ndotnet restore\r\n```\r\n\r\n## System Information\r\n\r\n```\r\nC:\\Users\\Phillip\\Desktop\\dotNetCore\\01_NewTypes\\test\\NewTypesTests>systeminfo\r\n\r\nHost Name:                 FENIX\r\nOS Name:                   Microsoft Windows 10 Pro\r\nOS Version:                10.0.18362 N/A Build 18362\r\nOS Manufacturer:           Microsoft Corporation\r\n```\r\n\r\n## `dotnet` Errors\r\n```\r\nC:\\Users\\Phillip\\Desktop\\dotNetCore\\01_NewTypes\\test\\NewTypesTests>dotnet restore \r\nRestore completed in 25.54 ms for C:\\Users\\Phillip\\Desktop\\dotNetCore\\01_NewTypes\\src\\NewTypes\\NewTypes.csproj.\r\nC:\\Users\\Phillip\\Desktop\\dotNetCore\\01_NewTypes\\test\\NewTypesTests\\NewTypesTests.csproj : error NU1100: Unable to resolve 'Microsoft.NET.Test.Sdk (>= 16.2.0)' for '.NETCoreApp,Version=v3.1'.\r\nC:\\Users\\Phillip\\Desktop\\dotNetCore\\01_NewTypes\\test\\NewTypesTests\\NewTypesTests.csproj : error NU1100: Unable to resolve 'xunit (>= 2.4.0)' for '.NETCoreApp,Version=v3.1'.\r\nC:\\Users\\Phillip\\Desktop\\dotNetCore\\01_NewTypes\\test\\NewTypesTests\\NewTypesTests.csproj : error NU1100: Unable to resolve 'xunit.runner.visualstudio (>= 2.4.0)' for '.NETCoreApp,Version=v3.1'.\r\nC:\\Users\\Phillip\\Desktop\\dotNetCore\\01_NewTypes\\test\\NewTypesTests\\NewTypesTests.csproj : error NU1100: Unable to resolve 'coverlet.collector (>= 1.0.1)' for '.NETCoreApp,Version=v3.1'.\r\n  Restore failed in 150.83 ms for C:\\Users\\Phillip\\Desktop\\dotNetCore\\01_NewTypes\\test\\NewTypesTests\\NewTypesTests.csproj.\r\n```\r\n\r\n## `dotnet` information\r\n\r\n```\r\nC:\\Users\\Phillip\\Desktop\\dotNetCore\\01_NewTypes\\test\\NewTypesTests>dotnet --info\r\n.NET Core SDK (reflecting any global.json):\r\n Version:   3.1.100\r\n Commit:    cd82f021f4\r\n\r\nRuntime Environment:\r\n OS Name:     Windows\r\n OS Version:  10.0.18362\r\n OS Platform: Windows\r\n RID:         win10-x64\r\n Base Path:   C:\\Program Files\\dotnet\\sdk\\3.1.100\\\r\n\r\nHost (useful for support):\r\n  Version: 3.1.0\r\n  Commit:  65f04fb6db\r\n\r\n.NET Core SDKs installed:\r\n  3.1.100 [C:\\Program Files\\dotnet\\sdk]\r\n\r\n.NET Core runtimes installed:\r\n  Microsoft.AspNetCore.App 3.1.0 [C:\\Program Files\\dotnet\\shared\\Microsoft.AspNetCore.App]\r\n  Microsoft.NETCore.App 3.1.0 [C:\\Program Files\\dotnet\\shared\\Microsoft.NETCore.App]\r\n  Microsoft.WindowsDesktop.App 3.1.0 [C:\\Program Files\\dotnet\\shared\\Microsoft.WindowsDesktop.App]\r\n\r\nTo install additional .NET Core runtimes or SDKs:\r\n  https://aka.ms/dotnet-download\r\n```\r\n\r\n_Copied from original issue: dotnet/sdk#4156_"}],"ResultType":"GitHubEvent"},"Announcements":{"Events":[{"Id":"10740159942","Type":"IssuesEvent","CreatedAt":"2019-10-29T17:39:29","Actor":"anangaur","Repository":"NuGet/Announcements","Organization":"NuGet","RawContent":null,"RelatedAction":"opened","RelatedUrl":"https://github.com/NuGet/Announcements/issues/39","RelatedDescription":"Opened issue \"Flag vulnerable packages\" (#39) at NuGet/Announcements","RelatedBody":"The spec for 'Flagging vulnerable packages' is ready for **review**:\r\n\r\n|Spec wiki|Discussion issue|\r\n|----------|------------------|\r\n|[Flag vulnerable packages](https://github.com/NuGet/Home/wiki/Flag-vulnerable-packages) | https://github.com/nuget/home/issues/8087|"}],"ResultType":"GitHubEvent"},"Twitter":{"ResultType":"TwitterTimeline","Tweets":[{"Id":"1219766107269025792","CreatedAt":"2020-01-21T23:37:56+00:00","UserScreenname":"nuget","Text":"https://t.co/F9kiKfdOWi package publishing is currently facing technical difficulty and new packages pushed to… https://t.co/4E67LHHnbI","Source":"<a href=\"https://about.twitter.com/products/tweetdeck\" rel=\"nofollow\">TweetDeck</a>","RetweetCount":2,"FavoriteCount":2,"RawContent":null},{"Id":"1204812404573392897","CreatedAt":"2019-12-11T17:17:16+00:00","UserScreenname":"nuget","Text":"We are currently experiencing CDN issues in a few geographies.  https://t.co/F9kiKfdOWi services like package resto… https://t.co/0ZVMeF11CW","Source":"<a href=\"http://twitter.com/download/iphone\" rel=\"nofollow\">Twitter for iPhone</a>","RetweetCount":10,"FavoriteCount":8,"RawContent":null},{"Id":"1190360390980395008","CreatedAt":"2019-11-01T20:10:07+00:00","UserScreenname":"nuget","Text":"The issue with the publishing pipeline has been resolved and packages are now being published normally. https://t.co/NdK8mVk7UF","Source":"<a href=\"https://about.twitter.com/products/tweetdeck\" rel=\"nofollow\">TweetDeck</a>","RetweetCount":3,"FavoriteCount":0,"RawContent":null},{"Id":"1190331936293572608","CreatedAt":"2019-11-01T18:17:03+00:00","UserScreenname":"nuget","Text":"We are experiencing an issue with our publishing pipeline causing a delay in the publishing of new packages.
