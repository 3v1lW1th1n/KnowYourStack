Windows Server 1709 includes the .NET Framework 4.7.1. .NET Framework 4.6.2 and .NET Framework 4.7 images are only available with Windows Server 2016 images. You can see an example of 1709-based images in the following example.\r\n\r\n![.NET Framework Windows 1709 images](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/2608468/32028249-6684a82c-b9a2-11e7-8afa-1b1abf89eb3b.png)\r\n\r\nYou can identify Windows Server 1709-based .NET Framework images with the tag substring `windowsservercore-1709` and Windows Server 2016 images with the tag substring `windowsservercore-10.0.14393`. You will likely notice that the 1709-based images are easier to identify than the Windows Server 2016 ones. \r\n\r\nChanges have been made in Windows Server 1709 that affect the [compatibility of Windows container images](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/virtualization/windowscontainers/deploy-containers/version-compatibility). The practical impact is that Windows Server 2016, Windows 10 Anniversary Update, and Windows 10 Creative Update hosts cannot load Windows Server 1709 images. Windows 10 Fall Creative Update and Windows Server 1709 can load both original Windows Server 2016 and Windows Server 1709 images. Windows Server 1709 requires Hyper-V isolation (`docker run --isolation=hyperv`) in order to load Windows Server 2016 images.\r\n\r\nGiven the compatibility differences with Windows container images, .NET Framework images will adopt [manifest lists](https://github.com/Microsoft/dotnet-framework-docker/issues/32) so that a single logical tag, like `4.7.1`, can be used on both older and newer Windows 10 and Windows Server versions. `docker pull microsoft/dotnet-framework:4.7.1` will pull a Windows Server 2016 image on Windows Server 2016, Windows 10 Anniversary Update, and Windows 10 Creators Update machines. The same command will pull a Windows Server 1709 based image on Windows Server 1709 and Windows 10 Fall Creators Update machines. The same rules apply to FROM lines. [.NET Core](https://hub.docker.com/r/microsoft/dotnet) Docker images use this same feature to support Linux and Windows hosts and AMD64 and ARM32 hosts with the same logical tag, like `2.0-runtime`.\r\n\r\nThe following tags will be updated to use manifest lists:\r\n\r\n- `latest`\r\n- `4.7.1`\r\n- `3.5`\r\n\r\nYou need [Docker 17.10](https://docs.docker.com/release-notes/docker-ce/#17100-ce-2017-10-17) or later to use Windows-version-specific manifest list tags. The following change from the Docker 17.10 release notes is the one that enables this functionality.\r\n\r\n* Add support for Windows version filtering on pull [moby/moby#35090](https://github.com/moby/moby/pull/35090)\r\n\r\nYou are only recommended to use manifest tags if you want flexibility for development and deployment environments. That's what manifest tags deliver. In general, you should select the most specific tag you can. The more specific the tag, the more predictable the result of each `docker pull` and `docker build` will be."},{"Id":"6761784781","Type":"IssuesEvent","CreatedAt":"2017-10-25T04:03:38","Actor":"richlander","Repository":"dotnet/announcements","Organization":"dotnet","RawContent":null,"RelatedAction":"opened","RelatedUrl":"https://github.com/dotnet/announcements/issues/35","RelatedDescription":"Opened issue \"microsoft/dotnet-framework latest tag updated to 4.7.1\" (#35) at dotnet/announcements","RelatedBody":"# microsoft/dotnet-framework latest tag updated to 4.7.1\r\n\r\nThe [.NET Framework 4.7.1](https://blogs.msdn.microsoft.com/dotnet/2017/10/17/announcing-the-net-framework-4-7-1/) was released earlier this month.

This advisory also provides guidance on what developers can do to update their applications correctly.\r\n\r\nMicrosoft is aware of a security vulnerability in the public version of .NET Core where a malformed string request could cause an application to crash and lead to a denial of service.\r\n\r\nSystem administrators are advised to update their .NET Core runtimes to versions 1.0.7 and 1.1.4. Developers are advised to update their .NET Core SDK to version 1.1.4.\r\n\r\n### Discussion\r\n\r\nUse https://github.com/dotnet/corefx/issues/24703 for discussion of this advisory.\r\n\r\n### Mitigation Factors\r\n\r\n.NET Core 2.0 is not affected by this issue.\r\n\r\n### Advisory FAQ\r\n#### How do I know if I am affected?\r\n\r\nAny application running against .NET Core 1.0.6 or lower versions, or 1.1.2 or lower versions is affected. The latest version of the .NET core runtime you have installed in your computer can be listed by running `dotnet --info`. Running that command produces an output similar to the following:\r\n\r\n```\r\n.NET Command Line Tools (2.0.2)\r\n\r\nProduct Information:\r\n Version:            2.0.2\r\n Commit SHA-1 hash:  a04b4bf512\r\n\r\nRuntime Environment:\r\n OS Name:     Windows\r\n OS Version:  10.0.16299\r\n OS Platform: Windows\r\n RID:         win10-x64\r\n Base Path:   C:\\Program Files\\dotnet\\sdk\\2.0.2\\\r\n\r\nMicrosoft .NET Core Shared Framework Host\r\n\r\n  Version  : 2.0.0\r\n  Build    : e8b8861ac7faf042c87a5c2f9f2d04c98b69f28d\r\n```\r\n\r\nAs this command only displays the latest version of the runtime installed (or the version set in the *global.json* file), it may hide the fact that you have a vulnerable runtime. A complete list of runtimes can be discovered by performing a directory listing in the install root directories. The default root directories are listed in the following table:\r\n\r\n| Operating System | Location          |\r\n|------------------|-------------------|\r\n| Windows          | C:\\Program Files\\dotnet\\shared\\Microsoft.NETCore.App\\ |\r\n| macOS            | /usr/local/share/dotnet/shared/Microsoft.NETCore.App/ |\r\n| [Supported Linux platforms](https://docs.microsoft.com/dotnet/core/linux-prerequisites#supported-linux-versions) | /usr/share/dotnet/shared/Microsoft.NETCore.App/ |\r\n\r\nEach runtime version is installed in its own directory, where the directory name is the version number. If you don't have a directory for 1.0.7 and 1.1.4, then any applications targeting 1.0 or 1.1 of .NET Core are vulnerable.\r\n\r\nAlso, even if you have a directory for 1.0.7 and 1.1.4 present in your system, if you've deployed [self-contained applications](https://docs.microsoft.com/dotnet/core/deploying/#self-contained-deployments-scd) targeting the impacted versions, these applications are also vulnerable.\r\n\r\n#### How do I fix my affected application?\r\nApplications can be fixed by installing the latest .NET Core runtimes or SDKs. Typically, application servers only have runtime packages installed and developer machines have the SDKs installed. Installers for the runtimes can be downloaded from the [Runtime and SDK download archive](https://github.com/dotnet/core/blob/master/release-notes/download-archive.md). .NET Core 1.1.4 SDK installs both versions 1.0.7 and 1.1.4 of the .NET Core runtime.\r\n\r\nIf you've built a [self-contained application](https://docs.microsoft.com/dotnet/core/deploying/#self-contained-deployments-scd), you must install the new runtime and SDK, recompile your application and redeploy.\r\n\r\n#### What if the update breaks my application?\r\nAn application can be pinned to a previous version of the runtime by editing the [*application.runtime.config*](https://github.com/dotnet/cli/blob/ede74b6be1406ba0c086b6d5fc1a5d4eacff1f01/Documentation/specs/runtime-configuration-file.md#appnameruntimeconfigjson) file for that application. Set the framework version to the desired version and the `rollForward` property to `false`. These settings should be treated as a temporary measure and the application updated to work with the patched versions of the framework.\r\n\r\nSince the *application.runtime.config* file is an optional file, you may need to create one for each application and add it alongside the executable."},{"Id":"6725652001","Type":"IssuesEvent","CreatedAt":"2017-10-17T06:48:14","Actor":"richlander","Repository":"dotnet/announcements","Organization":"dotnet","RawContent":null,"RelatedAction":"opened","RelatedUrl":"https://github.com/dotnet/announcements/issues/33","RelatedDescription":"Opened issue \".NET Framework Docker Performance Issue Resolved\" (#33) at dotnet/announcements","RelatedBody":"# .NET Framework Docker Performance Issue Resolved\r\n\r\nMultiple people have [reported](https://github.com/Microsoft/dotnet-framework-docker/issues/25) that [.NET Framework performance in Docker images is poor](https://github.com/moby/moby/issues/33096).

They are now correctly generated and expected performance has been restored.\r\n\r\n## Discussion \r\n\r\nPlease share your thoughts on this change and see what others are saying at:\r\n\r\n* [dotnet-framework-docker #29](https://github.com/Microsoft/dotnet-framework-docker/pull/29)\r\n\r\n## Details\r\n\r\n* [dotnet-framework-docker #27](https://github.com/Microsoft/dotnet-framework-docker/pull/27)\r\n\r\nThe .NET Framework uses [NGEN](https://docs.microsoft.com/dotnet/framework/tools/ngen-exe-native-image-generator) as a primary mechanism for startup performance. .NET Framework assemblies are compiled to native code with the NGEN tool as part of the .NET Framework setup process. The benefit of these files is that they can be loaded and executed without any additional significant extra work required by the Common Language Runtime (CLR). The lack of  additional work means that performance is very good.\r\n\r\nNGEN image generation interacts with a Windows subsystem that is not correctly supported in Windows containers. NGEN images are generated in Windows containers, but they are not valid. Fortunately, the CLR can still run in the presence of invalid images, but code execution is much slower.\r\n\r\nWe are in the process of fixing Windows containers so that NGEN will work correctly. In the interim, we have updated the [dotnet-framework/](https://hub.docker.com/r/microsoft/dotnet-framework/) images to correctly generate NGEN images. The [microsoft/windowsservercore/](https://hub.docker.com/r/microsoft/windowsservercore/) images still have the performance problem that was initially reported. We are working on updating Windows containers so that NGEN works as expected. You are recommended to use the [dotnet-framework/](https://hub.docker.com/r/microsoft/dotnet-framework/) base image if you can, so that you can get better performance.\r\n\r\nOne of the developers that reported the performance issue shared basic performance results. The first two rows are the before state. The last row is the dotnet-framework image after the fix. The improvement is quite significant.\r\n\r\n> Runing `powershell -command (measure-command { powershell -command exit }).TotalSeconds` in various images on our CI server produced this table of timings:\r\n \r\n| time (s) | image |\r\n|----------|--------|\r\n|10.7212372| microsoft/windowsservercore |\r\n|8.3278793  | microsoft/dotnet-framework:4.7|\r\n|0.6426073  | microsoft/dotnet-framework:4.7 (after fix)|\r\n"},{"Id":"6645912196","Type":"IssuesEvent","CreatedAt":"2017-09-27T19:47:08","Actor":"terrajobst","Repository":"dotnet/announcements","Organization":"dotnet","RawContent":null,"RelatedAction":"opened","RelatedUrl":"https://github.com/dotnet/announcements/issues/32","RelatedDescription":"Opened issue \".NET Framework 4.7.1 provides built-in support for .NET Standard 2.0\" (#32) at dotnet/announcements","RelatedBody":"## Summary\r\n\r\n.NET Framework 4.7.1 will have built-in support for .NET Standard 2.0. This means that you don't have to deploy any additional files or use binding redirects to use .NET Standard 2.0 libraries.\r\n\r\nFor a demo, check out [this video][video].\r\n\r\n## Details\r\n\r\nWhile libraries targeting [.NET Standard 2.0][ns20post] are can be consumed by applications and libraries [targeting .NET Framework 4.6.1][nstable] and higher, not all files that are required for .NET Standard libraries were part of .NET Framework 4.6.1. In fact, .NET Framework 4.6.1 was shipped before .NET Standard 2.0 was even designed. That's why building an application targeting .NET Framework 4.6.1 (as well as 4.6.2 and 4.7) will have to deploy additional files.\r\n\r\n* If you use **Visual Studio 2017 15.3** or higher, these files are automatically copied to the application's output folder.\r\n\r\n* If you use **Visual Studio 2015 and [use NuGet 3.6][nuget36]**, we'll prompt you to install a [support package][vs2015support] which will handle copying the files to the output directory.\r\n\r\nStarting with .NET Framework 4.7.1 these files no longer have to be deployed with the application -- they are built right into the .NET Framework itself.\r\n\r\n.NET Framework 4.7.1 also adds[about 200 missing APIs][missingapis] that were part of .NET Standard 2.0 but not actually implemented by .NET Framework 4.6.1, 4.6.2 or 4.7.\r\n\r\nThis also removes the need for [binding redirects][netfx-issues] when using .NET Standard libraries on .NET Framework because the CLR automatically unifies version numbers of assemblies that are part of the platform.\r\n\r\nLearn more [by reading the .NET Standard FAQ](http://aka.ms/netstandardfaq).\r\n\r\n## Discussion\r\n\r\nDiscussion\r\n\r\nFor a discussion, please go to dotnet/standard#514.\r\n\r\n[ns20post]: https://blogs.msdn.microsoft.com/dotnet/2017/08/14/announcing-net-standard-2-0/\r\n[nstable]: https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/standard/net-standard\r\n[nuget36]: https://dist.nuget.org/visualstudio-2015-vsix/v3.6.0/NuGet.Tools.vsix\r\n[vs2015support]: https://aka.ms/netstandard-build-support-netfx\r\n[missingapis]: https://github.com/dotnet/standard/blob/master/netstandard/src/ApiCompatBaseline.net461.txt\r\n[netfx-issues]: https://github.com/dotnet/standard/issues/481\r\n[video]: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u67Eu_IgEMs\r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/dotnet/standard/issues/514"}],"ResultType":"GitHubEvent"},"CoreCLR":{"Events":[{"Id":"6779436797","Type":"PullRequestEvent","CreatedAt":"2017-10-28T22:56:49","Actor":"kouvel","Repository":"dotnet/coreclr","Organization":"dotnet","RawContent":null,"RelatedAction":"opened","RelatedUrl":"https://github.com/dotnet/coreclr/pull/14739","RelatedDescription":"Opened pull request \"Clean up YieldProcessorNormalized\" (#14739) at dotnet/coreclr","RelatedBody":"Separated YieldProcessorNormalized changes from PR https://github.com/dotnet/coreclr/pull/14216 to simplify that PR:\r\n- Moved YieldProcessorNormalized into separate files\r\n- Cleaned up YieldProcessorNormalized"},{"Id":"6779105587","Type":"IssuesEvent","CreatedAt":"2017-10-28T18:51:29","Actor":"shravan2x","Repository":"dotnet/coreclr","Organization":"dotnet","RawContent":null,"RelatedAction":"opened","RelatedUrl":"https://github.com/dotnet/coreclr/issues/14738","RelatedDescription":"Opened issue \"High memory usage on Ubuntu 16\" (#14738) at dotnet/coreclr","RelatedBody":"_This is a cross post from https://github.com/aspnet/Home/issues/2052 and https://github.com/aspnet/KestrelHttpServer/issues/2141.

Doing so completely breaks restore by applying the TargetFramework to all projects transitively. The correct behavior is to restore for all frameworks, then build/publish/etc for the given target framework. Achieving that still requires two distinct msbuild process invocations.\r\n\r\nThis also changes the verbosity of implicit restore from quiet to that of the subsequent command (default=minimal). Similar to global properties, we cannot specify a distinct console verbosity for the /restore portion of the overall execution. For consistency, we apply the same verbosity change to the case where we still use two separate msbuild invocations.\r\n\r\nOutput Before:\r\n```\r\n[Logo]\r\n  qwert -> D:\\temp\\qwert\\bin\\Debug\\netcoreapp2.0\\qwert.dll.\r\n[Summary]\r\n```\r\n\r\nOutput After:\r\n```\r\n[Logo]\r\n  Restoring packages for D:\\temp\\qwert\\qwert.csproj...\r\n  Installing Newtonsoft.Json 10.0.3.\r\n  Restore completed in 763.37 ms for D:\\temp\\qwert\\qwert.csproj.\r\n  qwert -> D:\\temp\\qwert\\bin\\Debug\\netcoreapp2.0\\qwert.dll\r\n[Summary]\r\n```\r\n\r\nIn the incremental no-op restore case, only the line about \"Restore completed in X for Y\" is added. \r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/NuGet/Home/issues/4695 tracks reducing restores output when verbosity is minimal.\r\n\r\n\r\nThis also fixes an issue where the separate restore invocation's msbuild log would be overwritten by the subsequent command execution. However, this remains unfixed in the case where we still use two separate msbuild invocations.\r\n\r\nThe first two commits are strictly separate, but were getting in the way of test changes I needed to make so I tackled them here.\r\n* Remove necessary handling of verbosity in RestoreCommand\r\n* Fix #7009, Cannot pass /clp:NoSummary to dotnet build\r\n"}],"ResultType":"GitHubEvent"},"Standard":{"Events":[{"Id":"6778790926","Type":"PullRequestEvent","CreatedAt":"2017-10-28T15:19:20","Actor":"dotnet-maestro-bot","Repository":"dotnet/standard","Organization":"dotnet","RawContent":null,"RelatedAction":"opened","RelatedUrl":"https://github.com/dotnet/standard/pull/563","RelatedDescription":"Opened pull request \"Update BuildTools to prerelease-02128-02 (master)\" (#563) at dotnet/standard","RelatedBody":""},{"Id":"6778163753","Type":"IssuesEvent","CreatedAt":"2017-10-28T06:47:01","Actor":"safern","Repository":"dotnet/standard","Organization":"dotnet","RawContent":null,"RelatedAction":"closed","RelatedUrl":"https://github.com/dotnet/standard/issues/560","RelatedDescription":"Closed issue \"msbuild error - .NET 4.7.1 console app referrencing dotnet standard 2.0 lib\" (#560) at dotnet/standard","RelatedBody":"Hello, \r\nI got in troubles on my dev environments with switching from .NET Framework 4.6.1 to  4.7.1.\r\nFinally I tried to create simple solution with (console app 4.7.1+ lib ,targeting .netstandard2.0), which build  ended up with:\r\nerror CS0012: The type 'Object' is defined in an assembly that is not referenced.
