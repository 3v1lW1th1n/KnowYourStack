Regarding FastTree/LightGBM we may want to refine the public prediction/learned model surface a bit more.\r\n\r\nThe structures exposed here, including [`TreeEnsemble`](https://github.com/dotnet/machinelearning/blob/00577c06ff99ad07006ca8c58cf974943cb1971f/src/Microsoft.ML.FastTree/TreeEnsemble/TreeEnsemble.cs#L21) but especially [`RegressionTree`](https://github.com/dotnet/machinelearning/blob/00577c06ff99ad07006ca8c58cf974943cb1971f/src/Microsoft.ML.FastTree/TreeEnsemble/RegressionTree.cs#L22), are dual use structures in the sense that they are used for both training and prediction. This means it is irretreivably mutable (as it must be during training) even during prediction. It is polymorphic in its structure, in the sense that various structures are active and populated during training than are used during prediction -- worse, in some cases the *same* structures are used, but have distinct meanings. (E.g., the feature indices during training are distinct from those used during prediction, since if FastTree determines it can only use a subset of features, it will during training not even consider the unusable features to exist, until it is done with training and maps the structure back to the original feature space so it is usable by ML.NET.) There are other serious but (in context) comparatively minor notes, like not being either sealed or abstract, disobeying more .NET naming and implementation guidelines than I care to enumerate, etc.\r\n\r\nYet, we cannot avoid exposing *some* structure, since of course people want to inspect the trees they have learnt. And, we use this structure to represent the trained ensembles of both the FastTree and LightGBM learner, and, if we ever clean up our XGBoost wrapper so it can be open sourced (or, perhaps even, someone implements a fresh wrapper for us), maybe it will wind up using exactly that same structure. This will also serve them better since this class's structure is, for the same reasons enumerated above, incomprehensible, since about half the members on it are things people shouldn't use. (Since they are used as explained above exclusively during training.)\r\n\r\nWhat should be done instead is the following: during training there is an internal class, in fact, probably more or less the same class that exists now, with a separate *immutable* class that is exposed as the model during training, created out of instances of this class. This also implies a separate training/prediction structure of what is currently called `TreeEnsemble`, and of course the quantile trees will have to be fashioned in some way. Much of the code supporting prediction and the standard ML.NET interfaces would move into *that* set of immutable classes.","Url":"https://github.com/dotnet/machinelearning/issues/1960","RelatedDescription":"Open issue \"Make FastTree/LightGBM learned model suitable for public consumption\" (#1960)"},{"Id":"393694338","IsPullRequest":false,"CreatedAt":"2018-12-22T18:35:09","Actor":"ganik","Number":"1959","RawContent":null,"Title":" internal static partial class Utils is not accessible anymore from NimbusML","State":"open","Body":"This is a breaking changes in ML.NET 0.8 or later for NimbusML\r\nPls advise\r\n\r\n","Url":"https://github.com/dotnet/machinelearning/issues/1959","RelatedDescription":"Open issue \" internal static partial class Utils is not accessible anymore from NimbusML\" (#1959)"},{"Id":"393693702","IsPullRequest":false,"CreatedAt":"2018-12-22T18:25:16","Actor":"ganik","Number":"1958","RawContent":null,"Title":"ArgumentAttribute is inaccessible due to its protection level from NimbusML","State":"open","Body":"ML.Runtime.CommandLine.ArgumentAttribute is inaccessible anymore from NimbusML. \r\nPlease advise how to proceed\r\n\r\nthx","Url":"https://github.com/dotnet/machinelearning/issues/1958","RelatedDescription":"Open issue \"ArgumentAttribute is inaccessible due to its protection level from NimbusML\" (#1958)"},{"Id":"393693371","IsPullRequest":false,"CreatedAt":"2018-12-22T18:20:51","Actor":"ganik","Number":"1957","RawContent":null,"Title":"Contracts is internal and inaccessible from NimbusML","State":"open","Body":"NimbusML has DotNetBridge that uses Microsoft.ML.Runtime.Contracts(..) throughout its code base.
