I eventually found out that I was missing the \"px\" in my bindings and everything was fine again.\r\n\r\nImo, It would be helpful to warn the author (at least in development mode) that the binding is just a pure number which might not be what the developer intended.\r\n\r\nThis could also be used for other properties like height, paddings and margins.\r\n\r\n### What does the proposed API look like?\r\nNot an API, just a warning: \"The width/height/... is a pure number, maybe you're missing 'px' for example?\"\r\n\r\n<!-- generated by vue-issues.
