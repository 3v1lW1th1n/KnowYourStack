Seems to be an issue considered to be crosscutting?\r\n\r\n\r\n### Is this a regression?\r\nYes, the previous version in which this bug was not present was: Angular 7.3.7;  It also works with Angular 8.0.0-beta.10 when not using Ivy\r\n\r\nAccording to this [source for Ivy status](https://github.com/angular/angular/blob/master/packages/core/src/render3/STATUS.md#crosscutting), extending components should now be supported with Ivy if I'm not mistaken.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Description\r\nWhen a component extends another component, the derived component and the components included in its template are not rendered on the screen.  I can see the the component tag by inspecting the DOM with devtools, but its actual content is not displayed.\r\n\r\nI can also verify the constructor of the base class is called as expected.  However, it is not possible to get a reference to a child component inserted in the template of the derived component using @ViewChild (neither from the base component nor from the derived component).\r\n\r\n## üî¨ Minimal Reproduction\r\nI have created this repo with a minimal reproduction of the problem: [Component inheritance with Ivy](https://github.com/MakesNine/TestIvy8Beta10)\r\n\r\nI have also created another repo, with the same code but created with Angular 8.0.0-beta.10 without Ivy enabled to show that it works in this case: [Component inheritance without Ivy](https://github.com/MakesNine/TestNoIvy)\r\n\r\n## üî• Exception or Error\r\nContent is not rendered and @ViewChild doesn't work.\r\n\r\n\r\n## üåç  Your Environment\r\n\r\nAngular CLI: 8.0.0-beta.10\r\nNode: 10.15.0\r\nOS: win32 x64\r\nAngular: 8.0.0-beta.10\r\n... animations, cli, common, compiler, compiler-cli, core, forms\r\n... language-service, platform-browser, platform-browser-dynamic\r\n... router\r\n\r\nPackage                           Version\r\n-----------------------------------------------------------\r\n@angular-devkit/architect         0.800.0-beta.10\r\n@angular-devkit/build-angular     0.800.0-beta.10\r\n@angular-devkit/build-optimizer   0.800.0-beta.10\r\n@angular-devkit/build-webpack     0.800.0-beta.10\r\n@angular-devkit/core              8.0.0-beta.10\r\n@angular-devkit/schematics        8.0.0-beta.10\r\n@ngtools/webpack                  8.0.0-beta.10\r\n@schematics/angular               8.0.0-beta.10\r\n@schematics/update                0.800.0-beta.10\r\nrxjs                              6.4.0\r\ntypescript                        3.3.4000\r\nwebpack                           4.29.6\r\n\r\n**Anything else relevant?**\r\nTested with Chrome\r\n","Url":"https://github.com/angular/angular/issues/29687","RelatedDescription":"Open issue \"[Ivy] Component composition (inheritance) breaks rendering\" (#29687)"},{"Id":"428794617","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2019-04-03T14:17:27","Actor":"MartinMa","Number":"29685","RawContent":null,"Title":"feat(core): add missing ARIA attributes to html sanitizer","State":"open","Body":"Allow ARIA attributes from the WAI-ARIA 1.1 spec, which were stripped by the `htmlSanitizer`.\r\n\r\nCloses #26815\r\n\r\n## PR Checklist\r\n\r\n- [x] The commit message follows our guidelines: https://github.com/angular/angular/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md#commit\r\n- [x] Tests for the changes have been added (for bug fixes / features)\r\n- [ ] Docs have been added / updated (for bug fixes / features)\r\n\r\n## PR Type\r\nWhat kind of change does this PR introduce?\r\n\r\n- [x] Feature\r\n\r\n## What is the current behavior?\r\nAria attributes like `aria-label` are being stripped by the html sanitizer as unsafe html.\r\n\r\nIssue Number: #26815\r\n\r\n## What is the new behavior?\r\n`aria-*` attributes are treated as safe html and are not being stripped by the html sanitizer (for example when used within `[innerHTML]`).\r\n\r\n## Does this PR introduce a breaking change?\r\n\r\n- [x] No","Url":"https://github.com/angular/angular/pull/29685","RelatedDescription":"Open PR \"feat(core): add missing ARIA attributes to html sanitizer\" (#29685)"},{"Id":"428791396","IsPullRequest":false,"CreatedAt":"2019-04-03T14:11:35","Actor":"jonrimmer","Number":"29684","RawContent":null,"Title":"Dependency injection for pipes does not follow view hierarchy","State":"open","Body":"# üêû bug report\r\n\r\n### Affected Package\r\nThe issue is caused by package @angular/core\r\n\r\n\r\n### Is this a regression?\r\n\r\nNo(?)\r\n\r\n### Description\r\n\r\nIf a pipe injects a value, it does not consider the injectors of directives/components that are its parents in the template.

Create **app-routing.module.ts** to define paths, for **about-us** it would be like that:\r\n\r\n```\r\nimport { NgModule } from '@angular/core';\r\nimport { Routes, RouterModule } from '@angular/router';\r\n\r\nconst routes: Routes = [\r\n  {\r\n    path: 'about-us',\r\n    loadChildren: '@ditectrev-libs/about-us/src/lib/about-us.module#AboutUsModule'\r\n  }\r\n];\r\n\r\n@NgModule({\r\n  imports: [RouterModule.forRoot(routes)],\r\n  exports: [RouterModule]\r\n})\r\nexport class RoutingModule {}\r\n```\r\n\r\nStep 6. Add **<router-outlet>** to **app.component.html**, below:\r\n\r\n`<router-outlet></router-outlet>`\r\n\r\nStep 7.

We have a core product but have \"extensions\" to our software packaged separately. I'm using the lazy module (via `loadChildren`) support to be able to do subsequent builds. So our workflow is currently to start the `ng build` in watch mode with a custom configuration, and then add or remove modules to a lazy route file. The idea is that we may have thousands of extensions that are loaded dynamically by the client, so we only build them on demand. This is hard with webpack.\r\n\r\nThe problem I am experiencing is that after deleting these modules, webpack is still looking for them. \r\n\r\n<!-- ‚úçÔ∏è--> A clear and concise description of the problem...\r\n\r\n## üî¨ Minimal Reproduction\r\n\r\n1. Create an Angular application with one lazy route module with no routes (see below)\r\n2. Start `ng build --watch` \r\n3. Add in a new module file into the source directory (say module A)\r\n4.

The documentation of the [Angularlitics2](https://github.com/angulartics/angulartics2#remove-ids-from-url-paths) package shows that this works, and assuming the Angular documentation on [supported expressions in annotations](https://angular.io/guide/aot-compiler#expression-syntax) is still correct, it should work.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Description\r\nI'm using the [Angularlitics2](https://github.com/angulartics/angulartics2) package to track page views.  There is optional config to provide a RegExp that [removes ID's from tracked URL paths](https://github.com/angulartics/angulartics2#remove-ids-from-url-paths).  This seems to work fine for JIT (non-prod) builds.  But when adding the `--prod` flag, it seems that RegExp is stripped from the compiled build.\r\n\r\nThis is kind of a derivative of https://github.com/angular/angular-cli/issues/13702 which also doesn't work, but as pointed out in the bug, probably shouldn't work.\r\n\r\n\r\n## üî¨ Minimal Reproduction\r\nhttps://github.com/mtraynham/angular-module-regex-constructor\r\n\r\n1. `ng new angular-module-regex-constructor`  (routing Y; CSS)\r\n2. Add Angularlitics, e.g. this [commit](https://github.com/mtraynham/angular-module-regex-constructor/commit/39d4501b5d811d24aee60ab7ec1cbda4ab92b651).\r\n3. Compile with `ng build --prod`.\r\n4. Search for `idsRegExp` in the compiled output and find no instances of the configured `idsRegExp: new RegExp('^[a-z]\\\\d+$')`.\r\n\r\nI went ahead and ran `ng build --vendor-chunk`, `ng build --prod --vendor-chunk`, `ng build --prod --aot --vendor-chunk` and committed them to that same repository (after beautifying the main files).  It works in the standard build case, but not when using `--prod` as identified by the following lines:\r\n\r\nJIT - https://github.com/mtraynham/angular-module-regex-constructor/blob/master/dist/angular-module-regex-constructor/main.js#L149-L153\r\n```js\r\n                angulartics2__WEBPACK_IMPORTED_MODULE_5__[\"Angulartics2Module\"].forRoot({\r\n                    pageTracking: {\r\n                        clearIds: true,\r\n                        idsRegExp: new RegExp('^[a-z]\\\\d+$') /* Workaround: No NgModule metadata found for 'AppModule' */\r\n                    }\r\n                })\r\n```\r\n\r\nProd - https://github.com/mtraynham/angular-module-regex-constructor/blob/master/dist/angular-module-regex-constructor-prod/main.5ede6a1bdd2f105d28e3.js#L54\r\n```js\r\nb.qb(256, M.a, {settings: {pageTracking: {clearIds: !0}}}, [])\r\n```\r\n\r\nProd AOT - https://github.com/mtraynham/angular-module-regex-constructor/blob/master/dist/angular-module-regex-constructor-prod-aot/main.5ede6a1bdd2f105d28e3.js#L54\r\n```js\r\nb.qb(256, M.a, {settings: {pageTracking: {clearIds: !0}}}, [])\r\n```\r\n\r\n## üî• Exception or Error\r\nNo error thrown.\r\n\r\n## üåç Your Environment\r\n<pre><code>\r\nAngular CLI: 7.3.7\r\nNode: 11.13.0\r\nOS: darwin x64\r\nAngular: 7.2.11\r\n... animations, common, compiler, compiler-cli, core, forms\r\n... language-service, platform-browser, platform-browser-dynamic\r\n... router\r\n\r\nPackage                           Version\r\n-----------------------------------------------------------\r\n@angular-devkit/architect         0.13.7\r\n@angular-devkit/build-angular     0.13.7\r\n@angular-devkit/build-optimizer   0.13.7\r\n@angular-devkit/build-webpack     0.13.7\r\n@angular-devkit/core              7.3.7\r\n@angular-devkit/schematics        7.3.7\r\n@angular/cli                      7.3.7\r\n@ngtools/webpack                  7.3.7\r\n@schematics/angular               7.3.7\r\n@schematics/update                0.13.7\r\nrxjs                              6.3.3\r\ntypescript                        3.2.4\r\nwebpack                           4.29.0\r\n</code></pre>\r\n\r\n**Anything else relevant?**\r\n<!-- ‚úçÔ∏èIs this a browser specific issue?
