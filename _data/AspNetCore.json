The ASP.NET team's development resources are finite, and we think we can deliver more valuable features to ASP.NET developers by focusing elsewhere.\r\n\r\nSo:\r\n\r\n* The `Microsoft.DotNet.Web.Spa.ProjectTemplates` package, containing **Angular**, **React**, and **React+Redux** templates, is **not affected**. This ships in the .NET Core SDK and is officially supported. We continue to invest development effort in this package. We can put *more* time and effort into these SPA templates now the effort isn't so spread out.\r\n* If you have an existing Aurelia/Knockout/Vue project based on our SPA templates, you're not directly affected because these templates are only used to create new projects. You can continue building and shipping your app forever. Obviously we still support and enhance the underlying ASP.NET Core APIs (such as those in JavaScriptServices) that you are using.\r\n* The `Microsoft.AspNetCore.SpaTemplates` package, containing Aurelia, Knockout, and Vue templates, continues to be available, but we'll no longer update it or work on issues related to it.\r\n* We encourage enthusiastic community members to [ship your own `dotnet new` templates](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/core/tools/custom-templates). The `dotnet new` system is extensible for this exact reason. If you want to own the go-to Aurelia/Knockout/Vue project template, now's your chance! You could [fork the ones from `Microsoft.AspNetCore.SpaTemplates`](https://github.com/aspnet/templating/tree/dev/src/Microsoft.AspNetCore.SpaTemplates), or start from scratch depending on what you prefer.\r\n* In the long term, if another JavaScript SPA framework becomes dominant, we will of course consider adding a template for it to the SDK templates package.\r\n\r\nI know this will be irritating to some people, especially those who have worked on PRs for the Aurelia/Knockout/Vue templates.
