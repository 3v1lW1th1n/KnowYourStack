The problem was caused by the fact that extra statements were not appended to the temporary vars block, so they were missing in generated code. This commit updated the logic to use the `convertPropertyBinding` function, which contains the necessary code to append extra statements. The `convertExpressionBinding` function was removed as it duplicates the `convertPropertyBinding` one (for the most part) and is no longer used.\r\n\r\n## PR Type\r\nWhat kind of change does this PR introduce?\r\n\r\n- [x] Bugfix\r\n\r\n\r\n## Does this PR introduce a breaking change?\r\n\r\n- [ ] Yes\r\n- [x] No","Url":"https://github.com/angular/angular/pull/32309","RelatedDescription":"Open PR \"fix(ivy): handle expressions in i18n attributes properly\" (#32309)"},{"Id":"484860518","IsPullRequest":false,"CreatedAt":"2019-08-24T20:44:07","Actor":"skbgff","Number":"32308","RawContent":null,"Title":"ICP 1 Issue","State":"open","Body":"🛑🛑🛑🛑🛑🛑🛑🛑🛑🛑🛑🛑🛑🛑🛑🛑🛑🛑🛑🛑🛑🛑🛑🛑🛑🛑🛑\r\n\r\nPlease read https://angular.io/guide/security#report-issues on how to disclose security related issues.\r\n\r\n🛑🛑🛑🛑🛑🛑🛑🛑🛑🛑🛑🛑🛑🛑🛑🛑🛑🛑🛑🛑🛑🛑🛑🛑🛑🛑🛑\r\n","Url":"https://github.com/angular/angular/issues/32308","RelatedDescription":"Open issue \"ICP 1 Issue\" (#32308)"},{"Id":"484858560","IsPullRequest":false,"CreatedAt":"2019-08-24T20:18:50","Actor":"Xarenn","Number":"32307","RawContent":null,"Title":"FormBuilder can't find control (with name)","State":"open","Body":"Hello we have some errors with building FormGroup with FormBuilder.\r\nStackblitz: https://stackblitz.com/edit/angular-zhznxh?file=src%2Fapp%2Fapp.module.ts\r\ncode:\r\n\r\n> \r\n>  export class AppComponent  {\r\n>   name = 'Angular';\r\n>   private formWork: FormGroup;\r\n> \r\n>   constructor(\r\n>     private formBuilder: FormBuilder,\r\n>    ) {\r\n>     this.formWork = this.formBuilder.group([{\r\n>       contract: ['']\r\n>     }]);\r\n>   }\r\n>    onSubmit() {\r\n>     console.log('submint');\r\n>     console.log(this.formWork.value);\r\n>    }\r\n>  }\r\n>     <button (click)=\"clicked = !clicked\"> Clickme</button>\r\n>     <div class=\"container\" *ngIf=\"clicked\">\r\n>         <form [formGroup]=\"formWork\" (ngSubmit)=\"onSubmit()\">\r\n>             <input formControlName=\"contract\"\r\n>                    class=\"form-control\"\r\n>                    type=\"number\">\r\n>             <button (click)=\"onSubmit()\">Submint</button>\r\n> \r\n>         </form>\r\n>     </div>\r\n","Url":"https://github.com/angular/angular/issues/32307","RelatedDescription":"Open issue \"FormBuilder can't find control (with name)\" (#32307)"},{"Id":"484855450","IsPullRequest":false,"CreatedAt":"2019-08-24T19:39:41","Actor":"s0720bae","Number":"32306","RawContent":null,"Title":"ICP1 Issue","State":"open","Body":"🛑🛑🛑🛑🛑🛑🛑🛑🛑🛑🛑🛑🛑🛑🛑🛑🛑🛑🛑🛑🛑🛑🛑🛑🛑🛑🛑\r\n\r\nPlease do not file questions or support requests on the GitHub issues tracker.\r\n\r\nYou can get your questions answered using other communication channels.

To accomplish this, ngcc\r\ntraverses the full import graph of the entry-points it encounters, for\r\nwhich it uses a dependency host to find all module imports. Since\r\nimports look different in the various bundle formats ngcc supports, a\r\nspecific dependency host is used depending on the information provided\r\nin an entry-points `package.json` file. If there's not enough\r\ninformation in the `package.json` file for ngcc to be able to determine\r\nwhich dependency host to use, ngcc would fail with an error.\r\n\r\nIf, however, the entry-point is not compiled by Angular, it is not\r\nnecessary to process any of its dependencies.

I'd like to have a way to tell Angular to just don't instantiate any component/directive when a particular required dependency is not available. This can help implementing components/directives that are instantiated based on the presence of another ancestor component/directive. As an example, think about a directive activated by `[role=\"grid\"]` that transforms a static table into a navigable [grid](https://www.w3.org/TR/wai-aria-practices/#grid). Inside the grid, directives bound to `tr`, `td`, `th`, would be activated by the required dependency without the need of additional attributes/classes on those elements. Other `tr`, `td`, `th` tags inside tables not marked by `[role=\"grid\"]` would stay unaffected.\r\n\r\n### Describe the solution you'd like\r\nThe solution I propose is to have a `Required` decorator that represents the default injector behavior plus an option to fail silently:\r\n```typescript\r\n@Directive({ selector: '[my-dir]' })\r\nexport class MyDirective {\r\n  constructor(@Required({ fatal: false }) private myNonFatalDep: MyDep) { }\r\n}\r\n```\r\nOf course the `fatal` option will have a default value of `true` when not specified. Also, combining this decorator with `Optional` should raise an error.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Describe alternatives you've considered\r\nI couldn't find any.

In one particular component, the component is using require.ensure(...) to import JS scripts needed for the component.\r\n\r\nExample:\r\n\r\n```\r\nrequire.ensure([], require => {\r\n\tconst TweenLite = require('../../../../../assets/external-js/TweenLite.min');\r\n\tlet confettiCannon = require('../../../../../assets/external-js/confetti');\r\n\tthis.confettiCannon = confettiCannon = new confettiCannon.ConfettiCannon();\r\n\tconfettiCannon.start();\r\n});\r\n```\r\n\r\nTweenLite.min.js is a GSAP plugin used for simple transitions. confetti.js is a custom script that loads a canvas animation. When confettiCannon.start() is run eventually it will try to use the TweenLite plugin - which is resulting in an error because TweenLite is `undefined`.\r\n\r\nWith my previous Angular application this code works fine, and since when running the confetti.js TweenLite is listed as undefined my hunch was that the plugin is not being attached to the window.\r\n\r\nBelow is a sample of the differences between the code that is returned by Webpack from my two applications:\r\n\r\n_Working Application (custom webpack config)_\r\n\r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/36479149/63606218-d2f9d000-c5cf-11e9-954f-f68349402feb.png)\r\n\r\n_Failing Application (using Angular CLI)_\r\n\r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/36479149/63606251-ead15400-c5cf-11e9-8716-5cf39cd59cb9.png)\r\n\r\nThe difference between the two scripts is that the working sample wraps the imported script with a `function(global) { ... }`. I'm guessing that with this Webpack is able to attach the script globally.\r\n\r\nSo my question is, is it possible to dynamically import a JS file and somehow make it available globally?\r\n\r\nI don't know if there's any CLI configuration or Webpack loader that could help with this scenario.\r\n\r\n## 🌍 Your Environment\r\n<pre><code>\r\n<!-- run `ng version` and paste output below

This can happen when transitioning from the server to the client.\r\nfor (let i = 0; i < previousContainers.length; i++) {\r\n  previousContainers[i].parentNode!.removeChild(previousContainers[i]);\r\n}\r\n```\r\nI hope I find the time to reproduce this issue in stackblitz in the near future, but the issue is quite easy to mentally comprehend: \r\n\r\nImagine two compoennts compA and compB, and each of them have separate OverlayContainer instances injected to them.\r\n\r\nNow CompA attaches a portal to its OverlayContainer. No container element has been created for his OverlayContainer instance yet, so the _createContainer() method is being called. All \"previous\" containers are being cleared (which isn't a problem yet) and a new one is created. The overlay is being displayed correctly.\r\n\r\nNow CompB attaches a portal to its component overlay. No Container Element has been created for his OverlayContainer instance yet, so the _createContainer() method is being called. All \"previous\" containers are being cleared, **including the container element of the OverlayContainer of compA**. The overlay of comB is being display correctly.\r\n\r\nNow CompA tries to attach another portal to its OverlayContainer. His OverlayContainer still references the container element it has created before even though this element has been removed from the DOM by this point.\r\n\r\n`\r\nif (!this._containerElement) {\r\n      this._createContainer();\r\n }\r\n`\r\n\r\n**So, NO new container element is being created.. However, this container element has been detached from the DOM earlier by the OverlayContainer from compB. So now we can attach whatever we want to this container, they won't be displayed in the DOM.** \r\n\r\nTo fix this issue, three solutions should be examined:\r\n\r\n1. If it's true that there always should only be ONE container element, independent of the OverlayContainer instance, then the getContainerElement() method should not check, whether or not a reference exists in the particular instance, but instead perform a dom query, as it's done currently done, when existing container elements are removed\r\n2. If it's true that there should only be ONE container element per OverlayContainer instance, than these containers should have some sort of ID attached to them, so we only remove the containers refering to this instance\r\n3. The proposed fix targets a situation caused by server-side-rendering using angular universal. Maybe there is a different solution to address this issue.\r\n\r\n\r\n#### Reproduction\r\nI hope I can build a stackblitz for this issue soon.

Furthermore, since we are not intending to use what is provided by Angular Material out of the box in terms of CSS styling, it's better that we might as well not include it all.\r\n\r\nFurthermore, in terms of the form field component, you guys are not using any form of ```ViewEncapsulation``` at all, so apart from loading order of the CSS files, it doesn't make much of a difference to a global stylesheet, so I feel this request is not unreasonable.\r\n\r\nI feel the people in my team are experienced enough in CSS that I feel we can take responsibility for our own actions of what happens there.\r\n\r\nSo basically we want to use your JS functionality but give us the option not to use your CSS and allow us the freedom and responsibility to maintain the look and feel ourselves. :)\r\n\r\n#### Which versions of Angular, Material, OS, TypeScript, browsers are affected?\r\nI'm going to make the assumption of all versions of Angular Material that can be consumed in Angular 2 onwards since this is a conscious code structure decision made by the Angular Material team.
