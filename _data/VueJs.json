Often, I found it is annoying when I \"time-traveled\", there is a side-effect being performed due to the component life cycle or routing middleware try to do their \"regular\" task... this resulted in a polluted mutation records... Consider the fact that some component can be delayed rendered by `v-if=state` (so components may be mounted/unmounted during time-traveling), the same may also happen if the one uses `@vue/vuex-router-sync`, this feature is good to have.\r\n\r\n### What does the proposed API look like?\r\nWhen we click \"time travel to the state\" in the dev tool, Vuex internally have a mechanism to silent and ignore any dispatch or commit to be performed (or prevent state to be mutated during time-traveling).  This locking mechanism can be unlocked if we decide to either **revert** or **traverse** to the latest state (they are basically the same).  While I have little clue how we are going to implement this or should we have this, after discussed with my colleagues, I think it would be beneficial to open this discussion.\r\n\r\n** the reason I post this here is due to the fact that the devTool have to touch the vuex core if we want to have this.\r\n\r\n<!-- generated by vue-issues.

It will cause bug easily.\r\nAnd there are duplicated namespace called `\"todos\"`. It will inhibit maintainabillity.\r\n\r\n### What does the proposed API look like?\r\nThe way to introduce it is not to suggest a new API, but to use the existing API properly.\r\nWe can use `createNamespacedHelpers` API with constants in store directory!\r\n\r\n### Example\r\n\r\n_@/store/todos/types.js_\r\n\r\n```js\r\nexport const NAMESPACE = \"todos\";\r\n```\r\n\r\n_@/store/todos/index.js_\r\n\r\n```js\r\nimport { createNamespacedHelpers } from\"vuex\";\r\nimport { NAMESPACE } from \"./types\";\r\n\r\n// Key point !\r\nconst { mapState, mapGetters, mapActions } = createNamespacedHelpers(NAMESPACE);\r\n\r\nexport { mapState, mapGetters, mapActions };\r\n\r\nexport default { /* namespaced, state, getters, mutations, actions */ }\r\n```\r\n\r\n_@/store/todos/getters.js_\r\n\r\n```js\r\n// Key point !\r\nexport const DONE_ITEMS = \"DONE_ITEMS\";\r\nexport const ACTIVE_ITEMS = \"ACTIVE_ITEMS\";\r\n\r\nexport default {\r\n  [DONE_ITEMS]: state => state.items.filter(todo => todo.isDone),\r\n  [ACTIVE_ITEMS]: state => state.items.filter(todo => !todo.isDone)\r\n};\r\n```\r\n\r\nIf we do this, we can use customized binding helpers.\r\n\r\n_my-component.vue_ (TO-BE version)\r\n\r\n```js\r\nimport * as todos from '@/store/todos'; // Key point !\r\nimport * as getters from '@/store/todos/getters'; // Key point !\r\n\r\nexport default {\r\n  computed: {\r\n    ...todos.mapState({\r\n      allItems: ({ items }) => items,\r\n    }),\r\n    ...todos.mapGetters([\r\n      getters.DONE_ITEMS,\r\n      getters.ACTIVE_ITEMS,\r\n    ])\r\n  },\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nHow about this?

Much like in a database, if you add an object to an array in the store, you want to get it's id so that you can reference it again. When looking up how to do this, I found that you cannot, and I also found that someone else had the exact same inquiry on stackoverflow: https://stackoverflow.com/questions/42404925/return-value-from-vuex-mutation-id-for-newly-created-object#42406872\r\nThe response to the question on stack overflow was to use vuex actions, but I don't think that one should have to use an asynchronous action to achieve a synchronous task.\r\nTo carry on with the database example, one might use postgresql's \"RETURNING\" as an analogy.
