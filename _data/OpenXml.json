However, our filtering software identifies the resulting file as corrupt (Word 2016 opens the file just fine though, so it is probably within spec).\r\n\r\nWhen I examine the contents of the .docx file, I notice that the [Content_Types].xml file at the root   still contains the following line:\r\n<Default ContentType=\"application/vnd.ms-office.vbaProject\" Extension=\"bin\"/>\r\n\r\nThe VbaProjectPart PartName reference is gone and no other content in the .docx file structure contains any macro components.  I think that one line in [Content_Types].xml is enough to trip up our scanner.\r\n\r\nIs there some other way to get rid of this line that I'm missing, is this a bug, or is this structure just something that our scanning software should accept?\r\n\r\n**Information**\r\n\r\n- .NET Target: .NET Core 2.1.12\r\n- DocumentFormat.OpenXml Version: 2.10.0-beta0002\r\n\r\n**Repro**\r\n\r\n            bool fileChanged = false;\r\n\r\n            using (WordprocessingDocument document = WordprocessingDocument.Open(sourcePath, true))\r\n            {\r\n                // Access the main document part.\r\n                var docPart = document.MainDocumentPart;\r\n\r\n                // Look for the vbaProject part.
