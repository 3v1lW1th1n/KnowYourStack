Currently because it is causing issues I have disabled it. While I was searching on how to implement service workers in angular, I found an article which says that to implement service worker I need to have the latest version of Angular Cli.

Any suggestions or articles would be of great help.

Knowing what package.json file is causing the issue is vital to fixing the problem (deleting the `node_modules` doesn't work when the libraries are conflicting like this).\r\n\r\nI temporarily changed the function:\r\n```\r\n    function hasBeenProcessed(packageJson, format, entryPointPath) {\r\n        if (!packageJson.__processed_by_ivy_ngcc__) {\r\n            return false;\r\n        }\r\n        if (Object.keys(packageJson.__processed_by_ivy_ngcc__)\r\n            .some(function (property) { return packageJson.__processed_by_ivy_ngcc__[property] !== exports.NGCC_VERSION; })) {\r\n            var nodeModulesFolderPath = entryPointPath;\r\n            while (!file_system_1.isRoot(nodeModulesFolderPath) && file_system_1.basename(nodeModulesFolderPath) !== 'node_modules') {\r\n                nodeModulesFolderPath = file_system_1.dirname(nodeModulesFolderPath);\r\n            }\r\n            console.log(packageJson);\r\n            throw new Error(\"The ngcc compiler has changed since the last ngcc build.\\n\" +\r\n                (\"Please remove \\\"\" + (file_system_1.isRoot(nodeModulesFolderPath) ? entryPointPath : nodeModulesFolderPath) + \"\\\" and try again.\"));\r\n        }\r\n        return packageJson.__processed_by_ivy_ngcc__[format] === exports.NGCC_VERSION;\r\n    }\r\n```\r\nI added the `console.log(packageJson);` and it was really helpful to track down what library had the wrong ngcc output.\r\n\r\nPerhaps change this to log the failing `packageJson` when the log level is set to debug?\r\n\r\nThanks!\r\n\r\n\r\n### Command (mark with an `x`)\r\n<!-- Can you pin-point the command or commands that are relevant for this feature request? -->\r\n<!-- ‚úçÔ∏èedit: -->\r\n```\r\n- [ ] new\r\n- [x] build\r\n- [x] ngcc\r\n- [ ] serve\r\n- [ ] test\r\n- [ ] e2e\r\n- [ ] generate\r\n- [ ] add\r\n- [ ] update\r\n- [ ] lint\r\n- [ ] xi18n\r\n- [ ] run\r\n- [ ] config\r\n- [ ] help\r\n- [ ] version\r\n- [ ] doc\r\n```\r\n\r\n","Url":"https://github.com/angular/angular-cli/issues/16483","RelatedDescription":"Open issue \"Improve error `The ngcc compiler has changed since the last ngcc build`\" (#16483)"},{"Id":"540953761","IsPullRequest":false,"CreatedAt":"2019-12-20T14:53:23","Actor":"rienheuver","Number":"16482","RawContent":null,"Title":"Outdir in tsconfig is ignored when using nx.dev","State":"closed","Body":"# üêû Bug report\r\n\r\n### Command (mark with an `x`)\r\n<!-- Can you pin-point the command or commands that are effected by this bug? -->\r\n<!-- ‚úçÔ∏èedit: -->\r\n\r\n- [ ] new\r\n- [x] build\r\n- [ ] serve\r\n- [ ] test\r\n- [ ] e2e\r\n- [ ] generate\r\n- [ ] add\r\n- [ ] update\r\n- [ ] lint\r\n- [ ] xi18n\r\n- [ ] run\r\n- [ ] config\r\n- [ ] help\r\n- [ ] version\r\n- [ ] doc\r\n\r\n\r\n### Description\r\n\r\nI'm building a monorepo using nrwl (nx.dev) and am using an outDir in my tsconfig.json, this seems however to be ignored.

([3339d46](https://togithub.com/bazelbuild/rules_nodejs/commit/3339d46)), closes [#&#8203;1068](https://togithub.com/bazelbuild/rules_nodejs/issues/1068)\n\n##### Code Refactoring\n\n-   pkg_npm attributes renames packages=>nested_packages & replacements=>substitutions ([7e1b7df](https://togithub.com/bazelbuild/rules_nodejs/commit/7e1b7df))\n-   remove `bootstrap` attribute & fix $(location) expansions in nodejs_binary templated_args ([1860a6a](https://togithub.com/bazelbuild/rules_nodejs/commit/1860a6a))\n-   remove templated_args_file from nodejs_binary & nodejs_test ([799acb4](https://togithub.com/bazelbuild/rules_nodejs/commit/799acb4))\n-   **builtin:** add `args` to yarn_install & npm_install

([6d731cf](https://togithub.com/bazelbuild/rules_nodejs/commit/6d731cf))\n-   **builtin:** renamed npm_package to pkg_npm to match naming convention ([7df4109](https://togithub.com/bazelbuild/rules_nodejs/commit/7df4109))\n-   pre-1.0 release breaking changes ([cc64818](https://togithub.com/bazelbuild/rules_nodejs/commit/cc64818))\n-   remove unused exclude_packages from npm_install & yarn_install ([f50dea3](https://togithub.com/bazelbuild/rules_nodejs/commit/f50dea3))\n\n##### Features\n\n-   **builtin:** introduce copy_to_bin rule ([#&#8203;1450](https://togithub.com/bazelbuild/rules_nodejs/issues/1450)) ([f19245b](https://togithub.com/bazelbuild/rules_nodejs/commit/f19245b))\n\n##### Performance Improvements\n\n-   avoid unnecessary nested depset() ([#&#8203;1435](https://togithub.com/bazelbuild/rules_nodejs/issues/1435)) ([f386322](https://togithub.com/bazelbuild/rules_nodejs/commit/f386322))\n\n##### BREAKING CHANGES\n\n-   `templated_args_file` removed from nodejs_binary, nodejs_test & jasmine_node_test. This was a separation of concerns and complicated node.bzl more than necessary while also being rigid in how the params file is formatted. It is more flexible to expose this functionality as another simple rule named params_file.\n\nTo match standard $(location) and $(locations) expansion, params_file args location expansions are also in the standard short_path form (this differs from the old templated_args behavior which was not Bazel idiomatic)\nUsage example:\n\n    load(\"@&#8203;build_bazel_rules_nodejs//:index.bzl\", \"params_file\", \"nodejs_binary\")\n\n    params_file(\n        name = \"params_file\",\n        args = [\n            \"--some_param\",\n            \"$(location //path/to/some:file)\",\n            \"--some_other_param\",\n            \"$(location //path/to/some/other:file)\",\n        ],\n        data = [\n            \"//path/to/some:file\",\n            \"//path/to/some/other:file\",\n        ],\n    )\n\n    nodejs_binary(\n        name = \"my_binary\",\n        data = [\":params_file\"],\n        entry_point = \":my_binary.js\",\n        templated_args = [\"$(location :params_file)\"],\n    )\n\n-   bootstrap attribute in nodejs_binary, nodejs_test & jasmine_node_test removed\n\nThis can be replaced with the `--node_options=--require=$(location label)` argument such as,\n\n    nodejs_test(\n    name = \"bootstrap_test\",\n    templated_args = [\"--node_options=--require=$(rlocation $(location :bootstrap.js))\"],\n    entry_point = \":bootstrap.spec.js\",\n    data = [\"bootstrap.js\"],\n    )\n\nor\n\n    jasmine_node_test(\n    name = \"bootstrap_test\",\n    srcs = [\"bootstrap.spec.js\"],\n    templated_args = [\"--node_options=--require=$(rlocation $(location :bootstrap.js))\"],\n    data = [\"bootstrap.js\"],\n    )\n\n`templated_args` `$(location)` and `$(locations)` are now correctly expanded when there is no space before `$(location`\nsuch as `templated_args = [\"--node_options=--require=$(rlocation $(location :bootstrap.js))\"]`.\n\nPath is returned in runfiles manifest path format such as `repo/path/to/file`. This differs from how $(location)\nand $(locations) expansion behaves in expansion the `args` attribute of a _\\_binary or _\\_test which returns\nthe runfiles short path of the format `./path/to/file` for user repo and `../external_repo/path/to/file` for external\nrepositories. We may change this behavior in the future with $(mlocation) and $(mlocations) used to expand\nto the runfiles manifest path.\nSee <https://docs.bazel.build/versions/master/be/common-definitions.html#common-attributes-binaries>.\n\n-   -   pkg_npm attribute packages renamed to nested_packages\n-   pkg_npm attribute replacements renamed to substitutions\n-   **builtin:** legacy [@&#8203;build](https://togithub.com/build)\\_bazel_rules_nodejs//internal/jasmine_node_test removed; use jasmine_node_test from [@&#8203;bazel/jasmine](https://togithub.com/bazel/jasmine) npm package instead\n-   **builtin:** `args` in yarn_install and npm_install can be used to pass arbitrary arguments so we removed the following attributes:\n-   prod_only from yarn_install and npm_install; should be replaced by args = [\"--prod\"] and args = [\"--production\"] respectively\n-   frozen_lockfile from yarn_install; should be replaced by args = [\"--frozen-lockfile\"]\n-   network_timeout from yanr_install; should be replaced by args = [\"--network_timeout\", \"<time in ms>\"]\n-   **builtin:** `npm_package` renamed to `pkg_npm`. This is to match the naming convention for package rules <https://docs.bazel.build/versions/master/be/pkg.html>.\n-   Users must now switch to loading from index.bzl\n-   Removed unused exclude_packages from npm_install & yarn_install\n-   //:declaration_provider.bzl deleted; load from //:providers.bzl instead\n    //internal/common:npm_pacakge_info.bzl removed; load from //:providers.bzl instead\n    transitive_js_ecma_script_module_info macro removed; use js_ecma_script_module_info instead\n    [@&#8203;npm](https://togithub.com/npm)\\_bazel_karma//:browser_repositories.bzl removed; use [@&#8203;io](https://togithub.com/io)\\_bazel_rules_webtesting//web/versioned:browsers-0.3.2.bzl instead\n    [@&#8203;npm](https://togithub.com/npm)\\_bazel_protractor//:browser_repositories.bzl removed; use [@&#8203;io](https://togithub.com/io)\\_bazel_rules_webtesting//web/versioned:browsers-0.3.2.bzl instead\n    ts_web_test & ts_web_test_suite marcos removed; use karma_web_test & karma_web_test_suite instead\n\n#### [0.42.3](https://togithub.com/bazelbuild/rules_nodejs/compare/0.42.2...0.42.3) (2019-12-10)\n\nTo upgrade:\n\n```python\nhttp_archive(\n    name = \"build_bazel_rules_nodejs\",\n    sha256 = \"a54b2511d6dae42c1f7cdaeb08144ee2808193a088004fc3b464a04583d5aa2e\",\n    urls = [\"https://github.com/bazelbuild/rules_nodejs/releases/download/0.42.3/rules_nodejs-0.42.3.tar.gz\"],\n)\n```\n\nand run `yarn upgrade --scope @&#8203;bazel` to update all your `@bazel`-scoped npm packages to the latest versions.\n(or manually do the npm equivalent - they don't have a way to update a scope)\n\n##### Bug Fixes\n\n-   **builtin:** handle scoped packages in generated npm_umd_bundle targets ([#&#8203;1425](https://togithub.com/bazelbuild/rules_nodejs/issues/1425)) ([e9e2e8e](https://togithub.com/bazelbuild/rules_nodejs/commit/e9e2e8e)), closes [#&#8203;1095](https://togithub.com/bazelbuild/rules_nodejs/issues/1095)\n-   **builtin:** only stamp artifacts when --stamp is passed to bazel ([#&#8203;1441](https://togithub.com/bazelbuild/rules_nodejs/issues/1441)) ([cbaab60](https://togithub.com/bazelbuild/rules_nodejs/commit/cbaab60))\n-   **docs** default values are now documented for rule attributes\n\n##### Features\n\n-   **builtin:** wire linker/node-patches to npm-generated index.bzl rules ([3321ed5](https://togithub.com/bazelbuild/rules_nodejs/commit/3321ed5)), closes [#&#8203;1382](https://togithub.com/bazelbuild/rules_nodejs/issues/1382)\n\n#### [0.42.2](https://togithub.com/bazelbuild/rules_nodejs/compare/0.42.1...0.42.2) (2019-12-04)\n\n##### Bug Fixes\n\n-   **builtin:** additional_root_paths in pkg_web should also include paths in genfiles and bin dirs ([#&#8203;1402](https://togithub.com/bazelbuild/rules_nodejs/issues/1402)) ([9ce8c85](https://togithub.com/bazelbuild/rules_nodejs/commit/9ce8c85))\n-   **typescript:** fix for cross platform ts_devserver issue [#&#8203;1409](https://togithub.com/bazelbuild/rules_nodejs/issues/1409) ([#&#8203;1413](https://togithub.com/bazelbuild/rules_nodejs/issues/1413)) ([172caff](https://togithub.com/bazelbuild/rules_nodejs/commit/172caff)), closes [#&#8203;1415](https://togithub.com/bazelbuild/rules_nodejs/issues/1415)\n-   support realpath.native and fix crash in mkdirp ([b9282b9](https://togithub.com/bazelbuild/rules_nodejs/commit/b9282b9))\n\n#### [0.42.1](https://togithub.com/bazelbuild/rules_nodejs/compare/0.41.0...0.42.1) (2019-11-27)\n\nTo upgrade:\n\n```python\nhttp_archive(\n    name = \"build_bazel_rules_nodejs\",\n    sha256 = \"c612d6b76eaa17540e8b8c806e02701ed38891460f9ba3303f4424615437887a\",\n    urls = [\"https://github.com/bazelbuild/rules_nodejs/releases/download/0.42.1/rules_nodejs-0.42.1.tar.gz\"],\n)\n```\n\nand run `yarn upgrade --scope @&#8203;bazel` to update all your `@bazel`-scoped npm packages to the latest versions.\n(or manually do the npm equivalent - they don't have a way to update a scope)\n\n##### New stuff\n\nIn 0.41.0 we noted that a feature for inserting `<script>` and `<link>` tags was dropped from `ts_devserver` and `pkg_web` but the replacement wasn't available.

An example is creating a dialog. I see that angular material has [schematics](https://material.angular.io/guide/schematics). It would be nice if there was something for a dialog:\r\n`ng generate @angular/material:dialog <component-name>`\r\n\r\nThis would generate a component like so:\r\n\r\n```\r\nimport { Component, Inject, OnInit } from '@angular/core';\r\nimport { MAT_DIALOG_DATA, MatDialogRef } from '@angular/material';\r\n\r\n@Component({\r\n  selector: 'app-aggregate-dialog',\r\n  templateUrl: './aggregate-dialog.component.html',\r\n  styleUrls: ['./aggregate-dialog.component.scss']\r\n})\r\nexport class AggregateDialogComponent implements OnInit {\r\n  private _dialogRef: MatDialogRef<AggregateDialogComponent>;\r\n  constructor(dialogRef: MatDialogRef<AggregateDialogComponent>, @Inject(MAT_DIALOG_DATA) data: any) {\r\n    this._dialogRef = dialogRef;\r\n  }\r\n\r\n  ngOnInit() {\r\n  }\r\n\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nThis would also mean the dialog component would be added to the `entryComponents` in the module.\r\n\r\n#### Use Case\r\n\r\nDescribe the use case(s) that the proposed feature would enable.\r\nFor dialog-heavy applications, setting up dialogs require quite a few steps. It would be nice if this was a little more streamlined. Given that (I believe) if you want to use an Angular Material dialog, it _requires_ it's own component I think it would be useful for the proper (or common) references to be added when generated. It sounds like the `entryComponents` step won't be needed in `v9`, so that is nice.\r\n","Url":"https://github.com/angular/components/issues/17994","RelatedDescription":"Open issue \"Schematic for Angular Material Dialog\" (#17994)"}],"ResultType":"GitHubIssue"}},"RunOn":"2019-12-21T05:30:05.6848484Z","RunDurationInMilliseconds":3397}
