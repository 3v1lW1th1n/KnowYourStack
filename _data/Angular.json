Commonly we are importing @angular/localize/init into the polyfills.ts, but with libraries, I have very quickly identified some confusing situations:\r\n\r\n- should each library be importing `@angular/localize/init` as well since otherwise it fails building?\r\n- should each library import it to `test.ts` file as well - tests fail to execute if the import is not there?\r\n- if some library imports `@angular/localize/init` all its dependents will successfully build. Therefore, if this library removes the import its dependants will start failing.\r\n\r\nIn my opinion the last one is the most confusing.\r\n\r\n## üî¨ Minimal Reproduction\r\n\r\n## üî• Exception or Error\r\n\r\n\r\n## üåç  Your Environment\r\n\r\n**Angular Version:**\r\n<pre><code>\r\nAngular CLI: 9.0.0-rc.9\r\nNode: 12.13.1\r\nOS: darwin x64\r\n\r\nAngular: 9.0.0-rc.9\r\n... animations, cli, common, compiler, compiler-cli, core\r\n... elements, forms, language-service, localize\r\n... platform-browser, platform-browser-dynamic, router\r\n... service-worker\r\nIvy Workspace: Yes\r\n\r\nPackage                            Version\r\n------------------------------------------------------------\r\n@angular-devkit/architect          0.900.0-rc.9\r\n@angular-devkit/build-angular      0.900.0-rc.9\r\n@angular-devkit/build-ng-packagr   0.900.0-rc.9\r\n@angular-devkit/build-optimizer    0.900.0-rc.9\r\n@angular-devkit/build-webpack      0.900.0-rc.9\r\n@angular-devkit/core               9.0.0-rc.9\r\n@angular-devkit/schematics         9.0.0-rc.10\r\n@angular/cdk                       9.0.0-rc.8\r\n@angular/flex-layout               8.0.0-beta.27\r\n@angular/material                  9.0.0-rc.8\r\n@angular/pwa                       0.900.0-rc.10\r\n@ngtools/webpack                   9.0.0-rc.9\r\n@schematics/angular                9.0.0-rc.10\r\n@schematics/update                 0.900.0-rc.9\r\nng-packagr                         9.0.0-rc.7\r\nrxjs                               6.5.4\r\ntypescript                         3.6.4\r\n\r\n</code></pre>","Url":"https://github.com/angular/angular/issues/34920","RelatedDescription":"Open issue \"Usage of @angular/localize in Angular Libraries\" (#34920)"},{"Id":"553949638","IsPullRequest":false,"CreatedAt":"2020-01-23T05:41:55","Actor":"abhinav-goyall","Number":"34918","RawContent":null,"Title":"Issue with Scroll in angular.io","State":"open","Body":"# üìö Docs or angular.io bug report\r\nWhen i am going through docs , i came across that when i scroll down to the last , summary never gets highlighted as other items do in the right panel and that;s because scroll is coming before the content of the page is over.

Namely, this:\r\n\r\n> Now, you can click on the Admin button, which takes you to the Login page with the provided queryParamMap and fragment. After you click the login button, notice that you have been redirected to the Admin Dashboard page with the query parameters and fragment still intact in the address bar.\r\n\r\nThe query parameter and the fragment both get lost when you are forwarded to the \"admin\" page by the login button. You can see that the \"Admin\" page displays `Null` both for `Session ID` and for `Token`, as they are also absent in the address bar. \r\n\r\nThe cause seems to be the `navigateByUrl()` call in `auth/login/login.component.ts` at line 40. This is what the official doc says for this function referring to its `extras` parameter:\r\n\r\n>  NavigationExtras | An object containing properties that modify the navigation strategy. The function ignores any properties in the¬†NavigationExtras¬†that would change the provided URL.\r\n\r\nSo if you replace line 40 \r\n```\r\nthis.router.navigateByUrl(redirect, navigationExtras);\r\n```\r\nwith\r\n```\r\nthis.router.navigate([this.authService.redirectUrl], navigationExtras);\r\n```\r\nthe app behaviour is then consistent with the expected description in the angular write-up. While `navigate()` is normally doing a relative navigation, in the absence of a \"start\" (`relativeTo`) position it will do the absolute navigation, but without the adverse effect of `navigateByUrl()`. Maybe not the most optimal solution though\r\n\r\nBut notice that if this solution is adopted, the `UrlTree` `redirect` variable is then not necessary\r\n\r\nAlso the Angular Doc write‚Äìup has to be updated as well to whatever solution is adopted\r\n\r\n## üî¨ Minimal Reproduction\r\n\r\n### What's the affected URL?**\r\n\r\nhttps://angular.io/generated/live-examples/router/stackblitz.html\r\n\r\nand the documentation at\r\n\r\nhttps://angular.io/guide/router#query-parameters-and-fragments\r\n\r\n### Reproduction Steps**\r\nNavigate to https://angular.io/generated/live-examples/router/stackblitz.html, then to `Admin` tab and click the `Login` button. You will see both `Session ID` and `Token` being `None`\r\n\r\n### Expected vs Actual Behavior**\r\n`Session ID` should be `123456789`, and `Token` should be `anchor`, and not `None`\r\n\r\nOtherwise how are they persistent?\r\n\r\n\r\n## üì∑Screenshot\r\n<!-- Often a screenshot can help to capture the issue better than a long description. -->\r\n<!-- ‚úçÔ∏èupload a screenshot:-->\r\n\r\n\r\n## üî• Exception or Error\r\n<pre><code>\r\n<!-- If the issue is accompanied by an exception or an error, please share it below: -->\r\n<!-- ‚úçÔ∏è-->\r\n\r\n</code></pre>\r\n\r\n\r\n## üåç  Your Environment\r\n\r\n### Browser info\r\n<!-- ‚úçÔ∏èIs this a browser specific issue?

Migrating the entire code base to Angular is not technically viable at this point in time. As a solution I have dual bootstrap the AngularJS application with the Angular ngUpgrade module so the application can be migrated over time. \r\n\r\nAt this initial stage of the project I am using the existing webpack.config to build the app. My webpack.config handles the transpilation of the Typescript and Angular by way of the ts-loader. Everything compiles and loads and I can proceed with Angular while maintaining existing AngularJS code.\r\n\r\nAt present I do not get the full benefit of the Angular CLI, but will in future as more legacy code is migrated and the CLI is used to it's full capability. At present thou it should be possible for me to use the lint and test commands against all new Angular code even thou it isn't being built or served by the Angular CLI.\r\n\r\n#### The actual feature request\r\n\r\nThe issue comes into play when I attempt to use `ng test` to test new Angular components. `ng test`, or more specifically the angular-devkit/build-angular:karma plugin. Out of the box it doesn't support native ES6 imports for html files within Angular components. Running `ng test` on files written like:\r\n\r\n```\r\nimport {Component} from '@angular/core';\r\n\r\nimport template from './my-component.component.html';\r\n\r\n@Component({\r\n    selector: 'my-component',\r\n    template\r\n})\r\npublic class MyComponent {\r\n```\r\n\r\nresults in:\r\n\r\n```\r\nERROR in ./src/app/my-component/my-component.component.html 1:0\r\nModule parse failed: Unexpected token (1:0)\r\nYou may need an appropriate loader to handle this file type, currently no loaders are configured to process this file. See https://webpack.js.org/concepts#loaders\r\n```\r\n\r\nI cannot use the Angular CLI to build at this time, so using templateUrl is out as it results distribution  making requests to the server for the templates. I assume this is because I don't have a full AOT configuration provided natively by the Angular CLI.\r\n\r\n### Describe the solution you'd like\r\n\r\nI would like the `\\.html$` files to be handled by the webpack config generated by @angular-devkit/build-angular/plugins/karma`. This can be achieved simply by adding (or something similar):\r\n\r\n```\r\nwebpackConfig.module.rules.push({\r\n    test: /\\.html$/,\r\n    use: [{loader: 'raw-loader'}]\r\n});\r\n```\r\n\r\nI was thinking `raw-loader` only because you already have it as a dependency; otherwise `html-loader` would also work with the additional configuration option for `caseSensitive: true`. It's a little insane that the plugin supports imports of every other typical file type but not html:\r\n\r\n```\r\n[\r\n  {\r\n    test: /\\.(eot|svg|cur|jpg|png|webp|gif|otf|ttf|woff|woff2|ani)$/,\r\n    loader: 'file-loader',\r\n    options: { name: '[name].[ext]' }\r\n  },\r\n  {\r\n    test: /[\\/\\\\]@angular[\\/\\\\]core[\\/\\\\].+\\.js$/,\r\n    parser: { system: true }\r\n  },\r\n  { test: /[\\/\\\\]hot[\\/\\\\]emitter\\.js$/, parser: { node: [Object] } },\r\n  {\r\n    test: /[\\/\\\\]webpack-dev-server[\\/\\\\]client[\\/\\\\]utils[\\/\\\\]createSocketUrl\\.js$/,\r\n    parser: { node: [Object] }\r\n  },\r\n  { test: /\\.js$/, exclude: /(ngfactory|ngstyle)\\.js$/ },\r\n  {\r\n    test: /\\.js$/,\r\n    exclude: /(ngfactory|ngstyle)\\.js$/,\r\n    enforce: 'pre'\r\n  },\r\n  { exclude: [], test: /\\.css$/, use: [ [Object], [Object] ] },\r\n  {\r\n    exclude: [],\r\n    test: /\\.scss$|\\.sass$/,\r\n    use: [ [Object], [Object], [Object] ]\r\n  },\r\n  {\r\n    exclude: [],\r\n    test: /\\.less$/,\r\n    use: [ [Object], [Object], [Object] ]\r\n  },\r\n  {\r\n    exclude: [],\r\n    test: /\\.styl$/,\r\n    use: [ [Object], [Object], [Object] ]\r\n  },\r\n  {\r\n    test: /\\.tsx?$/,\r\n    loader: '/<omitted>/node_modules/@angular-devkit/build-angular/node_modules/@ngtools/webpack/src/index.js'\r\n  },\r\n  {\r\n    test: /\\.(jsx?|tsx?)$/,\r\n    loader: '/<omitted>/node_modules/coverage-istanbul-loader/lib/index.js',\r\n    options: { esModules: true },\r\n    enforce: 'post',\r\n    exclude: [ /\\.(e2e|spec)\\.ts$/, /node_modules/ ],\r\n    include: '<omitted>'\r\n  }\r\n]\r\n```\r\n\r\nThis shouldn't impact the usage of Angular's template or templateUrls because they aren't native requires or imports; just strings and webpack will ignore them.\r\n\r\n### Describe alternatives you've considered\r\n\r\nI have tried several work arounds including attempting to preprocess the files like in AngularJS and replace templateUrl with the embedded html string. Looked into other angular tooling that will build angular in my existing webpack config; but all these solutions feel dirty.\r\n\r\nMy least offensive workaround for my issue is to publish my own hacked version of the angular-devkit/build-angular library that applies the above mentioned patch so I can process test files in a way I expect until which time I can move to a world strictly with the angular-cli.","Url":"https://github.com/angular/angular-cli/issues/16746","RelatedDescription":"Open issue \"Add support for *.html via the raw-loader to the webpack.config generated by

It shows a pending forever in the network tab and we theorize that this is because it is getting some kind of parsing error.\r\n\r\nWe first tracked it down to the @angular-dev-kit/build-angular and then to this commit (https://github.com/angular/angular-cli/commit/6ffa74acead4798a42f82b4a3001fec26625d738) which upgraded core-js 3.3.6 to 3.6.0 to the build-angular dependencies. Any build after this one (https://github.com/angular/angular-devkit-build-angular-builds/commit/cbd21fa9307631006689f42f2afeb986f5c4f5be) fails to load in IE11 with either a never ending spinner or a long running script error. No other errors ever present themselves in the console.\r\n\r\nFor any build after the one listed above, if you go into the `node_modules/@angular-devkit/build-angular/node_modules` and delete the `core-js` folder, then node will revert to the project `core-js` folder (we can verify it works at 3.1.4, 3.3.6, and 3.5.0) and everything works just fine.\r\n\r\nWe have tested this with the most recent commits/builds and this is still an issue with 3.6.4 of core-js.\r\n\r\n\r\n## üî¨ Minimal Reproduction\r\n<!--\r\nSimple steps to reproduce this bug.\r\n\r\nPlease include: commands run (including args), packages added, related code changes.\r\n\r\nIf reproduction steps are not enough for reproduction of your issue, please create a minimal GitHub repository with the reproduction of the issue. \r\nA good way to make a minimal reproduction is to create a new app via `ng new repro-app` and add the minimum possible code to show the problem. \r\nShare the link to the repo below along with step-by-step instructions to reproduce the problem, as well as expected and actual behavior.\r\n\r\nIssues that don't have enough info and can't be reproduced will be closed.\r\n\r\nYou can read more about issue submission guidelines here: https://github.com/angular/angular-cli/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md#-submitting-an-issue\r\n-->\r\nThis is super hard to reproduce because we are running an AngularJS and Angular hybrid app with over half a million lines of code. We are not sure what in our build process is causing the issue but it is for sure being caused by the upgrade to version 3.6.x of `core-js`.
