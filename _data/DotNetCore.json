Developers are advised to update their .NET Core SDK to versions 1.1.8 or 2.1.101.\r\n\r\n## Discussion\r\n\r\nUse *TBD* for discussion of this advisory.\r\n\r\n### Mitigation Factors\r\nNone\r\n\r\n### Affected Software\r\n\r\nAny application running against .NET Core 1.0.9 or lower versions, 1.1.6 or lower minor versions or 2.0.5 or lower minor versions is affected. \r\n\r\n### Advisory FAQ\r\n#### How do I know if I am affected?\r\nAny application running against .NET Core 1.0.9 or lower versions, 1.1.6 or lower minor versions or 2.0.5 or lower minor versions is affected. \r\n\r\nA complete list of runtimes can be discovered by performing a directory listing in the install root directories. The default root directories are listed in the following table:\r\n\r\n| Operating System | Location |\r\n|------------------|----------|\r\n| Windows\t| `C:\\Program Files\\dotnet\\shared\\Microsoft.NETCore.App\\` |\r\n| macOS\t| `/usr/local/share/dotnet/shared/Microsoft.NETCore.App/` |\r\n| Supported Linux platforms\t| `/usr/share/dotnet/shared/Microsoft.NETCore.App/` |\r\n\r\nEach runtime version is installed in its own directory, where the directory name is the version number. If you don't have a directory for 1.0.10, 1.1.7 and 2.0.6, then any applications targeting the respective major/minor versions, 1.0 or 1.1 or 2.0 of .NET Core are vulnerable.\r\n\r\nAdditionally, if you've deployed self-contained applications targeting any of the impacted versions, these applications are also vulnerable and must be recompiled and redeployed.\r\n\r\n#### How do I fix my affected application?\r\n\r\nApplications can be fixed by installing the latest .NET Core runtimes or SDKs. Typically, application servers only have runtime packages installed and developer machines have the SDKs installed. \r\nInstallers for the runtimes can be downloaded from the [Runtime and SDK download archive](https://github.com/dotnet/core/blob/master/release-notes/download-archive.md). \r\n.NET Core 1.1.8 SDK installs both versions 1.0.10 and 1.1.7 of the .NET Core runtime.\r\n\r\nIf you've built a self-contained application, you must install the new runtime and SDK, recompile your application and redeploy.\r\n\r\n#### What if the update breaks my application?\r\nAn application can be pinned to a previous version of the runtime by editing the `application.runtime.config` file for that application. Set the framework version to the desired version and the `rollForward` property to false. These settings should be treated as a temporary measure and the application updated to work with the patched versions of the framework.\r\n\r\nSince the `application.runtime.config` file is an optional file, you may need to create one for each application and add it alongside the executable.\r\n\r\n### Acknowledgments\r\n[Ben Adams](https://twitter.com/ben_a_adams) of [Illyriad Games](https://www.illyriad.co.uk/)\r\n\r\n### External Links\r\n[CVE-2018-0875](https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2018-0875)\r\n\r\n### Revisions\r\n\r\nV1.0 (Mar 13, 2018): Advisory published.\r\n\r\n_Version 1.0_\r\n_Last Updated 2018-03-13_\r\n"},{"Id":"7301596554","Type":"IssuesEvent","CreatedAt":"2018-02-27T06:10:33","Actor":"mairaw","Repository":"dotnet/announcements","Organization":"dotnet","RawContent":null,"RelatedAction":"opened","RelatedUrl":"https://github.com/dotnet/announcements/issues/61","RelatedDescription":"Opened issue \"New offline books released for Visual Studio 2017\" (#61) at dotnet/announcements","RelatedBody":"# New offline books released for Visual Studio 2017\r\n\r\nEarlier this month, we released an update to Offline Books for the Visual Studio 2017 Help Viewer.\r\n\r\nThis release includes new .NET books, including .NET Core Guide, .NET Guide, .NET Framework Guide and the .NET API Reference.

See the [initial platform intrinsics design](https://github.com/dotnet/designs/blob/master/accepted/platform-intrinsics.md) for more information.\r\n\r\nWe have decided that it makes the most sense for this intrinsics feature to ship in a “preview” status in the .NET Core 2.1 RTM timeframe.  This means that the runtime support we are implementing will be included, but the assembly exposing the intrinsics will only be available to projects via explicit reference to a “preview-only” package.  These APIs won’t be included in the official .NET Core 2.1 packages.\r\n\r\nGiven our limited time and resources, recent changes in the approach we take to expose the intrinsics, and API changes prompted by design feedback from the community, we don’t believe there is enough time to settle these APIs for 2.1. We plan to follow the pattern of other recent features like Span<T> and Memory<T> that first shipped in preview before formally joining the supported API surface.  Not only would we expect the next version of .NET Core to support more intrinsics than could be supported in 2.1, but we expect to have real usage examples in CoreFX and higher level components as well.  These real world examples, as well as feedback from customers who opt in to the preview, should give us the confidence we need to officially support the APIs going forward.\r\n\r\n## Discussion\r\n\r\nPlease share your thoughts on this change and see what others are saying at:\r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/dotnet/corefx/issues/27486\r\n\r\n## Details\r\n\r\nIn the coming days, we plan on removing System.Runtime.Intrinsics.dll from the Microsoft.NETCore.App package.  This means any libraries/applications that are using these APIs will no longer compile by default, and will not run on new builds of .NET Core 2.1.\r\n\r\nAt the same time, we will start producing a new System.Runtime.Intrinsics.Experimental NuGet package.  In order to continue using these APIs on .NET Core 2.1, a project will need to add a reference to this new package.\r\n\r\nAs its name implies, this package is experimental and should only be used for preview purposes.  It isn’t expected to be used in production scenarios.  Future version of .NET Core (after 2.1) will be allowed to break this package. This enables us respond to future feedback that requires the APIs to be modified.\r\n\r\nIn the future, when we are confident we have the intrinsic APIs right, we will stop producing the System.Runtime.Intrinsics.Experimental package. The platform intrinsics APIs will then be added back to Microsoft.NETCore.App and will be officially supported."},{"Id":"7273056222","Type":"IssuesEvent","CreatedAt":"2018-02-21T02:28:03","Actor":"KathleenDollard","Repository":"dotnet/announcements","Organization":"dotnet","RawContent":null,"RelatedAction":"opened","RelatedUrl":"https://github.com/dotnet/announcements/issues/57","RelatedDescription":"Opened issue \"Manually Uninstall .NET Core SDK 2.2.0-Preview Nightly Builds\" (#57) at dotnet/announcements","RelatedBody":"# Manually Uninstall .NET Core SDK 2.2.0-Preview Nightly Builds\r\n\r\n[A change in the version number strategy for .NET Core SDK](https://github.com/dotnet/designs/pull/29) resulted in some nightly builds having a higher version number.

However, some of the libraries (Microsoft.Extensions.DependencyModel) for netstandard uses this call.\r\n\n\n---\n\n@svick commented on [Fri Feb 23 2018](https://github.com/dotnet/core/issues/1281#issuecomment-368089059)\n\nThis is expected. .Net Framework 4.6.1 behaves as if it supported .Net Standard 2.0 and it does support the vast majority of it, but not everything. Specifically, it does not support APIs that were added in .Net Standard 1.5 and 1.6.\r\n\r\nFor more details, see [.NET Framework 4.6.1 supporting .NET Standard 2.0](https://github.com/dotnet/standard/tree/master/docs/netstandard-20#net-framework-461-supporting-net-standard-20).\r\n\r\nAs for your specific case, Microsoft.Extensions.DependencyModel 2.0.4 has versions for .Net Framework 4.5.1, .Net Standard 1.3 and .Net Standard 1.6. How exactly are you distributing your application/library? Maybe there's a way to use the .Net Framework 4.5.1 version of Microsoft.Extensions.DependencyModel from your .Net Framework 4.6.2 host?\n\n---\n\n@nothrow commented on [Thu Mar 01 2018](https://github.com/dotnet/core/issues/1281#issuecomment-369511734)\n\nThanks for the link, I missed this specific document. \r\n\r\n> Considering the number of APIs that .NET Framework 4.6.1 will not support is low and that these are all brand-new APIs with low adoption we believe this is a much better trade-off.\r\n\r\nThis is kind of unfortunate, since the brand new API is used by ASP.NET Core, so eventually anyone wanting to combine netstandard + full framework with web will probably hit the wall here.\r\n\r\nI had troubles with 4.5.1 version, so I ended up with shipping my own forked version of DependencyModel. \r\n\r\nJust a suggestion, there is bunch of #if DOTNETCORE s  in `Microsoft.Extensions.DependencyModel`. Wouldn't it make sense to have libraries with #ifs in `runtime/`, so the correct one will be resolved, based on framework at run-time, not at compile-time?\r\n\r\n\n\n---\n\n@svick commented on [Thu Mar 01 2018](https://github.com/dotnet/core/issues/1281#issuecomment-369566176)\n\n> eventually anyone wanting to combine netstandard + full framework with web will probably hit the wall here\r\n\r\nI don't think so, that's what the .Net Framework 4.5.1 version is for. I think you're in a special situation, where you're distributing a single DLL to multiple frameworks, so that doesn't help. But most people will be fine.\r\n\r\n> Wouldn't it make sense to have libraries with #ifs in `runtime/`, so the correct one will be resolved, based on framework at run-time, not at compile-time?\r\n\r\nI don't know, I'm not sure that would actually work. You might consider creating a new issue about that in the repo where that code lives: [dotnet/core-setup](https://github.com/dotnet/core-setup).\n\n---\n\n@Petermarcu commented on [Wed Mar 14 2018](https://github.com/dotnet/core/issues/1281#issuecomment-373257629)\n\n@terrajobst , sounds like this one is just unfortunately hitting the small set of API's that fell through the cracks.

But if i have the test project also target net471, calls to Microsoft.Win32.Registry from the MEF part fail (Registry.LocalMachine returns null). I assume this is because Microsoft.Win32.Registry has a net461-specific library that isn't present.\r\n\r\nI see this problem doesn't exist if, instead of using MEF, i just directly depend on the part.

issue \"ConcurrentStack  PushRange idea\" (#28450) at dotnet/corefx","RelatedBody":"[ConcurrentStack](https://github.com/dotnet/corefx/blob/master/src/System.Collections.Concurrent/src/System/Collections/Concurrent/ConcurrentStack.cs) has a `PushRange` method that takes in an array/set of items.\r\n```c#\r\npublic void PushRange(T[] items);\r\npublic void PushRange(T[] items, int startIndex, int count);\r\n```\r\n\r\n`PushRange` has a very useful optimization in that it creates a pre-made linked list, then attaches the tale to the current head, which makes it very efficient at adding the entire set **with a single successful CAS**(compare and swap). I think limiting `PushRange` to only arrays may encourage bad usage or force the user to using arrays.\r\n\r\nI was wondering about some other signatures that could help facilitate the bulk adding of items without having to work with arrays or calling 'ToArray' on your favorite set object.\r\n\r\n```c#\r\npublic void PushRange(T[] items);\r\npublic void PushRange(T[] items, int startIndex, int count);\r\n\r\npublic void PushRange(IList<T> items);\r\npublic void PushRange(IList<T> items, int startIndex, int count);\r\n\r\npublic void PushRange(IEnumerable<T> items);\r\n```\r\n\r\nI get this feeling that people are just doing, because it's easy enough\r\n```c#\r\nforeach(var i in items)\r\n\tstack.Push(i);\r\n```\r\nin lieu of a bulk push method for other set types. But this will result in many more CAS operations, increasing contention.\r\n\r\nfyi, T[] implements IList<T>, so you could just redirect `PushRange(T[] items...)` to `PushRange(IList<T> items...)`"},{"Id":"7430160573","Type":"IssuesEvent","CreatedAt":"2018-03-24T21:56:00","Actor":"bcronce","Repository":"dotnet/corefx","Organization":"dotnet","RawContent":null,"RelatedAction":"opened","RelatedUrl":"https://github.com/dotnet/corefx/issues/28449","RelatedDescription":"Opened issue \"ConcurrentBag resize simplification\" (#28449) at dotnet/corefx","RelatedBody":"In the [internal void LocalPush(T item)](https://github.com/dotnet/corefx/blob/master/src/System.Collections.Concurrent/src/System/Collections/Concurrent/ConcurrentBag.cs#L748) method, I think the array growth logic is doing extra work.\r\n\r\n`Else` is preserving order\r\n```c#\r\nint headIdx = head & _mask;\r\nif (headIdx == 0)\r\n{\r\n\tArray.Copy(_array, 0, newArray, 0, _array.Length);\r\n}\r\nelse\r\n{\r\n\tArray.Copy(_array, headIdx, newArray, 0, _array.Length - headIdx);\r\n\tArray.Copy(_array, 0, newArray, _array.Length - headIdx, headIdx);\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nBags do not guarantee order, just do away with the extra order preserving logic.\r\n```c#\r\nvar newArray = new T[_array.Length << 1];\r\nArray.Copy(_array, 0, newArray, 0, _array.Length);\r\n\r\n// Reset the field values\r\n_array = newArray;\r\n_headIndex = 0;\r\n_tailIndex = tail = count;\r\n_mask = (_mask << 1) | 1;\r\n```"},{"Id":"7430109204","Type":"IssuesEvent","CreatedAt":"2018-03-24T21:20:00","Actor":"liserdarts","Repository":"dotnet/corefx","Organization":"dotnet","RawContent":null,"RelatedAction":"opened","RelatedUrl":"https://github.com/dotnet/corefx/issues/28448","RelatedDescription":"Opened issue \"NamedPipeServerStream.EndWaitForConnection throws SocketException on x86/Linux\" (#28448) at dotnet/corefx","RelatedBody":"I've been running the same code one multiple platforms (amd64/Win 10, amd64/Debian 9, arm64/Rasbian, and x86/Debian 9).
