The purpose is to indicate that the channel actually reached the end of the code block successfully, in the way that the code writer thought it would, and thus distinguish between the case where the channel was disposed because we reached the end vs. the channel was disposed for some other reason. (Because, I guess, the alternative, an exception being thrown and interrupting the flow of code, wasn't conspicuous enough of a signal.)\r\n\r\nThat's fine if a little redundant. However, this *does* incur a cost to code. Consider for example this code here:\r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/dotnet/machinelearning/blob/a3b67d393714ebeb873a41af82cd22ea7311e44c/src/Microsoft.ML.Core/Data/IHostEnvironment.cs#L229-L235\r\n\r\nNow, it *could* have been written like this:\r\n\r\n```csharp\r\nusing (var ch = host.Start(channelName))\r\n    return func(ch);\r\n```\r\n\r\nBut we can't, because, of course, we need to make sure we call `ch.Done()`, which means we have to store the return value somewhere else, etc. etc.\r\n\r\nBy itself that isn't that bad, except we use channels literally everywhere. So we see this pattern repeated over, and over, and over again. I've done this so often I even have a standard variable name I personally use to work around this thing, `retval`.\r\n\r\nYet, despite being used everywhere in the codebase, over the years I can count the number of times that check has been useful on exactly zero of my hands. In fact it is so useless that we never actually bothered to consider it an error condition, since there are far more examples of people forgetting to do that than examples where it actually signaled a problem -- refer to the example above, the \"mistake\" is far more obvious than the correct actually implemented pattern -- and again, the alternative, an exception being thrown, was far more obvious anyway. So it just writes an easily ignored warning to the *trace* stream if it's detected (which is a logging layer people by default cannot visibly access anyway).\r\n\r\nMaybe we ought to get rid of it, just rely on the fact that the channel is being disposed (which contrary to this `Done` thing does convey very useful information), and simplify a bunch of code.","Url":"https://github.com/dotnet/machinelearning/issues/803","RelatedDescription":"Open issue \"Make IChannel `.Done` Done\" (#803)"},{"Id":"356185236","IsPullRequest":false,"CreatedAt":"2018-09-01T08:46:09","Actor":"nilay-kothari","Number":"802","RawContent":null,"Title":"InvalidOperationException: numClasses must be at least 2.","State":"open","Body":"### System information\r\n\r\nMl.Net version : 0.4.0\r\n\r\n### Issue\r\n\r\nI have written a multi classification code using ml.net 0.4.0.

As a very common workflow, it makes sense to build a vectorizer that does this internally effectively adding columns to the dataset from a single source date column which can then be Concatenator to the features.\r\n\r\nI was thinking perhaps a vectorizer that takes a flags enum of various types of date transform (e.g. Day, Month, Year, Day of Week, Day of Year, Quarter, ISO Week of Year, etc). Obviously there are many ways to slice a date so maybe ultimately the best option is a builtin user defined formula transform which can solve this but Dates are a very common workflow as lots of real world data is actually time series.\r\n","Url":"https://github.com/dotnet/machinelearning/issues/789","RelatedDescription":"Open issue \"Add Date Transform/Vectorizers\" (#789)"},{"Id":"355693710","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2018-08-31T16:21:44","Actor":"abgoswam","Number":"783","RawContent":null,"Title":"Updates to Unit Test cases for the TensorFlowTransform","State":"closed","Body":"Fixes #779 \r\n\r\n(1) address the additional comments on the original TensorFlowTransform [PR](https://github.com/dotnet/machinelearning/pull/704)\r\n\r\n(2) added an additional unit test to verify invalid shapes are being handled correctly \r\n\r\n\r\n","Url":"https://github.com/dotnet/machinelearning/pull/783","RelatedDescription":"Closed or merged PR \"Updates to Unit Test cases for the TensorFlowTransform\" (#783)"},{"Id":"355800763","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2018-08-31T08:17:56","Actor":"briancylui","Number":"788","RawContent":null,"Title":"Make perf results table of CpuMath hardware intrinsics more informative","State":"closed","Body":"All style changes aimed at making the perf results table look nicer - no functionality changes.
