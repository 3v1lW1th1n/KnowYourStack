Because\r\nof the closure, any narrowing effects of template guards will no longer\r\nbe in effect when checking the event binding, as TypeScript assumes that\r\nthe guard outside of the closure may no longer be true once the closure\r\nis invoked. For more information on TypeScript's Control Flow Analysis,\r\nplease refer to https://github.com/microsoft/TypeScript/issues/9998.\r\n\r\nIn Angular templates, it is known that an event binding can only be\r\nexecuted when the view it occurs in is currently rendered, hence the\r\ncorresponding template guard is known to hold during the invocation of\r\nan event handler closure. As such, it is desirable that any narrowing\r\neffects from template guards are still in effect within the event\r\nhandler closure.\r\n\r\nThis commit tweaks the generated Type-Check Block (TCB) to repeat all\r\ntemplate guards within an event handler closure.

These helpers can be either imported from `tslib` (by setting the `importHelpers` TS compiler option to `true`) or emitted inline (by setting the `importHelpers` and `noEmitHelpers` TS compiler options to `false`, which is the default value for both).\r\n\r\nNgtsc's `StaticInterpreter` (which is also used during ngcc processing) is able to statically evaluate some of these helpers (currently `__assing()`, `__spread()` and `__spreadArrays()`), as long as `ReflectionHost#getDefinitionOfFunction()` correctly detects the declaration of the helper. For this to happen, the left-hand size of the corresponding call expression (i.e. `__spread(...)` or `tslib.__spread(...)`) must be evaluated as a function declaration for `getDefinitionOfFunction()` to be called with.\r\n\r\nIn the case of imported helpers, the `tslib.__someHelper` expression was resolved to a function declaration of the form `export declare function __someHelper(...args: any[][]): any[];`, which allows `getDefinitionOfFunction()` to correctly map it to a TS helper.\r\n\r\nIn contrast, in the case of emitted helpers (and regardless of the module format: `CommonJS`, `ESNext`, `UMD`, etc.)), the `__someHelper` identifier was resolved to a variable declaration of the form `var __someHelper = (this && this.__someHelper) || function () { ... }`, which upon further evaluation was categorized as a `DynamicValue` (prohibiting further evaluation by the `getDefinitionOfFunction()`).\r\n\r\nAs a result of the above, emitted TypeScript helpers were not evaluated in ES5 code.\r\n\r\n---\r\nThis commit changes the detection of TS helpers to leverage the existing `KnownFn` feature (previously only used for built-in functions). `Esm5ReflectionHost`'s is changed to always return `KnownDeclaration`s for TS helpers, both imported (`getExportsOfModule()`) as well as emitted (`getDeclarationOfIdentifier()`).\r\n\r\nThe `KnownDeclaration`s are then mapped to `KnownFn`s in `StaticInterpreter`, allowing it to statically evaluate call expressions involving any kind of TS helpers.","Url":"https://github.com/angular/angular/pull/35191","RelatedDescription":"Open PR \"fix(ngcc): correctly detect emitted TS helpers in ES5\" (#35191)"},{"Id":"561136101","IsPullRequest":false,"CreatedAt":"2020-02-06T16:54:45","Actor":"MuhammadAbdelsalam","Number":"35189","RawContent":null,"Title":"I can't create dynamic FormGroup  manually","State":"closed","Body":"<!--üîÖüîÖüîÖüîÖüîÖüîÖüîÖüîÖüîÖüîÖüîÖüîÖüîÖüîÖüîÖüîÖüîÖüîÖüîÖüîÖüîÖüîÖüîÖüîÖüîÖüîÖüîÖüîÖüîÖüîÖüîÖ\r\n\r\nI can't create dynamic form group manually but when i form builder it's working fine\r\n\r\nüîÖüîÖüîÖüîÖüîÖüîÖüîÖüîÖüîÖüîÖüîÖüîÖüîÖüîÖüîÖüîÖüîÖüîÖüîÖüîÖüîÖüîÖüîÖüîÖüîÖüîÖüîÖüîÖüîÖüîÖüîÖüîÖüîÖ-->\r\n\r\nthis code not work fine at first time page load and fire exception\r\n\r\ncomponent.ts\r\n    this.contactForm = new FormGroup({\r\n      name: new FormControl(),\r\n       phones: new FormArray([new FormGroup({Phone: new FormControl('')})])\r\n         });\r\n\r\ncomponent.html\r\n<div formArrayName=\"phones\">\r\n            <div *ngFor=\"let item of phones.controls; let phoneIndex = index\" [formGroupName]=\"phoneIndex\">\r\n                <label>\r\n                    Phone: <input formControlName=\"phone\" />\r\n                </label>\r\n                <button type=\"button\" (click)=\"deletePhone(phoneIndex)\">Delete Phone</button>\r\n            </div>\r\n            <button type=\"button\" (click)=\"addPhone()\">Add Phone</button>\r\n        </div>\r\n\r\nException :\r\nCannot find control with path: 'phones -> 0 -> phone'\r\n\r\nif I used formbuilder, it will work fine \r\n this.contactForm = this.fb.group({\r\n      name: '',\r\n      address: '',\r\n      note: '',\r\n      phones: this.fb.array([this.fb.group({phone:''})])\r\n    });\r\n\r\nAngular CLI: 8.3.23\r\nNode: 12.14.1\r\nOS: win32 x64","Url":"https://github.com/angular/angular/issues/35189","RelatedDescription":"Closed issue \"I can't create dynamic FormGroup  manually\" (#35189)"},{"Id":"561139070","IsPullRequest":false,"CreatedAt":"2020-02-06T16:49:50","Actor":"MuhammadAbdelsalam","Number":"35190","RawContent":null,"Title":"I can't create dynamic FormGroup manually","State":"open","Body":"<!--üîÖüîÖüîÖüîÖüîÖüîÖüîÖüîÖüîÖüîÖüîÖüîÖüîÖüîÖüîÖüîÖüîÖüîÖüîÖüîÖüîÖüîÖüîÖüîÖüîÖüîÖüîÖüîÖüîÖüîÖüîÖ\r\n\r\nI can't create dynamic form group manually but when i form builder it's working fine\r\n\r\nüîÖüîÖüîÖüîÖüîÖüîÖüîÖüîÖüîÖüîÖüîÖüîÖüîÖüîÖüîÖüîÖüîÖüîÖüîÖüîÖüîÖüîÖüîÖüîÖüîÖüîÖüîÖüîÖüîÖüîÖüîÖüîÖüîÖ-->\r\n\r\n\r\n# üêû bug report\r\n\r\n### Affected Package\r\n<!-- Can you pin-point one or more @angular/* packages as the source of the bug?

It would be great if issues stemming from this user error could be better highlighted at development stages with the Angular Language Service in editors or at compile time with a better error description from the compiler.\r\n\r\n#### Incorrect code sample\r\nThis issue occurs if you redefine a template variable, like so:\r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/9078166/73932569-e7f6c100-48da-11ea-8cb1-4b59ccad9486.png)\r\nComponent:\r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/9078166/73934949-c4824500-48df-11ea-9ad7-86c0ea1d2887.png)\r\nNotice that both loop variables are called _i_. Now obviously this is a user error and it is not an intended use of the loop variables.\r\nHowever neither the Angular Language Service in VS Code or the compiler handle it well.\r\n- The language service:\r\n  - Doesn't highlight the variable redefinition, even as a warning.\r\n  - Does highlight the property accessor being incorrect\r\n  - Thinks that the latter defnition takes precedence over the former, since it thinks _i_ is going to be a number in this scope:\r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/9078166/73932966-b9c5b100-48db-11ea-8f9e-29ce7dc54514.png)\r\n    When in fact before Ivy this code did not produce any errors whatsoever, instead at runtime the loop variable held the former value and correctly iterated over the collection in the component and accessed the individual properties. Here is the rendered page for the above template:\r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/9078166/73933267-5d16c600-48dc-11ea-91e4-05821e8659b1.png)\r\n- The compiler:\r\n  - After Ivy, the above template produces a compiler error. It produces:\r\n    - no error when calling `ng build` in any version or configuration\r\n    - a runtime error when calling `ng serve` with AOT turned off and Ivy turned on in Angular 8\r\n    - a compile time error when calling `ng serve` with  both AOT and Ivy turned on in Angular 8\r\n    - a compile time error when calling `ng serve` in Angular 9\r\n    - a compile time error when calling `ng test` in Angular 9\r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/9078166/73933965-d95dd900-48dd-11ea-87df-6a848fec5307.png)\r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/9078166/73934065-03170000-48de-11ea-97e6-3656d839b05c.png)\r\nThis error message does not allow for effective debugging, since it does not mention in which template the problem occured. In fact it does not even state explicitly that it is a template error. The only way I managed to find the component was by modifying the compiler code and writing extra information to the console.\r\n\r\n#### Updating to Ivy\r\nSince previous Angular versions did not break on this error we only found it when upgrading a medium/large sized app to Angular 9 and suddenly a completely cryptic compiler error message prevented both testing and compiling. This feature might come in handy for others planning to update to Angular 9.\r\n\r\n### Describe the solution you'd like\r\n- The compiler should create a more verbose template error (template parse error?)\r\n- The Angular Language Service should warn about variable redefinitions\r\n\r\n### Describe alternatives you've considered\r\nNo real alternatives to consider.\r\n\r\n### Sample\r\nI have attached a sample component and template for testing in a completely new project:\r\n[app.component.ts.txt](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli/files/4164894/app.component.ts.txt)\r\n[app.component.html.txt](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli/files/4164893/app.component.html.txt)","Url":"https://github.com/angular/angular/issues/35186","RelatedDescription":"Open issue \"Better error handling for template variable redefinitions\" (#35186)"},{"Id":"560965966","IsPullRequest":false,"CreatedAt":"2020-02-06T11:58:20","Actor":"Mewster","Number":"35184","RawContent":null,"Title":"When all the children form controls are disabled, the parent becomes disabled","State":"open","Body":"# üêû bug report\r\n\r\n### Affected Package\r\nThe issue is caused by package @angular/forms\r\n\r\n### Is this a regression?\r\nCouldn't check.\r\n\r\n### Description\r\nAdding only disabled AbstractControl to a FormGroup or a FormArray disables their parent.\r\nMoreover, the \"value\" field changes its behaviour when all the controls are disabled (showing all of them instead of only the enabled ones)\r\n\r\n## üî¨ Minimal Reproduction\r\nhttps://stackblitz.com/edit/angular-136pgu\r\n\r\n## üåç  Your Environment\r\n**Angular Version:**\r\nAngular CLI: 8.3.5\r\nNode: 10.16.3\r\nOS: linux x64\r\nAngular: 8.2.7\r\n... animations, common, compiler, compiler-cli, core, forms\r\n... language-service, platform-browser, platform-browser-dynamic\r\n... router\r\n\r\nPackage                           Version\r\n-----------------------------------------------------------\r\n@angular-devkit/architect         0.803.5\r\n@angular-devkit/build-angular     0.803.5\r\n@angular-devkit/build-optimizer   0.803.5\r\n@angular-devkit/build-webpack     0.803.5\r\n@angular-devkit/core              8.3.5\r\n@angular-devkit/schematics        8.3.5\r\n@angular/cdk                      8.2.3\r\n@angular/cli                      8.3.5\r\n@ngtools/webpack                  8.3.5\r\n@schematics/angular               8.3.5\r\n@schematics/update                0.803.5\r\nrxjs                              6.4.0\r\ntypescript                        3.5.3\r\nwebpack                           4.39.2","Url":"https://github.com/angular/angular/issues/35184","RelatedDescription":"Open issue \"When all the children form controls are disabled, the parent becomes disabled\" (#35184)"},{"Id":"560932061","IsPullRequest":false,"CreatedAt":"2020-02-06T10:52:42","Actor":"ghuser","Number":"35183","RawContent":null,"Title":"operators definition conflicting with ReactiveX/rxjs definition. \"They return a function\" vs \"should return an observable\"","State":"open","Body":"<!--üîÖüîÖüîÖüîÖüîÖüîÖüîÖüîÖüîÖüîÖüîÖüîÖüîÖüîÖüîÖüîÖüîÖüîÖüîÖüîÖüîÖüîÖüîÖüîÖüîÖüîÖüîÖüîÖüîÖüîÖüîÖ\r\n\r\nOh hi there! üòÑ\r\n\r\nTo expedite issue processing please search open and closed issues before submitting a new one.\r\nExisting issues often contain information about workarounds, resolution, or progress updates.\r\n\r\nüîÖüîÖüîÖüîÖüîÖüîÖüîÖüîÖüîÖüîÖüîÖüîÖüîÖüîÖüîÖüîÖüîÖüîÖüîÖüîÖüîÖüîÖüîÖüîÖüîÖüîÖüîÖüîÖüîÖüîÖüîÖüîÖüîÖ-->\r\n\r\n# üìö Docs or angular.io bug report\r\n\r\n### Description\r\n\r\n<!-- ‚úçÔ∏èedit:--> \r\nIn the section https://angular.io/guide/rx-library#operators there is a definition of an operator: \r\n\r\n> ..Operators take configuration options, and **they return a function that takes a source observable**.\r\n\r\nBut in [rxjs guidelines](https://github.com/ReactiveX/rxjs/blob/master/doc/operator-creation.md#guidelines) about operation creation they say: \r\n\r\n> Operators should always return an Observable.

Internally I've seen the ivy code swap variable names back and forth between runs, I haven't been able to reproduce this in isolation  though. In other cases I'm seeing the exact same code, but with a single line of whitespace at the end which causes a different source-map hash. I've also seen the `*.__ivy_ngcc_bak` files sometimes being left behind, this normally happens alongside the single line of whitespace.\r\n\r\nNon-deterministic results can break caching with tools like bazel. In the case of different variable names it could go a step further and produce different resulting .js files and bust browser caches etc.\r\n\r\nEssentially has the same consequences as #34635 but seems less common.\r\n\r\n## üî¨ Minimal Reproduction\r\n\r\nRunning the following almost always produces different results between some of the `ngcc` runs.\r\n```\r\n# Init\r\nyarn add @angular/compiler@9.0.0-rc.14 @angular/compiler-cli@9.0.0-rc.14 @angular/cdk@9.0.0-rc.9 tslib typescript\r\n\r\n# Initial ngcc\r\n./node_modules/.bin/ngcc\r\ncp -R node_modules/@angular @angular-0-init\r\n\r\n# Redo with fresh node_modules but no changes\r\nrm -Rf node_modules/\r\nyarn\r\n./node_modules-first/.bin/ngcc\r\ncp -R node_modules/@angular @angular-1-rerun\r\n\r\n# Redo with new package\r\nyarn add @angular/core@9.0.0-rc.14\r\n./node_modules/.bin/ngcc\r\ncp -R node_modules/@angular @angular-2-new-package\r\n\r\n# Redo with new package and out of date yarn.lock\r\nyarn add --no-lockfile @angular/material@9.0.0-rc.9\r\n./node_modules/.bin/ngcc\r\ncp -R node_modules/@angular @angular-3-bad-lock\r\n\r\n# Redo with updated yarn.lock\r\nyarn\r\n./node_modules/.bin/ngcc\r\ncp -R node_modules/@angular @angular-4-better-lock\r\n\r\n# Redo fresh\r\nrm -Rf node_modules yarn.lock\r\nyarn\r\n./node_modules/.bin/ngcc\r\ncp -R node_modules/@angular @angular-5-redo\r\n```\r\n\r\n## üåç  Your Environment\r\n\r\n**Angular Version:**\r\n9.0.0-rc.14, pretty sure it was also happening with 9.0.0-rc.10","Url":"https://github.com/angular/angular/issues/35180","RelatedDescription":"Open issue \"ngcc is non-deterministic\" (#35180)"},{"Id":"560818539","IsPullRequest":false,"CreatedAt":"2020-02-06T07:01:41","Actor":"santoshyadav198613","Number":"35179","RawContent":null,"Title":"document providedIn: any and platform","State":"open","Body":"<!--üîÖüîÖüîÖüîÖüîÖüîÖüîÖüîÖüîÖüîÖüîÖüîÖüîÖüîÖüîÖüîÖüîÖüîÖüîÖüîÖüîÖüîÖüîÖüîÖüîÖüîÖüîÖüîÖüîÖüîÖüîÖ\r\n\r\nOh hi there! üòÑ\r\n\r\nTo expedite issue processing please search open and closed issues before submitting a new one.\r\nExisting issues often contain information about workarounds, resolution, or progress updates.\r\n\r\nüîÖüîÖüîÖüîÖüîÖüîÖüîÖüîÖüîÖüîÖüîÖüîÖüîÖüîÖüîÖüîÖüîÖüîÖüîÖüîÖüîÖüîÖüîÖüîÖüîÖüîÖüîÖüîÖüîÖüîÖüîÖüîÖüîÖ-->\r\n\r\n# üìö Docs or angular.io bug report\r\n\r\n### Description\r\n\r\nAngular 9 introduces providedIn: any and platform for provided scope, which is not documented.\r\n\r\n\r\n## üî¨ Minimal Reproduction\r\n\r\n### What's the affected URL?**\r\nhttps://next.angular.io/guide/providers#provider-scope\r\n\r\n### Reproduction Steps**\r\n<!-- If applicable please list the steps to take to reproduce the issue -->\r\n<!-- ‚úçÔ∏èedit:-->\r\n\r\n### Expected vs Actual Behavior**\r\n<!-- If applicable please describe the difference between the expected and actual behavior after following the repro steps. -->\r\n<!-- ‚úçÔ∏èedit:-->\r\n\r\n\r\n## üì∑Screenshot\r\n<!-- Often a screenshot can help to capture the issue better than a long description. -->\r\n<!-- ‚úçÔ∏èupload a screenshot:-->\r\n\r\n\r\n## üî• Exception or Error\r\n<pre><code>\r\n<!-- If the issue is accompanied by an exception or an error, please share it below: -->\r\n<!-- ‚úçÔ∏è-->\r\n\r\n</code></pre>\r\n\r\n\r\n## üåç  Your Environment\r\n\r\n### Browser info\r\n<!-- ‚úçÔ∏èIs this a browser specific issue?

We have over 2000 javascript files.\r\n\r\n\r\n## üî¨ Minimal Reproduction\r\n<!--\r\nSimple steps to reproduce this bug.\r\n\r\nPlease include: commands run (including args), packages added, related code changes.\r\n\r\nIf reproduction steps are not enough for reproduction of your issue, please create a minimal GitHub repository with the reproduction of the issue. \r\nA good way to make a minimal reproduction is to create a new app via `ng new repro-app` and add the minimum possible code to show the problem. \r\nShare the link to the repo below along with step-by-step instructions to reproduce the problem, as well as expected and actual behavior.\r\n\r\nIssues that don't have enough info and can't be reproduced will be closed.\r\n\r\nYou can read more about issue submission guidelines here: https://github.com/angular/angular-cli/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md#-submitting-an-issue\r\n-->\r\n\r\n## üî• Exception or Error\r\n<pre><code>\r\n<!-- If the issue is accompanied by an exception or an error, please share it below: -->\r\n<!-- ‚úçÔ∏è-->\r\nERROR in ./src/main/javascript/structure/cases/hv-plan/hv-plan.module.js\r\nModule build failed (from ./node_modules/coverage-istanbul-loader/lib/index.js):\r\nError: An error occurred while trying to read the map file at C:\\Users\\p289718\\Projects\\flow\\flow-ui\\src\\main\\javascript\\structure\\cases\\hv-plan\\hv-plan.module.js.map\r\nError: ENOENT: no such file or directory, open 'C:\\Users\\p289718\\Projects\\flow\\flow-ui\\src\\main\\javascript\\structure\\cases\\hv-plan\\hv-plan.module.js.map'\r\n    at readFromFileMap (C:\\Users\\p289718\\Projects\\flow\\flow-ui\\node_modules\\coverage-istanbul-loader\\node_modules\\convert-source-map\\index.js:40:11)\r\n    at new Converter (C:\\Users\\p289718\\Projects\\flow\\flow-ui\\node_modules\\coverage-istanbul-loader\\node_modules\\convert-source-map\\index.js:47:32)\r\n    at Object.exports.fromMapFileComment (C:\\Users\\p289718\\Projects\\flow\\flow-ui\\node_modules\\coverage-istanbul-loader\\node_modules\\convert-source-map\\index.js:110:10)\r\n    at Object.exports.fromMapFileSource (C:\\Users\\p289718\\Projects\\flow\\flow-ui\\node_modules\\coverage-istanbul-loader\\node_modules\\convert-source-map\\index.js:122:22)\r\n    at Object.default_1 (C:\\Users\\p289718\\Projects\\flow\\flow-ui\\node_modules\\coverage-istanbul-loader\\lib\\index.js:28:45)\r\n @ ./src/main/javascript/structure/structure.module.ts 228:0-58 230:101-113\r\n @ ./src/main/javascript/app/app.angularjs.module.ts\r\n @ ./src/main/javascript/flow-tests.ts\r\n</code></pre>\r\n\r\n\r\n## üåç Your Environment\r\n<pre><code>\r\n<!-- run `ng version` and paste output below -->\r\n<!-- ‚úçÔ∏è-->\r\n\r\n     _                      _                 ____ _     ___\r\n    / \\   _ __   __ _ _   _| | __ _ _ __     / ___| |   |_ _|\r\n   / ‚ñ≥ \\ | '_ \\ / _` | | | | |/ _` | '__|   | |   | |    | |\r\n  / ___ \\| | | | (_| | |_| | | (_| | |      | |___| |___ | |\r\n /_/   \\_\\_| |_|\\__, |\\__,_|_|\\__,_|_|       \\____|_____|___|\r\n                |___/\r\n\r\n\r\nAngular CLI: 9.0.0-rc.14\r\nNode: 12.10.0\r\nOS: win32 x64\r\n\r\nAngular: 9.0.0-rc.14\r\n... cli, common, compiler, compiler-cli, core, language-service\r\n... platform-browser, platform-browser-dynamic, router, upgrade\r\nIvy Workspace: Yes\r\n\r\nPackage                           Version\r\n-----------------------------------------------------------\r\n@angular-devkit/architect         0.803.24\r\n@angular-devkit/build-angular     0.803.24\r\n@angular-devkit/build-optimizer   0.803.24\r\n@angular-devkit/build-webpack     0.803.24\r\n@angular-devkit/core              8.3.24\r\n@angular-devkit/schematics        9.0.0-rc.14\r\n@ngtools/webpack                  8.3.24\r\n@schematics/angular               9.0.0-rc.14\r\n@schematics/update                0.900.0-rc.14\r\nrxjs                              6.5.4\r\ntypescript                        3.7.3\r\nwebpack                           4.41.2\r\n</code></pre>\r\n\r\n**Anything else relevant?**\r\n<!-- ‚úçÔ∏èIs this a browser specific issue?

I think there are competing setups of different development environments.\r\n\r\n### Description\r\n\r\nThere seem to be different interpretations where the `sockjs-node` endpoint of the webpack development server should be reachable.\r\n\r\nMy usecase:\r\n\r\nI have an Asp.Net Core project with multiple angular-apps on the client side. Each Angular dev-server runs on a different port (configured in angular.json in `projects.appX.architect.serve.port`.\r\nIn `projects.appX.architect.build.deployUrl` is the `/appX/ `, because every request under that url is redirected either to the static files of the built app (in production mode) or proxied to the dev-server (in development mode).\r\n\r\nThe url of the Asp.Net Core project is given as `public-host` to `ng serve`, so each live-reload client knows, where to reach its server (something like `https://localhost:44733/appX`, all apps get the same url obviously). Every request on the baseHref of each app is proxied to the right port of the corresponding dev-server (which is configured within the Asp.Net Core project).\r\n\r\nThe Asp.Net Core backend doesn't change the request path on these request, so a request heading to `public-host/appX/sockjs-node/info` will be proxied to `http://localhost:4500/appX/sockjs-node/info`. Unfortunatly webpack was listening on `http://localhost:4500/sockjs-node/info` so live-reloading didn't work.\r\n\r\nCommit 5260bbb added the missing webpack option so everything worked fine. But this seem to break other people's setup, because they configured their reverse proxies in a different way, so all requests to `public-host/appX/sockjs-node` are forwarded to `http://localhost:4500/sockjs-node/info`.\r\n\r\nIs there any kind of configuration option, so I can serve the `sockjs-node` endpoint under the baseHref? Maybe I'm missing something, but the documentation is not very clear about the topic, how baseHref, deployUrl, servePath and publicHost are meant to work together.\r\n\r\nDoes any option of these have an effect on webpack?","Url":"https://github.com/angular/angular-cli/issues/16836","RelatedDescription":"Open issue \"live-reloading broken (again): misunderstandings about webpack's sockPath\" (#16836)"},{"Id":"559913964","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2020-02-04T19:17:43","Actor":"sacgrover","Number":"16835","RawContent":null,"Title":"Schematics: rename to a non-existing dir fails on sync to disk #16484","State":"closed","Body":"Schematics: rename to a non-existing dir fails on sync to disk #16484","Url":"https://github.com/angular/angular-cli/pull/16835","RelatedDescription":"Closed or merged PR \"Schematics: rename to a non-existing dir fails on sync to disk #16484\" (#16835)"},{"Id":"559811306","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2020-02-04T18:15:04","Actor":"alan-agius4","Number":"16830","RawContent":null,"Title":"[LTS] fix(@angular-devkit/build-angular): provide supported browsers to babel","State":"closed","Body":"By default the browserslist `configPath` will default to `process.cwd()`.

The problem goes away when only one namespace is used.\r\n\r\n\r\n## üî¨ Minimal Reproduction\r\nhttps://stackblitz.com/edit/angular-issue-repro2-fljw6o\r\n\r\n**The problem only presents itself when running in production mode with AOT.**\r\n\r\n**So please download and try locally**\r\n\r\nThe app takes the two namespaces, logs their keys, then logs the names of the functions associated with the keys. You can see that the split up namespace has duplicated function names, while the mono-namespace has unique names.\r\n\r\n## üåç  Your Environment\r\n\r\n**Angular Version:**\r\n<pre><code>\r\nAngular CLI: 9.0.0-rc.10\r\nNode: 12.14.1\r\nOS: linux x64\r\n\r\nAngular: 9.0.0-rc.11\r\n... common, compiler, compiler-cli, core, language-service\r\n... platform-browser, platform-browser-dynamic, router\r\nIvy Workspace: Yes\r\n\r\nPackage                           Version\r\n-----------------------------------------------------------\r\n@angular-devkit/architect         0.900.0-rc.10\r\n@angular-devkit/build-angular     0.900.0-rc.10\r\n@angular-devkit/build-optimizer   0.900.0-rc.10\r\n@angular-devkit/build-webpack     0.900.0-rc.10\r\n@angular-devkit/core              9.0.0-rc.10\r\n@angular-devkit/schematics        9.0.0-rc.10\r\n@angular/cli                      9.0.0-rc.10\r\n@ngtools/webpack                  9.0.0-rc.10\r\n@schematics/angular               9.0.0-rc.10\r\n@schematics/update                0.900.0-rc.10\r\nrxjs                              6.5.4\r\ntypescript                        3.7.5\r\nwebpack                           4.41.2\r\n</code></pre>\r\n","Url":"https://github.com/angular/angular-cli/issues/16831","RelatedDescription":"Open issue \"Prod minified code breaks app when using namespace merging\" (#16831)"}],"ResultType":"GitHubIssue"},"material2-Issues":{"Issues":[{"Id":"561368378","IsPullRequest":false,"CreatedAt":"2020-02-07T01:33:00","Actor":"ignaciojvig","Number":"18425","RawContent":null,"Title":"Conflicting components: MatFormField,MatFormField while Testing with Angular 8","State":"open","Body":"#### Reproduction\r\n\r\nSteps to reproduce:\r\n1.
