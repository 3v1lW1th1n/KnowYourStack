Additionally, new projects created that target 2.1 will use this meta-package by default, rather than the existing meta-package *Microsoft.AspNetCore.All*.\r\n\r\nThe new meta-package differs from the existing meta-package in that it reduces the number of dependencies of packages not owned or supported by the ASP.NET or .NET teams to just those deemed necessary to ensure the major frameworks features function. The full list of packages being removed compared to *Microsoft.AspNetCore.All* can be seen below.\r\n\r\nThe existing *Microsoft.AspNetCore.All* meta-package will continue to be made available throughout the 2.x lifecycle, and it now depends on *Microsoft.AspNetCore.App*, but we recommend customers move to the new *Microsoft.AspNetCore.App* meta-pacakge and then add individual references to any of the removed packages if their app requires it.\r\n\r\n## Package references not in \"Microsoft.AspNetCore.App\", compared to \"Microsoft.AspNetCore.All\"\r\nThe following packages are direct dependencies of *Microsoft.AspNetCore.All* but **not** of *Microsoft.AspNetCore.App*. Note that any dependencies of these packages that otherwise aren't dependencies of *Microsoft.AspNetCore.App* will now **not** be included implicitly, e.g. *StackExchange.Redis* as a dependency of *Microsoft.Extensions.Caching.Redis*, *Microsoft.ApplicationInsights* as a dependency of *Microsoft.AspNetCore.ApplicationInsights.HostingStartup*:\r\n- Microsoft.Data.Sqlite\r\n- Microsoft.Data.Sqlite.Core\r\n- Microsoft.EntityFrameworkCore.Sqlite\r\n- Microsoft.EntityFrameworkCore.Sqlite.Core\r\n- Microsoft.Extensions.Caching.Redis\r\n- Microsoft.AspNetCore.DataProtection.AzureStorage\r\n- Microsoft.Extensions.Configuration.AzureKeyVault\r\n- Microsoft.AspNetCore.DataProtection.AzureKeyVault\r\n- Microsoft.AspNetCore.Identity.Service.AzureKeyVault\r\n- Microsoft.AspNetCore.AzureKeyVault.HostingStartup\r\n- Microsoft.AspNetCore.ApplicationInsights.HostingStartup\r\n\r\nWhen moving from *Microsoft.AspNetCore.All* to *Microsoft.AspNetCore.App*, if your application uses any APIs from the above packages, or packages brought in by those packages, you'll now need to add references to those packages in your project manually."}],"ResultType":"GitHubEvent"},"Twitter":{"ResultType":"TwitterTimeline","Tweets":[{"Id":"961596291968102400","CreatedAt":"2018-02-08T13:43:16+00:00","UserScreenname":"aspnet","Text":"Our @csharpfritz and ASPInsider @brendoneus will be showing unit testing patterns and structure practices LIVE onli‚Ä¶ https://t.co/dvU3elJX8R","Source":"<a href=\"https://about.twitter.com/products/tweetdeck\" rel=\"nofollow\">TweetDeck</a>","RetweetCount":10,"FavoriteCount":3,"RawContent":null},{"Id":"961390822993399809","CreatedAt":"2018-02-08T00:06:48+00:00","UserScreenname":"aspnet","Text":"Did you miss this week's #ASPNET Community Standup (with the latest news on Blazor, starring @danroth27 and‚Ä¶ https://t.co/tfeqgnhClX","Source":"<a href=\"https://about.twitter.com/products/tweetdeck\" rel=\"nofollow\">TweetDeck</a>","RetweetCount":19,"FavoriteCount":9,"RawContent":null},{"Id":"961390078932148224","CreatedAt":"2018-02-08T00:03:51+00:00","UserScreenname":"aspnet","Text":"Sure, after you've left a PR on the #ASPNET docs...\n\nhttps://t.co/Dau0ZgAUbe\n\n;) https://t.co/s8UGKAhK0e","Source":"<a href=\"https://about.twitter.com/products/tweetdeck\" rel=\"nofollow\">TweetDeck</a>","RetweetCount":10,"FavoriteCount":2,"RawContent":null},{"Id":"961382608818130944","CreatedAt":"2018-02-07T23:34:10+00:00","UserScreenname":"aspnet","Text":"Join our Jeff Fritz and ASPInsider Brendan Enrick for a LIVE CODING stream talking about how to write better unit t‚Ä¶ https://t.co/7ecMOR53sw","Source":"<a href=\"https://about.twitter.com/products/tweetdeck\" rel=\"nofollow\">TweetDeck</a>","RetweetCount":8,"FavoriteCount":0,"RawContent":null},{"Id":"960929306548387840","CreatedAt":"2018-02-06T17:32:54+00:00","UserScreenname":"aspnet","Text":"This week's standup starts in 30 minutes.
