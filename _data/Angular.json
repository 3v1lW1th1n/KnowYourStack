And that issue is a lack of information given by Angular when stuff goes wrong.\r\n\r\nFor instance, I've been refactoring some code, afterwards I wanted to run a build to see if everything was still in order.\r\n\r\nSadly, I was faced with the following errors:\r\n\r\n```\r\nERROR in Cannot determine the module for class DbValueComponent in /lib/db-value/db-value.component.ts! Add DbValueComponent to the NgModule to fix it.\r\n\r\nCannot determine the module for class DbInputComponent in /lib/db-input/db-input.component.ts! Add DbInputComponent to the NgModule to fix it.\r\n```\r\n\r\nSo then you think, alright lets take a look in my ngModule see if everything's in order. But everything's there. So now the error message became useless, it doesn't point you in the right way at all.\r\n\r\nNow this is just a simple example, but this happens too often in my opinion. Greatly reduces efficiency for no apparent gain.\r\n\r\n### Describe the solution you'd like\r\nFix error descriptions so it's actually useful.\r\n\r\n### Describe alternatives you've considered\r\nReact","Url":"https://github.com/angular/angular/issues/33492","RelatedDescription":"Open issue \"Useful errors\" (#33492)"},{"Id":"514526129","IsPullRequest":false,"CreatedAt":"2019-10-30T09:49:11","Actor":"flash-me","Number":"33490","RawContent":null,"Title":"[feature][@angular/elements] Expose ComponentNgElementStrategy","State":"open","Body":"# 🚀 feature request\r\n\r\n### Relevant Package\r\n@angular/elements\r\n\r\n\r\n### Description\r\nThere is no \"easy\" way to pass custom [lifecycle callbacks](https://html.spec.whatwg.org/multipage/custom-elements.html#custom-element-reactions) for CustomElements.\r\nWe may pass a custom **NgElementStrategyFactory** to `createCustomElement`, but when looking at [ComponentNgElementStrategy](https://github.com/angular/angular/blob/master/packages/elements/src/component-factory-strategy.ts#L45), this is not something that should be done by the average angular developer.\r\n\r\n### Describe the solution you'd like\r\n1.

This is the only difference that I can determine from various configuration and setups. \r\n\r\n## 🔬 Minimal Reproduction\r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/gnomeontherun/angular-9-ivy-library-error\r\n\r\nWorking configuration in separate directories: https://github.com/gnomeontherun/angular-9-ivy-library-error/commit/1443b1139d0a2d814d0acd1c2dbd8d1c1cc05547\r\n\r\nFailing configuration in same directory: https://github.com/gnomeontherun/angular-9-ivy-library-error/commit/1f9c7817c2adc75229b4509d061f6d2d4f1c0fbf\r\n\r\n1.

building based on webpack and @ngtools/webpack.  Build takes a lot of time. During some research I found that before starting actually build of files @ngtools/webpack run the following steps\r\n\r\n```\r\nAngularCompilerPlugin._setupOptions: 656.320ms\r\nAngularCompilerPlugin._createOrUpdateProgram.ts.createProgram: 25064.073ms\r\nAngularCompilerPlugin._make.resolveEntryModuleFromMain: 17.954ms\r\nAngularCompilerPlugin._listLazyRoutesFromProgram.createProgram: 1.900ms\r\nAngularCompilerPlugin._listLazyRoutesFromProgram.listLazyRoutes: 7292.047ms\r\nAngularCompilerPlugin._emit.ts.getOptionsDiagnostics: 0.349ms\r\nAngularCompilerPlugin._emit.ts.gatherDiagnostics.ts.getSyntacticDiagnostics: 4.739ms\r\nAngularCompilerPlugin._emit.ts.gatherDiagnostics.ts.getSemanticDiagnostics: 18770.113ms\r\nAngularCompilerPlugin._emit: 34101.066ms\r\nAngularCompilerPlugin._update._emit: 34101.871ms\r\nAngularCompilerPlugin._update: 67271.220ms\r\nAngularCompilerPlugin._make: 67271.619ms\r\n\r\nngcLoader+main.ts+.ngcLoader.AngularCompilerPlugin: 15.984ms\r\nngcLoader+main.ts+: 45.086ms\r\nrunning other build files\r\n```\r\nAs you see it takes more than one minutes to start building and it wait to finish the command `AngularCompilerPlugin._make`\r\n\r\nI tried to run other project using Angular-CLI and the picture is the following\r\n\r\n```\r\nAngularCompilerPlugin._setupOptions: 21.142ms\r\n 10% building modules 3/3 modules 0 activeAngularCompilerPlugin._createOrUpdateProgram.ts.createProgram: 4751.113ms\r\nAngularCompilerPlugin._make.resolveEntryModuleFromMain: 7.353ms\r\nAngularCompilerPlugin._getLazyRoutesFromNgtools: 392.109ms\r\nAngularCompilerPlugin._emit.ts.getOptionsDiagnostics: 0.327ms\r\nAngularCompilerPlugin._emit.ts.gatherDiagnostics.ts.getSyntacticDiagnostics: 0.527ms\r\nAngularCompilerPlugin._emit.ts.gatherDiagnostics.ts.getSemanticDiagnostics: 4462.985ms\r\nAngularCompilerPlugin._emit.ts+environment.ts+.emit: 29.307ms\r\nAngularCompilerPlugin._emit.ts+main.ts+.emit: 12.554ms\r\n...... some other files emit\r\nAngularCompilerPlugin._emit: 6090.988ms\r\nAngularCompilerPlugin._update._emit: 6091.611ms\r\nAngularCompilerPlugin._update: 11278.420ms\r\nAngularCompilerPlugin._make: 11298.618ms\r\nngcLoader+main.ts+: 10.050ms\r\n```\r\nAs you can see in Angular-CLI after command `AngularCompilerPlugin._emit.ts.gatherDiagnostics.ts.getSemanticDiagnostics`  it shows me all emit files and time which is taking for this operation. In @ngtools/webpack is it still emit all files or just blocked? If it is emitting is it possible to see all files?\r\n\r\nI think it takes a lot of time for the step\r\nAngularCompilerPlugin._make: 67271.619ms. \r\nDo you have any idea how can we improve this time? \r\nIs it possible to add more logs to see what actually consuming AngularCompilerPlugin?\r\n\r\n### Describe the solution you'd like\r\nAdd more logs for AngularCompilerPlugin initial step to find which task takes more time.\r\n","Url":"https://github.com/angular/angular-cli/issues/15987","RelatedDescription":"Open issue \"@ngtools/webpack build do not wait until AngularCompilerPlugin._make finish like in angular-cli\" (#15987)"},{"Id":"514828525","IsPullRequest":false,"CreatedAt":"2019-10-30T16:54:22","Actor":"kylecordes","Number":"15984","RawContent":null,"Title":"Don't write into node_modules by default","State":"open","Body":"Currently, `ng build` and possibly other commands write into the node modules directory.\r\n\r\nA recently added change #15900 has created the ability to configure CLI to not do this.

some other bundler. \r\n\r\nWebpack is old \r\n\r\n- On a frequent basis webpack gets out of sync with the current state of the project and will fall behind 1 or N (yes it really can be unlimited in how far back) builds. You're then coding while working with a \"phantom build\" or \"ghost build\" a served state of the app which is 1 or N compiles behind what you currently have on disk / in your IDE. this is impossible to flag/debug. You must be aware this can happen and remember to think about it constantly when something iffy is happening (old state of the code clearly on page / not expected behavior) and react by killing all npm instances on your PC and compiling from scratch.\r\n\r\nWorst part about this is that it can sometimes be chimeric : a little of the current state a little of an old state. which leads to truly aberrant behavior.\r\nYou can waste a lot of time debugging your code over this when in reality your code was 100% correct.\r\n- Speaking of time, webpack is very slow. If you use rollup, parcel or another solution on your angular cli project, initial compilation will be super-fast by comparison and the following re-compilations even more so.\r\n- Webpack has loads of complicated config. Parcel for one has NO config. with that being a possibility why are we trudging on with a dated config-heavy solution?\r\n\r\n\r\n### Describe the solution you'd like\r\n\r\nParcel would do nicely but I would also be happy with [rollup](https://rollupjs.org/guide/en/) or [pika](https://www.pika.dev/about/) \r\n","Url":"https://github.com/angular/angular-cli/issues/15981","RelatedDescription":"Closed issue \"Integrate Parcel 📦🚀\" (#15981)"},{"Id":"514230081","IsPullRequest":false,"CreatedAt":"2019-10-30T12:52:28","Actor":"leoperetti","Number":"15976","RawContent":null,"Title":"@angular/compiler-cli is using source-map@0.6.1, does not exist.","State":"closed","Body":"<!--🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅\r\n🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅-->\r\n\r\n\r\n# 🐞 bug report\r\nThe issue is caused by package @angular/compiler-cli \r\n\r\n\r\n### Is this a regression?\r\n\r\n<!-- Did this behavior use to work in the previous version? -->\r\n<!-- ✍️-->No\r\n\r\n\r\n### Description\r\nIt prevents me from creating new angular applications\r\nHere paste my stack overflow post\r\nhttps://es.stackoverflow.com/questions/304557/creating-new-angular-application\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<!--\r\nIf StackBlitz is not suitable for reproduction of your issue, please create a minimal GitHub repository with the reproduction of the issue.\r\nA good way to make a minimal reproduction is to create a new app via `ng new repro-app` and add the minimum possible code to show the problem. \r\nShare the link to the repo below along with step-by-step instructions to reproduce the problem, as well as expected and actual behavior.\r\n\r\nIssues that don't have enough info and can't be reproduced will be closed.\r\n\r\nYou can read more about issue submission guidelines here: https://github.com/angular/angular/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md#-submitting-an-issue\r\n-->\r\n\r\n## 🔥 Exception or Error\r\n<pre><code>\r\n$ npm install\r\nnpm ERR! code ETARGET\r\nnpm ERR! notarget No matching version found for source-map@0.6.1.\r\nnpm ERR! notarget In most cases you or one of your dependencies are requesting\r\nnpm ERR! notarget a package version that doesn't exist.\r\nnpm ERR! notarget\r\nnpm ERR! notarget It was specified as a dependency of '@angular/compiler-cli'\r\nnpm ERR! notarget\r\n</code></pre>\r\n\r\n\r\n## 🌍  Your Environment\r\n\r\n**Angular Version:**\r\n8\r\n</code></pre>\r\n\r\n**Anything else relevant?**\r\n<!-- ✍️Is this a browser specific issue?

NX (upgraded to 8.7.0) or Angular 9.\r\n- cleanup up the complete `angular.json` \r\n- checked all settings in `angular.json` etc.\r\n\r\n- to be sure I tested with `style` and `skipTests` as well\r\n> Deprecated `styleext` and `spec` options have been removed. Use `style` and `skipTests` options instead.\r\n\r\n\r\n#### Example repo:\r\nhttps://gitlab.com/ultimate-solutions/ultimate-nx-starter-workspace\r\n> This is a (first | WIP) setup for some best practices etc. Yet Another Starter Project\r\n> With NX, Angular and GraphQL\r\n\r\n```\r\nnpm run start simple-app\r\n```\r\n- upgrading `\"@angular-devkit/build-angular\": \"0.803.13\",`  to `\"@angular-devkit/build-angular\": \"0.803.14\",` shows the ERROR.\r\n\r\n","Url":"https://github.com/angular/angular-cli/issues/15975","RelatedDescription":"Open issue \"@angular-devkit/build-angular 0.803.14 results in devServer error\" (#15975)"},{"Id":"514129222","IsPullRequest":false,"CreatedAt":"2019-10-29T18:24:19","Actor":"filipesilva","Number":"15974","RawContent":null,"Title":"Multi-locale Ivy builds do not use registerLocaleData","State":"open","Body":"`localeData`, obtained via `@angular/common/locales/<locale>`, is needed for several FW features like pluralization.\r\n\r\nIn VE each build resulted in a single locale. To register the locale data in VE the CLI added the following code via a transform:\r\n```\r\nimport { registerLocaleData } from '@angular/common';\r\nimport localeFr from '@angular/common/locales/fr';\r\nregisterLocaleData(localeFr, 'fr');\r\n```\r\nLocales can also have extra information that the CLI did not handle. It would have required to use add the code below instead:\r\n```\r\nimport { registerLocaleData } from '@angular/common';\r\nimport localeFr from '@angular/common/locales/fr';\r\nimport localeFrExtra from '@angular/common/locales/extra/fr';\r\nregisterLocaleData(localeFr, 'fr-FR', localeFrExtra);\r\n```\r\nIn Ivy each build can result in several locales. To use a similar mechanism would look like this:\r\n```\r\nimport {registerLocaleData} from '@angular/common';\r\nimport localeFr from '@angular/common/locales/fr';\r\nimport localeDe from '@angular/common/locales/de';\r\nswitch ($localize.locale) {\r\n  case 'fr':\r\n    registerLocaleData(localeFr);\r\n    break;\r\n  case 'de':    \r\n    registerLocaleData(localeDe);\r\n  default:\r\n    break;\r\n}\r\n```\r\nThis approach is not ideal because all locale-specific builds would include all locale data.\r\n\r\nSince localize operates after code is built and bundled, introducing locale specific data presents a novel problem.\r\n\r\nA repro of this problem can be found in https://github.com/filipesilva/i18n. It is still possible to do individual locale builds (via the `i18n*` options) with Ivy though.","Url":"https://github.com/angular/angular-cli/issues/15974","RelatedDescription":"Open issue \"Multi-locale Ivy builds do not use registerLocaleData\" (#15974)"},{"Id":"514059378","IsPullRequest":false,"CreatedAt":"2019-10-29T16:35:30","Actor":"runner78","Number":"15970","RawContent":null,"Title":"ng serve: no cookies send to https server (chrome 78)","State":"open","Body":"<!--🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅\r\n\r\nIt may be a problem of google chrome, but if that is normal now, it would be a problem\r\n\r\n🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅-->\r\n\r\n\r\n# 🐞 Bug report\r\n\r\n### Command (mark with an `x`)\r\n<!-- Can you pin-point the command or commands that are effected by this bug? -->\r\n<!-- ✍️edit: -->\r\n```\r\n- [ ] new\r\n- [ ] build\r\n- [x] serve\r\n- [ ] test\r\n- [ ] e2e\r\n- [ ] generate\r\n- [ ] add\r\n- [ ] update\r\n- [ ] lint\r\n- [ ] xi18n\r\n- [ ] run\r\n- [ ] config\r\n- [ ] help\r\n- [ ] version\r\n- [ ] doc\r\n```\r\n\r\n### Description\r\n\r\n\r\nIts may be a problem of google chrome, but if that is normal behavior for chrome now, it would be a problem.\r\n\r\nAfter update to google chrome to 78, my project no longer send cookies from localhost to my website with https. iI have also used ng serve with ssl command.

Any user selection can be meaningful, not only when the selected option changes.\r\n\r\nA concrete use case is when you are implementing a \"smart\" control that switches from a simple label to an actual select when you click on it and then switches back to a simple label when a selection is made (possibly confirming the currently selected option).\r\n\r\nWithout the requested feature, the mat-select element will remain visible each time the user confirms the currently selected option, thus breaking the kind of UX that I described.\r\n","Url":"https://github.com/angular/components/issues/17534","RelatedDescription":"Open issue \"mat-select should have a \"selectionMade\" output\" (#17534)"},{"Id":"513602569","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2019-10-28T23:30:49","Actor":"Splaktar","Number":"17532","RawContent":null,"Title":"docs(cdk/platform): remove header in example from TOC","State":"closed","Body":"`h2`s aren't anchored or added to the TOC.\r\n\r\nFixes extra TOC entry here for `Platform Information:` from the example\r\n<img width=\"1111\" alt=\"Screen Shot 2019-10-28 at 15 59 42\" src=\"https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/3506071/67724336-fb20f900-f99b-11e9-90e5-410e912054e3.png\">\r\n","Url":"https://github.com/angular/components/pull/17532","RelatedDescription":"Closed or merged PR \"docs(cdk/platform): remove header in example from TOC\" (#17532)"},{"Id":"513479264","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2019-10-28T21:19:39","Actor":"andrewseguin","Number":"17527","RawContent":null,"Title":"docs: add package ID prefix to h3's ids","State":"closed","Body":"This helps avoid collisions in the table of content's sections like\r\n\"Directives\" and \"Services\", since now we may show more than one\r\npackage entry point in docs (e.g. button and button-testing).\r\n\r\nNote that we chose not to add the prefix to individual\r\nclass/constant/interface/etc names because it muddles the URL and\r\nis unlikely that we collide on these values.\r\n\r\ne.g\r\n```html\r\n<h3 id=\"material-button-directives\" class=\"docs-header-link docs-api-h3\">\r\n```\r\n\r\n```html\r\n<h3 id=\"material-button-testing-interfaces\" class=\"docs-header-link docs-api-h3\">\r\n```\r\n\r\nFixes #17526","Url":"https://github.com/angular/components/pull/17527","RelatedDescription":"Closed or merged PR \"docs: add package ID prefix to h3's ids\" (#17527)"},{"Id":"513467298","IsPullRequest":false,"CreatedAt":"2019-10-28T21:19:39","Actor":"andrewseguin","Number":"17526","RawContent":null,"Title":"Docs content needs to prefix HTML ids with the package name","State":"closed","Body":"The docs site now includes API docs for multiple entry points, which means our Table of Contents will need to point to more specific IDs than just \"services\" and \"classes\".\r\n\r\nA change needs to be made to `entry-point.template.html` so that the `id=...` is prefixed so you have something like `material-button-classes` and `material-button-testing-classes`","Url":"https://github.com/angular/components/issues/17526","RelatedDescription":"Closed issue \"Docs content needs to prefix HTML ids with the package name\" (#17526)"},{"Id":"513549207","IsPullRequest":false,"CreatedAt":"2019-10-28T20:47:58","Actor":"als9xd","Number":"17531","RawContent":null,"Title":"Mat-select disabled reactivity bug","State":"open","Body":"#### Reproduction\r\n\r\nhttps://stackblitz.com/edit/angular-3wepre\r\n\r\nSteps to reproduce:\r\n1.
