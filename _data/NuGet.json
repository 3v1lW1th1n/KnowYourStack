The other issue with this approach is that I need it to reference a package that hasn't been published to NuGet yet (as all packages are published in lock-step), e.g:\r\n\r\n```xml\r\n<PackageReference Include=\"ServiceStack.Common\" Version=\"5.5.0\" ExcludeAssets=\"compile\"/>\r\n```\r\n\r\nThe build fails that it can't find the unpublished package:\r\n\r\n    [NU1102] Unable to find package ServiceStack.Common with version (>= 5.5.0)\r\n\r\nI effectively need someway to \"inject\" the exact dependencies and version I need in the generated .nuspec which results in:\r\n\r\n```xml\r\n<group targetFramework=\"net45\">\r\n  <dependency id=\"ServiceStack.Common\" version=\"5.5.0\" />\r\n</group>\r\n<group targetFramework=\".netstandard2.0\">\r\n  <dependency id=\"ServiceStack.Common\" version=\"5.5.0\" />\r\n</group>\r\n```\r\n\r\nIs there some way I can manually declare `<dependency/>` as above so it's only used when MSBuild/NuGet packs the project? Otherwise is there a way to apply some XML transform to the generated .nuspec so I can manipulate the XML in the .nuspec before it's packed/compressed?\r\n\r\nBasically I'm only interested in injecting dependencies when the \"pack\" target is run so it's ignored/inert in all other targets."},{"Id":"8743622955","Type":"IssuesEvent","CreatedAt":"2018-12-12T19:42:05","Actor":"tolgaonbay","Repository":"NuGet/Home","Organization":"NuGet","RawContent":null,"RelatedAction":"opened","RelatedUrl":"https://github.com/NuGet/Home/issues/7630","RelatedDescription":"Opened issue \"NuGet Install NoCache Doesn't Install Latest Prerelease Package\" (#7630) at NuGet/Home","RelatedBody":"## NuGet Install NoCache Doesn't Install Latest Prerelease Package\r\n\r\nI try to install the latest pre-release package from a nuget server with Prerelease and NoCache parameters, but the nuget install command installs the earlier version of the package from the local cache.
