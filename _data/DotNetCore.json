This means [.NET Core 2.2](https://devblogs.microsoft.com/dotnet/announcing-net-core-2-2/) is no longer supported and updates will no longer be provided. We recommend moving to [.NET Core 3.1](https://devblogs.microsoft.com/dotnet/announcing-net-core-3-1/), our long term support (LTS) release.\r\n\r\n- [Download .NET Core 3.1](https://www.microsoft.com/net/download/dotnet-core/3.1)\r\n- [.NET Core 2.2 end-of-life statement](https://devblogs.microsoft.com/dotnet/net-core-2-2-will-reach-end-of-life-on-december-23-2019/)\r\n\r\nWe've created an issue at [dotnet/core#4084](https://github.com/dotnet/core/issues/4084) for your questions and comments.\r\n\r\n## .NET Core 2.2 Lifecycle\r\n\r\n.NET Core releases belong to one of two [support lifecycles](https://www.microsoft.com/net/platform/support-policy): long term support (LTS) and Current. LTS releases are stable release which receive critical updates and are supported for at least three years. Current releases can include new features that may undergo future change based on feedback. Current releases are supported for three months after the subsequent .NET Core major or minor release. Both LTS and Current releases receive critical fixes throughout their lifecycle, for security, reliability, or to add support for new operating system versions. You must stay up-to-date with the latest patches to qualify for support. \r\n\r\n[.NET Core 2.2](https://devblogs.microsoft.com/dotnet/announcing-net-core-2-2/) was released in December 2018 as a Current release. Per the lifecycle policy, Current releases reach end of life 3 months after a subsequent release (Current or LTS). **.NET Core 3.0** released in **September 2019** and began the end of life countdown for .NET Core 2.2 that concluded on December 23, 2019. \r\n\r\n## .NET Core 2.2 Downloads\r\n\r\n.NET Core 2.2 installers, zips and tar.gzs will remain available, but unsupported. This includes existing releases available on Linux package feeds. Previous versions, including 2.2, will be accessible through the [Download Archives](https://www.microsoft.com/net/download/archives). \r\n\r\n## Policy Information\r\n\r\nAdditional lifecycle and support details  and background can be seen in the following:\r\n\r\n* [.NET Core Support Lifecycle](https://www.microsoft.com/net/platform/support-policy)\r\n* [Microsoft Support for .NET Core](https://github.com/dotnet/core/blob/master/microsoft-support.md)\r\n* [.NET Core OS Lifecycle Policy](https://github.com/dotnet/core/blob/master/os-lifecycle-policy.md)\r\n* [Support and Versioning](https://blogs.msdn.microsoft.com/dotnet/2016/07/26/net-support-and-versioning/)\r\n"},{"Id":"11137901850","Type":"IssuesEvent","CreatedAt":"2019-12-20T20:42:34","Actor":"vivmishra","Repository":"dotnet/announcements","Organization":"dotnet","RawContent":null,"RelatedAction":"opened","RelatedUrl":"https://github.com/dotnet/announcements/issues/146","RelatedDescription":"Opened issue \"Announcing Availability of Localized IntelliSense for .NET Core 3.0 and 3.1\" (#146) at dotnet/announcements","RelatedBody":"This week we released localized [IntelliSense](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/visualstudio/ide/using-intellisense?view=vs-2019) files for .NET Core 3.0 and 3.1, in following 10 Visual Studio supported languages: \r\n- Brazilian Portuguese\r\n- Chinese (simplified)\r\n- Chinese (traditional)\r\n- French\r\n- German\r\n- Italian\r\n- Japanese\r\n- Korean\t\r\n- Russian\r\n- Spanish\r\n\r\nThe files (in zip archives) are available for download from [**Download localized .NET Core IntelliSense files**](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/download/dotnet-core/intellisense).\r\n\r\n * [Checksums for 3.0 zip files](https://dotnetcli.blob.core.windows.net/dotnet/checksums/3.0.0-intellisense-sha.txt)\r\n * [Checksums for 3.1 zip files](https://dotnetcli.blob.core.windows.net/dotnet/checksums/3.1.0-intellisense-sha.txt)\r\n\r\nYou can see [the .NET Core Guide](https://aka.ms/dotnet-core-intellisense) for instructions on how to use these files with Visual Studio.\r\n\r\nBy default, when you're developing .NET Core projects, the SDK only includes the English version of the IntelliSense files. But now you can enhance your localized Visual Studio development experience by adding the localized IntelliSense files from the download site into your local development environment.\r\n\r\nLastly, with this release we have made the localized IntelliSense available as zip archives that does require you to manually extract and copy the files to respective SDK install folders.

This means some folks will lose their Collaborator badge and the ability to interact with the CI system.*\r\n\r\nOver the years, we’ve added a bunch of folks as collaborators with read permissions to our public repos. The rationale was that we wanted to be able to assign issues to community members because GitHub only allowed assigning issues to users with an explicit permission grant for the repository. However, they changed this in [June 2019](https://github.blog/2019-06-25-assign-issues-to-issue-commenters/). Now, we can assign issues to all users with explicit permissions as well as to users that have commented on the specific issue.\r\n\r\nAlso, we recently started to audit and tighten the permissions for our organizations. As a result, it became clear that large number of repo-specific permission grants are hard to review and audit. Internally, our goal is to grant all permissions via teams instead.\r\n\r\nHence, we plan to remove all collaborators from public repos that only have read permissions (folks with triage permissions will remain). The full list of affected repos is listed below.\r\n\r\nThis shouldn’t impact your ability to work with us, but losing explicit read-only has the following implications:\r\n\r\n-   **You’ll lose the contributor badge**. We understand that this is visually appealing and for some people it might have been a badge of honor. But given that GitHub also shows a Contributor bade for folks whose PRs got merged, we don’t think it this will be a major take back.    \r\n    ![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/5169960/70491508-43acf580-1ab6-11ea-94df-74ea2dde98b4.png)\r\n\r\n\r\n-   **You lose the ability to interact with the CI system**. As a collaborator, you can use comments to [send commands to the CI system](https://github.com/dotnet/runtime/blob/master/docs/project/pullrequest-builds.md). While this can be useful at times, we generally don’t expect (or desire) contributors to do that. Of course, anyone can still access the CI logs.\r\n\r\n| Public Repo                | \\#collaborators with read |\r\n|----------------------------|---------------------------|\r\n| arcade                     | 1                         |\r\n| BenchmarkDotNet            | 11                        |\r\n| cli                        | 2                         |\r\n| command-line-api           | 14                        |\r\n| coreclr                    | 18                        |\r\n| corefx                     | 180                       |\r\n| corefxlab                  | 4                         |\r\n| corert                     | 7                         |\r\n| core-sdk                   | 1                         |\r\n| docs                       | 3                         |\r\n| interactive-window         | 1                         |\r\n| machinelearning            | 1                         |\r\n| machinelearning-samples    | 1                         |\r\n| msbuild-language-service   | 1                         |\r\n| runtime                    | 128                       |\r\n| spark                      | 5                         |\r\n| standard                   | 1                         |\r\n| windowsdesktop             | 1                         |\r\n| winforms-datavisualization | 1                         |\r\n| Grand Total                | 381                       |\r\n\r\n### Discussion\r\n\r\nTo discuss this, please comment on the corresponding issue at https://github.com/dotnet/runtime/issues/718."},{"Id":"11003471296","Type":"IssuesEvent","CreatedAt":"2019-12-03T20:36:30","Actor":"MichaelSimons","Repository":"dotnet/announcements","Organization":"dotnet","RawContent":null,"RelatedAction":"opened","RelatedUrl":"https://github.com/dotnet/announcements/issues/143","RelatedDescription":"Opened issue \".NET Core `latest` Docker tags updated to 3.1\" (#143) at dotnet/announcements","RelatedBody":"# .NET Core `latest` Docker tags updated to 3.1\r\n\r\nThe `latest` tags for the [dotnet/core](https://hub.docker.com/_/microsoft-dotnet-core) repos have been updated to reference [.NET Core 3.1](https://devblogs.microsoft.com/dotnet/announcing-net-core-3-1/).\r\n\r\n## Discussion\r\n \r\nYou can share your thoughts on this change or see what others are saying at:\r\n \r\n* [dotnet/dotnet-docker#1337](https://github.com/dotnet/dotnet-docker/issues/1511)\r\n\r\n## Details\r\n\r\n* [dotnet-docker#1509](https://github.com/dotnet/dotnet-docker/pull/1509)\r\n\r\nThe `latest` tags for the [dotnet/core](https://hub.docker.com/_/microsoft-dotnet-core) repos are always intended to reference the latest supported version of .NET Core.

I understand this would be a breaking change so probably this issue will get closed but perhaps someone will find this helpful in future.\r\n\r\nExecution of the following code results in incorrect XML and consequently deserialization exception:\r\n\r\n```\r\npublic class Foo\r\n{\r\n    [XmlAttribute(\"bar\")]\r\n    public string Bar { get; set; } = new string(new[]\r\n    {\r\n        '\\u201A', // ‚ replaced with 44 ,\r\n        '\\u2018', // ‘ replaced with 39 '\r\n        '\\u201E', // „ replaced with 34 \"\r\n        '\\u201C'  // “ replaced with 34 \"\r\n    });\r\n}\r\n\r\nvar iso88591 = Encoding.GetEncoding(\"ISO-8859-1\");\r\nvar ms = new MemoryStream();\r\nvar sw = new StreamWriter(ms, iso88591);\r\nvar sr = new StreamReader(ms, iso88591);\r\nvar serializer = new XmlSerializer(typeof(Foo));\r\n\r\nserializer.Serialize(sw, new Foo());\r\nvar charPreview = iso88591.GetString(ms.GetBuffer()).ToCharArray();\r\nms.Position = 0;\r\nserializer.Deserialize(sr); //fails due containing extra quotation marks\r\n```\r\n\r\nThe workaround would be to use Serialize method overload accepting XmlWriter e.g.:\r\n```\r\nvar xmlWriter = XmlWriter.Create(ms, new XmlWriterSettings() { Encoding = iso88591 });\r\nserializer.Serialize(xmlWriter, new Foo());\r\n```"},{"Id":"11231126727","Type":"IssuesEvent","CreatedAt":"2020-01-08T18:58:03","Actor":"GrabYourPitchforks","Repository":"dotnet/corefx","Organization":"dotnet","RawContent":null,"RelatedAction":"closed","RelatedUrl":"https://github.com/dotnet/corefx/issues/36133","RelatedDescription":"Closed issue \"API proposal: MemoryMarshal.GetRawArrayData\" (#36133) at dotnet/corefx","RelatedBody":"(Related to https://github.com/dotnet/corefx/issues/33706, but more narrowly scoped.)\r\n\r\n### Proposal\r\n\r\n```cs\r\nnamespace System.Runtime.InteropServices\r\n{\r\n    public static class MemoryMarshal\r\n    {\r\n        // new method on existing MemoryMarshal type\r\n        public static ref T GetRawArrayRef<T>(T[] array);\r\n    }\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\n### Motivation\r\n\r\nPer the feedback at https://github.com/dotnet/corefx/issues/33706#issuecomment-442145588, third-party libraries may want to perform certain optimizations that today can only be performed within coreclr itself because we know the internal layout of SzArray instances.\r\n\r\n### Behavior\r\n\r\nIf _array_ is null, this results in a standard `NullReferenceException` (see https://github.com/dotnet/corefx/issues/36133#issuecomment-474389127). Otherwise it returns a reference to the element at index 0 in the array, __even if the array is empty__.\r\n\r\nPer [ECMA-335 (PDF)](https://www.ecma-international.org/publications/files/ECMA-ST/ECMA-335.pdf), § II.14.4.2, it is legal for a managed pointer (type _T&_) to point just past the end of an array to where the next value would have been stored. Such _T&_ cannot be safely dereferenced, but it is guaranteed to be tracked properly by the GC, and it can be used as an input argument in binary operators like `add` or `clt`.\r\n\r\nBecause it is possible to get a real GC-tracked managed pointer (_T&_), but because we cannot guarantee that it's safe to dereference, the `GetRawArrayData` method belongs on `MemoryMarshal` or some other \"unsafe\" type. The `Unsafe` static class is also a candidate for where this API can live, but it does not have any existing API surface for dealing with `T[]` inputs.\r\n\r\nDevelopers who want a _T&_ that's always safe to dereference can continue to use the standard syntax for getting a reference to the first array element:\r\n\r\n```cs\r\nref T myRef = ref theArray[0]; // runtime will bounds check for you\r\n```"}],"ResultType":"GitHubEvent"},"Roslyn":{"Events":[{"Id":"11234271059","Type":"IssuesEvent","CreatedAt":"2020-01-09T04:30:47","Actor":"rog1039","Repository":"dotnet/roslyn","Organization":"dotnet","RawContent":null,"RelatedAction":"opened","RelatedUrl":"https://github.com/dotnet/roslyn/issues/40841","RelatedDescription":"Opened issue \"Missing Core Assembly on TypeSymbols (MissingCorLibrarySymbol and TopLevel)\" (#40841) at dotnet/roslyn","RelatedBody":"**Version Used**: \r\n3.4.0.0\r\n\r\n**Steps to Reproduce**:\r\n\r\nI have a repository with two solutions that illustrates the problem. \r\nRepository is [here](https://github.com/rog1039/RoslynQuestion).\r\n* RoslynTestSolution.sln - this is the code I wish to analyze with Roslyn\r\n* RoslynAnalysis.sln - contains the code that uses Roslyn to analyze RoslynTestSolution.sln\r\n\r\nThe analysis solution contains two xUnit test cases which show the problem. The output from the test is below:\r\n\r\nThe test solution has two projects:\r\n* Project1\r\n* Project2\r\n\r\nEach project has a class, Class1 and Class2 respectively. Each class has a single int property called Id1 and Id2 respectively. When examining the IPropertySymbol of the two properties, the `Type` properties are different. In `Class1.Id1`, the type property is an instance of `PENamedTypeSymbolNonGeneric` whereas for `Class2.Id2` the Type property is an instance of `TopLevel` which has a containing assembly of `<Missing Core Assembly>`.\r\n\r\nThere is a project reference from Project2 to Project1. Interestingly, I do not get the 'missing core assembly' issue if I remove that project reference.\r\n\r\n\r\n**Expected Behavior**:\r\n\r\n```\r\nProperty Type: int:mscorlib, Version=4.0.0.0, Culture=neutral, PublicKeyToken=b77a5c561934e089      | - Property: Project1.Class1.Id1\r\nProperty Type: int:mscorlib, Version=4.0.0.0, Culture=neutral, PublicKeyToken=b77a5c561934e089      | - Property: Project2.Class2.Id2\r\n```\r\n\r\n**Actual Behavior**:\r\n\r\n```\r\nProperty Type: int:mscorlib, Version=4.0.0.0, Culture=neutral, PublicKeyToken=b77a5c561934e089      | - Property: Project1.Class1.Id1\r\nProperty Type: int:<Missing Core Assembly>, Version=0.0.0.0, Culture=neutral, PublicKeyToken=null   | - Property: Project2.Class2.Id2\r\n```\r\n\r\nSo it is not clear to me why the Id2 property in the second project does not resolve properly, but it does on the first project. Am I doing something wrong here?\r\n\r\nI also have tried two different ways of retrieving the semantic model. Each way is a separate unit test. However, they give the same result. So as a second question, is there any reason to prefer either \r\n```csharp\r\nvar projectCompilation = await project.GetCompilationAsync();\r\nvar semanticModel = projectCompilation.GetSemanticModel(syntaxTree);\r\n```\r\nor\r\n```csharp\r\n//Never called await project.GetCompilationAsync(); in this example\r\nvar semanticModel = document.GetSemanticModelAsync();\r\n```\r\nover the other?"},{"Id":"11234079178","Type":"PullRequestEvent","CreatedAt":"2020-01-09T03:43:49","Actor":"chsienki","Repository":"dotnet/roslyn","Organization":"dotnet","RawContent":null,"RelatedAction":"opened","RelatedUrl":"https://github.com/dotnet/roslyn/pull/40840","RelatedDescription":"Opened pull request \"Revert \"Consume centrally trained optprof data\"\" (#40840) at dotnet/roslyn","RelatedBody":"Reverts dotnet/roslyn#40510\r\n\r\nSo close, so far.

This occurs when testing the 3.1 tag, testing 2.1 works fine.\r\n\r\nAt first was seeing similar errors as https://github.com/dotnet/coreclr/issues/27725 when testing coreclr on amazon linux and ended up importing a patch based on https://github.com/dotnet/coreclr/pull/27815.\r\n\r\nNow I am seeing the following error:\r\n\r\n```\r\n/build/coreclr/tests/tests.targets(19,5): error :  The wrappers must be compiled and placed at /build/coreclr/tests/../bin/tests/Linux.x64.Release/tests/\\*\\ before they can be run, Do a clean Test Run [/build/coreclr/tests/runtest.proj]\r\n```\r\n\r\n\r\nWhen running:\r\n\r\n```\r\ntests/runtest.sh     \r\n--testRootDir=/build/coreclr/bin/tests/Linux.x64.Release     \r\n--testNativeBinDir=/build/coreclr/bin/obj/Linux.x64.Release/tests     \r\n--coreClrBinDir=/build/coreclr/bin/Product/Linux.x64.Release     \r\n--mscorlibDir=/build/coreclr/bin/Product/Linux.x64.Release     \r\n--coreFxBinDir=/build/corefx/bin/runtime/netcoreapp-Linux-Release-x64 \r\nrelease\r\n```\r\n\r\nI have been pulling my hairs on what is going on here, I can build/test 2.1 properly, but can't figure out what changed with 3.1. It looks like a path issue but I don't see where the hiccup occurs.\r\n\r\n\r\nAny thoughts @jashook?

https://github.com/dotnet/corefx/issues/42192\r\n\r\n### Summary\r\nOn RHEL 8, some time zones (specifically `Africa/Casablanca`) stop supporting daylight savings transitions because of a change in the tzdata files.\r\n\r\n### Customer Impact\r\nApplications getting time zone information on RedHat 8 (and potentially other Unix distros if using the same tzdata version) stop working with daylight savings time for `Africa/Casablanca` time zone.\r\n\r\nThis change allows `TimeZoneInfo` to work correctly for all the daylight savings transitions in the tzdata file, and it skips the \"future\" daylight savings template if we can't support it.\r\n\r\n### Regression?\r\nFor a user it is a regression when updating to RHEL 8 because of the change in the tzdata in the OS. Our code didn't regress here - we never supported this format before now and were always throwing an exception. This is the first time we've hit it in the real-world.\r\n\r\n### Testing\r\nI ran all the TimeZoneInfo tests on RHEL 8. They failed for `Africa/Casablanca` before this change, and now pass afterward.\r\n\r\n### Risk\r\n**Low**: The change is isolated to a non-supported format that would cause DST to completely stop working before. Now we are allowing the other DST information to work, while skipping the unsupported future dates.\r\n\r\ncc: @danmosemsft @tarekgh @ericstj \r\n\r\n____\r\n\r\n\r\nIsDaylightSavingTime_CasablancaMultiYearDaylightSavings fails on rhel.8\r\n\r\nWhen parsing the tzdata POSIX string that contains an 'n' Julian date, we are currently throwing an exception, and then falling back to a TimeZoneInfo without DST enabled. However, this is a mistake because there are other DST transitions that were read from the tzdata file that are valid and usable. We shouldn't be throwing that information away.\r\n\r\nSo instead, we now skip the POSIX string if we detect an unsupported 'n' Julian date, and just use the last transition as the AdjustmentRule for all the DateTimes in the future. This way we can still make DST determinations correctly for some DateTimes.\r\n\r\nFix https://github.com/dotnet/corefx/issues/42192","Url":"https://github.com/dotnet/coreclr/pull/27969","RelatedDescription":"Open PR \"[release/3.1] Stop throwing exception in TimeZoneInfo POSIX parsing\" (#27969)"},{"Id":"535533061","IsPullRequest":false,"CreatedAt":"2019-12-10T14:47:07","Actor":"NMSAzulX","Number":"27968","RawContent":null,"Title":"How do I write code that allows a method to use Calli instructions at run time?

The intention of it is to be interchangeable with regular Dictionary implementations -- where, we always use the interface IDictionary<T, T> to interact with either.  Both Dictionary and ConcurrentDictionary implement IDictionary interface members.\r\n\r\nThe class looks like this:\r\n\r\n\r\n    public class CaseInsensitiveDictionary<TValue>\r\n        : ConcurrentDictionary<string, TValue>\r\n    {\r\n        public CaseInsensitiveDictionary()\r\n            : base(StringComparer.InvariantCultureIgnoreCase)\r\n        {\r\n        }\r\n\r\n        private CaseInsensitiveDictionary(IDictionary<string, TValue> attributes)\r\n            : this()\r\n        {\r\n            AddRange(attributes);\r\n        }\r\n\r\n        public void Add(string key, TValue value)\r\n        {\r\n            this.TryAdd(key, value);\r\n        }\r\n\r\n        public void AddRange(IDictionary<string, TValue> entries)\r\n        {\r\n            foreach (var item in entries)\r\n            {\r\n                this.TryAdd(item.Key, item.Value);\r\n            }\r\n        }\r\n\r\n        public static CaseInsensitiveDictionary<TValue> Create(IDictionary<string, TValue> attributes = null)\r\n        {\r\n            if (attributes == null)\r\n            {\r\n                return new CaseInsensitiveDictionary<TValue>();\r\n            }\r\n            return new CaseInsensitiveDictionary<TValue>(attributes);\r\n        }\r\n\r\n        public static implicit operator Dictionary<string, TValue>(CaseInsensitiveDictionary<TValue> data)\r\n        {\r\n            return new Dictionary<string, TValue>(data);\r\n        }\r\n\r\n        public static implicit operator CaseInsensitiveDictionary<TValue>(Dictionary<string, TValue> data)\r\n        {\r\n            return Create(data);\r\n        }\r\n\r\n    }\r\n\r\n\r\n`  \r\n\r\n\r\nLet's say then that we are trying to implicitly convert the ConcurrentDictionary to and from a dictionary.  To test, I wrote these methods:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n        public void FromDictionaryToCaseInsensitiveDictionaryTest()\r\n        {\r\n\r\n            Dictionary<string, string> dc2 = new Dictionary<string, string>();\r\n            dc2.Add(\"test1\", \"test1 value\");\r\n\r\n            var dc3 = (CaseInsensitiveDictionary<string>)dc2;\r\n            Console.WriteLine(\"FromDictionaryToCaseInsensitiveDictionaryTest success\");\r\n        }\r\n\r\n        public void FromIDictionaryToCaseInsensitiveDictionaryTest()\r\n        {\r\n            IDictionary<string, string> dc2 = new Dictionary<string, string>();\r\n            dc2.Add(\"test1\", \"test1 value\");\r\n\r\n            var dc3 = (CaseInsensitiveDictionary<string>)dc2;\r\n\r\n            Console.WriteLine(\"FromIDictionaryToCaseInsensitiveDictionaryTest success\");\r\n        }\r\n\r\n\r\n        public void FromCaseInsensitiveDictionaryToDictionaryTest()\r\n        {\r\n\r\n            var dc2 = new CaseInsensitiveDictionary<string>();\r\n            dc2.Add(\"test1\", \"test1 value\");\r\n\r\n            var dc3 = (Dictionary<string, string>)dc2;\r\n\r\n            Console.WriteLine(\"FromCaseInsensitiveDictionaryToDictionaryTest success\");\r\n\r\n        }\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe first (FromDictionaryToCaseInsensitiveDictionaryTest) and third methods (FromCaseInsensitiveDictionaryToDictionaryTest) work fine and correctly use the operators.\r\n\r\nThe second one fails with this exception: System.InvalidCastException: 'Unable to cast object of type 'System.Collections.Generic.Dictionary`2[System.String,System.String]' to type 'OpenToken.CaseInsensitiveDictionary`1[System.String]'.'\r\n.  In my opinion, FromIDictionaryToCaseInsensitiveDictionaryTest should work because the type is CaseInsensitiveDictionary and implements IDictionary.  If I do NOT have the first conversion operator, the first test method fails with this exact same error message, \r\n\r\nWith this evidence, it seems to me that something is missing when the runtime is looking for the appropriate operator.  FromIDictionaryToCaseInsensitiveDictionaryTest should work either from the Dictionary operator or automatically work because it implements the IDictionary interface.  (I cannot create an operator for IDictionary conversion because that is illegal).  \r\n\r\nPlease let me know if this is expected behavior and if there is some workaround for it.  This issue seems to be present in all versions of C#.\r\n\r\nThanks!\r\n\r\n","Url":"https://github.com/dotnet/standard/issues/1659","RelatedDescription":"Closed issue \"Generic class operators derived from interface seems broken\" (#1659)"},{"Id":"526765953","IsPullRequest":false,"CreatedAt":"2019-11-25T02:23:45","Actor":"arizvisa","Number":"1657","RawContent":null,"Title":"packages.microsoft.com: signature check for netstandard-targeting-pack-2.1.0 failed","State":"closed","Body":"Hey guys, the signature check for this package seems to be failing.

this is the code I wish to analyze with Roslyn\r\n* RoslynAnalysis.sln - contains the code that uses Roslyn to analyze RoslynTestSolution.sln\r\n\r\nThe analysis solution contains two xUnit test cases which show the problem. The output from the test is below:\r\n\r\nThe test solution has two projects:\r\n* Project1\r\n* Project2\r\n\r\nEach project has a class, Class1 and Class2 respectively. Each class has a single int property called Id1 and Id2 respectively. When examining the IPropertySymbol of the two properties, the `Type` properties are different. In `Class1.Id1`, the type property is an instance of `PENamedTypeSymbolNonGeneric` whereas for `Class2.Id2` the Type property is an instance of `TopLevel` which has a containing assembly of `<Missing Core Assembly>`.\r\n\r\nThere is a project reference from Project2 to Project1. Interestingly, I do not get the 'missing core assembly' issue if I remove that project reference.\r\n\r\n\r\n**Expected Behavior**:\r\n\r\n```\r\nProperty Type: int:mscorlib, Version=4.0.0.0, Culture=neutral, PublicKeyToken=b77a5c561934e089      | - Property: Project1.Class1.Id1\r\nProperty Type: int:mscorlib, Version=4.0.0.0, Culture=neutral, PublicKeyToken=b77a5c561934e089      | - Property: Project2.Class2.Id2\r\n```\r\n\r\n**Actual Behavior**:\r\n\r\n```\r\nProperty Type: int:mscorlib, Version=4.0.0.0, Culture=neutral, PublicKeyToken=b77a5c561934e089      | - Property: Project1.Class1.Id1\r\nProperty Type: int:<Missing Core Assembly>, Version=0.0.0.0, Culture=neutral, PublicKeyToken=null   | - Property: Project2.Class2.Id2\r\n```\r\n\r\nSo it is not clear to me why the Id2 property in the second project does not resolve properly, but it does on the first project. Am I doing something wrong here?\r\n\r\nI also have tried two different ways of retrieving the semantic model. Each way is a separate unit test. However, they give the same result. So as a second question, is there any reason to prefer either \r\n```csharp\r\nvar projectCompilation = await project.GetCompilationAsync();\r\nvar semanticModel = projectCompilation.GetSemanticModel(syntaxTree);\r\n```\r\nor\r\n```csharp\r\n//Never called await project.GetCompilationAsync(); in this example\r\nvar semanticModel = document.GetSemanticModelAsync();\r\n```\r\nover the other?","Url":"https://github.com/dotnet/roslyn/issues/40841","RelatedDescription":"Open issue \"Missing Core Assembly on TypeSymbols (MissingCorLibrarySymbol and TopLevel)\" (#40841)"},{"Id":"547230011","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2020-01-09T03:43:48","Actor":"chsienki","Number":"40840","RawContent":null,"Title":"Revert \"Consume centrally trained optprof data\"","State":"open","Body":"Reverts dotnet/roslyn#40510\r\n\r\nSo close, so far.

Looks like something went really wrong with the type system and I'd be really curious to know what's going on.\r\nI've personally worked around the issue by just going back to non-pooled arrays in this case, but still this issue was so strange that I though it'd be interesting to share 😄\r\n\r\nHere's a screen:\r\n\r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/10199417/71695441-6cbd5f00-2db2-11ea-9ab3-10ad502e1faf.png)\r\n\r\nYou can see that `T[] newItems` array is in fact a single `T` element, and not an array at all.\r\n\r\nHere's another screen, where I've also added `.GetType()` on the second array just to double check:\r\n\r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/10199417/71695493-95ddef80-2db2-11ea-8964-e6d6d094513f.png)\r\n\r\nHere's the source code of that `Pool<T>` class I'm using: https://gist.github.com/Sergio0694/9a08161830fbcebf26e1973ad2a51cea.\r\n\r\nI've created a repro branch in my repo and I have steps that seem to reproduce the crash reliably, so I'd be happy to give access to the repo to anyone from the team, if you guys want to investigate this.\r\n\r\nThank you for your time, and happy new year to the whole team! 🎉","Url":"https://github.com/dotnet/corert/issues/7936","RelatedDescription":"Closed issue \"ArrayPool<T> returning a single T item (!) as a T[] reference [UWP]\" (#7936)"},{"Id":"544371019","IsPullRequest":false,"CreatedAt":"2020-01-01T15:43:28","Actor":"yowl","Number":"7935","RawContent":null,"Title":"Wasm: Question on type of return values from shared generic calls","State":"open","Body":"As an example, take\r\nhttps://github.com/dotnet/corert/blob/88d75715f4c84c383365a33734d6f0cffe837061/src/System.Private.CoreLib/shared/System/Threading/WaitHandle.cs#L295\r\n\r\nThe second call parameter `safeWaitHandles` is an implicit op to a `Span<SafeWaitHandle?>` from its declaration\r\n```\r\nSafeWaitHandle?[]? safeWaitHandles = RentSafeWaitHandleArray(waitHandles.Length);\r\n```\r\n This implicit method  is a shared generic method so the call in LLVM looks like\r\n\r\n```\r\n%45 = call %\"[S.P.CoreLib]System.Span`1<System.__Canon>\" @\"S_P_CoreLib_System_Span_1<System___Canon>__op_Implicit\"(i8* %43, i8* %CastPtr163)\r\n```\r\nWhere the return is the Canon type, `[S.P.CoreLib]System.Span`1<System.__Canon>`\r\n\r\nThis is not a valid type to pass into `ObtainSafeWaitHandles` as in LLVM that is defined on the concrete type\r\n\r\n```\r\ndefine void @S_P_CoreLib_System_Threading_WaitHandle__ObtainSafeWaitHandles(i8*, %\"[S.P.CoreLib]System.ReadOnlySpan`1<System.Threading.WaitHandle>\", %\"[S.P.CoreLib]System.Span`1<Microsoft.Win32.SafeHandles.SafeWaitHandle>\", %\"[S.P.CoreLib]System.Span`1<native int>\")\r\n```\r\n\r\nWhat would be the right way to solve this?

Originally since the C++ signature uses `const&` (we just want to pass the struct by pointer/reference from C++ to C# as a view over read-only memory) we used `in` instead of `ref` for the `I420AVideoFrame` parameter, but this yields an error during the .NET Native build (and works with JIT):\r\n```\r\nerror : ILT0021: Could not resolve method 'EETypeRva:0x--------'\r\n```\r\n\r\nThis seems to be the error defined in `RuntimeTypeHandle.cs`, which is worryingly marked as \"last resort\" in comment, although I would expect there should be some metadata available for that method:\r\nhttps://github.com/dotnet/corert/blob/e2c4bc3d7889f951c231d7f131d6a7e20c034fb6/src/System.Private.CoreLib/src/System/RuntimeTypeHandle.cs#L134\r\n\r\nNote that we had to manually define the `MonoPInvokeCallback` attribute which seems to be required for working with Unity's IL2CPP, so we copied a definition from the Mono project:\r\n```cs\r\n[AttributeUsage(AttributeTargets.Method)]\r\nsealed class MonoPInvokeCallbackAttribute : Attribute\r\n{\r\n    public MonoPInvokeCallbackAttribute(Type t) { }\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nIs there any reason `ref` works and not `in` in this context? I assume that by using `ref` we expose ourselves to bugs where the C# code inadvertently modifying the struct would produce some side effect on the C++ side which the C++ compiler did not intend to see (since the parameter is `const&` there), which could lead to bugs, so the current workaround with `ref` is not ideal.","Url":"https://github.com/dotnet/corert/issues/7917","RelatedDescription":"Closed issue \"Build error for reverse P/Invoke with ref struct parameter (ref vs. in)\" (#7917)"},{"Id":"538560233","IsPullRequest":false,"CreatedAt":"2019-12-16T18:08:01","Actor":"lifecoder-phoenix","Number":"7919","RawContent":null,"Title":"Native dll with async","State":"closed","Body":"Hello,\r\nI'm actually wondering how dll compiled to native would behave if I expose an async task and call it from a C++ program.

LTS releases are stable release which receive critical updates and are supported for at least three years. Current releases can include new features that may undergo future change based on feedback. Current releases are supported for three months after the subsequent .NET Core major or minor release. Both LTS and Current releases receive critical fixes throughout their lifecycle, for security, reliability, or to add support for new operating system versions. You must stay up-to-date with the latest patches to qualify for support. \r\n\r\n[.NET Core 2.2](https://devblogs.microsoft.com/dotnet/announcing-net-core-2-2/) was released in December 2018 as a Current release. Per the lifecycle policy, Current releases reach end of life 3 months after a subsequent release (Current or LTS). **.NET Core 3.0** released in **September 2019** and began the end of life countdown for .NET Core 2.2 that concluded on December 23, 2019. \r\n\r\n## .NET Core 2.2 Downloads\r\n\r\n.NET Core 2.2 installers, zips and tar.gzs will remain available, but unsupported. This includes existing releases available on Linux package feeds. Previous versions, including 2.2, will be accessible through the [Download Archives](https://www.microsoft.com/net/download/archives). \r\n\r\n## Policy Information\r\n\r\nAdditional lifecycle and support details  and background can be seen in the following:\r\n\r\n* [.NET Core Support Lifecycle](https://www.microsoft.com/net/platform/support-policy)\r\n* [Microsoft Support for .NET Core](https://github.com/dotnet/core/blob/master/microsoft-support.md)\r\n* [.NET Core OS Lifecycle Policy](https://github.com/dotnet/core/blob/master/os-lifecycle-policy.md)\r\n* [Support and Versioning](https://blogs.msdn.microsoft.com/dotnet/2016/07/26/net-support-and-versioning/)\r\n","Url":"https://github.com/dotnet/announcements/issues/147","RelatedDescription":"Open issue \".NET Core 2.2 has reached end of life\" (#147)"},{"Id":"541189878","IsPullRequest":false,"CreatedAt":"2019-12-20T20:42:33","Actor":"vivmishra","Number":"146","RawContent":null,"Title":"Announcing Availability of Localized IntelliSense for .NET Core 3.0 and 3.1","State":"open","Body":"This week we released localized [IntelliSense](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/visualstudio/ide/using-intellisense?view=vs-2019) files for .NET Core 3.0 and 3.1, in following 10 Visual Studio supported languages: \r\n- Brazilian Portuguese\r\n- Chinese (simplified)\r\n- Chinese (traditional)\r\n- French\r\n- German\r\n- Italian\r\n- Japanese\r\n- Korean\t\r\n- Russian\r\n- Spanish\r\n\r\nThe files (in zip archives) are available for download from [**Download localized .NET Core IntelliSense files**](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/download/dotnet-core/intellisense).\r\n\r\n * [Checksums for 3.0 zip files](https://dotnetcli.blob.core.windows.net/dotnet/checksums/3.0.0-intellisense-sha.txt)\r\n * [Checksums for 3.1 zip files](https://dotnetcli.blob.core.windows.net/dotnet/checksums/3.1.0-intellisense-sha.txt)\r\n\r\nYou can see [the .NET Core Guide](https://aka.ms/dotnet-core-intellisense) for instructions on how to use these files with Visual Studio.\r\n\r\nBy default, when you're developing .NET Core projects, the SDK only includes the English version of the IntelliSense files. But now you can enhance your localized Visual Studio development experience by adding the localized IntelliSense files from the download site into your local development environment.\r\n\r\nLastly, with this release we have made the localized IntelliSense available as zip archives that does require you to manually extract and copy the files to respective SDK install folders.

This means some folks will lose their Collaborator badge and the ability to interact with the CI system.*\r\n\r\nOver the years, we’ve added a bunch of folks as collaborators with read permissions to our public repos. The rationale was that we wanted to be able to assign issues to community members because GitHub only allowed assigning issues to users with an explicit permission grant for the repository. However, they changed this in [June 2019](https://github.blog/2019-06-25-assign-issues-to-issue-commenters/). Now, we can assign issues to all users with explicit permissions as well as to users that have commented on the specific issue.\r\n\r\nAlso, we recently started to audit and tighten the permissions for our organizations. As a result, it became clear that large number of repo-specific permission grants are hard to review and audit. Internally, our goal is to grant all permissions via teams instead.\r\n\r\nHence, we plan to remove all collaborators from public repos that only have read permissions (folks with triage permissions will remain). The full list of affected repos is listed below.\r\n\r\nThis shouldn’t impact your ability to work with us, but losing explicit read-only has the following implications:\r\n\r\n-   **You’ll lose the collaborator badge**. We understand that this is visually appealing and for some people it might have been a badge of honor. But given that GitHub also shows a Contributor bade for folks whose PRs got merged, we don’t think it this will be a major take back.    \r\n    ![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/5169960/70491508-43acf580-1ab6-11ea-94df-74ea2dde98b4.png)\r\n\r\n-   ~~**You lose the ability to interact with the CI system**. As a collaborator, you can use comments to [send commands to the CI system](https://github.com/dotnet/runtime/blob/master/docs/project/pullrequest-builds.md). While this can be useful at times, we generally don’t expect (or desire) contributors to do that.

We’ll try to help as many pull requests as possible get merged by then. At that point, if there’s any pull requests still open we’ll have to close them. If you’d still like to continue those pull requests, we’d encourage you to bring them to dotnet/runtime in a new pull request.\r\n\r\nThe repositories themselves will be effectively archived at this point. The state of the “master” branch will be recorded with a tag, named “master-archive”, but the branch itself will be deleted. The default branch for the repositories will be named “archive” and it will be a single commit with a README.md and CONTRIBUTING.md file pointing to our dotnet/runtime repository.\r\n\r\nThe repositories will remain active for servicing changes to .NET Core 3.1 and earlier hence we will not be using the GitHub archive capability. \r\n\r\n### November 22nd\r\nThe dotnet/runtime repository will be made public and available for community contribution. Even though the repository will be created on November 13th it will take several days to get it back into a working order: fixing up our build scripts, recreating our Azure Dev Ops build definitions, etc … Until those tasks are completed it will not be possible to accept pull request and hence the repository will remain private. Once we are in a state that pull requests can be merged again the repository will be made public.\r\n\r\nOur expectation is that will occur on November 22nd. If it is ready sooner it will be made public sooner. If the work takes longer than we planned then we will add an update to this announcement with a new expected date.\r\n\r\n### December 1st-2nd\r\nAll issues, open and closed, will be migrated from corefx, coreclr and core-setup into dotnet/runtime. This will be using GitHub’s existing issue transfer feature in a bulk migration. This means all of the existing issue links will continue to function via redirects.\r\n\r\nThis does mean though that labels will not transfer with the issues. Labels will be re-applied as a post processing step by our engineering team once the issue migration completes.\r\n\r\nEven though our issues won’t be fully migrated until this time we’d like the community to begin filing issues on dotnet/runtime as soon as it’s public rather than continuing to file issues on the original repositories.\r\n\r\n### Migrating Commits\r\nThe dotnet/runtime repository will be a new commit history from the original repositories. We are using this consolidation as an opportunity to clean up our history with the goal of having a cleaner, smaller history as a starting point. This means commits will be rewritten in the following ways as they are migrated to dotnet/runtime:\r\n\r\n1. Author information, contributor information, changed file list and time stamps from the original commit will be preserved.\r\n1. Links to issues, pull requests or commits in the repository using GitHub short links will be rewritten so they continue to point the original repository. \r\n1. Every commit will be appended with a link to the original commit it was mapped from.\r\n\r\nThe actual contents of the commit though will be updated to match the new directory layout of the dotnet/runtime repository.","Url":"https://github.com/dotnet/announcements/issues/133","RelatedDescription":"Open issue \"Repository Consolidation Timeline\" (#133)"},{"Id":"513963125","IsPullRequest":false,"CreatedAt":"2019-10-29T14:32:55","Actor":"mthalman","Number":"132","RawContent":null,"Title":"Release of Alpine 3.10 Docker images","State":"open","Body":"# .NET Core Alpine Docker images updated to Alpine 3.10\r\n\r\nDocker images for .NET Core have been released that support Alpine 3.10.

With [.NET Standard 2.0](https://devblogs.microsoft.com/dotnet/announcing-net-standard-2-0/), we tried to make it much more viable to share code between .NET Framework, .NET Core, and Xamarin which resulted in approximately 38K .NET Frameworks APIs being available in .NET Core 2.0. We also built the [Windows Compatibility Pack](https://devblogs.microsoft.com/dotnet/announcing-the-windows-compatibility-pack-for-net-core/) which made another 21K .NET Framework APIs available to .NET Core, resulting in almost 60K additional APIs. And in .NET Core 3.0 we added WPF and WinForms, which increased the number of .NET Framework APIs ported to .NET Core to over 120k, which is more than half of all .NET Framework APIs.\r\n\r\nIt’s also worth pointing out that we added about 62K APIs to .NET Core that don’t exist in .NET Framework. If we compare their total number of APIs, .NET Core has about 80% of the API surface of .NET Framework.\r\n\r\n<p align=\"center\">\r\n<img src=\"https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/5169960/66777114-f8db7c80-ee7c-11e9-9161-acfe1c491586.png\" width=\"600\" align=\"center\">\r\n</p>\r\n\r\nWe announced that the [future of .NET](https://devblogs.microsoft.com/dotnet/net-core-is-the-future-of-net/) will be based on .NET Core. And at Build 2019, [Scott Hunter stated](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZlO1utbB2GQ&t=54m20s) that AppDomains, remoting, Web Forms, WCF server, and Windows Workflow won’t be ported to .NET Core.\r\n\r\nWith .NET Core 3.0, we’re at the point where we’ve ported all technologies that are required for modern workloads, be that desktop apps, mobile apps, console apps, web sites, or cloud services. That’s not to say that we don’t have any gaps or opportunities for new technologies, but we generally believe we won’t be finding them in the .NET Framework code base anymore. Moving forward, we’re focusing our resources on incorporating new technologies.\r\n\r\nSimultaneously, we’re looking into releasing more of the [.NET Framework code base under the MIT license](https://github.com/microsoft/referencesource) on GitHub to allow the community to create OSS projects for technologies we’re not intending to bring to .NET Core. For example, there already are community projects for [CoreWF](https://github.com/UiPath/corewf) and [CoreWCF](https://github.com/CoreWCF/CoreWCF).\r\n\r\nWe’d like to thank everyone who filed issues with requests for APIs being ported. Those issues allowed us to prioritize and close the gaps that prevented people from porting to .NET Core.\r\n\r\nBut since we generally no longer plan to bring existing technologies from .NET Framework to .NET Core we’ll be closing all issues that are [labeled with port-to-core](https://github.com/dotnet/corefx/issues?utf8=%E2%9C%93&q=is%3Aissue+is%3Aopen+label%3Aport-to-core).\r\n\r\n### Discussion\r\n\r\nTo discuss this issue, please comment on the corresponding issue at https://github.com/dotnet/corefx/issues/41769.","Url":"https://github.com/dotnet/announcements/issues/130","RelatedDescription":"Open issue \".NET Core 3.0 concludes the .NET Framework API porting project\" (#130)"},{"Id":"505445666","IsPullRequest":false,"CreatedAt":"2019-10-10T18:45:56","Actor":"TaraOverfield","Number":"129","RawContent":null,"Title":"October 2019 .NET Updates","State":"open","Body":"The following .NET updates were released on October 2019.

Based on your feedback, we decided to go with **dotnet/runtime** instead of **dotnet/platform** and **dotnet/sdk** instead of **dotnet/cli**.\r\n\r\nSeveral people pointed out that the previous names weren't relatable to how we talk about the product, for example on download pages. So, we decided to match the product distributions as the primary design point for the new names. We generally refer to the bits you need to run your app as *the runtime* and the bits you need to build apps as *the SDK*. This also matches the naming chosen by other platforms.\r\n\r\n### New repos can't be used for .NET Core 3.x or earlier\r\n\r\nThe consolidated repositories are going to be about .NET 5 and going forward. It will not be possible to build .NET Core 3.1 or earlier from these repositories. As such, only the master branch from each of the repositories will be brought forward. There will be no porting of the individual release branches in the source repositories.\r\n\r\n### Personal names and email addresses\r\n\r\nSince we're planning on rebasing the history in the merged repositories, we can map your name and email address to new values as well. We primarily do this to support our friends in the LGBTQ+ community who have changed their names to reflect their identities. However, anybody is welcome to use this to change their email and name.\r\n\r\nWhatever your reason might be: we value your contributions and we hope this small gesture makes your life a little bit better.

However, this separation has led to a variety of complications for contributors and maintainers alike.  For example:\r\n- **Confusion about where issues should be opened.**  It’s not always clear in which repo an issue should be reported, complicated by the fact that some implementations actually span repositories (e.g. a type might be exposed through a reference assembly and have its tests in corefx but actually be implemented in System.Private.CoreLib in coreclr).\r\n- **Difficulty sharing source.**  System.Private.CoreLib is intricately connected to the rest of the runtime, and thus has lived with the runtime code.  That, however, means that although corefx has been intended as the place to share as much core library code as possible across any underlying runtime, we’ve needed to keep a significant body of code in System.Private.CoreLib, which then has meant it’s needed to be “mirrored” to each runtime repo (coreclr, corert, mono) that needs to consume it as source; similarly, corefx has similarly required access to much of that source, for example to use the same interop DllImports that are employed elsewhere in the runtimes.  The automatic mirror that shares this source needs to be maintained, and even when it has been, it’s often led to lag.  It’s also complicated developer processes, where to validate a change in one repo generally requires manually mirroring the code to other local repos in order to validate the change and ensure merging into one repo won’t break the others.\r\n- **PRs spanning multiple repos.**  Because the runtime, CoreLib, and the core libraries are all intricately linked, changing runtime behaviors, adding new APIs, or changing various build processes (e.g. improving static analysis) often requires multiple PRs carefully staged across time and multiple repos.  For example, to add a new method to a type like Dictionary<>, a developer must first make the source changes in her local coreclr repo and the test and reference assembly changes in her local corefx repo.  When satisfied with the fix, the developer must submit a PR to coreclr as well as a PR to corefx, the latter of which will fail.  Eventually the coreclr PR will be merged, and the changes will mirror to the other runtimes that also require the update.  Eventually those mirror PRs will be merged, and builds will be created containing the fix for each runtime.  At some point later those builds will be consumed into the corefx repo, after which point the original corefx PR can be re-validated and eventually merged.  That’s the best case; things get more complicated in situations where there are bidirectional dependencies.\r\n- **Building an installable runtime.** Self-hosting a custom built .NET requires intricate knowledge of how all the repos work and interact.  A developer can’t just clone a single repo, make a desired change, and easily produce an installer.\r\n- **Consistency.**  One goal we had for more fine-grained repos was to enable isolation and independence for teams working within each repo’s confines, but this has led to non-trivial duplication of effort on things like build systems and CI, and then the resulting lack of consistency as each system ends up diverging from the others.\r\n\r\nThe issues go beyond the runtime.  For example, the ASP.NET maintainers and community did a great job in the past year or so consolidating from ~55 repos down to ~5 repos, but that’s still more repos than is desirable, leading to similar issues as cited above for the runtime.  On top of that, these ASP.NET repositories are in the aspnet GitHub org, which adds an additional set of issues, for example:\r\n- **Complications moving issues between repos.**  If a developer opens an issue in aspnet/aspnetcore and it’s determined that the cause of the issue is actually in dotnet/corefx, there is no GitHub mechanism to enable easily moving that issue across the aspnet to dotnet organizational boundary.\r\n- **Permissions.** Each organization’s permissions end up needing to be managed and maintained separately.\r\n\r\nThe issues extend into tooling as well.  For example, we currently have multiple repositories that all logically make up the dotnet CLI, but actually creating a working installer spans multiple repos.\r\n\r\n### Plan\r\n\r\nTo address these issues, we’re planning to make some changes to our repository structure:\r\n- **dotnet/platform.**  We plan to combine dotnet/coreclr, dotnet/corefx, dotnet/corert, dotnet/core-setup, and the relevant portions of mono/mono into a new dotnet/platform repo.  Everything needed to build and produce the Microsoft.NETCore.App shared framework will be in this repo.  We will no longer suffer from the complications of source mirroring.  Features like changing runtime behavior or adding an API will no longer require a complicated dance across multiple repos.  Etc.\r\n- **dotnet/aspnetcore.**  We plan to move the existing aspnet/aspnetcore repository into the dotnet organization.  Along with that, we aim to combine a variety of the other aspnet repositories into aspnetcore, such as aspnet/blazor.  Whether repos like entityframeworkcore remain separate or combined remains an open question.  A goal is that, just as dotnet/platform will be responsible for the creation of Microsoft.NETCore.App, dotnet/aspnetcore will be responsible for the creation of Microsoft.AspNETCore.App.\r\n- **dotnet/cli.**  We plan to combine dotnet/toolset and dotnet/sdk into the dotnet/cli repo.\r\n\r\n### FAQ\r\n\r\n#### Why are we merging repos?\r\n\r\nWe believe we can significantly improve several aspects of .NET on GitHub by combining repos, benefiting both maintainers and contributors.  These improvements will manifest in a variety of ways, such as in better issue management, much easier models of contribution, and easier and faster ways to build and install the resulting bits.\r\n\r\n####  What will happen to the aspnet org?\r\n\r\nThe aspnet org as a separate entity is legacy and artificial.  In time we hope to absorb it into the dotnet org and sunset the aspnet org.\r\n\r\n#### Will the coreclr and corefx repos go away?\r\n\r\nWith the help of GitHub, we plan to migrate all issues from these repos to the new dotnet/platform repo, and then lock down creation of additional issues, such that the repos will no longer be used for issue management.  We will also inhibit the creation of PRs to the master branch, which will effectively become an archive for read-only review of history.  In this sense, these repos will be archived, and no active development will happen with them.  However, we plan to continue servicing previous .NET Core releases out of these repos, so the various release branches (e.g. release/2.1, release/3.0, etc.) will continue to see (limited) activity.\r\n\r\n#### Will the mono repo go away?\r\n\r\nNo. mono/mono contains the source for the full mono stack and will continue to live on happily.  We will simply be moving the managed source associated with System.Private.CoreLib and copying the relatively small amount of source that makes up the native mono runtime to dotnet/platform.  We may choose to then use some mirroring technology to keep the runtime copy in sync (this will, however, not suffer from the same mirroring issues we currently experience, as we would not be mirroring between two components required to build the same binaries), or we may choose to let them diverge and manually sync only those changes deemed relevant to both implementations.\r\n\r\n#### Will the corert repo go away?\r\n\r\nYes.  We plan to retire/archive the corert repo.  Some of the technology in the corert repo will be migrated to the master branch of dotnet/platform, where it will be productized as part of .NET.  Other portions of the corert repo will be migrated to feature branches of dotnet/platform, where the experimentation can continue.  In this way, we will use feature branches to continue experimenting with the corert technology, while making it easier to share portions with its shipping counterpart and also graduate functionality into master if/when it’s ready.\r\n\r\n#### Does this mean there will be a single repo for all of .NET?\r\n\r\nNo.  We will be reducing the number of repos that contribute to .NET, but currently we do not believe that going all the way down to one is the right answer.\r\n\r\n#### Doesn’t this mean that issue and PR tracking will now be overwhelming?\r\n\r\nIt is already the case that the vast majority of issues in a given repo are not relevant to any individual developer, and with several thousand open issues in each repo and on the order of a hundred open PRs in each, we already need systems (e.g. labels) to successfully manage issues and PRs.  As such, we don’t believe the merging will have a significant impact on this aspect of developer productivity.  If it turns out to have an unexpectedly large negative impact, we will work with the community to find ways to mitigate the problem.  However, there are already a multitude of successful open source projects on GitHub with at least an order of magnitude more issues.\r\n\r\n#### What will happen to existing issues?\r\n\r\nWith the help of GitHub functionality, we plan to migrate all issues from old repos (e.g. dotnet/coreclr, dotnet/corefx) to the new repos (e.g. dotnet/platform).  We may also use this as a forcing function to revisit stale issues and either close those that are no longer relevant or reinvigorate those that are demanding of more immediate attention.\r\n\r\n#### What about git history?\r\n\r\nIn general, we plan to keep history, such that history from each constituent repo will be a part of the new repo.  However, we have made some mistakes in the past (e.g. large binaries, multitudes of automated PRs for flowing bits and source between repos, etc.), and we plan to rewrite history to correct those mistakes wherever possible and impactful.  Some rough calculations suggest this could end up significantly reducing the size of the repos as well as the time it takes to clone, which should not only help developers approaching the project but also CI.  This will end up meaning that SHAs may be different in the new repo than they were in the old repo; as previously mentioned, however, any references to the old SHAs in the old repos will continue to work, as those repos will remain accessible.\r\n\r\n#### Will I still show up in the contributor list due to previous contributions?\r\n\r\nYes.  We plan to merge all such history.\r\n\r\n#### Will this break debugging with SourceLink?\r\n\r\nNo.  The existing repos will continue to be accessible, and commit SHAs there will remain unchanged.\r\n\r\n#### Might plans change?\r\n\r\nSure.  Part of the goal of posting this announcement is to hear from you, hear about additional benefits you're excited about, and hear about additional concerns we may not have considered.  We will include such ideas in our planning and course correct as necessary.\r\n\r\n## Discussion\r\n\r\nTo discuss these plans, please comment on the corresponding issue at https://github.com/dotnet/coreclr/issues/26175.\r\n","Url":"https://github.com/dotnet/announcements/issues/119","RelatedDescription":"Open issue \"Consolidating .NET GitHub repos\" (#119)"},{"Id":"470434872","IsPullRequest":false,"CreatedAt":"2019-07-19T16:54:02","Actor":"richlander","Number":"118","RawContent":null,"Title":".NET Core master branches have switched to \"5.0\"","State":"open","Body":"# .NET Core master branches have switched to \"5.0\"\r\n\r\nVarious .NET Core repos have switched their `master` branches to \"5.0\", and will use 3.x branches for 3.0 and 3.1 projects.

Otherwise, we recommend that you wait for the 5.0 Preview releases before installing this new version.\r\n\r\n## Discussion\r\nPlease share your thoughts on this change and see what others are saying at:\r\n\r\n[dotnet/core #3059](https://github.com/dotnet/core/issues/3059)\r\n\r\n## Details\r\n\r\nThe following repos have moved their master branches to \"5.0\":\r\n\r\n- [dotnet/coreclr](https://github.com/dotnet/coreclr)\r\n- [dotnet/corefx](https://github.com/dotnet/corefx)\r\n- [dotnet/core-setup](https://github.com/dotnet/core-setup)\r\n\r\nYou can see that [5.0 .NET Core Runtime builds](https://github.com/dotnet/core-setup#daily-builds) are now being built and published at dotnet/core-setup.\r\n\r\nIn large part, we switched `master` to 5.0 to enable to the community to contribute changes. As the .NET Core 3.0 released has progressed, we've had to increase scrutiny on the changes we will accept. Now that we've permanently branched for 3.0, we can accept a much broader set of changes. Please consider that to be an open invitation!\r\n\r\nNotably, [dotnet/core-sdk](https://github.com/dotnet/core-sdk) is not yet producing 5.0 builds. We expect that the dotnet/core-sdk master branch will continue as a 3.0 branch for 2-3 months while we finish up the .NET Core 3.0 project.\r\n\r\nAt present, there is no developer experience for 5.0. We are waiting on the dotnet/core-sdk repo to switch to 5.0. Switching your project file to target `netcoreapp5.0` won't do anything useful. We'll update this issue when a 5.0 SDK comes available.","Url":"https://github.com/dotnet/announcements/issues/118","RelatedDescription":"Open issue \".NET Core master branches have switched to \"5.0\"\" (#118)"}],"ResultType":"GitHubIssue"},"Twitter":{"ResultType":"TwitterTimeline","Tweets":[{"Id":"1215026649923764224","CreatedAt":"2020-01-08T21:45:02+00:00","UserScreenname":"dotnet","Text":"Today's #AzureDevOps podcast w/ @KathleenDollard highlights key pieces listeners should consider when diving into t… https://t.co/MdHdnUd7kA","Source":"<a href=\"https://prod2.sprinklr.com\" rel=\"nofollow\">Sprinklr Publisher</a>","RetweetCount":12,"FavoriteCount":2,"RawContent":null},{"Id":"1214945126725935105","CreatedAt":"2020-01-08T16:21:05+00:00","UserScreenname":"dotnet","Text":"It's less than a week away! #dotNETConf kicks off Jan 14 with tons of great sessions to inspire app development for… https://t.co/7Mg0cma577","Source":"<a href=\"https://prod2.sprinklr.com\" rel=\"nofollow\">Sprinklr Publisher</a>","RetweetCount":47,"FavoriteCount":12,"RawContent":null},{"Id":"1214653254447095809","CreatedAt":"2020-01-07T21:01:17+00:00","UserScreenname":"dotnet","Text":"#dotNETConf kicks off Jan 14 with tons of great sessions to inspire app dev for the new 🎊 year.  🎉 \n\n...AND you won… https://t.co/6scTueNX7S","Source":"<a href=\"https://prod2.sprinklr.com\" rel=\"nofollow\">Sprinklr Publisher</a>","RetweetCount":43,"FavoriteCount":27,"RawContent":null},{"Id":"1214297091306065927","CreatedAt":"2020-01-06T21:26:01+00:00","UserScreenname":"dotnet","Text":"In today's On #dotNET, @MairaCW and @gotheap teach us how to make use of discards in #CSharp.
