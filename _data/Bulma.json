This would be closely modelled on `breadcrumb` with the following differences:\r\n\r\n* Default separator character is vertical bar (|) rather than solidus (/).\r\n* Default value for horizontal item padding is 0.5em rather than 0.75\r\n`$menubar-item-padding-horizontal: 0.5em !default`.\r\n* Separator options include `.has-solidus-separator` to use the solidus but not `.has-arrow-separator` or `.has-succeeds-separator` as these imply a hierarchy which isn't applicable here.","Url":"https://github.com/jgthms/bulma/issues/2464","RelatedDescription":"Open issue \"Add new menubar component\" (#2464)"},{"Id":"437244589","IsPullRequest":false,"CreatedAt":"2019-04-25T18:23:20","Actor":"tanmalik786","Number":"2462","RawContent":null,"Title":"Not an issue of sorts ..","State":"closed","Body":"<!-- PLEASE READ THE FOLLOWING INSTRUCTIONS -->\r\n\r\n<!-- Choose one of the following: -->\r\nThis is about **Bulma | the Docs**.\r\n\r\n<!-- Is it about Bulma or about the Docs? -->\r\nIt will be really great if we can have some kind of a search box to search from with in the entire documentation\r\n<!-- Is it a bug/feature/question or do you need help? -->\r\n<!-- If it's a bug, is it a browser bug? -->\r\n\r\n### Overview of the problem\r\n\r\n<!-- UNCOMMENT THE APPROPRIATE LINES -->\r\n\r\n<!-- This is about the Bulma **CSS framework** -->\r\n<!-- This is about the Bulma **Docs** -->\r\n<!-- I'm using Bulma **version** [x.x.x] -->\r\n<!-- My **browser** is: -->\r\n<!-- This is a **Sass** issue: I'm using version [x.x.x] -->\r\n<!-- I am sure this issue is **not a duplicate**? -->\r\n\r\n### Description\r\n\r\n<!-- Description of the bug, enhancement, or question -->\r\n\r\n### Steps to Reproduce\r\n\r\n<!--\r\n1.
