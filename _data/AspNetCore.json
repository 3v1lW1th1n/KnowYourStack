In order to rectify, it's necessary to either require the user to remember their username (I never remember username, but always remember email address), or to modify the code as follows to get the username associated with the account associated with the input email address:\r\n\r\n```protected void Login(object sender, EventArgs e)\r\n{\r\n    if (IsValid)\r\n    {\r\n        // Validate the user password\r\n        var manager = Context.GetOwinContext().GetUserManager<ApplicationUserManager>();\r\n        var signinManager = Context.GetOwinContext().GetUserManager<ApplicationSignInManager>();\r\n\r\n        var user = manager.FindByEmail(Email.Text);\r\n        if (user != null)\r\n        {\r\n            var result = signinManager.PasswordSignIn(user.UserName, Password.Text, RememberMe.Checked, shouldLockout: false);\r\n```\r\n\r\nSeems a little bit counter intuitive to have a template written that I have to modify so that it actually works.","Url":"https://github.com/aspnet/Identity/issues/1920","RelatedDescription":"Closed issue \"Template code supplies email for PasswordSignIn function which requires username\" (#1920)"},{"Id":"350121291","IsPullRequest":false,"CreatedAt":"2018-08-13T17:26:08","Actor":"cubikca","Number":"1919","RawContent":null,"Title":"UserManager is always ServiceLiftime.Scoped","State":"open","Body":"```\r\nservices.TryAddScoped<UserManager<TUser>>();\r\n```\r\nIn practice this presents a problem because the database context is transient.

If the client continues to send frames  after the grace period expires then we can treat it as a connection error as before. This prevents unnecessary connection teardowns for stream errors.\r\n\r\nMany of the limits we're implementing would trigger such resets. The code in Http2Connection.ValidateHeader today that throws stream exceptions similarly triggers this issue is corrupting the HPACK state by not processing all of the headers. Any error that is not fatal to the connection should put the stream into a graceful drain state.\r\n\r\nOne caveat: The client must not send additional streams if they have sent (rather than received) a reset. This is a connection error. Client aborted streams should not be given a graceful drain period.

This feature is on by default and allows build time verification of the correctness of Razor files, and also faster startup performance. Additionally, MVC watches for changes to cshtml files and seamlessly updates build-time compiled views with runtime compiled views. This allows editing cshtml files and then refreshing the browser to see the changes.\r\n\r\nMVC uses the app's compilation context, details about the references and settings that were used to compile the source code (.cs) in the app, to compile views at runtime. In addition to the compilation context, MVC exposes options such as [RazorViewEngineOptions.CompilationCallback](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/api/microsoft.aspnetcore.mvc.razor.razorviewengineoptions.compilationcallback?view=aspnetcore-2.1) and [AdditionalCompilationReferences](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/api/microsoft.aspnetcore.mvc.razor.razorviewengineoptions.additionalcompilationreferences?view=aspnetcore-2.1) that allow configuring compilation specifically for runtime. \r\n\r\nRuntime specific customizations are unavailable at build time and consequently the two outputs could be different.\r\n\r\nTo address this inconsistency, we plan on removing APIs in MVC that change or modify runtime compilation. For 2.2.0, we're marking these APIs obsolete with the intent to remove them in 3.0.0.

Direct dependencies are dependencies where you specifically add a package to your project, transitive dependencies occur when you add a package to your project that in turn relies on another package.\r\n\r\nFor example, the `Microsoft.AspNetCore.Mvc` package depends on the `Microsoft.AspNetCore.Mvc.Core` package. When you add a dependency on `Microsoft.AspNetCore.Mvc` in your project, you're taking a transitive dependency on `Microsoft.AspNetCore.Mvc.Core`.\r\n\r\nAny application that has a direct or transitive dependency on the [affected package](#affected-software) can be exposed to the vulnerability if it does not meet any of the [mitigation factors](#mitigation-factors).\r\n\r\n### <a name=\"how-fix\"></a>How do I fix the issue?\r\n\r\n### ASP.NET Core 2.1\r\n\r\nTo update ASP.NET Core 2.1 you should [download](https://www.microsoft.com/net/download) and install the .NET Core SDK 2.1.302 on your development machines and build servers, and the .NET Core Runtime 2.1.2 on your deployment servers. Your application will roll forward to these versions on an application restart.\r\n\r\n### ASP.NET Core 2.0\r\n\r\nIf you're targeting ASP.NET Core 2.0 and using the `Microsoft.AspNetCore.All` metapackage update its version number to 2.0.9 to update the `Microsoft.AspNetCore.Server.Kestrel.Core` package, recompile, and redeploy. On your deployment servers, you should [download](https://github.com/dotnet/core/blob/master/release-notes/download-archives/2.0.9-download.md) and install the .NET Core 2.0.9 using the Windows Server Hosting Bundle for Windows and the `dotnet-hosting-2.0.9` package for Linux servers.\r\n\r\n### ASP.NET 2.0 & 2.1 not targeting the meta-packages\r\n\r\n.NET Core projects have two types of dependencies: direct and transitive. You must update your projects using the following instructions to address both types of dependency.\r\n\r\n#### Direct dependencies\r\n\r\nDirect dependencies are discoverable by examining your `csproj` file. They can be fixed by [editing the project file](#direct-dependencies) or using NuGet to update the dependency.\r\n\r\n#### Transitive dependencies\r\n\r\nTransitive dependencies occur when you add a package to your project that in turn relies on another package. For example, if Contoso publishes a package `Contoso.Utility` which, in turn, depends on `Contoso.Internals` and you add the `Contoso.Utility` package to your project now your project has a direct dependency on `Contoso.Utility` and, because `Contoso.Utility` depends 'Contoso.Internals', your application gains a transitive dependency on the `Contoso.Internals` package.\r\n\r\nTransitive dependencies are reviewable in three ways, depending on your [project format](#project-format):\r\n\r\n* In the Visual Studio Solution Explorer window, which supports searching.\r\n* By examining the `project.assets.json` file contained in the obj directory of your project for `csproj` based projects.\r\n\r\nThe `project.assets.json`files are the authoritative list of all packages used by your project, containing both direct and transitive dependencies.\r\n\r\n#### <a name=\"direct-dependencies-vs2017\"></a>Fixing direct dependencies in Visual Studio 2017\r\n\r\nOpen *projectname.csproj* in your editor. If you're using Visual Studio, right-click the project and choose **Edit projectname.csproj** from the context menu, where projectname is the name of your project. Look for `PackageReference` elements. The following shows an example project file:\r\n\r\n```xml\r\n<Project Sdk=\"Microsoft.NET.Sdk.Web\">\r\n  <PropertyGroup>\r\n    <TargetFramework>netcoreapp2.0</TargetFramework>\r\n  </PropertyGroup>\r\n  <ItemGroup>\r\n    <PackageReference Include=\"Microsoft.AspNetCore.All\" Version=\"2.0.8\" />\r\n  </ItemGroup>\r\n</Project>\r\n```\r\n\r\nThe preceding example has a reference to the [vulnerable package](#affected-software), as seen by the single `PackageReference` element. The name of the package is in the `Include` attribute.\r\nThe package version number is in the `Version` attribute. The previous example shows a single direct dependency on `Microsoft.AspNetCore.All` version 2.0.0.\r\n\r\nTo update the version to the secure package, change the version number to the updated package version as listed on the table [previously](#affected-software).\r\nIn this example, update `Microsoft.AspNetCore.All` to the appropriate [fixed package number](#affected-software) for your major version. Save the *csproj* file. The example *csproj* now looks as follows:\r\n\r\n```xml\r\n<Project Sdk=\"Microsoft.NET.Sdk.Web\">\r\n  <PropertyGroup>\r\n    <TargetFramework>netcoreapp2.0</TargetFramework>\r\n  </PropertyGroup>\r\n  <ItemGroup>\r\n    <PackageReference Include=\"Microsoft.AspNetCore.All\" Version=\"2.0.9\" />\r\n  </ItemGroup>\r\n</Project>\r\n```\r\n\r\nIf you're using Visual Studio and you save your updated *csproj* file, Visual Studio will restore the new package version.\r\nYou can see the restore results by opening the **Output** window (Ctrl+Alt+O) and changing the **Show output from** drop-down list to **Package Manager**.\r\n\r\nIf you're not using Visual Studio, open a command line and change to your project directory. Execute the `dotnet restore` command to restore the updated dependencies.\r\n\r\nNow recompile your application. If after recompilation you see a *Dependency conflict warning*, you must update your other direct dependencies to versions that take a dependency on the updated package.\r\n\r\n#### Discovering and fixing transitive dependencies\r\n\r\nThere are two ways to view transitive dependencies. You can either [use Visual Studio’s Solution Explorer](#vs-solution-explorer), or you can review [the `project.assets.json` file](#project-assets-json) .\r\n\r\n##### <a name=\"vs-solution-explorer\"></a>Using Visual Studio Solution Explorer\r\n\r\nTo use Solution Explorer, open the project in Visual Studio, and then press Ctrl+; to activate the search in Solution Explorer. Search for the [vulnerable package](#affected-software) and make a note of the version numbers of any results you find.\r\n\r\nFor example, searching for `Microsoft.AspNetCore.Mvc.Core` in an example project that contains a package that takes a dependency on `Microsoft.AspNetCore.Mvc` shows the following results in Visual Studio 2017:\r\n\r\n![Screenshot of search results in Visual Studio 2017](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/796298/25858816/8ecdc2b4-3491-11e7-9363-746804bb9832.png)\r\n\r\nThe search results appear as a tree. In the previous results, you can see that a reference to `Microsoft.AspNetCore.Mvc.Core` version 1.1.2 is discovered.\r\n\r\nUnder the Dependencies node is a NuGet node. Under the NuGet node is the list of packages you have directly taken a dependency on and their versions.\r\nIn screenshot, the application takes a direct dependency on `Microsoft.AspNetCore.Mvc`. `Microsoft.AspNetCore.Mvc` in turn has leaf nodes that list its dependencies and their versions.\r\nThe `Microsoft.AspNetCore.Mvc` package takes a dependency on a version of `Microsoft.AspNetCore.Mvc.ApiExplorer`, that in turn takes a dependency on a version of `Microsoft.AspNetCore.Mvc.Core`.\r\n\r\n##### <a name=\"project-assets-json\"></a> Manually reviewing project.assets.json\r\n\r\nOpen the *project.assets.json* file from your project’s obj directory in your editor. We suggest you use an editor that understands JSON and allows you to collapse and expand nodes to review this file.\r\nVisual Studio and Visual Studio Code provide JSON friendly editing.\r\n\r\nSearch the *project.assets.json* file for the [vulnerable package](#affected-software), using the format `packagename/` for each of the package names from the preceding table. If you find the assembly name in your search:\r\n\r\n* Examine the line on which they are found, the version number is after the `/`.\r\n* Compare to the [vulnerable versions table](#affected-software).\r\n\r\nFor example, a search result that shows `Microsoft.AspNetCore.Server.Kestrel.Core/2.0.0` is a reference to version 2.0.0 of `Microsoft.AspNetCore.Server.Kestrel.Core`.\r\nIf your *project.assets.json* file includes references to the [vulnerable package](#affected-software), then you need to fix the transitive dependencies.\r\n\r\nIf you have not found any reference to any vulnerable packages, this means either\r\n\r\n* None of your direct dependencies depend on any vulnerable packages, or\r\n* You have already fixed the problem by updating the direct dependencies.\r\n\r\nIf your transitive dependency review found references to the [vulnerable package](#affected-software), you must add a direct dependency to the updated package to your *csproj* file to override the transitive dependency.\r\n\r\nOpen *projectname.csproj* in your editor. If you're using Visual Studio, right-click the project and choose **Edit projectname.csproj** from the context menu, where projectname is the name of your project.\r\nLook for `PackageReference` nodes, for example:\r\n\r\n```xml\r\n<Project Sdk=\"Microsoft.NET.Sdk.\">\r\n  <PropertyGroup>\r\n    <TargetFramework>net461</TargetFramework>\r\n  </PropertyGroup>\r\n  <ItemGroup>\r\n    <PackageReference Include=\"ThirdParty.NotUpdatedYet\" Version=\"2.0.0\" />\r\n  </ItemGroup>\r\n</Project>\r\n```\r\n\r\nYou must add a direct dependency to the updated version of the [vulnerable package](#affected-software) by adding it to the *csproj* file.\r\nYou do this by adding a new line to the dependencies section, referencing the fixed version.\r\nFor example, if your search showed a transitive reference to a vulnerable `Microsoft.AspNetCore.Server.Kestrel.Core` version, you'd add a reference to the [fixed package number](#affected-software).\r\n\r\n```xml\r\n<Project Sdk=\"Microsoft.NET.Sdk.Web\">\r\n  <PropertyGroup>\r\n    <TargetFramework>net461</TargetFramework>\r\n  </PropertyGroup>\r\n  <ItemGroup>\r\n    <PackageReference Include=\"Microsoft.AspNetCore.Server.Kestrel.Core\" Version=\"2.0.34 />\r\n    <PackageReference Include=\"ThirdParty.NotUpdatedYet\" Version=\"2.0.0\" />\r\n  </ItemGroup>\r\n</Project>\r\n```\r\n\r\nAfter you've added the direct dependency reference, save your *csproj* file.\r\n\r\nIf you're using Visual Studio, save your updated *csproj* file and Visual Studio will restore the new package versions.\r\nYou can see the restore results by opening the **Output** window (Ctrl+Alt+O) and changing the **Show output from** drop-down list to **Package Manager**.\r\n\r\nIf you're not using Visual Studio, open a command line and change to your project directory. Execute the `dotnet restore` command to restore the new dependencies.\r\n\r\n#### Rebuilding your application\r\n\r\nFinally you must rebuild your application, test, and redeploy.\r\n\r\n## Other Information\r\n\r\n### Reporting Security Issues\r\n\r\nIf you have found a potential security issue in .NET Core, please email details to secure@microsoft.com.

Direct dependencies are dependencies where you specifically add a package to your project, transitive dependencies occur when you add a package to your project that in turn relies on another package.\r\n\r\nFor example, the `Microsoft.AspNetCore.Mvc` package depends on the `Microsoft.AspNetCore.Mvc.Core` package.

Your application will roll forward to these versions on an application restart.\r\n\r\n### ASP.NET Core 2.0\r\n\r\nIf you're targeting ASP.NET Core 2.0 and using the `Microsoft.AspNetCore.All` metapackage update its version number to 2.0.9 to update the `Microsoft.AspNetCore.Identity` package, recompile, and redeploy. On your deployment servers, you should [download](https://github.com/dotnet/core/blob/master/release-notes/download-archives/2.0.9-download.md) and install the .NET Core 2.0.9 using the Windows Server Hosting Bundle for Windows and the `dotnet-hosting-2.0.9` package for Linux servers.\r\n\r\n### ASP.NET Core 1.0, 1.1 or 2.0 not targeting the metapackage.\r\n\r\n.NET Core projects have two types of dependencies: direct and transitive. You must update your projects using the following instructions to address both types of dependency.\r\n\r\n### <a name=\"project-format\"></a>.NET Core Project formats\r\n\r\n.NET Core has two different project file formats, depending on what software created the project.\r\n\r\n1. `project.json` is the format used in .NET Core 1.0 and Microsoft Visual Studio 2015.\r\n2. `csproj` is the format used in .NET Core 1.1, .NET Core 2.0 and Microsoft Visual Studio 2017.\r\n\r\n#### Direct dependencies\r\n\r\nDirect dependencies are discoverable by examining your `csproj` file or your `project.json` file. They can be fixed by [editing the project file](#direct-dependencies) or using NuGet to update the dependency.\r\n\r\n#### Transitive dependencies\r\n\r\nTransitive dependencies occur when you add a package to your project that in turn relies on another package. For example, if Contoso publishes a package `Contoso.Utility` which, in turn, depends on `Contoso.Internals` and you add the `Contoso.Utility` package to your project now your project has a direct dependency on `Contoso.Utility` and, because `Contoso.Utility` depends 'Contoso.Internals', your application gains a transitive dependency on the `Contoso.Internals` package.\r\n\r\nTransitive dependencies are reviewable in three ways, depending on your [project format](#project-format):\r\n\r\n* In the Visual Studio Solution Explorer window, which supports searching.\r\n* By examining the `project.assets.json` file contained in the obj directory of your project for `csproj` based projects *OR*.\r\n* By examining the `project.lock.json` file contained in the root directory of your project for `project.json` based projects.\r\n\r\nThe `project.assets.json` and `project.lock.json` files are the authoritative list of all packages used by your project, containing both direct and transitive dependencies.\r\n\r\n#### <a name=\"direct-dependencies-vs2017\"></a>Fixing direct dependencies in a csproj based project / Visual Studio 2017\r\n\r\nOpen *projectname.csproj* in your editor. If you're using Visual Studio, right-click the project and choose **Edit projectname.csproj** from the context menu, where projectname is the name of your project. Look for `PackageReference` elements. The following shows an example project file:\r\n\r\n```xml\r\n<Project Sdk=\"Microsoft.NET.Sdk.Web\">\r\n  <PropertyGroup>\r\n    <TargetFramework>netcoreapp2.0</TargetFramework>\r\n  </PropertyGroup>\r\n  <ItemGroup>\r\n    <PackageReference Include=\"Microsoft.AspNetCore.Identity\" Version=\"2.0.0\" />\r\n  </ItemGroup>\r\n</Project>\r\n```\r\n\r\nThe preceding example has a reference to the [vulnerable package](#affected-software), as seen by the single `PackageReference` element. The name of the package is in the `Include` attribute.\r\nThe package version number is in the `Version` attribute. The previous example shows a single direct dependency on `Microsoft.AspNetCore.Identity` version 2.0.0.\r\n\r\nTo update the version to the secure package, change the version number to the updated package version as listed on the table [previously](#affected-software).\r\nIn this example, update `Microsoft.AspNetCore.Identity` to the appropriate [fixed package number](#affected-software) for your major version. Save the *csproj* file. The example *csproj* now looks as follows:\r\n\r\n```xml\r\n<Project Sdk=\"Microsoft.NET.Sdk.Web\">\r\n  <PropertyGroup>\r\n    <TargetFramework>netcoreapp2.0</TargetFramework>\r\n  </PropertyGroup>\r\n  <ItemGroup>\r\n    <PackageReference Include=\"Microsoft.AspNetCore.Identity\" Version=\"2.0.4\" />\r\n  </ItemGroup>\r\n</Project>\r\n```\r\n\r\nIf you're using Visual Studio and you save your updated *csproj* file, Visual Studio will restore the new package version.\r\nYou can see the restore results by opening the **Output** window (Ctrl+Alt+O) and changing the **Show output from** drop-down list to **Package Manager**.\r\n\r\nIf you're not using Visual Studio, open a command line and change to your project directory. Execute the `dotnet restore` command to restore the updated dependencies.\r\n\r\nNow recompile your application. If after recompilation you see a *Dependency conflict warning*, you must update your other direct dependencies to versions that take a dependency on the updated package.\r\n\r\n#### <a name=\"direct-dependencies-vs2015\"></a> Fixing Direct Dependencies in project.json based project / Visual Studio 2015\r\n\r\nOpen your `project.json` file in your editor. Look for the dependencies section. Below is an example dependencies section:\r\n\r\n``` json\r\n    \"dependencies\": {\r\n      \"Microsoft.NETCore.App\": {\r\n        \"version\": \"1.0.1\",\r\n        \"type\": \"platform\"\r\n      },\r\n     \"Microsoft.AspNetCore.Mvc.Core\": \"1.0.6\",\r\n     \"Microsoft.AspNetCore.Identity\" : \"1.0.5\"\r\n    }\r\n```\r\n\r\nThis example has three direct dependencies: `Microsoft.NETCore.App`, `Microsoft.AspNetCore.Mvc.Core` and `Microsoft.AspNetCore.Identity`.\r\n\r\n`Microsoft.NetCore.App` is the platform the application targets, you should ignore this. The other packages expose their version to the right of the package name. In our example, our non-platform packages are version 1.0.1.\r\n\r\nReview your direct dependencies for any instance of the packages and versions listed above. In the example above, there is a direct dependency on a vulnerable package, `Microsoft.AspNetCore.Identity` version 1.0.5.\r\n\r\nTo update to the fixed package, change the version number to be the appropriate package for your release. In the example, this would be updating `Microsoft.AspNetCore.Identity` to 1.0.6.\r\n\r\nAfter updating the vulnerable package versions, save your `project.json` file.\r\n\r\nThe dependencies section in our example `project.json` would now look as follows:\r\n\r\n```json\r\n  \"dependencies\": {\r\n    \"Microsoft.NETCore.App\": {\r\n      \"version\": \"1.0.1\",\r\n      \"type\": \"platform\"\r\n    },\r\n    \"Microsoft.AspNetCore.Mvc.Core\": \"1.0.6\",\r\n    \"Microsoft.AspNetCore.Identity \": \"1.0.6\"\r\n  }\r\n```\r\n\r\nIf you are using Visual Studio and save your updated `project.json` file, Visual Studio will restore the new package version. You can see the restore results by opening the Output Window (Ctrl+Alt+O) and changing the Show output from drop-down list to Package Manager.\r\n\r\nIf you are not using Visual Studio, open a command line and change to your project directory. Execute the `dotnet restore` command to restore your new dependency.\r\n\r\nAfter you have addressed all of your direct dependencies, you must also review your transitive dependencies.\r\n\r\nAfter you've addressed all of your direct dependencies, you must review your transitive dependencies.\r\n\r\n#### Discovering and fixing transitive dependencies\r\n\r\nThere are two ways to view transitive dependencies. You can either [use Visual Studio’s Solution Explorer](#vs-solution-explorer), or you can review [the `project.assets.json` file](#project-assets-json) or the [the `project.lock.json` file](#project-lock-json).\r\n\r\n##### <a name=\"vs-solution-explorer\"></a>Using Visual Studio Solution Explorer\r\n\r\nTo use Solution Explorer, open the project in Visual Studio, and then press Ctrl+; to activate the search in Solution Explorer. Search for the [vulnerable package](#affected-software) and make a note of the version numbers of any results you find.\r\n\r\nFor example, searching for `Microsoft.AspNetCore.Mvc.Core` in an example project that contains a package that takes a dependency on `Microsoft.AspNetCore.Mvc` shows the following results in Visual Studio 2017:\r\n\r\n![Screenshot of search results in Visual Studio 2017](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/796298/25858816/8ecdc2b4-3491-11e7-9363-746804bb9832.png)\r\n\r\nThe search results appear as a tree. In the previous results, you can see that a reference to `Microsoft.AspNetCore.Mvc.Core` version 1.1.2 is discovered.\r\n\r\nUnder the Dependencies node is a NuGet node. Under the NuGet node is the list of packages you have directly taken a dependency on and their versions.\r\nIn screenshot, the application takes a direct dependency on `Microsoft.AspNetCore.Mvc`. `Microsoft.AspNetCore.Mvc` in turn has leaf nodes that list its dependencies and their versions.\r\nThe `Microsoft.AspNetCore.Mvc` package takes a dependency on a version of `Microsoft.AspNetCore.Mvc.ApiExplorer`, that in turn takes a dependency on a version of `Microsoft.AspNetCore.Mvc.Core`.\r\n\r\n##### <a name=\"project-assets-json\"></a> Manually reviewing project.assets.json (csproj/VS2017)\r\n\r\nOpen the *project.assets.json* file from your project’s obj directory in your editor. We suggest you use an editor that understands JSON and allows you to collapse and expand nodes to review this file.\r\nVisual Studio and Visual Studio Code provide JSON friendly editing.\r\n\r\nSearch the *project.assets.json* file for the [vulnerable package](#affected-software), using the format `packagename/` for each of the package names from the preceding table. If you find the assembly name in your search:\r\n\r\n* Examine the line on which they are found, the version number is after the `/`.\r\n* Compare to the [vulnerable versions table](#affected-software).\r\n\r\nFor example, a search result that shows `Microsoft.AspNetCore.Identity/2.0.0` is a reference to version 2.0.0 of `Microsoft.AspNetCore.Identity`.\r\nIf your *project.assets.json* file includes references to the [vulnerable package](#affected-software), then you need to fix the transitive dependencies.\r\n\r\nIf you have not found any reference to any vulnerable packages, this means either\r\n\r\n* None of your direct dependencies depend on any vulnerable packages, or\r\n* You have already fixed the problem by updating the direct dependencies.\r\n\r\nIf your transitive dependency review found references to the [vulnerable package](#affected-software), you must add a direct dependency to the updated package to your *csproj* file to override the transitive dependency.\r\n\r\nOpen *projectname.csproj* in your editor. If you're using Visual Studio, right-click the project and choose **Edit projectname.csproj** from the context menu, where projectname is the name of your project.\r\nLook for `PackageReference` nodes, for example:\r\n\r\n```xml\r\n<Project Sdk=\"Microsoft.NET.Sdk.\">\r\n  <PropertyGroup>\r\n    <TargetFramework>net461</TargetFramework>\r\n  </PropertyGroup>\r\n  <ItemGroup>\r\n    <PackageReference Include=\"ThirdParty.NotUpdatedYet\" Version=\"2.0.0\" />\r\n  </ItemGroup>\r\n</Project>\r\n```\r\n\r\nYou must add a direct dependency to the updated version of the [vulnerable package](#affected-software) by adding it to the *csproj* file.\r\nYou do this by adding a new line to the dependencies section, referencing the fixed version.\r\nFor example, if your search showed a transitive reference to a vulnerable `Microsoft.AspNetCore.Identity` version, you'd add a reference to the [fixed package number](#affected-software).\r\n\r\n```xml\r\n<Project Sdk=\"Microsoft.NET.Sdk.Web\">\r\n  <PropertyGroup>\r\n    <TargetFramework>net461</TargetFramework>\r\n  </PropertyGroup>\r\n  <ItemGroup>\r\n    <PackageReference Include=\"Microsoft.AspNetCore.Identity\" Version=\"2.0.4\" />\r\n    <PackageReference Include=\"ThirdParty.NotUpdatedYet\" Version=\"2.0.0\" />\r\n  </ItemGroup>\r\n</Project>\r\n```\r\n\r\nAfter you've added the direct dependency reference, save your *csproj* file.\r\n\r\nIf you're using Visual Studio, save your updated *csproj* file and Visual Studio will restore the new package versions.\r\nYou can see the restore results by opening the **Output** window (Ctrl+Alt+O) and changing the **Show output from** drop-down list to **Package Manager**.\r\n\r\nIf you're not using Visual Studio, open a command line and change to your project directory. Execute the `dotnet restore` command to restore the new dependencies.\r\n\r\n##### <a name=\"project-lock-json\"></a> Manually reviewing project.lock.json (project.json/VS2015)\r\n\r\nOpen the `project.lock.json` file in your editor. We suggest you use an editor that understands json and allows you to collapse and expand nodes to review this file; both Visual Studio and Visual Studio Code provide this functionality.\r\n\r\nIf you are using Visual Studio the `project.lock.json` file is “under” the `project.json` file. Click the right pointing triangle, ▷, to the left of the `project.json` file to expand the solution tree to expose the `project.lock.json` file. The following image shows a project with the `project.json` file expanded to show the `project.lock.json` file.\r\n\r\n![project lock json](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/796298/25858179/f6e01200-348f-11e7-8a77-7176d8dd3f03.png)\r\n\r\nSearch the `project.lock.json` file for the vulnerable packages, using the format `packagename/`, using each of the package names from the table above. If you find any vulnerable assembly name in your search examine the line on which they are found, the version number is after the `/` and compare to the vulnerable versions table above. For example a search result that shows `Microsoft.AspNetCore.Identity/1.0.1` is a reference to v1.0.1 of `Microsoft.AspNetCore.Identity`.   If your `project.lock.json` file includes references to any of the package versions shown above then you will need to fix the transitive dependencies.\r\n\r\nIf you have not found any reference to a vulnerable version of  `Microsoft.AspNetCore.Identity` this means none of your direct dependencies depend on any vulnerable packages or you have already fixed the problem by updating the direct dependencies.\r\n\r\nIf your transitive dependency review found references to any of the vulnerable packages you must add a direct dependency to the updated package to your `project.json` file to override the transitive dependency. Open your `project.json` and find the dependencies section. For example:\r\n\r\n``` json\r\n  \"dependencies\": {\r\n    \"Microsoft.NETCore.App\": {\r\n      \"version\": \"1.0.1\",\r\n      \"type\": \"platform\"\r\n    },\r\n    \"Microsoft.AspNetCore.Mvc\": \"1.0.0\"\r\n  }\r\n```\r\n\r\nFor each of the vulnerable packages your search returned you must add a direct dependency to the updated version by adding it to the `project.json` file. You do this by adding a new line to the dependencies section, referring the fixed version. For example, if your search showed a transitive reference to the vulnerable `Microsoft.AspNetCore.Identity` version 1.0.0 you would add a reference to the appropriate fixed version, 1.0.6. Edit the `project.json` file as follows:\r\n\r\n``` json\r\n  \"dependencies\": {\r\n    \"Microsoft.NETCore.App\": {\r\n      \"version\": \"1.0.1\",\r\n      \"type\": \"platform\"\r\n    },\r\n    \"Microsoft.AspNetCore.Identity\": \"1.0.6\",\r\n    \"Microsoft.AspNetCore.Mvc\": \"1.0.0\"\r\n  }\r\n```\r\n\r\nAfter you have added direct dependencies to the fixed packages, save your `project.json` file.\r\n\r\nIf you are using Visual Studio save your updated `project.json` file and Visual Studio will restore the new package versions. You can see the restore results by opening the Output Window (Ctrl+Alt+O) and changing the Show output from drop-down list to Package Manager.\r\n\r\nIf you are not using Visual Studio open a command line and change to your project directory. Execute the `dotnet restore` command to restore your new dependencies.\r\n\r\n#### Rebuilding your application\r\n\r\nFinally you must rebuild your application, test, and redeploy.\r\n\r\n## Other Information\r\n\r\n### Reporting Security Issues\r\n\r\nIf you have found a potential security issue in .NET Core, please email details to secure@microsoft.com.

We are concentrating most of our efforts to add new functionality on the 3.0 release. Still, you can expect 2.2 to include lots of bugs fixes, community contributions and small improvements.\r\n\r\nYou can access the list of issues currently assigned to the 2.2 milestone using [this query](https://github.com/aspnet/EntityFrameworkCore/issues?q=is%3Aopen+is%3Aissue+milestone%3A2.2.0+sort%3Areactions-%2B1-desc) on our issue tracking system.  \r\n\r\n## Schedule\r\nThe schedule of EF Core 2.2 will align with the schedule of .NET Core and ASP.NET Core 2.2. See [the ASP.NET Core 2.2 Roadmap announcement](https://github.com/aspnet/Announcements/issues/307).\r\n\r\nOur current plan is to have three previews before we ship RTM near the end of 2018:\r\n\r\n- August – Preview 1\r\n- September - Preview 2\r\n- October - Preview 3\r\n- Before end-of-year – RTM\r\n\r\n As usual, this post reflects our current plan, but things may change as we make progress. \r\n\r\n## New features\r\n\r\n### Reverse engineering of database views into query types\r\n\r\nIn EF Core 2.1 we added query types, which allow mapping .NET objects to views and tables without keys. In 2.2, we plan to leverage this new capability to automatically map existing database views to query types. \r\n\r\nYou can track the progress of this at https://github.com/aspnet/EntityFrameworkCore/issues/1679.\r\n\r\n###  Support for collections of owned entities\r\n\r\nIn EF Core 2.0 we added the concept of owned entity types, which allows modeling ownership relationship that are common between entities that are part of the same document in document-oriented databases or the same aggregate if you use Domain-Driven Design concepts in your model.\r\n\r\nUntil now, we only support reference navigation properties to owned entities. In EF Core 2.2, we plan to enhance this functionality to map collection navigation properties to owned entities. \r\n\r\nYou can track the progress of this at https://github.com/aspnet/EntityFrameworkCore/issues/8172.\r\n\r\n## Other work\r\n\r\nThere are some additional work items that are not strictly EF Core 2.2 features, but we still track as part of the 2.2 milestone because we are doing the work in the same timeframe:\r\n\r\n### Cosmos DB provider\r\n\r\nA lot of our efforts are going into productizing an EF Core provider for the SQL API in Cosmos DB.\r\nWe have already created a prototype, which we have shown in demos such as in this [this EF Core 2.1 talk](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k55kDH_ixrQ) we did at the Microsoft Build conference.\r\n\r\nDue to competing priorities, releasing a preview of this provider has taken more than what we originally planned, but we are working on it now, and the current plan is to release a stable version by the end of this calendar year.\r\n\r\nYou can track our progress on this issue: https://github.com/aspnet/EntityFrameworkCore/issues/12086. \r\n\r\n### Preview of spatial support for SQL Server\r\n\r\nWe are also focusing on adding spatial support as an extension to the SQL Server provider for EF Core.\r\nNote that the PostgreSQL provider (Npgsql) already added support in EF Core 2.1. Beside implementing this functionality for SQL Server, we are working closely with the developers of Npgsql to try to achieve a consistent and hopefully improved experience across providers.\r\n\r\nNote that we aren't committing to having a final version of the spatial support for the end of the current calendar year. But we are actively working on this now, and as we make progress, we should be able to provide a more precise estimate.   \r\n\r\nYou can track our progress on this issue: https://github.com/aspnet/EntityFrameworkCore/issues/1100.\r\n\r\n### Improve test coverage for LINQ and reduce query regressions in future releases\r\n\r\nIn the last few releases, we have seen that when we commit improvements to our LINQ implementation, we often break queries that were previously working. The main challenge is that LINQ defines a huge space of possible queries to test, and it is very complex to measure what level of test coverage we have, even for a specific query operator. In the 2.2 timeframe, we will be investing on improving test coverage for this huge space. We also plan to experiment with new approaches to add appropriate coverage, and to reduce the likelihood of introducing regressions in future releases.\r\n\r\nYou can track our progress on this at https://github.com/aspnet/EntityFrameworkCore/issues/12046. \r\n\r\nFor discussion on this roadmap, please use https://github.com/aspnet/EntityFrameworkCore/issues/12465. ","Url":"https://github.com/aspnet/Announcements/issues/308","RelatedDescription":"Open issue \"EF Core 2.2 Roadmap\" (#308)"},{"Id":"335571873","IsPullRequest":false,"CreatedAt":"2018-06-25T21:19:36","Actor":"glennc","Number":"307","RawContent":null,"Title":"ASP.NET Core 2.2 Roadmap","State":"open","Body":"We have grouped the ASP.NET Core 2.2 release into a few themes:\r\n\r\n- APIs & Services\r\n- Server improvements\r\n- SignalR\r\n\r\n## Rough Schedule\r\nWe are currently planning to have 3 previews before RTM:\r\n - August – Preview 1\r\n - September - Preview 2\r\n - October - Preview 3\r\n - Before End-of-year – RTM\r\n\r\nAs with our previous roadmap posts this is what we intend right now, but it's subject to change as we continue development.\r\n\r\n## APIs and Services\r\n\r\nThe 'north star' for this version is to generate better metadata about your app and use that data to make your dev experience better and more productive. This is the main focus for 2.2.\r\n\r\n### API Controller conventions\r\nIn 2.1 we added controller specific conventions that make Web API development more convenient with the [ApiController attribute](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/aspnet/core/web-api/index?view=aspnetcore-2.1#annotate-class-with-apicontrollerattribute). In 2.2 we want to expand on this concept to provide metadata for API Explorer and provide a better end-to-end API documentation experience.\r\n\r\nWe want to make it possible for all MVC Core applications to have a good Swagger/OpenAPI definition by default. By following common patterns, your actions will produce rich metadata without falling into 'attribute soup' where you list every possible status code that every action in your app could return. We will include a default set of conventions that match what ASP.NET Core scaffolding generations. It will also be possible to write and share your own conventions to reflect your desired contracts. \r\n\r\nWe will include a set of analyzers that will help you find cases where code that doesn't match the API Explorer metadata, and a code-fix that provides options to explicitly specify the response type metadata, create a new convention with a different pattern, or just let you write code to satisfy the convention.\r\n\r\nAs a concrete example, you could write a convention that says \"every action method that starts with 'Create' will return an HTTP 201\". If you wrote the following code, then you would receive a warning.\r\n\r\n```csharp\r\n[HttpPost(\"/orders\")]\r\npublic ActionResult<Order> CreateOrder(OrderData orderData)\r\n{\r\n    ....\r\n    return Ok(new Order() {...});\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nThis code doesn't match your Swagger/OpenAPI metadata (from the convention) - which says that this action returns a 201. Once you see this, you could `ctrl + .` to add the attributes for what we do know about this method, opting out of conventions, or you could change the code.\r\n\r\nThe analyzer will also be able to 'check your work' if you are being explicit about status codes and results using the existing attributes - it does not require you to use the conventions. Details for how this will all work can be discussed here: https://github.com/aspnet/Mvc/issues/7802\r\n\r\nLet's look at a more fleshed-out out example. The following code snippet is what is required to generate a reasonable Open API document for an action method that will get an item by ID or return a 404:\r\n\r\n```csharp\r\n[ApiController]\r\npublic class CatalogController : ControllerBase\r\n{\r\n    [HttpGet]\r\n    [Route(\"items/{id:int}\")]\r\n    [ProducesResponseType((int)HttpStatusCode.NotFound)]\r\n    [ProducesResponseType(typeof(CatalogItem),(int)HttpStatusCode.OK)]\r\n    public async Task<ActionResult<CatalogItem>> GetItemById(int id)\r\n    {\r\n    }\r\n    ...\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nIn 2.2 with the default conventions the following code should generate the same Open API document that the above code sample does, and this shipped analyzers will give you hints when you do something that doesn't match so you know to go and add attributes or change the conventions:\r\n\r\n```csharp\r\n[ApiController]\r\npublic class CatalogController : ControllerBase\r\n{\r\n    [HttpGet]\r\n    [Route(\"items/{id:int}\")]\r\n    public async Task<ActionResult<CatalogItem>> GetItemById(int id)\r\n    {\r\n    }\r\n    ...\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\n### OpenAPI generation\r\nWith the conventions described above it will be possible for code that uses the API Explorer to generate Open API documents to be better by default, since the code you write will either follow the conventions or have attributes allowing generators to create better documents.\r\n\r\n### Dispatcher\r\nIn 2.2 we will introduce a new routing system that will expand the set of scenarios where routing is useful – tentatively called Dispatcher. \r\n\r\nThe current routing system was designed to support MVC’s historical scenarios without much thought to how routing and the composable middleware pipeline will work together. The Dispatcher is designed to run the URL matching step very early in the pipeline so that middleware can see the Endpoint that was selected as well as metadata that is associated with that endpoint. Like existing routing, the dispatcher will branch and call the actual endpoint at the end of the pipeline.\r\n\r\nA concrete example of how this helps us is with CORS. Today there is both a CORS middleware AND a CORS feature of MVC (https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/aspnet/core/security/cors?view=aspnetcore-2.1). Because routing information is deeply integrated with MVC we can't apply CORS policies that only apply to specific controllers until after we know what controller has been selected. However, if you also want CORS policies to apply to other parts of your pipeline then you need the middleware. This has been a source of confusion for many and we can simplify it if all of the middleware pipeline can have as much information about routing as MVC does today.\r\n\r\nWe’re also using this opportunity to make improvements to the performance of routing and dispatching for MVC and other scenarios.\r\n\r\n### HTTP API REPL tooling\r\nToday there are no tools built into Visual Studio or the dotnet CLI to help you execute HTTP verbs against your API. We have a great language, debugger, and framework but they are somewhat limited when it's difficult to send a POST to my app to see what happens. In 2.2 we want to build a CLI experience for exploring HTTP APIs to imcrease your API inner loop productivity. The CLI builds on all the features we've talked about above as some of its advanced features, like listing all routes in your app, are enabled by consuming the metadata we have about your app via Open API documents. That means the CLI should be useful for executing any HTTP verb, but really shines when you feed it more data like Open API docs. We intend to start by shipping this as a standalone global tool while we explore its feature set and potential.\r\n\r\nYou can see a demo and description of this in Scott Hunter and Scott Hanselman's BUILD talk here: https://youtu.be/KAIJ3ezQb3c?t=18m\r\n\r\n### API client generation (C# & TypeScript)\r\nOnce you have an API with rich metadata and done exploring and testing it, then you need to go and write some client code to call and make use of your API. We are going to build an experience for generating this code based on the same data and documentation described above. We envision a few pieces for this story, one part is a dotnet tool that can generate code from an Open API document, the other is MSBuild SDK work to allow a `ServiceReference` to another project in a solution. That reference will cause build time client code generation to happen via the tool that can generate code. We expect this to work in a similar way to the EF Core tooling experience, where your application is built and most of your startup code executed but instead of running it we use the data we have about your code to generate a client.\r\n\r\n### Authorization Server\r\nOne of the largest gaps we’ve had has been around authorization for applications beyond a simple forms based login. We plan to fill that gap with a simple to use OpenID Connect based authorization server, which will allow your ASP.NET application to act as an authentication point for your projects, be they web site to API, SPA to API, native application to an API or, for distributed applications API to API. As we are concentrating on first party applications we can make the code you need to plumb in trivial, getting as close to zero configuration as you can,  we’re not aiming to replace the excellent third-party solutions out there which enable richer scenarios like third-party applications or which provide a flexibility in configuration and authentication flow.\r\n\r\n## Server Improvements\r\n\r\n### Health Checks\r\nThis feature is a way to trivially setup an endpoint in your application that can be used to check the health of your application, potentially taking into account things like memory consumption or database availability as well as just \"can I accept a HTTP request\".\r\n\r\n### HTTP/2 in Kestrel & HttpClient\r\nThe title says it all in this case. HTTP/2 support for all. We started this work some time ago, and have had the protocol mostly implemented for a while but not compiled into the product since it wasn't ready. This version we will finish that work and implement the missing features.\r\n\r\n### In-proc ANCM\r\nRunning ASP.NET Core applications in-process in IIS, giving a significant performance boost.\r\n\r\n## SignalR\r\n\r\n### Add Java & C++ clients\r\nAllow customers using Java or C++ to connect to SignalR servers, and the [Azure SignalR Service](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/blog/azure-signalr-service-a-fully-managed-service-to-add-real-time-functionality/).\r\n\r\n## Other\r\nAs with all releases there is a large tail of bug fixes, performance improvements, small features, and community PRs that we will also work on.

Direct dependencies are dependencies where you specifically add a package to your project, transitive dependencies occur when you add a package to your project that in turn relies on another package.\r\n\r\nFor example, the `Microsoft.AspNetCore.Mvc` package depends on the `Microsoft.AspNetCore.Mvc.Core` package. When you add a dependency on `Microsoft.AspNetCore.Mvc` in your project, you're taking a transitive dependency on `Microsoft.AspNetCore.Mvc.Core`.\r\n\r\nAny application that has a direct or transitive dependency on the [affected packages](#affected-software) can be exposed to the vulnerability.\r\n\r\n### How do I fix the issue?\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\nIf you're targeting .NET Core 2.x and the `Microsoft.AspNetCore.All` \"metapackage\":\r\n\r\n* Update its version number to 2.0.8 if you have targetted 2.0.x *OR*\r\n* Update its version number to 2.1.0-rc1-final if you have targetted previews of 2.1\r\n\r\nUpdating the metapackage will update the [affected packages](#affected-software)\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n.NET Core projects have two types of dependencies: direct and transitive. You must update your projects using the following instructions to address both types of dependency.\r\n\r\n#### Direct dependencies\r\n\r\nDirect dependencies are discoverable by examining your *csproj* file. They can be fixed by [editing the csproj file](#direct-dependencies) or using NuGet to update the dependency.\r\n\r\n#### Transitive dependencies\r\n\r\nTransitive dependencies occur when you add a package to your project that in turn relies on another package. For example, if Contoso publishes a package `Contoso.Utility` which, in turn, depends on `Contoso.Internals` and you add the `Contoso.Utility` package to your project now your project has a direct dependency on `Contoso.Utility` and, because `Contoso.Utility` depends 'Contoso.Internals', your application gains a transitive dependency on the `Contoso.Internals` package.\r\n\r\nTransitive dependencies are reviewable in two ways:\r\n\r\n* In the Visual Studio Solution Explorer window, which supports searching.\r\n* By examining the *project.assets.json* file contained in the obj directory of your project.\r\n\r\nThe *project.assets.json* files are the authoritative list of all packages used by your project, containing both direct and transitive dependencies.\r\n\r\n#### <a name=\"direct-dependencies\"></a>Fixing direct dependencies\r\n\r\nOpen *projectname.csproj* in your editor. If you're using Visual Studio, right-click the project and choose **Edit projectname.csproj** from the context menu, where projectname is the name of your project. Look for `PackageReference` elements. The following shows an example project file:\r\n\r\n```xml\r\n<Project Sdk=\"Microsoft.NET.Sdk\">\r\n  <PropertyGroup>\r\n    <TargetFramework>netcoreapp2.0</TargetFramework>\r\n  </PropertyGroup>\r\n  <ItemGroup>\r\n    <PackageReference Include=\"Microsoft.AspNetCore.Server.Kestrel.Core\" Version=\"2.0.1\" />\r\n  </ItemGroup>\r\n</Project>\r\n```\r\n\r\nThe preceding example has a reference to a [vulnerable package](#affected-software), as seen by the single `PackageReference` element. The name of the package is in the `Include` attribute.\r\nThe package version number is in the `Version` attribute. The previous example shows a single direct dependency on `Microsoft.AspNetCore.Server.Kestrel.Core` version 2.0.1.\r\n\r\nTo update the version to the secure package, change the version number to the updated package version as listed on the table [previously](#affected-software).\r\nIn this example, update `Microsoft.AspNetCore.Server.Kestrel.Core` to a [fixed package number](#affected-software). Save the *csproj* file. The example *csproj* now looks as follows:\r\n\r\n```xml\r\n<Project Sdk=\"Microsoft.NET.Sdk\">\r\n  <PropertyGroup>\r\n    <TargetFramework>netcoreapp2.0</TargetFramework>\r\n  </PropertyGroup>\r\n  <ItemGroup>\r\n    <PackageReference Include=\"Microsoft.AspNetCore.Server.Kestrel.Core\" Version=\"2.0.3 />\r\n  </ItemGroup>\r\n</Project>\r\n```\r\n\r\nIf you're using Visual Studio and you save your updated *csproj* file, Visual Studio will restore the new package version.\r\nYou can see the restore results by opening the **Output** window (Ctrl+Alt+O) and changing the **Show output from** drop-down list to **Package Manager**.\r\n\r\nIf you're not using Visual Studio, open a command line and change to your project directory. Execute the `dotnet restore` command to restore the updated dependencies.\r\n\r\nNow recompile your application. If after recompilation you see a *Dependency conflict warning*, you must update your other direct dependencies to versions that take a dependency on the updated package.\r\n\r\nAfter you've addressed all of your direct dependencies, you must review your transitive dependencies.\r\n\r\n#### Discovering and fixing transitive dependencies\r\n\r\nThere are two ways to view transitive dependencies. You can either [use Visual Studio’s Solution Explorer](#vs-solution-explorer), or you can [review the *project.assets.json* file](#project-assets-json).\r\n\r\n##### <a name=\"vs-solution-explorer\"></a>Using Visual Studio Solution Explorer\r\n\r\nTo use Solution Explorer, open the project in Visual Studio 2017, and then press Ctrl+; to activate the search in Solution Explorer. Search for each of the [vulnerable packages](#affected-software) and make a note of the version numbers of any results you find.\r\n\r\nFor example, searching for `Microsoft.AspNetCore.Mvc.Core` in an example project that contains a package that takes a dependency on `Microsoft.AspNetCore.Mvc` shows the following results in Visual Studio 2017:\r\n\r\n![Screenshot of search results in Visual Studio 2017](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/796298/25858816/8ecdc2b4-3491-11e7-9363-746804bb9832.png)\r\n\r\nThe search results appear as a tree. In the previous results, you can see that a reference to `Microsoft.AspNetCore.Mvc.Core` version 1.1.2 is discovered.\r\n\r\nUnder the Dependencies node is a NuGet node. Under the NuGet node is the list of packages you have directly taken a dependency on and their versions.\r\nIn screenshot, the application takes a direct dependency on `Microsoft.AspNetCore.Mvc`. `Microsoft.AspNetCore.Mvc` in turn has leaf nodes that list its dependencies and their versions.\r\nThe `Microsoft.AspNetCore.Mvc` package takes a dependency on a version of `Microsoft.AspNetCore.Mvc.ApiExplorer`, that in turn takes a dependency on a version of `Microsoft.AspNetCore.Mvc.Core`.\r\n\r\n##### <a name=\"project-assets-json\"></a>Manually reviewing project.assets.json\r\n\r\nOpen the *project.assets.json* file from your project’s obj directory in your editor. We suggest you use an editor that understands JSON and allows you to collapse and expand nodes to review this file.\r\nVisual Studio and Visual Studio Code provide JSON friendly editing.\r\n\r\nSearch the *project.assets.json* file for the [vulnerable package](#affected-software), using the format `packagename/` for each of the package names from the preceding table. If you find the assembly name in your search:\r\n\r\n* Examine the line on which they are found, the version number is after the `/`.\r\n* Compare to the [vulnerable versions table](#affected-software).\r\n\r\nFor example, a search result that shows `System.Security.Cryptography.Xml/4.4.0` is a reference to version 4.4.0 of `System.Security.Cryptography.Xml`.\r\nIf your *project.assets.json* file includes references to the [vulnerable package](#affected-software), then you need to fix the transitive dependencies.\r\n\r\n##### Fixing transitive dependencies\r\n\r\nIf you have not found any reference to any vulnerable packages, this means either\r\n\r\n* None of your direct dependencies depend on any vulnerable packages, or\r\n* You have already fixed the problem by updating the direct dependencies.\r\n\r\nIf your transitive dependency review found references to the [vulnerable package](#affected-software), you must add a direct dependency to the updated package to your *csproj* file to override the transitive dependency.\r\n\r\nOpen *projectname.csproj* in your editor. If you're using Visual Studio, right-click the project and choose **Edit projectname.csproj** from the context menu, where projectname is the name of your project.\r\nLook for `PackageReference` nodes, for example:\r\n\r\n```xml\r\n<Project Sdk=\"Microsoft.NET.Sdk.\">\r\n  <PropertyGroup>\r\n    <TargetFramework>net461</TargetFramework>\r\n  </PropertyGroup>\r\n  <ItemGroup>\r\n    <PackageReference Include=\"ThirdParty.NotUpdatedYet\" Version=\"2.0.0\" />\r\n  </ItemGroup>\r\n</Project>\r\n```\r\n\r\nYou must add a direct dependency to the updated version of the [vulnerable package](#affected-software) by adding it to the *csproj* file.\r\nYou do this by adding a new line to the dependencies section, referencing the fixed version.\r\nFor example, if your search showed a transitive reference to a vulnerable `Microsoft.AspNetCore.Server.Kestrel.Core` version, you'd add a reference to the [fixed package number](#affected-software).\r\n\r\n```xml\r\n<Project Sdk=\"Microsoft.NET.Sdk.Web\">\r\n  <PropertyGroup>\r\n    <TargetFramework>net461</TargetFramework>\r\n  </PropertyGroup>\r\n  <ItemGroup>\r\n    <PackageReference Include=\"Microsoft.AspNetCore.Server.Kestrel.Core\" Version=\"2.0.3\" />\r\n    <PackageReference Include=\"ThirdParty.NotUpdatedYet\" Version=\"2.0.0\" />\r\n  </ItemGroup>\r\n</Project>\r\n```\r\n\r\nAfter you've added the direct dependency reference, save your *csproj* file.\r\n\r\nIf you're using Visual Studio, save your updated *csproj* file and Visual Studio will restore the new package versions.\r\nYou can see the restore results by opening the **Output** window (Ctrl+Alt+O) and changing the **Show output from** drop-down list to **Package Manager**.\r\n\r\nIf you're not using Visual Studio, open a command line and change to your project directory. Execute the `dotnet restore` command to restore the new dependencies.\r\n\r\n#### Rebuilding your application\r\n\r\nFinally you must rebuild your application, test, and redeploy.\r\n\r\n## Other Information\r\n\r\n### Reporting Security Issues\r\n\r\nIf you have found a potential security issue in .NET Core, please email details to secure@microsoft.com.

We will continue to ship patches and security fixes for the existing aspnetcore images but any new images for 2.1 and higher will be pushed to microsoft/dotnet.\r\n\r\nDockerfiles using `microsoft/aspnetcore:<version>` should change to `microsoft/dotnet:<version>-aspnetcore-runtime`.\r\n\r\nDockerfiles using `microsoft/aspnetcore-build` that do not require Node should just change to `microsoft/dotnet:<version>-sdk`.\r\n\r\nDockerfiles using Node from the `microsoft/aspnetcore-build` image will either need to install Node into their own image or use mult-stage builds as described in the Dockerfile examples at the end of this announcement.\r\n\r\nThe `ASPNETCORE_URLS` env var that allows ASP.NET Core apps to accept traffic from outside the container will be set in all the `dotnet` images, which was a common early stumbling block for people getting started with ASP.NET Core and Docker. PR is [here](https://github.com/dotnet/dotnet-docker/pull/450)\r\n\r\n### Why the merge?\r\n\r\nFor some time we have been seeing people search for and find the `microsoft/dotnet` images and never realise that there are aspnetcore ones. This could be problematic in the past as the dotnet images were not optimised for ASP.NET Core, making things a little harder or slower. But with changes in the way ASP.NET Core works in 2.1 it was going to be much more impactful, in that ASP.NET Core applications were not likely to run on the base dotnet image. Given that we also thought it made more sense to have a single repository for all images, as ASP.NET is just part of .NET, we are taking this opportunity to remove the potential source of confusion and wasted time for our customers.\r\n\r\n### Why no Node?\r\nThere are two main reasons for this:\r\n\r\n  1. Multi-stage build now makes it easier to pull in the Node image for purely build concerns.\r\n  2. The ASP.NET Core templates no longer have a hard dependency on Node.\r\n\r\n\r\nFor discussion and feedback on this decision you can go here: [https://github.com/aspnet/aspnet-docker/issues/403](https://github.com/aspnet/aspnet-docker/issues/403)\r\n\r\n### Dockerfile examples\r\n\r\nIf you need Node then you will need to add it in your own Dockerfile, like this:\r\n\r\n```Dockerfile\r\nFROM microsoft/dotnet:2.1-sdk as build-env\r\nWORKDIR /app\r\n#setup node\r\nENV NODE_VERSION 8.9.4\r\nENV NODE_DOWNLOAD_SHA 21fb4690e349f82d708ae766def01d7fec1b085ce1f5ab30d9bda8ee126ca8fc\r\n\r\nRUN curl -SL \"https://nodejs.org/dist/v${NODE_VERSION}/node-v${NODE_VERSION}-linux-x64.tar.gz\" --output nodejs.tar.gz \\\r\n    && echo \"$NODE_DOWNLOAD_SHA nodejs.tar.gz\" | sha256sum -c - \\\r\n    && tar -xzf \"nodejs.tar.gz\" -C /usr/local --strip-components=1 \\\r\n    && rm nodejs.tar.gz \\\r\n    && ln -s /usr/local/bin/node /usr/local/bin/nodejs\r\n\r\n# copy csproj and restore as distinct layers\r\nCOPY *.csproj ./\r\nRUN dotnet restore\r\n\r\n# copy everything else and build\r\nCOPY . ./\r\nRUN dotnet publish -c Release -o out\r\n\r\n# build runtime image\r\nFROM microsoft/dotnet:2.1-aspnetcore-runtime\r\nWORKDIR /app\r\n#setup node, this is only needed if you use Node both at runtime and build time.

This advisory also provides guidance on what developers can do to update their applications to remove this vulnerability.\r\n\r\nMicrosoft is aware of a security vulnerability in all public versions of ASP.NET Core where an elevation of privilege vulnerability exists when a ASP.NET Core web application fails to validate web requests correctly.\r\n\r\n## Discussion\r\n\r\nDiscussion for this issue can be found at https://github.com/aspnet/Home/issues/2954\r\n\r\n### Mitigation factors\r\n\r\nSites are not vulnerable to this elevation of privilege when:\r\n\r\n* The site is hosted behind a proxy, such as Internet Information Services (IIS), NGINX, or Apache, where:\r\n\r\n  * The proxy validates the host header, and\r\n  * The proxy is configured to listen on fully qualified domain names or\r\n  * The proxy is configured with a wildcard subdomain where the root domain is fully controlled by the site owner.\r\n\r\nFor example, if IIS is configured to respond to requests for `contoso.com` or `*.contoso.com` hosts, the application is protected.\r\n\r\nIf IIS is configured to respond to any request from any host, the application is vulnerable.\r\n\r\nKestrel does not have the capability to validate host headers and is vulnerable if not placed behind a proxy that performs the host header validation.\r\n\r\nApps hosted in Azure Web Apps are not susceptible to this vulnerability.\r\n\r\n## <a name=\"affected-software\"></a>Affected software\r\n\r\nAny ASP.NET Core hosted application which is directly exposed to the internet, or hosted behind a proxy which does not validate or restict host headers to known good values.\r\n\r\nThe vulnerability also affects any ASP.NET Core 2.0 project if it uses the following package versions, which must also be [updated](#app-update), in addition to addressing your proxy configuration :\r\n\r\nPackage name | Vulnerable versions | Secure versions\r\n------------ | ---------------- | -------------------------\r\nMicrosoft.AspNetCore.HttpOverrides | 2.0.0, 2.0.1 |  2.0.2 and later\r\nMicrosoft.AspNetCore.Server.Kestrel.Core | 2.0.0, 2.0.1 |  2.0.2 and later\r\n\r\n*No patches are available for ASP.NET Core 1.0.x or ASP.NET Core 1.1.x. Microsoft requires that you place your 1.x ASP.NET Core application behind a proxy.\r\nYou must address the configuration of your proxy to protect your application. If you're not running ASP.NET Core 1.x behind a proxy, you must either place a proxy in front of your application or upgrade to ASP.NET Core 2.0.\r\nand add the host validating middleware provided at https://github.com/aspnet/BasicMiddleware/blob/release/2.0/samples/HostFilteringSample/.*\r\n\r\n## Advisory FAQ\r\n### How do I know if I am affected?\r\n\r\nReview the server and proxy configuration [instructions](#configuration) below to see if your system is configured correctly, and adjust the configuration if necessary.\r\n\r\n### How do I fix the issue?\r\n\r\nYou must address the [configuration](#configuration) of your server or proxy to protect your application to limit requests to known hosts.\r\n\r\nIf you're not running Kestrel 1.x behind a proxy, you must either place a proxy in front of your application or upgrade to ASP.NET Core 2.0 and follow the 2.0 instructions below.\r\n\r\nASP.NET Core 2.0.x applications must [update your code](#app-update) to fully protect your application.\r\n\r\n#### <a name=\"configuration\"></a> Server and Proxy configuration\r\n\r\nYou must examine your externally facing server or proxy configuration and ensure it requires host headers with fully qualified domain names, or known sub-domains if you are using sub-domain wild cards.\r\n\r\n##### ASP.NET Core applications behind [IIS](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/aspnet/core/host-and-deploy/iis/)\r\n\r\nTo configure IIS to only respond to know hosts:\r\n\r\n* Open IIS Manager.\r\n* Expand the **Sites** node for the machine you want to configure.\r\n* Select the site by clicking on the site.\r\n* In the **Actions** list on the right-hand side of IIS Manager, click **Bindings**.\r\n* Edit any bindings that do not have a host name to specify one. Do not use a `*` wildcard unless it's against a domain under your control. For example, `*.contoso.com` is safe, `*.com` is not.\r\n\r\n##### ASP.NET Core applications running publicly on [Kestrel](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/aspnet/core/fundamentals/servers/kestrel)\r\n\r\nKestrel does not have the capability to validate host headers. It must either be placed behind a proxy that performs the host header validation or the validation must be performed within the application by adding  host filtering middleware provided at https://github.com/aspnet/BasicMiddleware/blob/release/2.0/samples/HostFilteringSample/. You must also [update your dependencies](#app-update) to fully protect your application.\r\n\r\n##### ASP.NET Core applications running on [HTTP.SYS](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/aspnet/core/fundamentals/servers/httpsys)\r\n\r\nTo configure URL prefixes and ports, you can use the `UseUrls` extension method, the `urls` command-line argument, the ASPNETCORE_URLS environment variable, or the `UrlPrefixes` property on [HttpSysOptions](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/api/microsoft.aspnetcore.server.httpsys.httpsysoptions). The following code example uses `UrlPrefixes`.\r\n\r\n```c#\r\npublic static IWebHost BuildWebHost(string[] args) =>\r\n    WebHost.CreateDefaultBuilder(args)\r\n        .UseStartup<Startup>()\r\n        .UseHttpSys(options =>\r\n        {\r\n            // The following options are set to default values.\r\n            options.Authentication.Schemes = AuthenticationSchemes.None;\r\n            options.Authentication.AllowAnonymous = true;\r\n            options.MaxConnections = null;\r\n            options.MaxRequestBodySize = 30000000;\r\n            options.UrlPrefixes.Add(\"http://localhost:5000\");\r\n        })\r\n        .Build();\r\n```\r\n\r\n##### ASP.NET Core applications behind [NGINX](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/aspnet/core/host-and-deploy/linux-nginx)\r\n\r\nTo configure NGINX as a reverse proxy to forward requests to your ASP.NET Core app, replace the contents */etc/nginx/sites-available/default* with the following:\r\n\r\n```NGINX\r\nserver {\r\n    listen        80;\r\n    server_name   example.com *.example.com;\r\n    location / {\r\n        proxy_pass         http://localhost:5000;\r\n        proxy_http_version 1.1;\r\n        proxy_set_header   Upgrade $http_upgrade;\r\n        proxy_set_header   Connection keep-alive;\r\n        proxy_set_header   Host $host;\r\n        proxy_cache_bypass $http_upgrade;\r\n    }\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nNote that with NGINX, when there is no match for `server_name`, NGINX will pick the default server. If no default server has been defined, the first server in the conf file is the default server. Best practice is to add a specific default server which returns a status code of 444 in the conf file. An example default server configuration would be as follows:\r\n\r\n```NGINX\r\nserver {\r\n    listen   80 default_server;\r\n    # listen [::]:80 default_server deferred;\r\n    return   444;\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nWith the preceding configuration file and default server, NGINX accepts public traffic on port 80 with host header `example.com` or `*.example.com`. Requests not matching these hosts won't get forwarded to Kestrel. NGINX forwards the matching requests to Kestrel at `http://localhost:5000`. See [How nginx processes a request](https://nginx.org/docs/http/request_processing.html) for more information.\r\n\r\nOnce the NGINX configuration is established, run `sudo nginx -t` to verify the syntax of the configuration files. If the configuration file test is successful, force NGINX to pick up the changes by running `sudo nginx -s reload`.\r\n\r\n##### ASP.NET Core applications behind [Apache](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/aspnet/core/host-and-deploy/linux-apache)\r\n\r\nConfiguration files for Apache are located within the `/etc/httpd/conf.d/` directory. Any file with the `*.conf*` extension:\r\n\r\n* Is processed in alphabetical order, and\r\n* The module configuration files in `/etc/httpd/conf.modules.d/` are processed. The module configuration files in `/etc/httpd/conf.modules.d/` contain any configuration files necessary to load modules.\r\n\r\n\r\n```\r\n<VirtualHost *:80>\r\n    ProxyPreserveHost On\r\n    ProxyPass / http://127.0.0.1:5000/\r\n    ProxyPassReverse / http://127.0.0.1:5000/\r\n    ServerName www.example.com\r\n    ServerAlias *.example.com\r\n</VirtualHost>\r\n```\r\n\r\nThe `VirtualHost` block can appear multiple times, in one or more files on a server. In the preceding configuration file, Apache accepts public traffic on port 80. The domain `www.example.com` is being served, and the `*.example.com` alias resolves to the same website. See [Name-based virtual host support](https://httpd.apache.org/docs/current/vhosts/name-based.html) for more information. Requests are proxied at the root to port 5000 of the server at 127.0.0.1. For bi-directional communication, `ProxyPass` and `ProxyPassReverse` are required.\r\n\r\nSave the file and test the configuration. If everything passes, the response is `Syntax [OK]`.\r\n\r\n```bash\r\nsudo service httpd configtest\r\n```\r\n\r\nRestart Apache:\r\n\r\n```bash\r\nsudo systemctl restart httpd\r\nsudo systemctl enable httpd\r\n```\r\n\r\n\r\n#### <a name=\"app-update\"></a> ASP.NET Core 2.0 application code updates\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\nIf you're targeting .NET Core 2.x and the `Microsoft.AspNetCore.All` \"metapackage\":\r\n\r\n* Update its version number to 2.0.6 or later.\r\n* Updating will pull in the fixed packages listed above.\r\n\r\nIf you're targeting .NET Framework, update the packages listed above to their safe version or later.\r\n\r\nIf your application is using Kestrel without a proxy or the HttpOverrides functionality (UseForwardedHeaders with ForwardedHost) you must also add the host filtering middleware provided at https://github.com/aspnet/BasicMiddleware/tree/release/2.0/samples/HostFilteringSample/.\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n.NET Core and ASP.NET Core have two types of dependencies: direct and transitive. You must follow the update instructions below to address both types of dependency.\r\n\r\n### Direct dependencies\r\n\r\nDirect dependencies are dependencies where you specifically add a package to your project. For example, if you add the `Microsoft.AspNetCore.Mvc` package to your project then you have taken a direct dependency on `Microsoft.AspNetCore.Mvc`.\r\n\r\nDirect dependencies are discoverable by examining your *csproj* file.\r\n\r\n### Transitive dependencies\r\n\r\nTransitive dependencies occur when you add a package to your project that in turn relies on another package. For example, if you add the `Microsoft.AspNetCore.Mvc` package to your project it depends on the `Microsoft.AspNetCore.Mvc.Core` package (among others). Your project has a direct dependency on `Microsoft.AspNetCore.Mvc` and a transitive dependency on the `Microsoft.AspNetCore.Mvc.Core` package.\r\nTransitive dependencies are reviewable:\r\n\r\n* In the Visual Studio Solution Explorer window, which supports searching.\r\n* By examining the *project.assets.json* file contained in the obj directory of your project.\r\n\r\nThe *project.assets.json* files are the authoritative list of all packages used by your project, containing both direct and transitive dependencies.\r\n\r\n\r\n##### Fixing direct dependencies – Projects targeting .NET Core\r\n\r\nOpen *projectname.csproj* in your editor. If you're using Visual Studio, right-click the project and choose **Edit projectname.csproj** from the content menu, where projectname is the name of your project. Look for `PackageReference` elements. The following shows an example project file:\r\n\r\n```xml\r\n<Project Sdk=\"Microsoft.NET.Sdk.Web\">\r\n  <PropertyGroup>\r\n    <TargetFramework>netcoreapp2.0</TargetFramework>\r\n  </PropertyGroup>\r\n  <ItemGroup>\r\n    <PackageReference Include=\"Microsoft.AspNetCore.All\" Version=\"2.0.5\" />\r\n  </ItemGroup>\r\n  <ItemGroup>\r\n    <DotNetCliToolReference Include=\"Microsoft.VisualStudio.Web.CodeGeneration.Tools\" Version=\"2.0.0\" />\r\n  </ItemGroup>\r\n</Project>\r\n```\r\n\r\nThe preceding example has a reference to the vulnerable metapackage, as seen by the single `PackageReference` element. The name of the package is in the `Include` attribute. The package version number is in the `Version` attribute. The example shows a single direct dependency on `Microsoft.AspNetCore.All` version 2.0.5.\r\n\r\nTo update the version to the secure package, change the version number to a secure package version. In this example, update `Microsoft.AspNetCore.All` to 2.0.6 or later. Save the *csproj* file. The example *csproj* now looks as follows:\r\n\r\n```xml\r\n<Project Sdk=\"Microsoft.NET.Sdk.Web\">\r\n  <PropertyGroup>\r\n    <TargetFramework>netcoreapp2.0</TargetFramework>\r\n  </PropertyGroup>\r\n  <ItemGroup>\r\n    <PackageReference Include=\"Microsoft.AspNetCore.All\" Version=\"2.0.6\" />\r\n  </ItemGroup>\r\n  <ItemGroup>\r\n    <DotNetCliToolReference Include=\"Microsoft.VisualStudio.Web.CodeGeneration.Tools\" Version=\"2.0.0\" />\r\n  </ItemGroup>\r\n</Project>\r\n```\r\n\r\nIf you're using Visual Studio and save your updated *csproj* file, Visual Studio will restore the new package version. You can see the restore results by opening the **Output** window (Ctrl+Alt+O) and changing the **Show output from** drop-down list to **Package Manager**.\r\n\r\nIf you're not using Visual Studio, open a command line and change to your project directory. Execute the `dotnet restore` command to restore the updated dependencies.\r\n\r\n##### Fixing direct dependencies – Projects targeting .NET Framework\r\n\r\nOpen *projectname.csproj* in your editor. If you're using Visual Studio, right-click the project and choose **Edit projectname.csproj** from the content menu, where projectname is the name of your project. Look for `PackageReference` nodes. The following shows an example project file:\r\n\r\n```xml\r\n<Project Sdk=\"Microsoft.NET.Sdk.Web\">\r\n  <PropertyGroup>\r\n    <TargetFramework>net461</TargetFramework>\r\n  </PropertyGroup>\r\n  <ItemGroup>\r\n    <PackageReference Include=\"Microsoft.AspNetCore.HttpOverrides\" Version=\"2.0.1\" />\r\n  </ItemGroup>\r\n  <ItemGroup>\r\n    <DotNetCliToolReference Include=\"Microsoft.VisualStudio.Web.CodeGeneration.Tools\" Version=\"2.0.0\" />\r\n  </ItemGroup>\r\n</Project>\r\n```\r\n\r\nThe example has a reference to a single package, as seen by the `PackageReference` element. The name of the package is in the `Include` attribute. The package version number is in the `Version` attribute. The example shows a direct dependency on one of the vulnerable packages from the table above, `Microsoft.AspNetCore.HttpOverrides` version 2.0.1.\r\n\r\nTo update to the secure package, change the version number to the updated package version. In the example, this would be updating `Microsoft.AspNetCore.HttpOverrides` to 2.0.2 and later. Save the *csproj* file. The updated and secure *csproj* look as follows:\r\n\r\n``` XML\r\n<Project Sdk=\"Microsoft.NET.Sdk.Web\">\r\n  <PropertyGroup>\r\n    <TargetFramework>net461</TargetFramework>\r\n  </PropertyGroup>\r\n  <ItemGroup>\r\n    <PackageReference Include=\"Microsoft.AspNetCore.HttpOverrides\" Version=\"2.0.2\" />\r\n  </ItemGroup>\r\n  <ItemGroup>\r\n    <DotNetCliToolReference Include=\"Microsoft.VisualStudio.Web.CodeGeneration.Tools\" Version=\"2.0.0\" />\r\n  </ItemGroup>\r\n</Project>\r\n```\r\n\r\nIf you're using Visual Studio and save your updated *csproj* file, Visual Studio will restore the new package version. You can see the restore results by opening the **Output** window (Ctrl+Alt+O) and changing the **Show output from** drop-down list to **Package Manager**.\r\n\r\nIf you're not using Visual Studio, open a command line and change to your project directory. Execute the `dotnet restore` command to restore the new dependency version.\r\n\r\n##### After updating your direct dependencies\r\n\r\nRecompile your application.\r\n\r\nIf after recompilation you see a *Dependency conflict warning*, you must update your other direct dependencies to a compatible version. \r\n\r\nFor example if your project refers directly to `Microsoft.AspNetCore.Mvc.Cors` with a version number of `2.0.0`, when you update your `Microsoft.AspNetCore.Mvc` package to 2.0.1, compilation will throw:\r\n\r\n`NU1012      Dependency conflict. Microsoft.AspNetCore.Mvc 2.0.1 expected Microsoft.AspNetCore.Mvc.Cors >= 2.0.1 but received 2.0.0`\r\n\r\nTo fix this, edit the version for the expected package to be the version expected by updating your *project.json* in the same way that you used to update the vulnerable package versions.\r\n\r\nAfter you've addressed all of your direct dependencies, you must review your transitive dependencies.\r\n\r\n###### Reviewing transitive dependencies\r\n\r\nThere are two ways to view transitive dependencies. You can either use Visual Studio’s Solution Explorer, or you can review the *project.assets.json* file.\r\n\r\n###### Using Visual Studio Solution Explorer\r\n\r\nTo use Solution Explorer, open the project in Visual Studio 2017, and then press Ctrl+; to activate the search in Solution Explorer. Search for each of the vulnerable package names above and make a note of the version numbers of any results you find.\r\n\r\nFor example, searching for `Microsoft.AspNetCore.Mvc.Core` in an example project that contains a package that takes a dependency on `Microsoft.AspNetCore.Mvc` shows the following results in Visual Studio 2017:\r\n\r\n![vs2017](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/796298/25858816/8ecdc2b4-3491-11e7-9363-746804bb9832.png)\r\n\r\nThe search results appear as a tree. In these results, you can see a reference to `Microsoft.AspNetCore.Mvc.Core` version 1.1.2 is discovered.\r\n\r\nUnder the Dependencies node is a NuGet node. Under the NuGet node is the list of packages you have directly taken a dependency on and their versions. In this example, the application takes a direct dependency on `Microsoft.AspNetCore.Mvc`. `Microsoft.AspNetCore.Mvc` in turn has leaf nodes that list its dependencies and their versions. In the example, the `Microsoft.AspNetCore.Mvc` package takes a dependency on a version of `Microsoft.AspNetCore.Mvc.ApiExplorer`, that in turn takes a dependency on a vulnerable version of `Microsoft.AspNetCore.Mvc.Core`.\r\n\r\n###### Manually reviewing project.assets.json (VS2017)\r\n\r\nOpen the *project.assets.json* file from your project’s obj directory in your editor. We suggest you use an editor that understands JSON and allows you to collapse and expand nodes to review this file. Visual Studio and Visual Studio Code provide JSON friendly editing.\r\n\r\nSearch the *project.assets.json* file for each of the vulnerable packages, using the format `packagename/` for each of the package names from the preceding table. If you find the assembly name in your search:\r\n\r\n* Examine the line on which they are found, the version number is after the `/`.\r\n* Compare to the vulnerable versions table above.\r\n\r\nFor example, a search result that shows `Microsoft.AspNetCore.Mvc.Cors/1.1.0` is a reference to v1.1.0 of `Microsoft.AspNetCore.Mvc.Cors`.   If your *project.assets.json* file includes references to any of the vulnerable packages shown above, then you need to fix the transitive dependencies.\r\n\r\n###### Overriding transitive dependencies\r\n\r\nIf you have not found any reference to any vulnerable packages this means:\r\n\r\n* None of your direct dependencies depend on any vulnerable packages, or\r\n* You have already fixed the problem by updating the direct dependencies.\r\n\r\nIf your transitive dependency review found references to any of the vulnerable packages you must add a direct dependency to the updated package to your *csproj* file to override the transitive dependency.\r\n\r\nOpen *projectname.csproj* in your editor. If you're using Visual Studio, right-click the project and choose **Edit projectname.csproj** from the content menu, where projectname is the name of your project. Look for `PackageReference` nodes, for example:\r\n\r\n```xml\r\n<Project Sdk=\"Microsoft.NET.Sdk.Web\">\r\n  <PropertyGroup>\r\n    <TargetFramework>net461</TargetFramework>\r\n  </PropertyGroup>\r\n  <ItemGroup>\r\n    <PackageReference Include=\"ThirdParty.NotUpdatedYet\" Version=\"2.0.0\" />\r\n  </ItemGroup>\r\n  <ItemGroup>\r\n    <DotNetCliToolReference Include=\"Microsoft.VisualStudio.Web.CodeGeneration.Tools\" Version=\"2.0.0\" />\r\n  </ItemGroup>\r\n</Project>\r\n```\r\n\r\nFor each of the vulnerable packages your search returned, you must add a direct dependency to the updated version by adding it to the *csproj* file.\r\nYou do this by adding a new line to the dependencies section, referring the fixed version.\r\nFor example, if your search showed a transitive reference to the vulnerable `Microsoft.AspNetCore.HttpOverrides` version 2.0.0 you would add a reference to the fixed version, that is, 2.0.2 or later.\r\n\r\n```xml\r\n<Project Sdk=\"Microsoft.NET.Sdk.Web\">\r\n  <PropertyGroup>\r\n    <TargetFramework>net461</TargetFramework>\r\n  </PropertyGroup>\r\n  <ItemGroup>\r\n    <PackageReference Include=\"Microsoft.AspNetCore.HttpOverride\" Version=\"2.0.2\" />\r\n    <PackageReference Include=\"ThirdParty.NotUpdatedYet\" Version=\"2.0.0\" />\r\n  </ItemGroup>\r\n  <ItemGroup>\r\n    <DotNetCliToolReference Include=\"Microsoft.VisualStudio.Web.CodeGeneration.Tools\" Version=\"2.0.0\" />\r\n  </ItemGroup>\r\n</Project>\r\n```\r\n\r\nAfter you have added the direct dependency reference, save your *csproj* file.\r\n\r\nIf you're using Visual Studio, save your updated *csproj* file and Visual Studio will restore the new package versions.\r\nYou can see the restore results by opening the **Output** window (Ctrl+Alt+O) and changing the **Show output from** drop-down list to **Package Manager**.\r\n\r\nIf you're not using Visual Studio, open a command line and change to your project directory. Execute the `dotnet restore` command to restore the new dependencies.\r\n\r\n###### Rebuilding your application\r\n\r\nRebuild your application.

These images will continue to receive patch update whenever a 1.0.x, 1.1.x, or 2.0.x update ships, however, we will not produce a new version which contains the 2.1 runtime.\r\n\r\n### Why?\r\n \r\nThese images existed to support CI/CD pipelines that run apps on multiple versions for .NET Core in the same container. With each release, these images have grown in size. The 1.0-2.0 image is already about 1GB, and would continue to grow with runtime updates. \r\n \r\nFortunately, recent improvements to .NET Core (such as minor version roll-forward) and Docker (multi-stage builds) have reduced the need to use an image with multiple versions of .NET Core. We have seen usage of these multi-version images declining over time, and today, they are a small percentage of our Docker image usage.\r\n\r\nRather than maintaining a single, large image with all possible .NET Core runtimes, we encourage users to use multi-stage builds. Docker's multi-stage feature allows you to compose a single Dockerfile, but still use multiple .NET Core runtimes. Also, starting in 2.1, .NET Core supports rolling forward the runtime version within the major version, which will further reduce the need to have multiple 2.x runtimes side-by-side.\r\n \r\nFor discussion, use https://github.com/aspnet/aspnet-docker/issues/349","Url":"https://github.com/aspnet/Announcements/issues/292","RelatedDescription":"Open issue \"Deprecating the `microsoft/aspnetcore-build:1.0-2.0` Docker image\" (#292)"},{"Id":"301939059","IsPullRequest":false,"CreatedAt":"2018-03-02T23:33:38","Actor":"blowdart","Number":"291","RawContent":null,"Title":"Statement on ASP.NET susceptibility to the recent DuoLabs SAML vulnerability announcement.","State":"open","Body":"This week saw an announcement of vulnerabilities in  SAML parsing libraries by [DUO Labs](https://duo.com/blog/duo-finds-saml-vulnerabilities-affecting-multiple-implementations).

This advisory also provides guidance on what developers can do to update their applications correctly.\r\n\r\nMicrosoft is aware of an elevation of privilege vulnerability exists when a ASP.NET Core web application, created using vulnerable project templates, fails to properly sanitize web requests. An attacker who successfully exploited this vulnerability could perform content injection attacks and run script in the security context of the logged-on user.\r\n\r\nTo exploit the vulnerability, an attacker could send a specially crafted email, containing a malicious link, to a user. Alternatively, an attacker could use a chat client to social engineer a user into clicking the malicious link. However, in all cases to exploit this vulnerability a user must click a maliciously crafted link from an attacker.\r\n\r\nThe security update addresses the vulnerability by correcting the ASP.NET Core project templates.\r\n\r\nDevelopers who have generated applications from the vulnerable templates should change their code using the following instructions. They should also change their code to address a further vulnerability,  [CVE-2018-0785](https://github.com/aspnet/Announcements/issues/284), which is in the same templates. Finally installing the latest .NET Core SDK, version 2.1.4, from https://www.microsoft.com/net/download/ will update the templates to correct the issue for any new applications created.\r\n\r\n### Discussion\r\n\r\nPlease use https://github.com/aspnet/templating/issues/225 for discussion of this advisory.\r\n\r\n### Mitigation Factors\r\nASP.NET Core applications which are not created using the ASP.NET Core 2.0 Individual Authentication templates are not vulnerable to this issue.\r\n\r\n## Affected Software\r\nThe vulnerabilities affect any Microsoft .NET Core project if it uses any of affected runtime versions listed below and have generated applications using Individual Authentication with usernames and passwords stored within the application. Applications which use Azure Active Directory, or Azure Active Directory B2C are not affected.\r\n\r\nVulnerable .NET SDK Version | Fixed SDK Version\r\n----------------| -------------------------\r\n2.0.0, 2.0.2, 2.0.3, 2.1.2, 2.1.3 |  2.1.4\r\n\r\n### Advisory FAQ\r\n#### How do I know if I am affected?\r\n\r\nYour application will be affected if you generated it using the ASP.NET 2.0 Web Application template or the ASP.NET 2.0 Web Application (Model/View/Controller) template from a vulnerable SDK version where you have selected individual authentication where user accounts are stored in-app.\r\n\r\nTo check the runtimes installed on a computer you must view the contents of the runtime folder. By default these are\r\n\r\n| Operating System          | Location          |\r\n|---------------------------|-------------------|\r\n| Windows | C:\\Program Files\\dotnet\\sdk\\ |\r\n| macOS | /usr/local/share/dotnet/sdk/    |\r\n| Supported Linux platforms | /usr/share/dotnet/sdk/   |\r\n\r\nEach SDK version is installed in its own directory, where the directory name is the version number. If you do not have a directory for 2.1.4 then any applications generated for ASP.NET Core 2.0 using Individual Authentication may be vulnerable.. Downloads for all supported platforms can be acquired from https://www.microsoft.com/net/download/\r\n\r\n#### How do I fix my affected application?\r\nApplications can be fixed by changing the code created during application generation using the following instructions.\r\n\r\n#### For ASP.NET Core 2.0 Web Application (Razor Pages)\r\n\r\n1. Open `Pages\\Account\\Manage\\EnableAuthenticator.cshtml.cs` find the `OnPostAsync()` method and search for the following line\r\n\r\n```\r\n<div id=\"qrCodeData\" data-url=\"@Html.Raw(Model.AuthenticatorUri)\"></div>\r\n```\r\n\r\nReplace this line with the following code, removing the call to `Html.Raw()`\r\n\r\n```C#\r\n<div id=\"qrCodeData\" data-url=\"@Model.AuthenticatorUri\"></div>\r\n```\r\n\r\n2. Open the `Pages\\Account\\Manage\\EnableAuthenticator.cshtml.cs` and search for the following line, inside the `OnGetAsync()` method;\r\n\r\n```C#\r\nawait LoadSharedKeyAndQrCodeUriAsync(user);\r\n```\r\n\r\nRemove the code shown below which follows the call to `LoadSharedKeyAndQrCodeUriAsync(user);`\r\n\r\n```C#\r\nif (string.IsNullOrEmpty(SharedKey))\t\t\r\n{\t\t\r\n    await _userManager.ResetAuthenticatorKeyAsync(user);\t\t\r\n    await LoadSharedKeyAndQrCodeUriAsync(user);\t\t\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nThe `OnGetAsync()` method should now look like\r\n\r\n```C#\r\npublic async Task<IActionResult> OnGetAsync()\r\n{\r\n    var user = await _userManager.GetUserAsync(User);\r\n    if (user == null)\r\n    {\r\n        throw new ApplicationException($\"Unable to load user with ID '{_userManager.GetUserId(User)}'.\");\r\n    }\r\n\r\n    await LoadSharedKeyAndQrCodeUriAsync(user);\r\n\r\n    return Page();\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\n3. Still in the `Pages\\Account\\Manage\\EnableAuthenticator.cshtml.cs` file  and search for the `LoadSharedKeyAndQrCodeUriAsync(ApplicationUser user) function` and replace it with \r\n\r\n```C#\r\nprivate async Task LoadSharedKeyAndQrCodeUriAsync(ApplicationUser user)\r\n{\r\n    // Load the authenticator key & QR code URI to display on the form\r\n    var unformattedKey = await _userManager.GetAuthenticatorKeyAsync(user);\r\n    if (string.IsNullOrEmpty(unformattedKey))\r\n    {\r\n        await _userManager.ResetAuthenticatorKeyAsync(user);\r\n        unformattedKey = await _userManager.GetAuthenticatorKeyAsync(user);\r\n     }\r\n\r\n    SharedKey = FormatKey(unformattedKey);\r\n    AuthenticatorUri = GenerateQrCodeUri(user.Email, unformattedKey);\r\n }\r\n```\r\n\r\n4. Recompile your application and test you can generate 2fa recovery codes correctly, then redeploy your application.\r\n\r\n#### For ASP.NET Core 2.0 Web Application (Model/View/Controller)\r\n\r\n1. Open the `Controllers\\ManageController.cs` file and find the declaration for `private const string AuthenticatorUriFormat`. Add the following new const declaration below it;\r\n\r\n```C#\r\nprivate const string RecoveryCodesKey = nameof(RecoveryCodesKey);\r\n```\r\n\r\n2. Still in `Controllers\\ManageController.cs` file and find the `EnableAuthenticator()` function. Replace its contents with\r\n\r\n```C#\r\n[HttpGet]\r\npublic async Task<IActionResult> EnableAuthenticator()\r\n{\r\n    var user = await _userManager.GetUserAsync(User);\r\n    if (user == null)\r\n    {\r\n        throw new ApplicationException($\"Unable to load user with ID '{_userManager.GetUserId(User)}'.\");\r\n    }\r\n\r\n    var model = new EnableAuthenticatorViewModel();\r\n    await LoadSharedKeyAndQrCodeUriAsync(user, model);\r\n\r\n    return View(model);\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\n3. Still in `Controllers\\ManageController.cs` file and find the `EnableAuthenticator(EnableAuthenticatorViewModel model)` method. Replace its contents with\r\n\r\n```C#\r\n[HttpPost]\r\n[ValidateAntiForgeryToken]\r\npublic async Task<IActionResult> EnableAuthenticator(EnableAuthenticatorViewModel model)\r\n{\r\n    var user = await _userManager.GetUserAsync(User);\r\n    if (user == null)\r\n    {\r\n        throw new ApplicationException($\"Unable to load user with ID '{_userManager.GetUserId(User)}'.\");\r\n    }\r\n\r\n    if (!ModelState.IsValid)\r\n    {\r\n        await LoadSharedKeyAndQrCodeUriAsync(user, model);\r\n        return View(model);\r\n     }\r\n\r\n    // Strip spaces and hypens\r\n    var verificationCode = model.Code.Replace(\" \", string.Empty).Replace(\"-\", string.Empty);\r\n\r\n    var is2faTokenValid = await _userManager.VerifyTwoFactorTokenAsync(\r\n        user, _userManager.Options.Tokens.AuthenticatorTokenProvider, verificationCode);\r\n\r\n    if (!is2faTokenValid)\r\n    {\r\n        ModelState.AddModelError(\"Code\", \"Verification code is invalid.\");\r\n        await LoadSharedKeyAndQrCodeUriAsync(user, model);\r\n        return View(model);\r\n    }\r\n\r\n    await _userManager.SetTwoFactorEnabledAsync(user, true);\r\n    _logger.LogInformation(\"User with ID {UserId} has enabled 2FA with an authenticator app.\", user.Id);\r\n    var recoveryCodes = await _userManager.GenerateNewTwoFactorRecoveryCodesAsync(user, 10);\r\n    TempData[RecoveryCodesKey] = recoveryCodes.ToArray();\r\n\r\n    return RedirectToAction(nameof(ShowRecoveryCodes));\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\n4. Still in `Controllers\\ManageController.cs` file create the following method after `EnableAuthenticator(EnableAuthenticatorViewModel model)`;\r\n\r\n```C#\r\n[HttpGet]\r\npublic IActionResult ShowRecoveryCodes()\r\n{\r\n    var recoveryCodes = (string[])TempData[RecoveryCodesKey];\r\n    if (recoveryCodes == null)\r\n    {\r\n        return RedirectToAction(nameof(TwoFactorAuthentication));\r\n    }\r\n\r\n    var model = new ShowRecoveryCodesViewModel { RecoveryCodes = recoveryCodes };\r\n    return View(model);\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\n5. Still in `Controllers\\ManageController.cs` file create the following method after the `GenerateQrCodeUri(string email, string unformattedKey)` method\r\n\r\n```C#\r\nprivate async Task LoadSharedKeyAndQrCodeUriAsync(ApplicationUser user, EnableAuthenticatorViewModel model)\r\n{\r\n    var unformattedKey = await _userManager.GetAuthenticatorKeyAsync(user);\r\n    if (string.IsNullOrEmpty(unformattedKey))\r\n    {\r\n        await _userManager.ResetAuthenticatorKeyAsync(user);\r\n        unformattedKey = await _userManager.GetAuthenticatorKeyAsync(user);\r\n    }\r\n\r\n    model.SharedKey = FormatKey(unformattedKey);\r\n    model.AuthenticatorUri = GenerateQrCodeUri(user.Email, unformattedKey);\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\n6. Still in `Controllers\\ManageController.cs` Create a new action method in the controller file, `GenerateRecoveryCodesWarning()` containing the following code\r\n\r\n```C#\r\n[HttpGet]\r\npublic async Task<IActionResult> GenerateRecoveryCodesWarning()\r\n{\r\n    var user = await _userManager.GetUserAsync(User);\r\n    if (user == null)\r\n    {\r\n        throw new ApplicationException($\"Unable to load user with ID '{_userManager.GetUserId(User)}'.\");\r\n    }\r\n\r\n    if (!user.TwoFactorEnabled)\r\n    {\r\n        throw new ApplicationException($\"Cannot generate recovery codes for user with ID '{user.Id}' because they do not have 2FA enabled.\");\r\n    }\r\n\r\n    return View(nameof(GenerateRecoveryCodesWarning));\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\n7. Open the `Models\\ManageViewModels\\EnableAuthenticatorViewModel.cs` file and add the following `using` reference;\r\n\r\n```C#\r\nusing Microsoft.AspNetCore.Mvc.ModelBinding;\r\n```\r\n\r\nthen replace the class declaration with \r\n\r\n```C# \r\npublic class EnableAuthenticatorViewModel\r\n{\r\n    [Required]\r\n    [StringLength(7, ErrorMessage = \"The {0} must be at least {2} and at max {1} characters long.\", MinimumLength = 6)]\r\n    [DataType(DataType.Text)]\r\n    [Display(Name = \"Verification Code\")]\r\n    public string Code { get; set; }\r\n\r\n    [BindNever]\r\n    public string SharedKey { get; set; }\r\n\r\n    [BindNever]\r\n    public string AuthenticatorUri { get; set; }\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\n8. Open the `Views\\Manage\\EnableAuthenticator.cshtml` file and replace the following line\r\n\r\n```\r\n<div id=\"qrCodeData\" data-url=\"@Html.Raw(Model.AuthenticatorUri)\"></div>\r\n```\r\n\r\nwith\r\n\r\n```\r\n<div id=\"qrCodeData\" data-url=\"@Model.AuthenticatorUri\"></div>\r\n```\r\n\r\nremove the call to `Html.Raw()`.\r\n\r\n9.

This feature is on by default and allows build time verification of the correctness of Razor files, and also faster startup performance. Additionally, MVC watches for changes to cshtml files and seamlessly updates build-time compiled views with runtime compiled views. This allows editing cshtml files and then refreshing the browser to see the changes.\r\n\r\nMVC uses the app's compilation context, details about the references and settings that were used to compile the source code (.cs) in the app, to compile views at runtime. In addition to the compilation context, MVC exposes options such as [RazorViewEngineOptions.CompilationCallback](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/api/microsoft.aspnetcore.mvc.razor.razorviewengineoptions.compilationcallback?view=aspnetcore-2.1) and [AdditionalCompilationReferences](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/api/microsoft.aspnetcore.mvc.razor.razorviewengineoptions.additionalcompilationreferences?view=aspnetcore-2.1) that allow configuring compilation specifically for runtime. \r\n\r\nRuntime specific customizations are unavailable at build time and consequently the two outputs could be different.\r\n\r\nTo address this inconsistency, we plan on removing APIs in MVC that change or modify runtime compilation. For 2.2.0, we're marking these APIs obsolete with the intent to remove them in 3.0.0.

Direct dependencies are dependencies where you specifically add a package to your project, transitive dependencies occur when you add a package to your project that in turn relies on another package.\r\n\r\nFor example, the `Microsoft.AspNetCore.Mvc` package depends on the `Microsoft.AspNetCore.Mvc.Core` package. When you add a dependency on `Microsoft.AspNetCore.Mvc` in your project, you're taking a transitive dependency on `Microsoft.AspNetCore.Mvc.Core`.\r\n\r\nAny application that has a direct or transitive dependency on the [affected package](#affected-software) can be exposed to the vulnerability if it does not meet any of the [mitigation factors](#mitigation-factors).\r\n\r\n### <a name=\"how-fix\"></a>How do I fix the issue?\r\n\r\n### ASP.NET Core 2.1\r\n\r\nTo update ASP.NET Core 2.1 you should [download](https://www.microsoft.com/net/download) and install the .NET Core SDK 2.1.302 on your development machines and build servers, and the .NET Core Runtime 2.1.2 on your deployment servers. Your application will roll forward to these versions on an application restart.\r\n\r\n### ASP.NET Core 2.0\r\n\r\nIf you're targeting ASP.NET Core 2.0 and using the `Microsoft.AspNetCore.All` metapackage update its version number to 2.0.9 to update the `Microsoft.AspNetCore.Server.Kestrel.Core` package, recompile, and redeploy. On your deployment servers, you should [download](https://github.com/dotnet/core/blob/master/release-notes/download-archives/2.0.9-download.md) and install the .NET Core 2.0.9 using the Windows Server Hosting Bundle for Windows and the `dotnet-hosting-2.0.9` package for Linux servers.\r\n\r\n### ASP.NET 2.0 & 2.1 not targeting the meta-packages\r\n\r\n.NET Core projects have two types of dependencies: direct and transitive. You must update your projects using the following instructions to address both types of dependency.\r\n\r\n#### Direct dependencies\r\n\r\nDirect dependencies are discoverable by examining your `csproj` file. They can be fixed by [editing the project file](#direct-dependencies) or using NuGet to update the dependency.\r\n\r\n#### Transitive dependencies\r\n\r\nTransitive dependencies occur when you add a package to your project that in turn relies on another package. For example, if Contoso publishes a package `Contoso.Utility` which, in turn, depends on `Contoso.Internals` and you add the `Contoso.Utility` package to your project now your project has a direct dependency on `Contoso.Utility` and, because `Contoso.Utility` depends 'Contoso.Internals', your application gains a transitive dependency on the `Contoso.Internals` package.\r\n\r\nTransitive dependencies are reviewable in three ways, depending on your [project format](#project-format):\r\n\r\n* In the Visual Studio Solution Explorer window, which supports searching.\r\n* By examining the `project.assets.json` file contained in the obj directory of your project for `csproj` based projects.\r\n\r\nThe `project.assets.json`files are the authoritative list of all packages used by your project, containing both direct and transitive dependencies.\r\n\r\n#### <a name=\"direct-dependencies-vs2017\"></a>Fixing direct dependencies in Visual Studio 2017\r\n\r\nOpen *projectname.csproj* in your editor. If you're using Visual Studio, right-click the project and choose **Edit projectname.csproj** from the context menu, where projectname is the name of your project. Look for `PackageReference` elements. The following shows an example project file:\r\n\r\n```xml\r\n<Project Sdk=\"Microsoft.NET.Sdk.Web\">\r\n  <PropertyGroup>\r\n    <TargetFramework>netcoreapp2.0</TargetFramework>\r\n  </PropertyGroup>\r\n  <ItemGroup>\r\n    <PackageReference Include=\"Microsoft.AspNetCore.All\" Version=\"2.0.8\" />\r\n  </ItemGroup>\r\n</Project>\r\n```\r\n\r\nThe preceding example has a reference to the [vulnerable package](#affected-software), as seen by the single `PackageReference` element. The name of the package is in the `Include` attribute.\r\nThe package version number is in the `Version` attribute. The previous example shows a single direct dependency on `Microsoft.AspNetCore.All` version 2.0.0.\r\n\r\nTo update the version to the secure package, change the version number to the updated package version as listed on the table [previously](#affected-software).\r\nIn this example, update `Microsoft.AspNetCore.All` to the appropriate [fixed package number](#affected-software) for your major version. Save the *csproj* file. The example *csproj* now looks as follows:\r\n\r\n```xml\r\n<Project Sdk=\"Microsoft.NET.Sdk.Web\">\r\n  <PropertyGroup>\r\n    <TargetFramework>netcoreapp2.0</TargetFramework>\r\n  </PropertyGroup>\r\n  <ItemGroup>\r\n    <PackageReference Include=\"Microsoft.AspNetCore.All\" Version=\"2.0.9\" />\r\n  </ItemGroup>\r\n</Project>\r\n```\r\n\r\nIf you're using Visual Studio and you save your updated *csproj* file, Visual Studio will restore the new package version.\r\nYou can see the restore results by opening the **Output** window (Ctrl+Alt+O) and changing the **Show output from** drop-down list to **Package Manager**.\r\n\r\nIf you're not using Visual Studio, open a command line and change to your project directory. Execute the `dotnet restore` command to restore the updated dependencies.\r\n\r\nNow recompile your application. If after recompilation you see a *Dependency conflict warning*, you must update your other direct dependencies to versions that take a dependency on the updated package.\r\n\r\n#### Discovering and fixing transitive dependencies\r\n\r\nThere are two ways to view transitive dependencies. You can either [use Visual Studio’s Solution Explorer](#vs-solution-explorer), or you can review [the `project.assets.json` file](#project-assets-json) .\r\n\r\n##### <a name=\"vs-solution-explorer\"></a>Using Visual Studio Solution Explorer\r\n\r\nTo use Solution Explorer, open the project in Visual Studio, and then press Ctrl+; to activate the search in Solution Explorer. Search for the [vulnerable package](#affected-software) and make a note of the version numbers of any results you find.\r\n\r\nFor example, searching for `Microsoft.AspNetCore.Mvc.Core` in an example project that contains a package that takes a dependency on `Microsoft.AspNetCore.Mvc` shows the following results in Visual Studio 2017:\r\n\r\n![Screenshot of search results in Visual Studio 2017](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/796298/25858816/8ecdc2b4-3491-11e7-9363-746804bb9832.png)\r\n\r\nThe search results appear as a tree. In the previous results, you can see that a reference to `Microsoft.AspNetCore.Mvc.Core` version 1.1.2 is discovered.\r\n\r\nUnder the Dependencies node is a NuGet node. Under the NuGet node is the list of packages you have directly taken a dependency on and their versions.\r\nIn screenshot, the application takes a direct dependency on `Microsoft.AspNetCore.Mvc`. `Microsoft.AspNetCore.Mvc` in turn has leaf nodes that list its dependencies and their versions.\r\nThe `Microsoft.AspNetCore.Mvc` package takes a dependency on a version of `Microsoft.AspNetCore.Mvc.ApiExplorer`, that in turn takes a dependency on a version of `Microsoft.AspNetCore.Mvc.Core`.\r\n\r\n##### <a name=\"project-assets-json\"></a> Manually reviewing project.assets.json\r\n\r\nOpen the *project.assets.json* file from your project’s obj directory in your editor. We suggest you use an editor that understands JSON and allows you to collapse and expand nodes to review this file.\r\nVisual Studio and Visual Studio Code provide JSON friendly editing.\r\n\r\nSearch the *project.assets.json* file for the [vulnerable package](#affected-software), using the format `packagename/` for each of the package names from the preceding table. If you find the assembly name in your search:\r\n\r\n* Examine the line on which they are found, the version number is after the `/`.\r\n* Compare to the [vulnerable versions table](#affected-software).\r\n\r\nFor example, a search result that shows `Microsoft.AspNetCore.Server.Kestrel.Core/2.0.0` is a reference to version 2.0.0 of `Microsoft.AspNetCore.Server.Kestrel.Core`.\r\nIf your *project.assets.json* file includes references to the [vulnerable package](#affected-software), then you need to fix the transitive dependencies.\r\n\r\nIf you have not found any reference to any vulnerable packages, this means either\r\n\r\n* None of your direct dependencies depend on any vulnerable packages, or\r\n* You have already fixed the problem by updating the direct dependencies.\r\n\r\nIf your transitive dependency review found references to the [vulnerable package](#affected-software), you must add a direct dependency to the updated package to your *csproj* file to override the transitive dependency.\r\n\r\nOpen *projectname.csproj* in your editor. If you're using Visual Studio, right-click the project and choose **Edit projectname.csproj** from the context menu, where projectname is the name of your project.\r\nLook for `PackageReference` nodes, for example:\r\n\r\n```xml\r\n<Project Sdk=\"Microsoft.NET.Sdk.\">\r\n  <PropertyGroup>\r\n    <TargetFramework>net461</TargetFramework>\r\n  </PropertyGroup>\r\n  <ItemGroup>\r\n    <PackageReference Include=\"ThirdParty.NotUpdatedYet\" Version=\"2.0.0\" />\r\n  </ItemGroup>\r\n</Project>\r\n```\r\n\r\nYou must add a direct dependency to the updated version of the [vulnerable package](#affected-software) by adding it to the *csproj* file.\r\nYou do this by adding a new line to the dependencies section, referencing the fixed version.\r\nFor example, if your search showed a transitive reference to a vulnerable `Microsoft.AspNetCore.Server.Kestrel.Core` version, you'd add a reference to the [fixed package number](#affected-software).\r\n\r\n```xml\r\n<Project Sdk=\"Microsoft.NET.Sdk.Web\">\r\n  <PropertyGroup>\r\n    <TargetFramework>net461</TargetFramework>\r\n  </PropertyGroup>\r\n  <ItemGroup>\r\n    <PackageReference Include=\"Microsoft.AspNetCore.Server.Kestrel.Core\" Version=\"2.0.34 />\r\n    <PackageReference Include=\"ThirdParty.NotUpdatedYet\" Version=\"2.0.0\" />\r\n  </ItemGroup>\r\n</Project>\r\n```\r\n\r\nAfter you've added the direct dependency reference, save your *csproj* file.\r\n\r\nIf you're using Visual Studio, save your updated *csproj* file and Visual Studio will restore the new package versions.\r\nYou can see the restore results by opening the **Output** window (Ctrl+Alt+O) and changing the **Show output from** drop-down list to **Package Manager**.\r\n\r\nIf you're not using Visual Studio, open a command line and change to your project directory. Execute the `dotnet restore` command to restore the new dependencies.\r\n\r\n#### Rebuilding your application\r\n\r\nFinally you must rebuild your application, test, and redeploy.\r\n\r\n## Other Information\r\n\r\n### Reporting Security Issues\r\n\r\nIf you have found a potential security issue in .NET Core, please email details to secure@microsoft.com.

Direct dependencies are dependencies where you specifically add a package to your project, transitive dependencies occur when you add a package to your project that in turn relies on another package.\r\n\r\nFor example, the `Microsoft.AspNetCore.Mvc` package depends on the `Microsoft.AspNetCore.Mvc.Core` package. When you add a dependency on `Microsoft.AspNetCore.Mvc` in your project, you're taking a transitive dependency on `Microsoft.AspNetCore.Mvc.Core`.\r\n\r\nAny application that has a direct or transitive dependency on the [affected package](#affected-software) can be exposed to the vulnerability if it does not meet any of the [mitigation factors](#mitigation-factors).\r\n\r\n### <a name=\"how-fix\"></a>How do I fix the issue?\r\n\r\n### ASP.NET Core 2.1\r\n\r\nTo update ASP.NET Core 2.1 you should [download](https://www.microsoft.com/net/download) and install the .NET Core SDK 2.1.302 on your development machines and build servers, and the .NET Core Runtime 2.1.2 on your deployment servers. Your application will roll forward to these versions on an application restart.\r\n\r\n### ASP.NET Core 2.0\r\n\r\nIf you're targeting ASP.NET Core 2.0 and using the `Microsoft.AspNetCore.All` metapackage update its version number to 2.0.9 to update the `Microsoft.AspNetCore.Identity` package, recompile, and redeploy. On your deployment servers, you should [download](https://github.com/dotnet/core/blob/master/release-notes/download-archives/2.0.9-download.md) and install the .NET Core 2.0.9 using the Windows Server Hosting Bundle for Windows and the `dotnet-hosting-2.0.9` package for Linux servers.\r\n\r\n### ASP.NET Core 1.0, 1.1 or 2.0 not targeting the metapackage.\r\n\r\n.NET Core projects have two types of dependencies: direct and transitive. You must update your projects using the following instructions to address both types of dependency.\r\n\r\n### <a name=\"project-format\"></a>.NET Core Project formats\r\n\r\n.NET Core has two different project file formats, depending on what software created the project.\r\n\r\n1. `project.json` is the format used in .NET Core 1.0 and Microsoft Visual Studio 2015.\r\n2. `csproj` is the format used in .NET Core 1.1, .NET Core 2.0 and Microsoft Visual Studio 2017.\r\n\r\n#### Direct dependencies\r\n\r\nDirect dependencies are discoverable by examining your `csproj` file or your `project.json` file. They can be fixed by [editing the project file](#direct-dependencies) or using NuGet to update the dependency.\r\n\r\n#### Transitive dependencies\r\n\r\nTransitive dependencies occur when you add a package to your project that in turn relies on another package. For example, if Contoso publishes a package `Contoso.Utility` which, in turn, depends on `Contoso.Internals` and you add the `Contoso.Utility` package to your project now your project has a direct dependency on `Contoso.Utility` and, because `Contoso.Utility` depends 'Contoso.Internals', your application gains a transitive dependency on the `Contoso.Internals` package.\r\n\r\nTransitive dependencies are reviewable in three ways, depending on your [project format](#project-format):\r\n\r\n* In the Visual Studio Solution Explorer window, which supports searching.\r\n* By examining the `project.assets.json` file contained in the obj directory of your project for `csproj` based projects *OR*.\r\n* By examining the `project.lock.json` file contained in the root directory of your project for `project.json` based projects.\r\n\r\nThe `project.assets.json` and `project.lock.json` files are the authoritative list of all packages used by your project, containing both direct and transitive dependencies.\r\n\r\n#### <a name=\"direct-dependencies-vs2017\"></a>Fixing direct dependencies in a csproj based project / Visual Studio 2017\r\n\r\nOpen *projectname.csproj* in your editor. If you're using Visual Studio, right-click the project and choose **Edit projectname.csproj** from the context menu, where projectname is the name of your project. Look for `PackageReference` elements. The following shows an example project file:\r\n\r\n```xml\r\n<Project Sdk=\"Microsoft.NET.Sdk.Web\">\r\n  <PropertyGroup>\r\n    <TargetFramework>netcoreapp2.0</TargetFramework>\r\n  </PropertyGroup>\r\n  <ItemGroup>\r\n    <PackageReference Include=\"Microsoft.AspNetCore.Identity\" Version=\"2.0.0\" />\r\n  </ItemGroup>\r\n</Project>\r\n```\r\n\r\nThe preceding example has a reference to the [vulnerable package](#affected-software), as seen by the single `PackageReference` element. The name of the package is in the `Include` attribute.\r\nThe package version number is in the `Version` attribute. The previous example shows a single direct dependency on `Microsoft.AspNetCore.Identity` version 2.0.0.\r\n\r\nTo update the version to the secure package, change the version number to the updated package version as listed on the table [previously](#affected-software).\r\nIn this example, update `Microsoft.AspNetCore.Identity` to the appropriate [fixed package number](#affected-software) for your major version. Save the *csproj* file. The example *csproj* now looks as follows:\r\n\r\n```xml\r\n<Project Sdk=\"Microsoft.NET.Sdk.Web\">\r\n  <PropertyGroup>\r\n    <TargetFramework>netcoreapp2.0</TargetFramework>\r\n  </PropertyGroup>\r\n  <ItemGroup>\r\n    <PackageReference Include=\"Microsoft.AspNetCore.Identity\" Version=\"2.0.4\" />\r\n  </ItemGroup>\r\n</Project>\r\n```\r\n\r\nIf you're using Visual Studio and you save your updated *csproj* file, Visual Studio will restore the new package version.\r\nYou can see the restore results by opening the **Output** window (Ctrl+Alt+O) and changing the **Show output from** drop-down list to **Package Manager**.\r\n\r\nIf you're not using Visual Studio, open a command line and change to your project directory. Execute the `dotnet restore` command to restore the updated dependencies.\r\n\r\nNow recompile your application. If after recompilation you see a *Dependency conflict warning*, you must update your other direct dependencies to versions that take a dependency on the updated package.\r\n\r\n#### <a name=\"direct-dependencies-vs2015\"></a> Fixing Direct Dependencies in project.json based project / Visual Studio 2015\r\n\r\nOpen your `project.json` file in your editor. Look for the dependencies section. Below is an example dependencies section:\r\n\r\n``` json\r\n    \"dependencies\": {\r\n      \"Microsoft.NETCore.App\": {\r\n        \"version\": \"1.0.1\",\r\n        \"type\": \"platform\"\r\n      },\r\n     \"Microsoft.AspNetCore.Mvc.Core\": \"1.0.6\",\r\n     \"Microsoft.AspNetCore.Identity\" : \"1.0.5\"\r\n    }\r\n```\r\n\r\nThis example has three direct dependencies: `Microsoft.NETCore.App`, `Microsoft.AspNetCore.Mvc.Core` and `Microsoft.AspNetCore.Identity`.\r\n\r\n`Microsoft.NetCore.App` is the platform the application targets, you should ignore this. The other packages expose their version to the right of the package name. In our example, our non-platform packages are version 1.0.1.\r\n\r\nReview your direct dependencies for any instance of the packages and versions listed above. In the example above, there is a direct dependency on a vulnerable package, `Microsoft.AspNetCore.Identity` version 1.0.5.\r\n\r\nTo update to the fixed package, change the version number to be the appropriate package for your release. In the example, this would be updating `Microsoft.AspNetCore.Identity` to 1.0.6.\r\n\r\nAfter updating the vulnerable package versions, save your `project.json` file.\r\n\r\nThe dependencies section in our example `project.json` would now look as follows:\r\n\r\n```json\r\n  \"dependencies\": {\r\n    \"Microsoft.NETCore.App\": {\r\n      \"version\": \"1.0.1\",\r\n      \"type\": \"platform\"\r\n    },\r\n    \"Microsoft.AspNetCore.Mvc.Core\": \"1.0.6\",\r\n    \"Microsoft.AspNetCore.Identity \": \"1.0.6\"\r\n  }\r\n```\r\n\r\nIf you are using Visual Studio and save your updated `project.json` file, Visual Studio will restore the new package version. You can see the restore results by opening the Output Window (Ctrl+Alt+O) and changing the Show output from drop-down list to Package Manager.\r\n\r\nIf you are not using Visual Studio, open a command line and change to your project directory. Execute the `dotnet restore` command to restore your new dependency.\r\n\r\nAfter you have addressed all of your direct dependencies, you must also review your transitive dependencies.\r\n\r\nAfter you've addressed all of your direct dependencies, you must review your transitive dependencies.\r\n\r\n#### Discovering and fixing transitive dependencies\r\n\r\nThere are two ways to view transitive dependencies. You can either [use Visual Studio’s Solution Explorer](#vs-solution-explorer), or you can review [the `project.assets.json` file](#project-assets-json) or the [the `project.lock.json` file](#project-lock-json).\r\n\r\n##### <a name=\"vs-solution-explorer\"></a>Using Visual Studio Solution Explorer\r\n\r\nTo use Solution Explorer, open the project in Visual Studio, and then press Ctrl+; to activate the search in Solution Explorer. Search for the [vulnerable package](#affected-software) and make a note of the version numbers of any results you find.\r\n\r\nFor example, searching for `Microsoft.AspNetCore.Mvc.Core` in an example project that contains a package that takes a dependency on `Microsoft.AspNetCore.Mvc` shows the following results in Visual Studio 2017:\r\n\r\n![Screenshot of search results in Visual Studio 2017](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/796298/25858816/8ecdc2b4-3491-11e7-9363-746804bb9832.png)\r\n\r\nThe search results appear as a tree. In the previous results, you can see that a reference to `Microsoft.AspNetCore.Mvc.Core` version 1.1.2 is discovered.\r\n\r\nUnder the Dependencies node is a NuGet node. Under the NuGet node is the list of packages you have directly taken a dependency on and their versions.\r\nIn screenshot, the application takes a direct dependency on `Microsoft.AspNetCore.Mvc`. `Microsoft.AspNetCore.Mvc` in turn has leaf nodes that list its dependencies and their versions.\r\nThe `Microsoft.AspNetCore.Mvc` package takes a dependency on a version of `Microsoft.AspNetCore.Mvc.ApiExplorer`, that in turn takes a dependency on a version of `Microsoft.AspNetCore.Mvc.Core`.\r\n\r\n##### <a name=\"project-assets-json\"></a> Manually reviewing project.assets.json (csproj/VS2017)\r\n\r\nOpen the *project.assets.json* file from your project’s obj directory in your editor. We suggest you use an editor that understands JSON and allows you to collapse and expand nodes to review this file.\r\nVisual Studio and Visual Studio Code provide JSON friendly editing.\r\n\r\nSearch the *project.assets.json* file for the [vulnerable package](#affected-software), using the format `packagename/` for each of the package names from the preceding table. If you find the assembly name in your search:\r\n\r\n* Examine the line on which they are found, the version number is after the `/`.\r\n* Compare to the [vulnerable versions table](#affected-software).\r\n\r\nFor example, a search result that shows `Microsoft.AspNetCore.Identity/2.0.0` is a reference to version 2.0.0 of `Microsoft.AspNetCore.Identity`.\r\nIf your *project.assets.json* file includes references to the [vulnerable package](#affected-software), then you need to fix the transitive dependencies.\r\n\r\nIf you have not found any reference to any vulnerable packages, this means either\r\n\r\n* None of your direct dependencies depend on any vulnerable packages, or\r\n* You have already fixed the problem by updating the direct dependencies.\r\n\r\nIf your transitive dependency review found references to the [vulnerable package](#affected-software), you must add a direct dependency to the updated package to your *csproj* file to override the transitive dependency.\r\n\r\nOpen *projectname.csproj* in your editor. If you're using Visual Studio, right-click the project and choose **Edit projectname.csproj** from the context menu, where projectname is the name of your project.\r\nLook for `PackageReference` nodes, for example:\r\n\r\n```xml\r\n<Project Sdk=\"Microsoft.NET.Sdk.\">\r\n  <PropertyGroup>\r\n    <TargetFramework>net461</TargetFramework>\r\n  </PropertyGroup>\r\n  <ItemGroup>\r\n    <PackageReference Include=\"ThirdParty.NotUpdatedYet\" Version=\"2.0.0\" />\r\n  </ItemGroup>\r\n</Project>\r\n```\r\n\r\nYou must add a direct dependency to the updated version of the [vulnerable package](#affected-software) by adding it to the *csproj* file.\r\nYou do this by adding a new line to the dependencies section, referencing the fixed version.\r\nFor example, if your search showed a transitive reference to a vulnerable `Microsoft.AspNetCore.Identity` version, you'd add a reference to the [fixed package number](#affected-software).\r\n\r\n```xml\r\n<Project Sdk=\"Microsoft.NET.Sdk.Web\">\r\n  <PropertyGroup>\r\n    <TargetFramework>net461</TargetFramework>\r\n  </PropertyGroup>\r\n  <ItemGroup>\r\n    <PackageReference Include=\"Microsoft.AspNetCore.Identity\" Version=\"2.0.4\" />\r\n    <PackageReference Include=\"ThirdParty.NotUpdatedYet\" Version=\"2.0.0\" />\r\n  </ItemGroup>\r\n</Project>\r\n```\r\n\r\nAfter you've added the direct dependency reference, save your *csproj* file.\r\n\r\nIf you're using Visual Studio, save your updated *csproj* file and Visual Studio will restore the new package versions.\r\nYou can see the restore results by opening the **Output** window (Ctrl+Alt+O) and changing the **Show output from** drop-down list to **Package Manager**.\r\n\r\nIf you're not using Visual Studio, open a command line and change to your project directory. Execute the `dotnet restore` command to restore the new dependencies.\r\n\r\n##### <a name=\"project-lock-json\"></a> Manually reviewing project.lock.json (project.json/VS2015)\r\n\r\nOpen the `project.lock.json` file in your editor. We suggest you use an editor that understands json and allows you to collapse and expand nodes to review this file; both Visual Studio and Visual Studio Code provide this functionality.\r\n\r\nIf you are using Visual Studio the `project.lock.json` file is “under” the `project.json` file. Click the right pointing triangle, ▷, to the left of the `project.json` file to expand the solution tree to expose the `project.lock.json` file. The following image shows a project with the `project.json` file expanded to show the `project.lock.json` file.\r\n\r\n![project lock json](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/796298/25858179/f6e01200-348f-11e7-8a77-7176d8dd3f03.png)\r\n\r\nSearch the `project.lock.json` file for the vulnerable packages, using the format `packagename/`, using each of the package names from the table above. If you find any vulnerable assembly name in your search examine the line on which they are found, the version number is after the `/` and compare to the vulnerable versions table above. For example a search result that shows `Microsoft.AspNetCore.Identity/1.0.1` is a reference to v1.0.1 of `Microsoft.AspNetCore.Identity`.   If your `project.lock.json` file includes references to any of the package versions shown above then you will need to fix the transitive dependencies.\r\n\r\nIf you have not found any reference to a vulnerable version of  `Microsoft.AspNetCore.Identity` this means none of your direct dependencies depend on any vulnerable packages or you have already fixed the problem by updating the direct dependencies.\r\n\r\nIf your transitive dependency review found references to any of the vulnerable packages you must add a direct dependency to the updated package to your `project.json` file to override the transitive dependency. Open your `project.json` and find the dependencies section. For example:\r\n\r\n``` json\r\n  \"dependencies\": {\r\n    \"Microsoft.NETCore.App\": {\r\n      \"version\": \"1.0.1\",\r\n      \"type\": \"platform\"\r\n    },\r\n    \"Microsoft.AspNetCore.Mvc\": \"1.0.0\"\r\n  }\r\n```\r\n\r\nFor each of the vulnerable packages your search returned you must add a direct dependency to the updated version by adding it to the `project.json` file. You do this by adding a new line to the dependencies section, referring the fixed version. For example, if your search showed a transitive reference to the vulnerable `Microsoft.AspNetCore.Identity` version 1.0.0 you would add a reference to the appropriate fixed version, 1.0.6. Edit the `project.json` file as follows:\r\n\r\n``` json\r\n  \"dependencies\": {\r\n    \"Microsoft.NETCore.App\": {\r\n      \"version\": \"1.0.1\",\r\n      \"type\": \"platform\"\r\n    },\r\n    \"Microsoft.AspNetCore.Identity\": \"1.0.6\",\r\n    \"Microsoft.AspNetCore.Mvc\": \"1.0.0\"\r\n  }\r\n```\r\n\r\nAfter you have added direct dependencies to the fixed packages, save your `project.json` file.\r\n\r\nIf you are using Visual Studio save your updated `project.json` file and Visual Studio will restore the new package versions. You can see the restore results by opening the Output Window (Ctrl+Alt+O) and changing the Show output from drop-down list to Package Manager.\r\n\r\nIf you are not using Visual Studio open a command line and change to your project directory. Execute the `dotnet restore` command to restore your new dependencies.\r\n\r\n#### Rebuilding your application\r\n\r\nFinally you must rebuild your application, test, and redeploy.\r\n\r\n## Other Information\r\n\r\n### Reporting Security Issues\r\n\r\nIf you have found a potential security issue in .NET Core, please email details to secure@microsoft.com.

We are concentrating most of our efforts to add new functionality on the 3.0 release. Still, you can expect 2.2 to include lots of bugs fixes, community contributions and small improvements.\r\n\r\nYou can access the list of issues currently assigned to the 2.2 milestone using [this query](https://github.com/aspnet/EntityFrameworkCore/issues?q=is%3Aopen+is%3Aissue+milestone%3A2.2.0+sort%3Areactions-%2B1-desc) on our issue tracking system.  \r\n\r\n## Schedule\r\nThe schedule of EF Core 2.2 will align with the schedule of .NET Core and ASP.NET Core 2.2. See [the ASP.NET Core 2.2 Roadmap announcement](https://github.com/aspnet/Announcements/issues/307).\r\n\r\nOur current plan is to have three previews before we ship RTM near the end of 2018:\r\n\r\n- August – Preview 1\r\n- September - Preview 2\r\n- October - Preview 3\r\n- Before end-of-year – RTM\r\n\r\n As usual, this post reflects our current plan, but things may change as we make progress. \r\n\r\n## New features\r\n\r\n### Reverse engineering of database views into query types\r\n\r\nIn EF Core 2.1 we added query types, which allow mapping .NET objects to views and tables without keys. In 2.2, we plan to leverage this new capability to automatically map existing database views to query types. \r\n\r\nYou can track the progress of this at https://github.com/aspnet/EntityFrameworkCore/issues/1679.\r\n\r\n###  Support for collections of owned entities\r\n\r\nIn EF Core 2.0 we added the concept of owned entity types, which allows modeling ownership relationship that are common between entities that are part of the same document in document-oriented databases or the same aggregate if you use Domain-Driven Design concepts in your model.\r\n\r\nUntil now, we only support reference navigation properties to owned entities. In EF Core 2.2, we plan to enhance this functionality to map collection navigation properties to owned entities. \r\n\r\nYou can track the progress of this at https://github.com/aspnet/EntityFrameworkCore/issues/8172.\r\n\r\n## Other work\r\n\r\nThere are some additional work items that are not strictly EF Core 2.2 features, but we still track as part of the 2.2 milestone because we are doing the work in the same timeframe:\r\n\r\n### Cosmos DB provider\r\n\r\nA lot of our efforts are going into productizing an EF Core provider for the SQL API in Cosmos DB.\r\nWe have already created a prototype, which we have shown in demos such as in this [this EF Core 2.1 talk](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k55kDH_ixrQ) we did at the Microsoft Build conference.\r\n\r\nDue to competing priorities, releasing a preview of this provider has taken more than what we originally planned, but we are working on it now, and the current plan is to release a stable version by the end of this calendar year.\r\n\r\nYou can track our progress on this issue: https://github.com/aspnet/EntityFrameworkCore/issues/12086. \r\n\r\n### Preview of spatial support for SQL Server\r\n\r\nWe are also focusing on adding spatial support as an extension to the SQL Server provider for EF Core.\r\nNote that the PostgreSQL provider (Npgsql) already added support in EF Core 2.1. Beside implementing this functionality for SQL Server, we are working closely with the developers of Npgsql to try to achieve a consistent and hopefully improved experience across providers.\r\n\r\nNote that we aren't committing to having a final version of the spatial support for the end of the current calendar year. But we are actively working on this now, and as we make progress, we should be able to provide a more precise estimate.   \r\n\r\nYou can track our progress on this issue: https://github.com/aspnet/EntityFrameworkCore/issues/1100.\r\n\r\n### Improve test coverage for LINQ and reduce query regressions in future releases\r\n\r\nIn the last few releases, we have seen that when we commit improvements to our LINQ implementation, we often break queries that were previously working. The main challenge is that LINQ defines a huge space of possible queries to test, and it is very complex to measure what level of test coverage we have, even for a specific query operator. In the 2.2 timeframe, we will be investing on improving test coverage for this huge space. We also plan to experiment with new approaches to add appropriate coverage, and to reduce the likelihood of introducing regressions in future releases.\r\n\r\nYou can track our progress on this at https://github.com/aspnet/EntityFrameworkCore/issues/12046. \r\n\r\nFor discussion on this roadmap, please use https://github.com/aspnet/EntityFrameworkCore/issues/12465.

This is the main focus for 2.2.\r\n\r\n### API Controller conventions\r\nIn 2.1 we added controller specific conventions that make Web API development more convenient with the [ApiController attribute](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/aspnet/core/web-api/index?view=aspnetcore-2.1#annotate-class-with-apicontrollerattribute). In 2.2 we want to expand on this concept to provide metadata for API Explorer and provide a better end-to-end API documentation experience.\r\n\r\nWe want to make it possible for all MVC Core applications to have a good Swagger/OpenAPI definition by default. By following common patterns, your actions will produce rich metadata without falling into 'attribute soup' where you list every possible status code that every action in your app could return. We will include a default set of conventions that match what ASP.NET Core scaffolding generations. It will also be possible to write and share your own conventions to reflect your desired contracts. \r\n\r\nWe will include a set of analyzers that will help you find cases where code that doesn't match the API Explorer metadata, and a code-fix that provides options to explicitly specify the response type metadata, create a new convention with a different pattern, or just let you write code to satisfy the convention.\r\n\r\nAs a concrete example, you could write a convention that says \"every action method that starts with 'Create' will return an HTTP 201\". If you wrote the following code, then you would receive a warning.\r\n\r\n```csharp\r\n[HttpPost(\"/orders\")]\r\npublic ActionResult<Order> CreateOrder(OrderData orderData)\r\n{\r\n    ....\r\n    return Ok(new Order() {...});\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nThis code doesn't match your Swagger/OpenAPI metadata (from the convention) - which says that this action returns a 201. Once you see this, you could `ctrl + .` to add the attributes for what we do know about this method, opting out of conventions, or you could change the code.\r\n\r\nThe analyzer will also be able to 'check your work' if you are being explicit about status codes and results using the existing attributes - it does not require you to use the conventions. Details for how this will all work can be discussed here: https://github.com/aspnet/Mvc/issues/7802\r\n\r\nLet's look at a more fleshed-out out example. The following code snippet is what is required to generate a reasonable Open API document for an action method that will get an item by ID or return a 404:\r\n\r\n```csharp\r\n[ApiController]\r\npublic class CatalogController : ControllerBase\r\n{\r\n    [HttpGet]\r\n    [Route(\"items/{id:int}\")]\r\n    [ProducesResponseType((int)HttpStatusCode.NotFound)]\r\n    [ProducesResponseType(typeof(CatalogItem),(int)HttpStatusCode.OK)]\r\n    public async Task<ActionResult<CatalogItem>> GetItemById(int id)\r\n    {\r\n    }\r\n    ...\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nIn 2.2 with the default conventions the following code should generate the same Open API document that the above code sample does, and this shipped analyzers will give you hints when you do something that doesn't match so you know to go and add attributes or change the conventions:\r\n\r\n```csharp\r\n[ApiController]\r\npublic class CatalogController : ControllerBase\r\n{\r\n    [HttpGet]\r\n    [Route(\"items/{id:int}\")]\r\n    public async Task<ActionResult<CatalogItem>> GetItemById(int id)\r\n    {\r\n    }\r\n    ...\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\n### OpenAPI generation\r\nWith the conventions described above it will be possible for code that uses the API Explorer to generate Open API documents to be better by default, since the code you write will either follow the conventions or have attributes allowing generators to create better documents.\r\n\r\n### Dispatcher\r\nIn 2.2 we will introduce a new routing system that will expand the set of scenarios where routing is useful – tentatively called Dispatcher. \r\n\r\nThe current routing system was designed to support MVC’s historical scenarios without much thought to how routing and the composable middleware pipeline will work together. The Dispatcher is designed to run the URL matching step very early in the pipeline so that middleware can see the Endpoint that was selected as well as metadata that is associated with that endpoint. Like existing routing, the dispatcher will branch and call the actual endpoint at the end of the pipeline.\r\n\r\nA concrete example of how this helps us is with CORS. Today there is both a CORS middleware AND a CORS feature of MVC (https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/aspnet/core/security/cors?view=aspnetcore-2.1). Because routing information is deeply integrated with MVC we can't apply CORS policies that only apply to specific controllers until after we know what controller has been selected. However, if you also want CORS policies to apply to other parts of your pipeline then you need the middleware. This has been a source of confusion for many and we can simplify it if all of the middleware pipeline can have as much information about routing as MVC does today.\r\n\r\nWe’re also using this opportunity to make improvements to the performance of routing and dispatching for MVC and other scenarios.\r\n\r\n### HTTP API REPL tooling\r\nToday there are no tools built into Visual Studio or the dotnet CLI to help you execute HTTP verbs against your API. We have a great language, debugger, and framework but they are somewhat limited when it's difficult to send a POST to my app to see what happens. In 2.2 we want to build a CLI experience for exploring HTTP APIs to imcrease your API inner loop productivity. The CLI builds on all the features we've talked about above as some of its advanced features, like listing all routes in your app, are enabled by consuming the metadata we have about your app via Open API documents. That means the CLI should be useful for executing any HTTP verb, but really shines when you feed it more data like Open API docs. We intend to start by shipping this as a standalone global tool while we explore its feature set and potential.\r\n\r\nYou can see a demo and description of this in Scott Hunter and Scott Hanselman's BUILD talk here: https://youtu.be/KAIJ3ezQb3c?t=18m\r\n\r\n### API client generation (C# & TypeScript)\r\nOnce you have an API with rich metadata and done exploring and testing it, then you need to go and write some client code to call and make use of your API. We are going to build an experience for generating this code based on the same data and documentation described above. We envision a few pieces for this story, one part is a dotnet tool that can generate code from an Open API document, the other is MSBuild SDK work to allow a `ServiceReference` to another project in a solution. That reference will cause build time client code generation to happen via the tool that can generate code. We expect this to work in a similar way to the EF Core tooling experience, where your application is built and most of your startup code executed but instead of running it we use the data we have about your code to generate a client.\r\n\r\n### Authorization Server\r\nOne of the largest gaps we’ve had has been around authorization for applications beyond a simple forms based login. We plan to fill that gap with a simple to use OpenID Connect based authorization server, which will allow your ASP.NET application to act as an authentication point for your projects, be they web site to API, SPA to API, native application to an API or, for distributed applications API to API. As we are concentrating on first party applications we can make the code you need to plumb in trivial, getting as close to zero configuration as you can,  we’re not aiming to replace the excellent third-party solutions out there which enable richer scenarios like third-party applications or which provide a flexibility in configuration and authentication flow.\r\n\r\n## Server Improvements\r\n\r\n### Health Checks\r\nThis feature is a way to trivially setup an endpoint in your application that can be used to check the health of your application, potentially taking into account things like memory consumption or database availability as well as just \"can I accept a HTTP request\".\r\n\r\n### HTTP/2 in Kestrel & HttpClient\r\nThe title says it all in this case. HTTP/2 support for all. We started this work some time ago, and have had the protocol mostly implemented for a while but not compiled into the product since it wasn't ready. This version we will finish that work and implement the missing features.\r\n\r\n### In-proc ANCM\r\nRunning ASP.NET Core applications in-process in IIS, giving a significant performance boost.\r\n\r\n## SignalR\r\n\r\n### Add Java & C++ clients\r\nAllow customers using Java or C++ to connect to SignalR servers, and the [Azure SignalR Service](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/blog/azure-signalr-service-a-fully-managed-service-to-add-real-time-functionality/).\r\n\r\n## Other\r\nAs with all releases there is a large tail of bug fixes, performance improvements, small features, and community PRs that we will also work on. You can see the full list of work by browsing the 2.2 milestones on the various [repositories](https://github.com/aspnet/).\r\n\r\nFor discussion on the roadmap in general, use https://github.com/aspnet/Home/issues/3265","Url":"https://github.com/aspnet/Announcements/issues/307","RelatedDescription":"Open issue \"ASP.NET Core 2.2 Roadmap\" (#307)"},{"Id":"333804954","IsPullRequest":false,"CreatedAt":"2018-06-19T19:21:13","Actor":"anurse","Number":"306","RawContent":null,"Title":"SignalR Client 2.1.1 in UWP apps with Minimum Version of 1803","State":"open","Body":"ASP.NET Core 2.1.1 contains fixes to resolve blocking issues when using the SignalR Client from UWP applications where the minimum version is set to \"Windows 10, version 1803\".

When you add a dependency on `Microsoft.AspNetCore.Mvc` in your project, you're taking a transitive dependency on `Microsoft.AspNetCore.Mvc.Core`.\r\n\r\nAny application that has a direct or transitive dependency on the [affected packages](#affected-software) can be exposed to the vulnerability.\r\n\r\n### How do I fix the issue?\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\nIf you're targeting .NET Core 2.x and the `Microsoft.AspNetCore.All` \"metapackage\":\r\n\r\n* Update its version number to 2.0.8 if you have targetted 2.0.x *OR*\r\n* Update its version number to 2.1.0-rc1-final if you have targetted previews of 2.1\r\n\r\nUpdating the metapackage will update the [affected packages](#affected-software)\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n.NET Core projects have two types of dependencies: direct and transitive. You must update your projects using the following instructions to address both types of dependency.\r\n\r\n#### Direct dependencies\r\n\r\nDirect dependencies are discoverable by examining your *csproj* file. They can be fixed by [editing the csproj file](#direct-dependencies) or using NuGet to update the dependency.\r\n\r\n#### Transitive dependencies\r\n\r\nTransitive dependencies occur when you add a package to your project that in turn relies on another package. For example, if Contoso publishes a package `Contoso.Utility` which, in turn, depends on `Contoso.Internals` and you add the `Contoso.Utility` package to your project now your project has a direct dependency on `Contoso.Utility` and, because `Contoso.Utility` depends 'Contoso.Internals', your application gains a transitive dependency on the `Contoso.Internals` package.\r\n\r\nTransitive dependencies are reviewable in two ways:\r\n\r\n* In the Visual Studio Solution Explorer window, which supports searching.\r\n* By examining the *project.assets.json* file contained in the obj directory of your project.\r\n\r\nThe *project.assets.json* files are the authoritative list of all packages used by your project, containing both direct and transitive dependencies.\r\n\r\n#### <a name=\"direct-dependencies\"></a>Fixing direct dependencies\r\n\r\nOpen *projectname.csproj* in your editor. If you're using Visual Studio, right-click the project and choose **Edit projectname.csproj** from the context menu, where projectname is the name of your project. Look for `PackageReference` elements. The following shows an example project file:\r\n\r\n```xml\r\n<Project Sdk=\"Microsoft.NET.Sdk\">\r\n  <PropertyGroup>\r\n    <TargetFramework>netcoreapp2.0</TargetFramework>\r\n  </PropertyGroup>\r\n  <ItemGroup>\r\n    <PackageReference Include=\"Microsoft.AspNetCore.Server.Kestrel.Core\" Version=\"2.0.1\" />\r\n  </ItemGroup>\r\n</Project>\r\n```\r\n\r\nThe preceding example has a reference to a [vulnerable package](#affected-software), as seen by the single `PackageReference` element. The name of the package is in the `Include` attribute.\r\nThe package version number is in the `Version` attribute. The previous example shows a single direct dependency on `Microsoft.AspNetCore.Server.Kestrel.Core` version 2.0.1.\r\n\r\nTo update the version to the secure package, change the version number to the updated package version as listed on the table [previously](#affected-software).\r\nIn this example, update `Microsoft.AspNetCore.Server.Kestrel.Core` to a [fixed package number](#affected-software). Save the *csproj* file. The example *csproj* now looks as follows:\r\n\r\n```xml\r\n<Project Sdk=\"Microsoft.NET.Sdk\">\r\n  <PropertyGroup>\r\n    <TargetFramework>netcoreapp2.0</TargetFramework>\r\n  </PropertyGroup>\r\n  <ItemGroup>\r\n    <PackageReference Include=\"Microsoft.AspNetCore.Server.Kestrel.Core\" Version=\"2.0.3 />\r\n  </ItemGroup>\r\n</Project>\r\n```\r\n\r\nIf you're using Visual Studio and you save your updated *csproj* file, Visual Studio will restore the new package version.\r\nYou can see the restore results by opening the **Output** window (Ctrl+Alt+O) and changing the **Show output from** drop-down list to **Package Manager**.\r\n\r\nIf you're not using Visual Studio, open a command line and change to your project directory. Execute the `dotnet restore` command to restore the updated dependencies.\r\n\r\nNow recompile your application. If after recompilation you see a *Dependency conflict warning*, you must update your other direct dependencies to versions that take a dependency on the updated package.\r\n\r\nAfter you've addressed all of your direct dependencies, you must review your transitive dependencies.\r\n\r\n#### Discovering and fixing transitive dependencies\r\n\r\nThere are two ways to view transitive dependencies. You can either [use Visual Studio’s Solution Explorer](#vs-solution-explorer), or you can [review the *project.assets.json* file](#project-assets-json).\r\n\r\n##### <a name=\"vs-solution-explorer\"></a>Using Visual Studio Solution Explorer\r\n\r\nTo use Solution Explorer, open the project in Visual Studio 2017, and then press Ctrl+; to activate the search in Solution Explorer. Search for each of the [vulnerable packages](#affected-software) and make a note of the version numbers of any results you find.\r\n\r\nFor example, searching for `Microsoft.AspNetCore.Mvc.Core` in an example project that contains a package that takes a dependency on `Microsoft.AspNetCore.Mvc` shows the following results in Visual Studio 2017:\r\n\r\n![Screenshot of search results in Visual Studio 2017](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/796298/25858816/8ecdc2b4-3491-11e7-9363-746804bb9832.png)\r\n\r\nThe search results appear as a tree. In the previous results, you can see that a reference to `Microsoft.AspNetCore.Mvc.Core` version 1.1.2 is discovered.\r\n\r\nUnder the Dependencies node is a NuGet node. Under the NuGet node is the list of packages you have directly taken a dependency on and their versions.\r\nIn screenshot, the application takes a direct dependency on `Microsoft.AspNetCore.Mvc`. `Microsoft.AspNetCore.Mvc` in turn has leaf nodes that list its dependencies and their versions.\r\nThe `Microsoft.AspNetCore.Mvc` package takes a dependency on a version of `Microsoft.AspNetCore.Mvc.ApiExplorer`, that in turn takes a dependency on a version of `Microsoft.AspNetCore.Mvc.Core`.\r\n\r\n##### <a name=\"project-assets-json\"></a>Manually reviewing project.assets.json\r\n\r\nOpen the *project.assets.json* file from your project’s obj directory in your editor. We suggest you use an editor that understands JSON and allows you to collapse and expand nodes to review this file.\r\nVisual Studio and Visual Studio Code provide JSON friendly editing.\r\n\r\nSearch the *project.assets.json* file for the [vulnerable package](#affected-software), using the format `packagename/` for each of the package names from the preceding table. If you find the assembly name in your search:\r\n\r\n* Examine the line on which they are found, the version number is after the `/`.\r\n* Compare to the [vulnerable versions table](#affected-software).\r\n\r\nFor example, a search result that shows `System.Security.Cryptography.Xml/4.4.0` is a reference to version 4.4.0 of `System.Security.Cryptography.Xml`.\r\nIf your *project.assets.json* file includes references to the [vulnerable package](#affected-software), then you need to fix the transitive dependencies.\r\n\r\n##### Fixing transitive dependencies\r\n\r\nIf you have not found any reference to any vulnerable packages, this means either\r\n\r\n* None of your direct dependencies depend on any vulnerable packages, or\r\n* You have already fixed the problem by updating the direct dependencies.\r\n\r\nIf your transitive dependency review found references to the [vulnerable package](#affected-software), you must add a direct dependency to the updated package to your *csproj* file to override the transitive dependency.\r\n\r\nOpen *projectname.csproj* in your editor. If you're using Visual Studio, right-click the project and choose **Edit projectname.csproj** from the context menu, where projectname is the name of your project.\r\nLook for `PackageReference` nodes, for example:\r\n\r\n```xml\r\n<Project Sdk=\"Microsoft.NET.Sdk.\">\r\n  <PropertyGroup>\r\n    <TargetFramework>net461</TargetFramework>\r\n  </PropertyGroup>\r\n  <ItemGroup>\r\n    <PackageReference Include=\"ThirdParty.NotUpdatedYet\" Version=\"2.0.0\" />\r\n  </ItemGroup>\r\n</Project>\r\n```\r\n\r\nYou must add a direct dependency to the updated version of the [vulnerable package](#affected-software) by adding it to the *csproj* file.\r\nYou do this by adding a new line to the dependencies section, referencing the fixed version.\r\nFor example, if your search showed a transitive reference to a vulnerable `Microsoft.AspNetCore.Server.Kestrel.Core` version, you'd add a reference to the [fixed package number](#affected-software).\r\n\r\n```xml\r\n<Project Sdk=\"Microsoft.NET.Sdk.Web\">\r\n  <PropertyGroup>\r\n    <TargetFramework>net461</TargetFramework>\r\n  </PropertyGroup>\r\n  <ItemGroup>\r\n    <PackageReference Include=\"Microsoft.AspNetCore.Server.Kestrel.Core\" Version=\"2.0.3\" />\r\n    <PackageReference Include=\"ThirdParty.NotUpdatedYet\" Version=\"2.0.0\" />\r\n  </ItemGroup>\r\n</Project>\r\n```\r\n\r\nAfter you've added the direct dependency reference, save your *csproj* file.\r\n\r\nIf you're using Visual Studio, save your updated *csproj* file and Visual Studio will restore the new package versions.\r\nYou can see the restore results by opening the **Output** window (Ctrl+Alt+O) and changing the **Show output from** drop-down list to **Package Manager**.\r\n\r\nIf you're not using Visual Studio, open a command line and change to your project directory. Execute the `dotnet restore` command to restore the new dependencies.\r\n\r\n#### Rebuilding your application\r\n\r\nFinally you must rebuild your application, test, and redeploy.\r\n\r\n## Other Information\r\n\r\n### Reporting Security Issues\r\n\r\nIf you have found a potential security issue in .NET Core, please email details to secure@microsoft.com.

We will continue to ship patches and security fixes for the existing aspnetcore images but any new images for 2.1 and higher will be pushed to microsoft/dotnet.\r\n\r\nDockerfiles using `microsoft/aspnetcore:<version>` should change to `microsoft/dotnet:<version>-aspnetcore-runtime`.\r\n\r\nDockerfiles using `microsoft/aspnetcore-build` that do not require Node should just change to `microsoft/dotnet:<version>-sdk`.\r\n\r\nDockerfiles using Node from the `microsoft/aspnetcore-build` image will either need to install Node into their own image or use mult-stage builds as described in the Dockerfile examples at the end of this announcement.\r\n\r\nThe `ASPNETCORE_URLS` env var that allows ASP.NET Core apps to accept traffic from outside the container will be set in all the `dotnet` images, which was a common early stumbling block for people getting started with ASP.NET Core and Docker. PR is [here](https://github.com/dotnet/dotnet-docker/pull/450)\r\n\r\n### Why the merge?\r\n\r\nFor some time we have been seeing people search for and find the `microsoft/dotnet` images and never realise that there are aspnetcore ones. This could be problematic in the past as the dotnet images were not optimised for ASP.NET Core, making things a little harder or slower. But with changes in the way ASP.NET Core works in 2.1 it was going to be much more impactful, in that ASP.NET Core applications were not likely to run on the base dotnet image. Given that we also thought it made more sense to have a single repository for all images, as ASP.NET is just part of .NET, we are taking this opportunity to remove the potential source of confusion and wasted time for our customers.\r\n\r\n### Why no Node?\r\nThere are two main reasons for this:\r\n\r\n  1. Multi-stage build now makes it easier to pull in the Node image for purely build concerns.\r\n  2. The ASP.NET Core templates no longer have a hard dependency on Node.\r\n\r\n\r\nFor discussion and feedback on this decision you can go here: [https://github.com/aspnet/aspnet-docker/issues/403](https://github.com/aspnet/aspnet-docker/issues/403)\r\n\r\n### Dockerfile examples\r\n\r\nIf you need Node then you will need to add it in your own Dockerfile, like this:\r\n\r\n```Dockerfile\r\nFROM microsoft/dotnet:2.1-sdk as build-env\r\nWORKDIR /app\r\n#setup node\r\nENV NODE_VERSION 8.9.4\r\nENV NODE_DOWNLOAD_SHA 21fb4690e349f82d708ae766def01d7fec1b085ce1f5ab30d9bda8ee126ca8fc\r\n\r\nRUN curl -SL \"https://nodejs.org/dist/v${NODE_VERSION}/node-v${NODE_VERSION}-linux-x64.tar.gz\" --output nodejs.tar.gz \\\r\n    && echo \"$NODE_DOWNLOAD_SHA nodejs.tar.gz\" | sha256sum -c - \\\r\n    && tar -xzf \"nodejs.tar.gz\" -C /usr/local --strip-components=1 \\\r\n    && rm nodejs.tar.gz \\\r\n    && ln -s /usr/local/bin/node /usr/local/bin/nodejs\r\n\r\n# copy csproj and restore as distinct layers\r\nCOPY *.csproj ./\r\nRUN dotnet restore\r\n\r\n# copy everything else and build\r\nCOPY . ./\r\nRUN dotnet publish -c Release -o out\r\n\r\n# build runtime image\r\nFROM microsoft/dotnet:2.1-aspnetcore-runtime\r\nWORKDIR /app\r\n#setup node, this is only needed if you use Node both at runtime and build time.

If you're not running ASP.NET Core 1.x behind a proxy, you must either place a proxy in front of your application or upgrade to ASP.NET Core 2.0.\r\nand add the host validating middleware provided at https://github.com/aspnet/BasicMiddleware/blob/release/2.0/samples/HostFilteringSample/.*\r\n\r\n## Advisory FAQ\r\n### How do I know if I am affected?\r\n\r\nReview the server and proxy configuration [instructions](#configuration) below to see if your system is configured correctly, and adjust the configuration if necessary.\r\n\r\n### How do I fix the issue?\r\n\r\nYou must address the [configuration](#configuration) of your server or proxy to protect your application to limit requests to known hosts.\r\n\r\nIf you're not running Kestrel 1.x behind a proxy, you must either place a proxy in front of your application or upgrade to ASP.NET Core 2.0 and follow the 2.0 instructions below.\r\n\r\nASP.NET Core 2.0.x applications must [update your code](#app-update) to fully protect your application.\r\n\r\n#### <a name=\"configuration\"></a> Server and Proxy configuration\r\n\r\nYou must examine your externally facing server or proxy configuration and ensure it requires host headers with fully qualified domain names, or known sub-domains if you are using sub-domain wild cards.\r\n\r\n##### ASP.NET Core applications behind [IIS](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/aspnet/core/host-and-deploy/iis/)\r\n\r\nTo configure IIS to only respond to know hosts:\r\n\r\n* Open IIS Manager.\r\n* Expand the **Sites** node for the machine you want to configure.\r\n* Select the site by clicking on the site.\r\n* In the **Actions** list on the right-hand side of IIS Manager, click **Bindings**.\r\n* Edit any bindings that do not have a host name to specify one. Do not use a `*` wildcard unless it's against a domain under your control. For example, `*.contoso.com` is safe, `*.com` is not.\r\n\r\n##### ASP.NET Core applications running publicly on [Kestrel](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/aspnet/core/fundamentals/servers/kestrel)\r\n\r\nKestrel does not have the capability to validate host headers. It must either be placed behind a proxy that performs the host header validation or the validation must be performed within the application by adding  host filtering middleware provided at https://github.com/aspnet/BasicMiddleware/blob/release/2.0/samples/HostFilteringSample/. You must also [update your dependencies](#app-update) to fully protect your application.\r\n\r\n##### ASP.NET Core applications running on [HTTP.SYS](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/aspnet/core/fundamentals/servers/httpsys)\r\n\r\nTo configure URL prefixes and ports, you can use the `UseUrls` extension method, the `urls` command-line argument, the ASPNETCORE_URLS environment variable, or the `UrlPrefixes` property on [HttpSysOptions](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/api/microsoft.aspnetcore.server.httpsys.httpsysoptions). The following code example uses `UrlPrefixes`.\r\n\r\n```c#\r\npublic static IWebHost BuildWebHost(string[] args) =>\r\n    WebHost.CreateDefaultBuilder(args)\r\n        .UseStartup<Startup>()\r\n        .UseHttpSys(options =>\r\n        {\r\n            // The following options are set to default values.\r\n            options.Authentication.Schemes = AuthenticationSchemes.None;\r\n            options.Authentication.AllowAnonymous = true;\r\n            options.MaxConnections = null;\r\n            options.MaxRequestBodySize = 30000000;\r\n            options.UrlPrefixes.Add(\"http://localhost:5000\");\r\n        })\r\n        .Build();\r\n```\r\n\r\n##### ASP.NET Core applications behind [NGINX](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/aspnet/core/host-and-deploy/linux-nginx)\r\n\r\nTo configure NGINX as a reverse proxy to forward requests to your ASP.NET Core app, replace the contents */etc/nginx/sites-available/default* with the following:\r\n\r\n```NGINX\r\nserver {\r\n    listen        80;\r\n    server_name   example.com *.example.com;\r\n    location / {\r\n        proxy_pass         http://localhost:5000;\r\n        proxy_http_version 1.1;\r\n        proxy_set_header   Upgrade $http_upgrade;\r\n        proxy_set_header   Connection keep-alive;\r\n        proxy_set_header   Host $host;\r\n        proxy_cache_bypass $http_upgrade;\r\n    }\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nNote that with NGINX, when there is no match for `server_name`, NGINX will pick the default server. If no default server has been defined, the first server in the conf file is the default server. Best practice is to add a specific default server which returns a status code of 444 in the conf file. An example default server configuration would be as follows:\r\n\r\n```NGINX\r\nserver {\r\n    listen   80 default_server;\r\n    # listen [::]:80 default_server deferred;\r\n    return   444;\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nWith the preceding configuration file and default server, NGINX accepts public traffic on port 80 with host header `example.com` or `*.example.com`. Requests not matching these hosts won't get forwarded to Kestrel. NGINX forwards the matching requests to Kestrel at `http://localhost:5000`. See [How nginx processes a request](https://nginx.org/docs/http/request_processing.html) for more information.\r\n\r\nOnce the NGINX configuration is established, run `sudo nginx -t` to verify the syntax of the configuration files. If the configuration file test is successful, force NGINX to pick up the changes by running `sudo nginx -s reload`.\r\n\r\n##### ASP.NET Core applications behind [Apache](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/aspnet/core/host-and-deploy/linux-apache)\r\n\r\nConfiguration files for Apache are located within the `/etc/httpd/conf.d/` directory. Any file with the `*.conf*` extension:\r\n\r\n* Is processed in alphabetical order, and\r\n* The module configuration files in `/etc/httpd/conf.modules.d/` are processed. The module configuration files in `/etc/httpd/conf.modules.d/` contain any configuration files necessary to load modules.\r\n\r\n\r\n```\r\n<VirtualHost *:80>\r\n    ProxyPreserveHost On\r\n    ProxyPass / http://127.0.0.1:5000/\r\n    ProxyPassReverse / http://127.0.0.1:5000/\r\n    ServerName www.example.com\r\n    ServerAlias *.example.com\r\n</VirtualHost>\r\n```\r\n\r\nThe `VirtualHost` block can appear multiple times, in one or more files on a server. In the preceding configuration file, Apache accepts public traffic on port 80. The domain `www.example.com` is being served, and the `*.example.com` alias resolves to the same website. See [Name-based virtual host support](https://httpd.apache.org/docs/current/vhosts/name-based.html) for more information. Requests are proxied at the root to port 5000 of the server at 127.0.0.1. For bi-directional communication, `ProxyPass` and `ProxyPassReverse` are required.\r\n\r\nSave the file and test the configuration. If everything passes, the response is `Syntax [OK]`.\r\n\r\n```bash\r\nsudo service httpd configtest\r\n```\r\n\r\nRestart Apache:\r\n\r\n```bash\r\nsudo systemctl restart httpd\r\nsudo systemctl enable httpd\r\n```\r\n\r\n\r\n#### <a name=\"app-update\"></a> ASP.NET Core 2.0 application code updates\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\nIf you're targeting .NET Core 2.x and the `Microsoft.AspNetCore.All` \"metapackage\":\r\n\r\n* Update its version number to 2.0.6 or later.\r\n* Updating will pull in the fixed packages listed above.\r\n\r\nIf you're targeting .NET Framework, update the packages listed above to their safe version or later.\r\n\r\nIf your application is using Kestrel without a proxy or the HttpOverrides functionality (UseForwardedHeaders with ForwardedHost) you must also add the host filtering middleware provided at https://github.com/aspnet/BasicMiddleware/tree/release/2.0/samples/HostFilteringSample/.\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n.NET Core and ASP.NET Core have two types of dependencies: direct and transitive. You must follow the update instructions below to address both types of dependency.\r\n\r\n### Direct dependencies\r\n\r\nDirect dependencies are dependencies where you specifically add a package to your project. For example, if you add the `Microsoft.AspNetCore.Mvc` package to your project then you have taken a direct dependency on `Microsoft.AspNetCore.Mvc`.\r\n\r\nDirect dependencies are discoverable by examining your *csproj* file.\r\n\r\n### Transitive dependencies\r\n\r\nTransitive dependencies occur when you add a package to your project that in turn relies on another package. For example, if you add the `Microsoft.AspNetCore.Mvc` package to your project it depends on the `Microsoft.AspNetCore.Mvc.Core` package (among others). Your project has a direct dependency on `Microsoft.AspNetCore.Mvc` and a transitive dependency on the `Microsoft.AspNetCore.Mvc.Core` package.\r\nTransitive dependencies are reviewable:\r\n\r\n* In the Visual Studio Solution Explorer window, which supports searching.\r\n* By examining the *project.assets.json* file contained in the obj directory of your project.\r\n\r\nThe *project.assets.json* files are the authoritative list of all packages used by your project, containing both direct and transitive dependencies.\r\n\r\n\r\n##### Fixing direct dependencies – Projects targeting .NET Core\r\n\r\nOpen *projectname.csproj* in your editor. If you're using Visual Studio, right-click the project and choose **Edit projectname.csproj** from the content menu, where projectname is the name of your project. Look for `PackageReference` elements. The following shows an example project file:\r\n\r\n```xml\r\n<Project Sdk=\"Microsoft.NET.Sdk.Web\">\r\n  <PropertyGroup>\r\n    <TargetFramework>netcoreapp2.0</TargetFramework>\r\n  </PropertyGroup>\r\n  <ItemGroup>\r\n    <PackageReference Include=\"Microsoft.AspNetCore.All\" Version=\"2.0.5\" />\r\n  </ItemGroup>\r\n  <ItemGroup>\r\n    <DotNetCliToolReference Include=\"Microsoft.VisualStudio.Web.CodeGeneration.Tools\" Version=\"2.0.0\" />\r\n  </ItemGroup>\r\n</Project>\r\n```\r\n\r\nThe preceding example has a reference to the vulnerable metapackage, as seen by the single `PackageReference` element. The name of the package is in the `Include` attribute. The package version number is in the `Version` attribute. The example shows a single direct dependency on `Microsoft.AspNetCore.All` version 2.0.5.\r\n\r\nTo update the version to the secure package, change the version number to a secure package version. In this example, update `Microsoft.AspNetCore.All` to 2.0.6 or later. Save the *csproj* file. The example *csproj* now looks as follows:\r\n\r\n```xml\r\n<Project Sdk=\"Microsoft.NET.Sdk.Web\">\r\n  <PropertyGroup>\r\n    <TargetFramework>netcoreapp2.0</TargetFramework>\r\n  </PropertyGroup>\r\n  <ItemGroup>\r\n    <PackageReference Include=\"Microsoft.AspNetCore.All\" Version=\"2.0.6\" />\r\n  </ItemGroup>\r\n  <ItemGroup>\r\n    <DotNetCliToolReference Include=\"Microsoft.VisualStudio.Web.CodeGeneration.Tools\" Version=\"2.0.0\" />\r\n  </ItemGroup>\r\n</Project>\r\n```\r\n\r\nIf you're using Visual Studio and save your updated *csproj* file, Visual Studio will restore the new package version. You can see the restore results by opening the **Output** window (Ctrl+Alt+O) and changing the **Show output from** drop-down list to **Package Manager**.\r\n\r\nIf you're not using Visual Studio, open a command line and change to your project directory. Execute the `dotnet restore` command to restore the updated dependencies.\r\n\r\n##### Fixing direct dependencies – Projects targeting .NET Framework\r\n\r\nOpen *projectname.csproj* in your editor. If you're using Visual Studio, right-click the project and choose **Edit projectname.csproj** from the content menu, where projectname is the name of your project. Look for `PackageReference` nodes. The following shows an example project file:\r\n\r\n```xml\r\n<Project Sdk=\"Microsoft.NET.Sdk.Web\">\r\n  <PropertyGroup>\r\n    <TargetFramework>net461</TargetFramework>\r\n  </PropertyGroup>\r\n  <ItemGroup>\r\n    <PackageReference Include=\"Microsoft.AspNetCore.HttpOverrides\" Version=\"2.0.1\" />\r\n  </ItemGroup>\r\n  <ItemGroup>\r\n    <DotNetCliToolReference Include=\"Microsoft.VisualStudio.Web.CodeGeneration.Tools\" Version=\"2.0.0\" />\r\n  </ItemGroup>\r\n</Project>\r\n```\r\n\r\nThe example has a reference to a single package, as seen by the `PackageReference` element. The name of the package is in the `Include` attribute. The package version number is in the `Version` attribute. The example shows a direct dependency on one of the vulnerable packages from the table above, `Microsoft.AspNetCore.HttpOverrides` version 2.0.1.\r\n\r\nTo update to the secure package, change the version number to the updated package version. In the example, this would be updating `Microsoft.AspNetCore.HttpOverrides` to 2.0.2 and later. Save the *csproj* file. The updated and secure *csproj* look as follows:\r\n\r\n``` XML\r\n<Project Sdk=\"Microsoft.NET.Sdk.Web\">\r\n  <PropertyGroup>\r\n    <TargetFramework>net461</TargetFramework>\r\n  </PropertyGroup>\r\n  <ItemGroup>\r\n    <PackageReference Include=\"Microsoft.AspNetCore.HttpOverrides\" Version=\"2.0.2\" />\r\n  </ItemGroup>\r\n  <ItemGroup>\r\n    <DotNetCliToolReference Include=\"Microsoft.VisualStudio.Web.CodeGeneration.Tools\" Version=\"2.0.0\" />\r\n  </ItemGroup>\r\n</Project>\r\n```\r\n\r\nIf you're using Visual Studio and save your updated *csproj* file, Visual Studio will restore the new package version. You can see the restore results by opening the **Output** window (Ctrl+Alt+O) and changing the **Show output from** drop-down list to **Package Manager**.\r\n\r\nIf you're not using Visual Studio, open a command line and change to your project directory. Execute the `dotnet restore` command to restore the new dependency version.\r\n\r\n##### After updating your direct dependencies\r\n\r\nRecompile your application.\r\n\r\nIf after recompilation you see a *Dependency conflict warning*, you must update your other direct dependencies to a compatible version. \r\n\r\nFor example if your project refers directly to `Microsoft.AspNetCore.Mvc.Cors` with a version number of `2.0.0`, when you update your `Microsoft.AspNetCore.Mvc` package to 2.0.1, compilation will throw:\r\n\r\n`NU1012      Dependency conflict. Microsoft.AspNetCore.Mvc 2.0.1 expected Microsoft.AspNetCore.Mvc.Cors >= 2.0.1 but received 2.0.0`\r\n\r\nTo fix this, edit the version for the expected package to be the version expected by updating your *project.json* in the same way that you used to update the vulnerable package versions.\r\n\r\nAfter you've addressed all of your direct dependencies, you must review your transitive dependencies.\r\n\r\n###### Reviewing transitive dependencies\r\n\r\nThere are two ways to view transitive dependencies. You can either use Visual Studio’s Solution Explorer, or you can review the *project.assets.json* file.\r\n\r\n###### Using Visual Studio Solution Explorer\r\n\r\nTo use Solution Explorer, open the project in Visual Studio 2017, and then press Ctrl+; to activate the search in Solution Explorer. Search for each of the vulnerable package names above and make a note of the version numbers of any results you find.\r\n\r\nFor example, searching for `Microsoft.AspNetCore.Mvc.Core` in an example project that contains a package that takes a dependency on `Microsoft.AspNetCore.Mvc` shows the following results in Visual Studio 2017:\r\n\r\n![vs2017](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/796298/25858816/8ecdc2b4-3491-11e7-9363-746804bb9832.png)\r\n\r\nThe search results appear as a tree. In these results, you can see a reference to `Microsoft.AspNetCore.Mvc.Core` version 1.1.2 is discovered.\r\n\r\nUnder the Dependencies node is a NuGet node. Under the NuGet node is the list of packages you have directly taken a dependency on and their versions. In this example, the application takes a direct dependency on `Microsoft.AspNetCore.Mvc`. `Microsoft.AspNetCore.Mvc` in turn has leaf nodes that list its dependencies and their versions. In the example, the `Microsoft.AspNetCore.Mvc` package takes a dependency on a version of `Microsoft.AspNetCore.Mvc.ApiExplorer`, that in turn takes a dependency on a vulnerable version of `Microsoft.AspNetCore.Mvc.Core`.\r\n\r\n###### Manually reviewing project.assets.json (VS2017)\r\n\r\nOpen the *project.assets.json* file from your project’s obj directory in your editor. We suggest you use an editor that understands JSON and allows you to collapse and expand nodes to review this file. Visual Studio and Visual Studio Code provide JSON friendly editing.\r\n\r\nSearch the *project.assets.json* file for each of the vulnerable packages, using the format `packagename/` for each of the package names from the preceding table. If you find the assembly name in your search:\r\n\r\n* Examine the line on which they are found, the version number is after the `/`.\r\n* Compare to the vulnerable versions table above.\r\n\r\nFor example, a search result that shows `Microsoft.AspNetCore.Mvc.Cors/1.1.0` is a reference to v1.1.0 of `Microsoft.AspNetCore.Mvc.Cors`.   If your *project.assets.json* file includes references to any of the vulnerable packages shown above, then you need to fix the transitive dependencies.\r\n\r\n###### Overriding transitive dependencies\r\n\r\nIf you have not found any reference to any vulnerable packages this means:\r\n\r\n* None of your direct dependencies depend on any vulnerable packages, or\r\n* You have already fixed the problem by updating the direct dependencies.\r\n\r\nIf your transitive dependency review found references to any of the vulnerable packages you must add a direct dependency to the updated package to your *csproj* file to override the transitive dependency.\r\n\r\nOpen *projectname.csproj* in your editor. If you're using Visual Studio, right-click the project and choose **Edit projectname.csproj** from the content menu, where projectname is the name of your project. Look for `PackageReference` nodes, for example:\r\n\r\n```xml\r\n<Project Sdk=\"Microsoft.NET.Sdk.Web\">\r\n  <PropertyGroup>\r\n    <TargetFramework>net461</TargetFramework>\r\n  </PropertyGroup>\r\n  <ItemGroup>\r\n    <PackageReference Include=\"ThirdParty.NotUpdatedYet\" Version=\"2.0.0\" />\r\n  </ItemGroup>\r\n  <ItemGroup>\r\n    <DotNetCliToolReference Include=\"Microsoft.VisualStudio.Web.CodeGeneration.Tools\" Version=\"2.0.0\" />\r\n  </ItemGroup>\r\n</Project>\r\n```\r\n\r\nFor each of the vulnerable packages your search returned, you must add a direct dependency to the updated version by adding it to the *csproj* file.\r\nYou do this by adding a new line to the dependencies section, referring the fixed version.\r\nFor example, if your search showed a transitive reference to the vulnerable `Microsoft.AspNetCore.HttpOverrides` version 2.0.0 you would add a reference to the fixed version, that is, 2.0.2 or later.\r\n\r\n```xml\r\n<Project Sdk=\"Microsoft.NET.Sdk.Web\">\r\n  <PropertyGroup>\r\n    <TargetFramework>net461</TargetFramework>\r\n  </PropertyGroup>\r\n  <ItemGroup>\r\n    <PackageReference Include=\"Microsoft.AspNetCore.HttpOverride\" Version=\"2.0.2\" />\r\n    <PackageReference Include=\"ThirdParty.NotUpdatedYet\" Version=\"2.0.0\" />\r\n  </ItemGroup>\r\n  <ItemGroup>\r\n    <DotNetCliToolReference Include=\"Microsoft.VisualStudio.Web.CodeGeneration.Tools\" Version=\"2.0.0\" />\r\n  </ItemGroup>\r\n</Project>\r\n```\r\n\r\nAfter you have added the direct dependency reference, save your *csproj* file.\r\n\r\nIf you're using Visual Studio, save your updated *csproj* file and Visual Studio will restore the new package versions.\r\nYou can see the restore results by opening the **Output** window (Ctrl+Alt+O) and changing the **Show output from** drop-down list to **Package Manager**.\r\n\r\nIf you're not using Visual Studio, open a command line and change to your project directory. Execute the `dotnet restore` command to restore the new dependencies.\r\n\r\n###### Rebuilding your application\r\n\r\nRebuild your application.

These images will continue to receive patch update whenever a 1.0.x, 1.1.x, or 2.0.x update ships, however, we will not produce a new version which contains the 2.1 runtime.\r\n\r\n### Why?\r\n \r\nThese images existed to support CI/CD pipelines that run apps on multiple versions for .NET Core in the same container. With each release, these images have grown in size. The 1.0-2.0 image is already about 1GB, and would continue to grow with runtime updates. \r\n \r\nFortunately, recent improvements to .NET Core (such as minor version roll-forward) and Docker (multi-stage builds) have reduced the need to use an image with multiple versions of .NET Core. We have seen usage of these multi-version images declining over time, and today, they are a small percentage of our Docker image usage.\r\n\r\nRather than maintaining a single, large image with all possible .NET Core runtimes, we encourage users to use multi-stage builds. Docker's multi-stage feature allows you to compose a single Dockerfile, but still use multiple .NET Core runtimes. Also, starting in 2.1, .NET Core supports rolling forward the runtime version within the major version, which will further reduce the need to have multiple 2.x runtimes side-by-side.\r\n \r\nFor discussion, use https://github.com/aspnet/aspnet-docker/issues/349","Url":"https://github.com/aspnet/Announcements/issues/292","RelatedDescription":"Open issue \"Deprecating the `microsoft/aspnetcore-build:1.0-2.0` Docker image\" (#292)"},{"Id":"301939059","IsPullRequest":false,"CreatedAt":"2018-03-02T23:33:38","Actor":"blowdart","Number":"291","RawContent":null,"Title":"Statement on ASP.NET susceptibility to the recent DuoLabs SAML vulnerability announcement.","State":"open","Body":"This week saw an announcement of vulnerabilities in  SAML parsing libraries by [DUO Labs](https://duo.com/blog/duo-finds-saml-vulnerabilities-affecting-multiple-implementations).

The ASP.NET team's development resources are finite, and we think we can deliver more valuable features to ASP.NET developers by focusing elsewhere.\r\n\r\nSo:\r\n\r\n* The `Microsoft.DotNet.Web.Spa.ProjectTemplates` package, containing **Angular**, **React**, and **React+Redux** templates, is **not affected**. This ships in the .NET Core SDK and is officially supported. We continue to invest development effort in this package. We can put *more* time and effort into these SPA templates now the effort isn't so spread out.\r\n* If you have an existing Aurelia/Knockout/Vue project based on our SPA templates, you're not directly affected because these templates are only used to create new projects. You can continue building and shipping your app forever. Obviously we still support and enhance the underlying ASP.NET Core APIs (such as those in JavaScriptServices) that you are using.\r\n* The `Microsoft.AspNetCore.SpaTemplates` package, containing Aurelia, Knockout, and Vue templates, continues to be available, but we'll no longer update it or work on issues related to it.\r\n* We encourage enthusiastic community members to [ship your own `dotnet new` templates](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/core/tools/custom-templates). The `dotnet new` system is extensible for this exact reason. If you want to own the go-to Aurelia/Knockout/Vue project template, now's your chance! You could [fork the ones from `Microsoft.AspNetCore.SpaTemplates`](https://github.com/aspnet/templating/tree/dev/src/Microsoft.AspNetCore.SpaTemplates), or start from scratch depending on what you prefer.\r\n* In the long term, if another JavaScript SPA framework becomes dominant, we will of course consider adding a template for it to the SDK templates package.\r\n\r\nI know this will be irritating to some people, especially those who have worked on PRs for the Aurelia/Knockout/Vue templates.

This advisory also provides guidance on what developers can do to update their applications correctly.\r\n\r\nMicrosoft is aware of an elevation of privilege vulnerability exists when a ASP.NET Core web application, created using vulnerable project templates, fails to properly sanitize web requests. An attacker who successfully exploited this vulnerability could perform content injection attacks and run script in the security context of the logged-on user.\r\n\r\nTo exploit the vulnerability, an attacker could send a specially crafted email, containing a malicious link, to a user. Alternatively, an attacker could use a chat client to social engineer a user into clicking the malicious link. However, in all cases to exploit this vulnerability a user must click a maliciously crafted link from an attacker.\r\n\r\nThe security update addresses the vulnerability by correcting the ASP.NET Core project templates.\r\n\r\nDevelopers who have generated applications from the vulnerable templates should change their code using the following instructions. They should also change their code to address a further vulnerability,  [CVE-2018-0785](https://github.com/aspnet/Announcements/issues/284), which is in the same templates. Finally installing the latest .NET Core SDK, version 2.1.4, from https://www.microsoft.com/net/download/ will update the templates to correct the issue for any new applications created.\r\n\r\n### Discussion\r\n\r\nPlease use https://github.com/aspnet/templating/issues/225 for discussion of this advisory.\r\n\r\n### Mitigation Factors\r\nASP.NET Core applications which are not created using the ASP.NET Core 2.0 Individual Authentication templates are not vulnerable to this issue.\r\n\r\n## Affected Software\r\nThe vulnerabilities affect any Microsoft .NET Core project if it uses any of affected runtime versions listed below and have generated applications using Individual Authentication with usernames and passwords stored within the application. Applications which use Azure Active Directory, or Azure Active Directory B2C are not affected.\r\n\r\nVulnerable .NET SDK Version | Fixed SDK Version\r\n----------------| -------------------------\r\n2.0.0, 2.0.2, 2.0.3, 2.1.2, 2.1.3 |  2.1.4\r\n\r\n### Advisory FAQ\r\n#### How do I know if I am affected?\r\n\r\nYour application will be affected if you generated it using the ASP.NET 2.0 Web Application template or the ASP.NET 2.0 Web Application (Model/View/Controller) template from a vulnerable SDK version where you have selected individual authentication where user accounts are stored in-app.\r\n\r\nTo check the runtimes installed on a computer you must view the contents of the runtime folder. By default these are\r\n\r\n| Operating System          | Location          |\r\n|---------------------------|-------------------|\r\n| Windows | C:\\Program Files\\dotnet\\sdk\\ |\r\n| macOS | /usr/local/share/dotnet/sdk/    |\r\n| Supported Linux platforms | /usr/share/dotnet/sdk/   |\r\n\r\nEach SDK version is installed in its own directory, where the directory name is the version number. If you do not have a directory for 2.1.4 then any applications generated for ASP.NET Core 2.0 using Individual Authentication may be vulnerable.. Downloads for all supported platforms can be acquired from https://www.microsoft.com/net/download/\r\n\r\n#### How do I fix my affected application?\r\nApplications can be fixed by changing the code created during application generation using the following instructions.\r\n\r\n#### For ASP.NET Core 2.0 Web Application (Razor Pages)\r\n\r\n1. Open `Pages\\Account\\Manage\\EnableAuthenticator.cshtml.cs` find the `OnPostAsync()` method and search for the following line\r\n\r\n```\r\n<div id=\"qrCodeData\" data-url=\"@Html.Raw(Model.AuthenticatorUri)\"></div>\r\n```\r\n\r\nReplace this line with the following code, removing the call to `Html.Raw()`\r\n\r\n```C#\r\n<div id=\"qrCodeData\" data-url=\"@Model.AuthenticatorUri\"></div>\r\n```\r\n\r\n2. Open the `Pages\\Account\\Manage\\EnableAuthenticator.cshtml.cs` and search for the following line, inside the `OnGetAsync()` method;\r\n\r\n```C#\r\nawait LoadSharedKeyAndQrCodeUriAsync(user);\r\n```\r\n\r\nRemove the code shown below which follows the call to `LoadSharedKeyAndQrCodeUriAsync(user);`\r\n\r\n```C#\r\nif (string.IsNullOrEmpty(SharedKey))\t\t\r\n{\t\t\r\n    await _userManager.ResetAuthenticatorKeyAsync(user);\t\t\r\n    await LoadSharedKeyAndQrCodeUriAsync(user);\t\t\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nThe `OnGetAsync()` method should now look like\r\n\r\n```C#\r\npublic async Task<IActionResult> OnGetAsync()\r\n{\r\n    var user = await _userManager.GetUserAsync(User);\r\n    if (user == null)\r\n    {\r\n        throw new ApplicationException($\"Unable to load user with ID '{_userManager.GetUserId(User)}'.\");\r\n    }\r\n\r\n    await LoadSharedKeyAndQrCodeUriAsync(user);\r\n\r\n    return Page();\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\n3. Still in the `Pages\\Account\\Manage\\EnableAuthenticator.cshtml.cs` file  and search for the `LoadSharedKeyAndQrCodeUriAsync(ApplicationUser user) function` and replace it with \r\n\r\n```C#\r\nprivate async Task LoadSharedKeyAndQrCodeUriAsync(ApplicationUser user)\r\n{\r\n    // Load the authenticator key & QR code URI to display on the form\r\n    var unformattedKey = await _userManager.GetAuthenticatorKeyAsync(user);\r\n    if (string.IsNullOrEmpty(unformattedKey))\r\n    {\r\n        await _userManager.ResetAuthenticatorKeyAsync(user);\r\n        unformattedKey = await _userManager.GetAuthenticatorKeyAsync(user);\r\n     }\r\n\r\n    SharedKey = FormatKey(unformattedKey);\r\n    AuthenticatorUri = GenerateQrCodeUri(user.Email, unformattedKey);\r\n }\r\n```\r\n\r\n4. Recompile your application and test you can generate 2fa recovery codes correctly, then redeploy your application.\r\n\r\n#### For ASP.NET Core 2.0 Web Application (Model/View/Controller)\r\n\r\n1. Open the `Controllers\\ManageController.cs` file and find the declaration for `private const string AuthenticatorUriFormat`. Add the following new const declaration below it;\r\n\r\n```C#\r\nprivate const string RecoveryCodesKey = nameof(RecoveryCodesKey);\r\n```\r\n\r\n2. Still in `Controllers\\ManageController.cs` file and find the `EnableAuthenticator()` function. Replace its contents with\r\n\r\n```C#\r\n[HttpGet]\r\npublic async Task<IActionResult> EnableAuthenticator()\r\n{\r\n    var user = await _userManager.GetUserAsync(User);\r\n    if (user == null)\r\n    {\r\n        throw new ApplicationException($\"Unable to load user with ID '{_userManager.GetUserId(User)}'.\");\r\n    }\r\n\r\n    var model = new EnableAuthenticatorViewModel();\r\n    await LoadSharedKeyAndQrCodeUriAsync(user, model);\r\n\r\n    return View(model);\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\n3. Still in `Controllers\\ManageController.cs` file and find the `EnableAuthenticator(EnableAuthenticatorViewModel model)` method.
