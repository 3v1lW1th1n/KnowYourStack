Create or open any .NET project with Visual Studio 2017. \r\n2. Execute \"Install-Package Selenium.WebDriver.MicrosoftWebDriver\" command at Package Manager Console. \r\n3. After it, the correct latest version \"10.0.15063\" was installed. (This is correct behavior) \r\n4. Next step, execute \"Update-Package Selenium.WebDriver.MicrosoftWebDriver\" command. \r\n5. Then, the command update the package to UNLISTED version \"10.1.14393\" !\r\n\r\n### Appendix Information\r\n\r\nI guess, this problem happens due to the JSON response from api.nuget.org.\r\n\r\nThe JSON reponse contains \"upper\" proprty, but it looks like include unlisted package versions.\r\n\r\n![image](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/95908/25183534/d08fa9a4-2552-11e7-8f4e-204207486981.png)\r\n\r\nIs it by design and it should not change? or should fix it?\n\n---\n\n@skofman1 commented on [Wed Apr 19 2017](https://github.com/NuGet/NuGetGallery/issues/3802#issuecomment-295411222)\n\n@joelverhagen , @emgarten , is this a client or server issue?\n\n---\n\n@emgarten commented on [Wed Apr 19 2017](https://github.com/NuGet/NuGetGallery/issues/3802#issuecomment-295439707)\n\nLooks like a client issue if the unlisted package is being installed. The upper and lower bounds are correct.\n\n---\n\n@joelverhagen commented on [Wed Apr 19 2017](https://github.com/NuGet/NuGetGallery/issues/3802#issuecomment-295440372)\n\nI confirmed this behavior in NuGet 4.2.0.2451 with a packages.config project. A PackageReference project does not reproduce the problem. The issue occurs for both V2 and V3 NuGet.org source URL.\r\n\r\nAs @emgarten, this seems to be a client issue.\n\n"},{"Id":"7594402414","Type":"IssuesEvent","CreatedAt":"2018-04-26T22:54:15","Actor":"rohit21agrawal","Repository":"NuGet/Home","Organization":"NuGet","RawContent":null,"RelatedAction":"closed","RelatedUrl":"https://github.com/NuGet/Home/issues/6866","RelatedDescription":"Closed issue \"restore and build should not be needed when using dotnet.exe to pack nuspec\" (#6866) at NuGet/Home","RelatedBody":"currently if using dotnet.exe to pack a nuspec file (via a csproj property), you need to set IncludeBuildOutput=false if you use the --no-build switch.
