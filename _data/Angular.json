However, if the user navigates to another component (map2) that also creates an Amchart map in its ngOnInit(), the map in the second component is not created and I get only an empty div (confirmed also by inspecting the dom). \r\n\r\nAmcharts requires that we provide the id of the div that it will use to create the chart when we call its makeChart function.  The chart/map is created as a child element of that div.\r\nexample: `<div id=\"chartdiv\" class=\"map\"></div>`\r\n\r\nI have noticed that the problem only occurs when the divs used in both compoments (map1 and map2) have the same id.  If I use different ids, the map is always created as expected.\r\nexample: \r\nMap1 template:\r\n`<div id=\"chartdiv1\" class=\"map\"></div>`\r\nMap2 template:\r\n`<div id=\"chartdiv2\" class=\"map\"></div>`\r\n\r\nI have also noticed that when I use the same Id for both divs, and I therefore have the problem, I can briefly see that the map gets created a fraction of a second before leaving the component when I navigate from a component with a failed map (empty div) to another component that creates a map in a div with the same Id.\r\n\r\nThe behavior described above leads me to believe that, with Ivy, when I navigate to another component, the code in ngOnInit() starts its execution in the context of the template of the previous component that has not yet been deleted.  That would explain why the map is not created when I navigate from one component having a map to another one that tries to create one.\r\n\r\nThe workaround involving having different div's id works in this context but If I were to refactor the application to encapsulate the map in a dedicated component and insert that component in both map1 and map2 components it would likely not work because again a div with the same id would exist in two different routes.\r\n\r\n## üî¨ Minimal Reproduction\r\nI have created a minimal reproduction in the following repo: [TestIvyRc4](https://github.com/MakesNine/TestIvyRc4)\r\n\r\n- The master branch contains the code that generates the error.\r\nng serve, open the app on localhost:4200, click the link \"Navigate to first component with a map\" than click the other link, \"Navigate to second component with a map\".\r\n\r\n- The ivy-false branch contains the same code but Ivy set to false in the angularCompilerOptions.  You can verify that the problem doesn't occur with this branch.\r\n\r\n- In the third branch named fix-chartdiv, you have the same code as in master except for the different ids provided in the templates of both map components.  The changed ids are also used accordingly in the createChart function of these components.  You can use this branch to confirm that the error goes away using a different id for each div.\r\n\r\n\r\n## üî• Exception or Error\r\nThe application doesn't throw an exception/ error.  You can see however that the map isn't created.\r\n\r\n\r\n## üåç  Your Environment\r\n\r\n**Angular Version:**\r\n   / \\   _ __   __ _ _   _| | __ _ _ __     / ___| |   |_ _|\r\n   / ‚ñ≥ \\ | '_ \\ / _` | | | | |/ _` | '__|   | |   | |    | |\r\n  / ___ \\| | | | (_| | |_| | | (_| | |      | |___| |___ | |\r\n /_/   \\_\\_| |_|\\__, |\\__,_|_|\\__,_|_|       \\____|_____|___|\r\n                |___/\r\n\r\n\r\nAngular CLI: 9.0.0-rc.4\r\nNode: 10.15.0\r\nOS: win32 x64\r\n\r\nAngular: 9.0.0-rc.4\r\n... animations, cli, common, compiler, compiler-cli, core, forms\r\n... language-service, platform-browser, platform-browser-dynamic\r\n... router\r\nIvy Workspace: Yes\r\n\r\nPackage                            Version\r\n------------------------------------------------------------\r\n@angular-devkit/architect          0.900.0-rc.4\r\n@angular-devkit/build-angular      0.900.0-rc.4\r\n@angular-devkit/build-ng-packagr   0.900.0-rc.4\r\n@angular-devkit/build-optimizer    0.900.0-rc.4\r\n@angular-devkit/build-webpack      0.900.0-rc.4\r\n@angular-devkit/core               9.0.0-rc.4\r\n@angular-devkit/schematics         9.0.0-rc.4\r\n@ngtools/webpack                   9.0.0-rc.4\r\n@schematics/angular                9.0.0-rc.4\r\n@schematics/update                 0.900.0-rc.4\r\nng-packagr                         9.0.0-rc.2\r\nrxjs                               6.5.3\r\ntypescript                         3.6.4\r\nwebpack                            4.41.2\r\n\r\nOther information:\r\nWe do have a workaround for the map creation problem, but I'm afraid that we will encounter other synchronization problems if it is confirmed that ngOnInit code can execute in the context of the template of a previous route.","Url":"https://github.com/angular/angular/issues/34139","RelatedDescription":"Open issue \"Ivy: html elements from previous route are still in the DOM when ngOnInit and ngAfterViewInit are executed\" (#34139)"},{"Id":"530054543","IsPullRequest":false,"CreatedAt":"2019-11-28T19:26:03","Actor":"Wintermoose","Number":"34138","RawContent":null,"Title":"ngcc cannot handle UMD factory without parameters ( renderFactoryParameters )","State":"open","Body":"\r\n# üêû bug report\r\n\r\n### Affected Package\r\nThe issue is caused by package @angular/compiler-cli\r\n\r\n### Is this a regression?\r\n\r\nDon't know\r\n\r\n### Description\r\n\r\nAs part of our internal library, we have simple module that has no dependencies (two of them actually, but here I'll pick the primitive one).

Because of that, platform-server/http's xhr2 cookies setting remains unchanged (because I'm actually changing the settings of that new instance, not the one of platform-server/http).\r\n\r\n## What is the new behavior?\r\n\r\nThis Pull Request is to expose the XHR client used in platform-server/http, so that anyone can tweak it the way they want, especially for SSR-related issues.\r\n\r\n\r\n## Does this PR introduce a breaking change?\r\n\r\n- [ ] Yes\r\n- [x] No\r\n\r\n\r\n<!-- If this PR contains a breaking change, please describe the impact and migration path for existing applications below. -->\r\n\r\n\r\n## Other information\r\n","Url":"https://github.com/angular/angular/pull/34111","RelatedDescription":"Open PR \"feat(platform-server): Expose XHR client used in platform-server/http\" (#34111)"}],"ResultType":"GitHubIssue"},"AngularCli-Issues":{"Issues":[{"Id":"530140923","IsPullRequest":false,"CreatedAt":"2019-11-29T03:38:36","Actor":"vthinkxie","Number":"16311","RawContent":null,"Title":"use cypress as the default e2e tool","State":"open","Body":"<!--üîÖüîÖüîÖüîÖüîÖüîÖüîÖüîÖüîÖüîÖüîÖüîÖüîÖüîÖüîÖüîÖüîÖüîÖüîÖüîÖüîÖüîÖüîÖüîÖüîÖüîÖüîÖüîÖüîÖüîÖüîÖ\r\n\r\nOh hi there! üòÑ\r\n\r\nTo expedite issue processing please search open and closed issues before submitting a new one.\r\nExisting issues often contain information about workarounds, resolution, or progress updates.\r\n\r\nüîÖüîÖüîÖüîÖüîÖüîÖüîÖüîÖüîÖüîÖüîÖüîÖüîÖüîÖüîÖüîÖüîÖüîÖüîÖüîÖüîÖüîÖüîÖüîÖüîÖüîÖüîÖüîÖüîÖüîÖüîÖüîÖüîÖ-->\r\n\r\n\r\n# üöÄ Feature request\r\n\r\n\r\n### Command (mark with an `x`)\r\n<!-- Can you pin-point the command or commands that are relevant for this feature request? -->\r\n<!-- ‚úçÔ∏èedit: -->\r\n```\r\n- [ ] new\r\n- [ ] build\r\n- [ ] serve\r\n- [ ] test\r\n- [x] e2e\r\n- [ ] generate\r\n- [ ] add\r\n- [ ] update\r\n- [ ] lint\r\n- [ ] xi18n\r\n- [ ] run\r\n- [ ] config\r\n- [ ] help\r\n- [ ] version\r\n- [ ] doc\r\n```\r\n\r\n### Description\r\nprotractor is good, but cypress provides a much better user experience than protractor in e2e testing\r\n\r\n\r\n### Describe the solution you'd like\r\n\r\nreplace the e2e testing tools with cypress in angular cli\r\n\r\nThere is a schematic provided by https://www.npmjs.com/package/@briebug/cypress-schematic, but it would be better to make it the default one since angular cli should provide a better experience out of the box.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Describe alternatives you've considered\r\n\r\na related issue in https://github.com/angular/angular-cli/issues/8013 2 years ago","Url":"https://github.com/angular/angular-cli/issues/16311","RelatedDescription":"Open issue \"use cypress as the default e2e tool\" (#16311)"},{"Id":"529910751","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2019-11-28T13:24:03","Actor":"alan-agius4","Number":"16310","RawContent":null,"Title":"refactor(@schematics/angular): clean up module schematic template","State":"open","Body":"","Url":"https://github.com/angular/angular-cli/pull/16310","RelatedDescription":"Open PR \"refactor(@schematics/angular): clean up module schematic template\" (#16310)"},{"Id":"529809378","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2019-11-28T13:09:37","Actor":"alan-agius4","Number":"16309","RawContent":null,"Title":"fix(@angular/cli): add more packages to packageGroup","State":"closed","Body":"In a workspace users, might have a direct depedencies on packages which are currently not listed in the `packageGroup` such as `@angular-devkit/schematics`.\r\n\r\nA use-case for this would be that users might have a schematics library in their workspace or using the `@angular-devkit/architect-cli` with Bazel which is currently in prototype.\r\n\r\nFixes #16307","Url":"https://github.com/angular/angular-cli/pull/16309","RelatedDescription":"Closed or merged PR \"fix(@angular/cli): add more packages to packageGroup\" (#16309)"},{"Id":"529777805","IsPullRequest":false,"CreatedAt":"2019-11-28T10:18:31","Actor":"lacolaco","Number":"16308","RawContent":null,"Title":"Proposal: pre/post-commands for Angular CLI","State":"closed","Body":"<!--üîÖüîÖüîÖüîÖüîÖüîÖüîÖüîÖüîÖüîÖüîÖüîÖüîÖüîÖüîÖüîÖüîÖüîÖüîÖüîÖüîÖüîÖüîÖüîÖüîÖüîÖüîÖüîÖüîÖüîÖüîÖ\r\n\r\nOh hi there! üòÑ\r\n\r\nTo expedite issue processing please search open and closed issues before submitting a new one.\r\nExisting issues often contain information about workarounds, resolution, or progress updates.\r\n\r\nüîÖüîÖüîÖüîÖüîÖüîÖüîÖüîÖüîÖüîÖüîÖüîÖüîÖüîÖüîÖüîÖüîÖüîÖüîÖüîÖüîÖüîÖüîÖüîÖüîÖüîÖüîÖüîÖüîÖüîÖüîÖüîÖüîÖ-->\r\n\r\n\r\n# üöÄ Feature request\r\n\r\n\r\n### Command (mark with an `x`)\r\n\r\n- All commands\r\n\r\n### Description\r\n\r\nThis idea is inspired by npm-scripts. I'd like to introduce a feature that allows us to define a `prebuild` script in `angular.json`.\r\nThat is useful and powerful for solving build process issues like this:\r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/angular/angular-cli/issues/4318\r\n\r\nCurrently, Angular CLI doesn't have hooks on its commands. To execute preprocessing scripts like code-generation before `ng build`, developers have to do it manually.\r\n\r\nIn general, `ng build` is often aliased as `npm run build`. And for production build, often `ng build --prod` is aliased as a different command like `npm run build:prod`. Then my `package.json` becomes like below;\r\n\r\n```json\r\n{\r\n  \"scripts\": {\r\n    \"build\": \"ng build\",\r\n    \"build:prod\": \"ng build --prod\"\r\n  }\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nIn that case, for adding preprocess script, I have to add it into each scripts like this;\r\n\r\n```json\r\n{\r\n  \"scripts\": {\r\n    \"build\": \"npm run codegen && ng build\",\r\n    \"build:prod\": \"npm run codegen && ng build --prod\",\r\n    \"codegen\": \"...\"\r\n  }\r\n}\r\n```\r\nI can use `pre-` hook of npm-scripts, however, a problem is there are two build scripts. It brings a lot of scripts in `package.json`. \r\n\r\n```json\r\n{\r\n  \"scripts\": {\r\n    \"prebuild\": \"npm run codegen\",\r\n    \"build\": \"ng build\",\r\n    \"prebuild:prod\": \"npm run prebuild\",\r\n    \"build:prod\": \"ng build --prod\",\r\n    \"codegen\": \"...\"\r\n  }\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nThis problem can be more serious in a workspace having multiple projects. Each build commands have to take project identifier and often these are separated as different npm-scripts.\r\n\r\n```json\r\n{\r\n  \"scripts\": {\r\n    \"build:appA\": \"ng build appA\",\r\n    \"build:appA:prod\": \"ng build appA --prod\",\r\n    \"build:appB\": \"ng build appB\",\r\n    \"build:appB:prod\": \"ng build appB --prod\",\r\n  }\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nToo many npm-scripts are hard to maintain. So I'd like to propose Angular CLI's command hook feature.\r\n\r\n### Describe the solution you'd like\r\n\r\n**CLI command hook** is a mechanism to execute a script before/after running CLI's command. It is not only for `ng build` but all command. \r\n\r\nWith the hook, pre-build code-generation is able to be configured in `angular.json` like below;\r\n\r\n```json\r\n{\r\n  \"projects\": {\r\n    \"appA\": {\r\n      \"architect\": {\r\n        \"build\": {\r\n          \"hooks\": {\r\n            \"pre\": \"npm run codegen\"\r\n          },\r\n          \"configurations\": {\r\n             \"production\": {\r\n                \"hooks\": {\r\n                   \"pre\": \"npm run codegen:prod\",\r\n                 }\r\n              }\r\n           }\r\n        }\r\n      }\r\n    }\r\n  }\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nOnce configuring this, it can work with `--prod` or any `--configuration`s because each configuration can have its own `hooks` option to override.\r\nAnd any architect commands can be configured as well as `build`. Each architect author doesn't have to know about that.\r\n\r\nEach hook script will be executed at the location of `angular.json`. The initial `CWD` is the workspace root.","Url":"https://github.com/angular/angular-cli/issues/16308","RelatedDescription":"Closed issue \"Proposal: pre/post-commands for Angular CLI\" (#16308)"},{"Id":"529759741","IsPullRequest":false,"CreatedAt":"2019-11-28T08:21:31","Actor":"florian-kittel","Number":"16307","RawContent":null,"Title":"ng update does not update @angular-devkit/schematics","State":"open","Body":"<!--üîÖüîÖüîÖüîÖüîÖüîÖüîÖüîÖüîÖüîÖüîÖüîÖüîÖüîÖüîÖüîÖüîÖüîÖüîÖüîÖüîÖüîÖüîÖüîÖüîÖüîÖüîÖüîÖüîÖüîÖüîÖ\r\n\r\nOh hi there! üòÑ\r\n\r\nTo expedite issue processing please search open and closed issues before submitting a new one.\r\nExisting issues often contain information about workarounds, resolution, or progress updates.\r\n\r\nüîÖüîÖüîÖüîÖüîÖüîÖüîÖüîÖüîÖüîÖüîÖüîÖüîÖüîÖüîÖüîÖüîÖüîÖüîÖüîÖüîÖüîÖüîÖüîÖüîÖüîÖüîÖüîÖüîÖüîÖüîÖüîÖüîÖ-->\r\n\r\n\r\n# üêû Bug report\r\n\r\n### Command (mark with an `x`)\r\n<!-- Can you pin-point the command or commands that are effected by this bug? -->\r\n<!-- ‚úçÔ∏èedit: -->\r\n\r\n- [x] update\r\n\r\n\r\n### Is this a regression?\r\n\r\n<!-- Did this behavior use to work in the previous version? -->\r\n<!-- ‚úçÔ∏è--> Not working in previous versions as well.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Description\r\n\r\n<!-- ‚úçÔ∏è--> I have a library project and @angular-devkit/schematics was installed automatically by ng generate library <name>.

And it seems that gives one more reason people not to do it. But we can help alleviate some of that and have people writing the tests and not the boilerplate.\r\n\r\nGiven the class under test file CLI could : (`ng g spec components/my.component.ts`)\r\n * read the dependencies - using Typescript and getting names and types of deps\r\n * generate spec file - using schematics \r\n * update existing spec files - using a mixture of the above two\r\n\r\nAn implementation can be found here https://github.com/gparlakov/scuri (VS Code extension https://github.com/gparlakov/scuri-code). It supports: \r\n * create spec for existing Typescript class\r\n * update existing spec  (including CLI generated spec)\r\n * generate autospy function to aid in mocks - [here](https://github.com/gparlakov/scuri/blob/master/src/autospy/files/jasmine/auto-spy.ts.template)\r\n\r\n\r\n### Describe alternatives you've considered\r\nAfter talking with @mgechev among other people, I'd like to start a discussion and see:\r\n * is this is as big of a problem as I see it?\r\n * do we fix it \"inside\" of CLI or \"outside\"?","Url":"https://github.com/angular/angular-cli/issues/16288","RelatedDescription":"Open issue \"Spec (tests) maintenance aid\" (#16288)"},{"Id":"528469833","IsPullRequest":false,"CreatedAt":"2019-11-26T06:44:26","Actor":"khteh","Number":"16284","RawContent":null,"Title":"ERROR in The Angular Compiler requires TypeScript >=3.4.0 and <3.6.0 but 3.7.2 was found instead.","State":"closed","Body":"<!--üîÖüîÖüîÖüîÖüîÖüîÖüîÖüîÖüîÖüîÖüîÖüîÖüîÖüîÖüîÖüîÖüîÖüîÖüîÖüîÖüîÖüîÖüîÖüîÖüîÖüîÖüîÖüîÖüîÖüîÖüîÖ\r\n\r\nOh hi there! üòÑ\r\n\r\nTo expedite issue processing please search open and closed issues before submitting a new one.\r\nExisting issues often contain information about workarounds, resolution, or progress updates.\r\n\r\nüîÖüîÖüîÖüîÖüîÖüîÖüîÖüîÖüîÖüîÖüîÖüîÖüîÖüîÖüîÖüîÖüîÖüîÖüîÖüîÖüîÖüîÖüîÖüîÖüîÖüîÖüîÖüîÖüîÖüîÖüîÖüîÖüîÖ-->\r\n\r\n\r\n# üêû Bug report\r\n\r\n### Command (mark with an `x`)\r\n<!-- Can you pin-point the command or commands that are effected by this bug? -->\r\n<!-- ‚úçÔ∏èedit: -->\r\n\r\n- [ ] new\r\n- [ x] build\r\n- [ ] serve\r\n- [ ] test\r\n- [ ] e2e\r\n- [ ] generate\r\n- [ ] add\r\n- [ ] update\r\n- [ ] lint\r\n- [ ] xi18n\r\n- [ ] run\r\n- [ ] config\r\n- [ ] help\r\n- [ ] version\r\n- [ ] doc\r\n\r\n\r\n### Is this a regression?\r\n\r\n<!-- Did this behavior use to work in the previous version? -->\r\n<!-- ‚úçÔ∏è--> Yes, the previous version in which this bug was not present was: ....\r\n\r\n\r\n### Description\r\n\r\n<!-- ‚úçÔ∏è--> A clear and concise description of the problem...\r\n\r\n\r\n## üî¨ Minimal Reproduction\r\n<!--\r\nSimple steps to reproduce this bug.\r\n\r\nPlease include: commands run (including args), packages added, related code changes.\r\n\r\nIf reproduction steps are not enough for reproduction of your issue, please create a minimal GitHub repository with the reproduction of the issue. \r\nA good way to make a minimal reproduction is to create a new app via `ng new repro-app` and add the minimum possible code to show the problem. \r\nShare the link to the repo below along with step-by-step instructions to reproduce the problem, as well as expected and actual behavior.\r\n\r\nIssues that don't have enough info and can't be reproduced will be closed.\r\n\r\nYou can read more about issue submission guidelines here: https://github.com/angular/angular-cli/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md#-submitting-an-issue\r\n-->\r\n\r\n## üî• Exception or Error\r\n<pre><code>\r\n<!-- If the issue is accompanied by an exception or an error, please share it below: -->\r\n<!-- ‚úçÔ∏è-->\r\n\r\n</code></pre>\r\n\r\n\r\n## üåç Your Environment\r\n<pre><code>\r\n<!-- run `ng version` and paste output below -->\r\n<!-- ‚úçÔ∏è-->\r\n$ ng version\r\n\r\n     _                      _                 ____ _     ___\r\n    / \\   _ __   __ _ _   _| | __ _ _ __     / ___| |   |_ _|\r\n   / ‚ñ≥ \\ | '_ \\ / _` | | | | |/ _` | '__|   | |   | |    | |\r\n  / ___ \\| | | | (_| | |_| | | (_| | |      | |___| |___ | |\r\n /_/   \\_\\_| |_|\\__, |\\__,_|_|\\__,_|_|       \\____|_____|___|\r\n                |___/\r\n    \r\n\r\nAngular CLI: 8.3.19\r\nNode: 13.0.1\r\nOS: linux x64\r\nAngular: 8.2.14\r\n... animations, common, compiler, compiler-cli, core, forms\r\n... language-service, platform-browser, platform-browser-dynamic\r\n... platform-server, router\r\n\r\nPackage                           Version\r\n-----------------------------------------------------------\r\n@angular-devkit/architect         0.803.19\r\n@angular-devkit/build-optimizer   0.803.19\r\n@angular-devkit/core              8.3.19\r\n@angular-devkit/schematics        8.3.19\r\n@angular/cli                      8.3.19\r\n@ngtools/webpack                  8.3.19\r\n@schematics/angular               8.3.19\r\n@schematics/update                0.803.19\r\nrxjs                              6.5.3\r\ntypescript                        3.7.2\r\nwebpack                           4.41.2\r\n</code></pre>\r\n\r\n**Anything else relevant?**\r\n<!-- ‚úçÔ∏èIs this a browser specific issue?

I have had an internal version for my own projects for some time(back since angular.js and now upgraded/rewrite for angular 2+) now which wrapped the google maps lib to provide an angular integration. \r\n\r\nOne of the major issues we had was you do not want to wait for or load the google maps api on every page when it isn't needed. For our use case we were only using it on a details page for 2 records + on some reports if they happened to have a map. It required some heavy changes to make all google map related calls actually start from a promise/observable which loads the sdk first if it isn't already present.\r\n\r\nI get that there is the `async` and other script tags to defer loading but still once you need this feature it is basically a must have and it also requires some hard API changes so I'd really hope it's could be applied sooner rather than later.\r\n\r\nI currently have directives/components for the following:\r\n- routes\r\n- markers\r\n- heat maps\r\n- the map itself\r\n\r\n@mbehrlich From release notes I think you are the primary person working on maps.
