I'm the author of the OverlayScrollbars Library.\r\nThe library is written in vanilla Javascript and I'm currently providing a Vue wrapper Component for it.\r\nI ran into a issue with the class attribute recently and I need some guidance of someone who has better understanding of the overall structure of Vue.\r\n\r\nThe setup (minimal example):\r\nIn Vue I'm rendering a div:\r\n<div class=\"my-host\"></div>\r\n\r\nThen I'm initializing the library in the mounted hook\r\n```js\r\nmounted() {\r\n    myLibrary(this.$el);\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nThe library is adding internally classes to the already rendered div, so the virtual node still looks like this:\r\n```html\r\n<div class=\"my-host\"></div>\r\n```\r\nBut the real DOM element might look like this:\r\n```html\r\n<div class=\"my-host my-host-option-a my-host-option-b xyz\"></div>\r\n```\r\n\r\nThis leads to no problems, as long as the class attribute is set only once / is static, but as soon as you change it from the outside, vue overwrites the class names set by the library internally, because vue has no clue about it.\r\n\r\nMy question is now, how can I access the class string inside the virtual DOM node? I've written a method which is able to merge all class names correctly, but in order to do that, I need access to the class names which were set by vue. (e.g. which are inside the virtual DOM)\r\n\r\nAre there some best practices to do that? - Or is there a different way to handle my problem? I'm sure I'm not the first with this kind of issue, since this could be pretty common among authors of 3rd party libraries.\r\n\r\nI've also found out that I could access these values with:`$vnode.data.class` and `$vnode.data.staticClass`, but it feels like a hack.\r\n\r\n### What does the proposed API look like?\r\nThere are many possibilites to solve this issue, you could just expose the desired values inside the $attrs object, or make it observable inside the watch object. I know that in Vue3 it will be accessable in the $attrs object, but is there a workaround in the meantime for Vue2.x?\r\n\r\n<!-- generated by vue-issues.

Importing parseJSON in main.js (before importing Vue or App) doesn't work, either.

The check in push state wheter push state can be used, checks for `window.history && 'pushState' in window.history`, but office.js resets the fields on window.history, not window.history itself (see https://stackoverflow.com/a/42703406/). I propose we check if Office.js is available in the context, and if so, we disable the push state.\r\n\r\n### What does the proposed API look like?\r\nWe would add a check at this position:\r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/vuejs/vue-router/blob/c0d3376f4e3527bd761bd325873366ed74f5736b/src/util/push-state.js#L17\r\n\r\nThe additional check could look like this:\r\n\r\n```const officeJsLoaded = window.Office && window.Office.context;```\r\n\r\nso the whole function might look like this:\r\n\r\n```\r\nexport const supportsPushState =\r\n  inBrowser &&\r\n  (function () {\r\n    const ua = window.navigator.userAgent\r\n    const officeJsLoaded = window.Office && window.Office.context\r\n\r\n    if (\r\n      officeJsLoaded ||\r\n      ((ua.indexOf('Android 2.') !== -1 || ua.indexOf('Android 4.0') !== -1) &&\r\n      ua.indexOf('Mobile Safari') !== -1 &&\r\n      ua.indexOf('Chrome') === -1 &&\r\n      ua.indexOf('Windows Phone') === -1)\r\n    ) {\r\n      return false\r\n    }\r\n\r\n    return window.history && 'pushState' in window.history\r\n  })()\r\n```\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAlternatively, we could check if `window.history.pushState` is null, but I am not sure of the implications of this. Maybe someone who knows the expected state in the browsers can shed a light wheter that would make sense.\r\n\r\nThis would result in this return statement, the rest of the function not being changed:\r\n```\r\nreturn window.history && 'pushState' in window.history && window.history.pushState !== null\r\n```\r\n\r\n<!-- generated by vue-issues.

It is impossible to clean up its popstate listener.\r\n\r\n#### Basepath bug\r\n\r\nIf you have multiple vue applications, each using vue-router, they must all share the same base path, even if you ensure only one of them is active at a time by destroying / remounting when navigating between them. Otherwise they will all attempt to ensure that every route starts with their base path.\r\n\r\nSame goes for if you have one vue-router and one react-router. The vue-router will force all urls to start with its base path within the react-owned pages, even if you have destroyed the vue application before navigating to the react application.\r\n\r\n### What is expected?\r\nI think the best solution is to call `window.addEventListener('popstate', handler)` when `const intance = new Vue({router})` is called, instead of when `new VueRouter()` is called. And then call `window.removeEventListener('popstate', handler)` when `instance.$destroy()` is called.\r\n\r\nAlternatively, it could be cleaned up like so:\r\n\r\n```js\r\n// Alternative solution (not my preferred one, but works)\r\n\r\nconst router = new VueRouter({...})\r\n// later, to clean up event listeners:\r\nrouter.detach()\r\n// later, to reattach event listeners\r\nrouter.attach()\r\n```\r\n\r\n### What is actually happening?\r\nwindow.addEventListener is called during `new VueRouter()`, and there is no way to ever remove that event listener.\r\n\r\n---\r\nSee related https://github.com/single-spa/single-spa/issues/488. I am a maintainer of single-spa, which has dozens of organizations using one or more instances of vue-router. For us, cleaning up the event listener when the application is unmounted is important to being able to have isolated apps on the same page.\r\n\r\n<!-- generated by vue-issues.

When the dynamic module is installed with the `installModule` function and the `hot` option is enabled, the current implementation skips creating any state for the new module.  This introduces side effects, where the module is registered in the vuex store but the state can't be retrieved if there was no state previously present.\r\n\r\nThe [_vuex-persist_](https://github.com/championswimmer/vuex-persist) lib is in use, but it is used to hydrate any past state down to _vuex_.  The store, while using the _vuex-persist_ lib, has the data initialised in the following order.\r\n\r\n1. The store is created by _vuex_ and any known modules are initialised with their default values.\r\n2. If there are data in the local storage within the browser, it is loaded into the store state replacing the default state data.\r\n3. Dynamic modules are added as they are needed.\r\n\r\nUpon modifying the `installModule` function, to check if the state of the new dynamic module exists, the problem is resolved.  Essentially, if the state of the module doesn't currently exist in the `parentState` within the store, then the default module state is created and registered.\r\n\r\nOne set of changes that fix this case are as follows.\r\n\r\nIn [`src/store.js`](https://github.com/vuejs/vuex/blob/dev/src/store.js) the following code seems to be the offending code.\r\n\r\n```js\r\n// set state\r\nif (!isRoot && !hot) {\r\n  const parentState = getNestedState(rootState, path.slice(0, -1))\r\n  const moduleName = path[path.length - 1]\r\n  store._withCommit(() => {\r\n    if (process.env.NODE_ENV !== 'production') {\r\n      if (moduleName in parentState) {\r\n        console.warn(\r\n          `[vuex] state field \"${moduleName}\" was overridden by a module with the same name at \"${path.join('.')}\"`\r\n        )\r\n      }\r\n    }\r\n    Vue.set(parentState, moduleName, module.state)\r\n  })\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nWhen modified, the default state is created when the `moduleName` isn't found in the `parentState`.\r\n\r\n```js\r\n// set state\r\nvar parentState = getNestedState(rootState, path.slice(0, -1));\r\nvar moduleName = path[path.length - 1];\r\nvar moduleStateExists = moduleName in parentState\r\nif (!isRoot && (!hot || !moduleStateExists )) {\r\n store._withCommit(function () {\r\n   {\r\n     if (moduleStateExists) {\r\n       console.warn(\r\n         (\"[vuex] state field \\\"\"   moduleName   \"\\\" was overridden by a module with the same name at \\\"\"   (path.join('.'))   \"\\\"\")\r\n       );\r\n     }\r\n   }\r\n   Vue.set(parentState, moduleName, module.state);\r\n });\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nThere may be other ways to fix this issue, this is one potential solution that was discovered after some investigation.\r\n\r\n<!-- generated by vue-issues.
