The fix mentioned on stackoverflow is only a hack if you are using a single InputTagHelper.\r\n\r\nIf you create a custom TagHelper that inherits from InputTagHelper, the attributes cascade for each input element, so that if you add additional functionality such as adding an additional attribute, then the attributes get picked up.  In the current code, you end up with same same number of \"checkbox\" and \"hidden\" elements as the number of InputTagHelpers you use, but only for \"checkbox\".  All other input elements work correctly.  Also, you can see that each new checkbox only has attributes for the specific custom InputTagHelper that is used, and the attributes don't get merged like the other input elements do.\r\n\r\nThis is what I end up with the current code:\r\n\r\n```html\r\n<input data-val=\"true\" data-val-required=\"The UsingCreditCard field is required.\" id=\"UsingCreditCard\" name=\"UsingCreditCard\" type=\"checkbox\" value=\"true\" />\r\n<input name=\"UsingCreditCard\" type=\"hidden\" value=\"false\" />\r\n<input disabled=\"disabled\" id=\"UsingCreditCard\" name=\"UsingCreditCard\" type=\"checkbox\" value=\"true\" />\r\n<input name=\"UsingCreditCard\" type=\"hidden\" value=\"false\" />\r\n<input data-agl=\"agl\" id=\"UsingCreditCard\" name=\"UsingCreditCard\" type=\"checkbox\" value=\"true\" />\r\n<input name=\"UsingCreditCard\" type=\"hidden\" value=\"false\" />\r\n```\r\n\r\nInstead of this:\r\n\r\n```html\r\n<input data-agl=\"agl\" data-val=\"true\" data-val-required=\"The UsingCreditCard field is required.\" disabled=\"disabled\" id=\"UsingCreditCard\" name=\"UsingCreditCard\" type=\"checkbox\" value=\"true\" />\r\n<input name=\"UsingCreditCard\" type=\"hidden\" value=\"false\" />\r\n```\r\n"},{"Id":"7640528076","Type":"PullRequestEvent","CreatedAt":"2018-05-07T23:14:39","Actor":"mkArtakMSFT","Repository":"aspnet/Mvc","Organization":"aspnet","RawContent":null,"RelatedAction":"closed","RelatedUrl":"https://github.com/aspnet/Mvc/pull/5903","RelatedDescription":"Closed pull request \"Fix \"checkbox\" when using multiple InputTagHelper\" (#5903) at aspnet/Mvc","RelatedBody":"Fixes #5902"}],"ResultType":"GitHubEvent"},"Identity":{"Events":[{"Id":"7640581781","Type":"PullRequestEvent","CreatedAt":"2018-05-07T23:32:10","Actor":"ryanbrandenburg","Repository":"aspnet/Identity","Organization":"aspnet","RawContent":null,"RelatedAction":"merged","RelatedUrl":"https://github.com/aspnet/Identity/pull/1780","RelatedDescription":"Merged pull request \"Upgrade to netcoreapp22\" (#1780) at aspnet/Identity","RelatedBody":null},{"Id":"7632226244","Type":"PullRequestEvent","CreatedAt":"2018-05-05T12:52:03","Actor":"DamirAinullin","Repository":"aspnet/Identity","Organization":"aspnet","RawContent":null,"RelatedAction":"closed","RelatedUrl":"https://github.com/aspnet/Identity/pull/1399","RelatedDescription":"Closed pull request \"Fix for couple of obvious typos\" (#1399) at aspnet/Identity","RelatedBody":"Fix for couple of obvious typos."},{"Id":"7630809576","Type":"IssuesEvent","CreatedAt":"2018-05-04T21:14:16","Actor":"ajcvickers","Repository":"aspnet/Identity","Organization":"aspnet","RawContent":null,"RelatedAction":"closed","RelatedUrl":"https://github.com/aspnet/Identity/issues/1782","RelatedDescription":"Closed issue \"AddDefaultIdentity should be in the D.I. namespace\" (#1782) at aspnet/Identity","RelatedBody":"It's currently in the Identity namespace.
