I always get the message \"This localhost page can’t be found\" (in Chrome). The app runs fine in Visual Studio 2019 Preview (16.2.0 Preview 2.0).  But when I publish the code to an IIS website I get the error. I'm thinking it has something to do with the new MapFallbackToClientSideBlazor call in Startup.Configure (but that's just a guess). \r\n\r\n### To Reproduce\r\nSteps to reproduce the behavior:\r\n1. I installed the preview 6 SDK and the Hosting Bundle (from https://dotnet.microsoft.com/download/dotnet-core/3.0)\r\n2. In Visual Studio Professional 2019 Preview (16.2.0 Preview 2.0) I created a Blazor hosted project and verified that the Preview 6 packages were referenced. This project runs correctly in Chrome within VS 2019/IIS Express.\r\n3. Publish the web site (I used a File publish on my local machine) and setup an application in IIS for the site (app pool = No Managed Code, No 32-bit, Integrated, ApplicationPoolIdentity)\r\n4. Navigate to the new site in Chrome. I get the message \"This locahost page can't be found\"\r\n5. If I start the executable (WindowsApplication1.Server.exe) from the command line and navigate to http://localhost:5000 I also get the error message (I swear this worked once but it doesn't work now).\r\n\r\n### Expected behavior\r\nI expected the site to run\r\n\r\n### Screenshots\r\nIf applicable, add screenshots to help explain your problem.\r\n\r\n### Additional context\r\nAdd any other context about the problem here.\r\nHere's what I get at the command line when I start the executable and navigate to port 5000:\r\ninfo: Microsoft.AspNetCore.DataProtection.KeyManagement.XmlKeyManager[0]\r\n      User profile is available.

Please describe.\r\n`Task<AuthenticationState>` is a new cascading parameter in blazor apps that allows downstream components access to the current authentication state of the user.\r\n\r\nIn my blazor client application, users authentication sessions have a sliding expiry.\r\n\r\nWhen the user's session expires, I'd like all downstream components to be notified that the authentication state has changed, so that they have an option to re-render - potentially an \"unauthenticated view\" for their content.\r\n\r\nToday, I can implement a custom `AuthenticationStateProvider ` that returns the `AuthenticationState` based on my own 3 minute sliding cache of the users JWT token - and this works fine - the downstream components get the `AuthenticationState` and the user is either authenticated or not authenticated.\r\n\r\nHowever, suppose the user is initially authenticated, but then after doing nothing on the site for 3 minutes, their authentication token expires. My custom authentication mechanism is able to raise an event when this happens, and my `AuthenticationStateProvider` will now return an unauthenticated principle when it is next asked for the `AuthenticationState`. However downstream components are not able to be notified that the authentication state has Jjust changed - instead they must each poll the cascaded `Task<AuthenticationState>` periodically.

I don't like this because it couples otherwise reusable components to my specific authentication mechanism. Even if I injected a generic Event / Message Bus / IPubSub service to decouple the components from my specific authentication mechanism, id still then be coupling them to that service. If I wanted to re-use those components in other apps, they's have to also adopt whatever service that was.

My problem is that its not doing what we would expect it to do.   \r\n\r\nManagement expects when a user logs in and clicks remember me that they will then not be required to type their login and password again for a month.  Whether or not they will still have to type in the 2fa code is up for debate.\r\n\r\nWhat is actually happening is that i can close the browser reboot and come back for about an hour and 15 minutes and then i will be forced to type my password again.    This still happens even with a valid `.AspNetCore.Identity.Application` cookie set that is not due to expire for another month.\r\n\r\nAfter digging around in the code i found that Remember me is actually isPersistent and it is defined as.\r\n\r\n>Flag indicating whether the sign-in cookie should persist after the browser is closed.\r\n\r\nWhich brings you to:\r\n\r\nThere are two different types of Cookies:\r\n\r\n- session cookies, held in memory, and which expire once the browser exits\r\n- persistent cookies, which have a time-to-live, are persisted on disk, and are sent by the browser until their time-to-live has elapsed.\r\n\r\nAll this being said remember machine 2fa works as expected i am not prompted again for the 2fa and i have a cookie on my machine `Identity.TwoFactorRememberMe`.\r\n\r\nSo I guess my question is why are we not getting a `Identity.FactorRememberMe` or why isn't sign in respecting a long life time of the `AspNetCore.Identity.Application` cookie?\r\n\r\nHow is this supposed to work exactly?

VS 2019 is about to be released in around early 2019\r\n2. ASP.NET Core 1.0/1.1 is not going to be supported anymore, based on [this page](https://github.com/dotnet/core/blob/master/microsoft-support.md).\r\n3. Creating new ASP.NET Core 1.0/1.1 will always install the .NET Core 1.0/1.1 web tooling, and this is not necessary when previous reason has reached the unsupported period and it's quite near or might be the same time of VS 2019 release.\r\n4. Based on the problem mentioned above, VS 2017 has no \"built in\" tooling when creating new ASP.NET Core 1.0/1.1 project, but the external tooling may help. Therefore for those that still need to maintain ASP.NET Core 1.0/1.1 projects, we could use VS 2017 as long as the VS 2017 is still in support lifecycle or in mainstream support lifecycle.\r\n\r\nI

Here's the code change required to migrate to use `System.Text.Json`:\r\n\r\n```C#\r\n// Before\r\nstring value = Json.Serialize(...);\r\nMyPoco poco = Json.Deserialize<MyPoco>(\"...\");\r\n\r\n// After\r\nusing System.Text.Json.Serialization;\r\n...\r\n\r\nstring value = JsonSerializer.ToString(...);\r\nMyPoco poco = JsonSerializer.Parse<MyPoco>(\"...\");\r\n```\r\n\r\n* `DotNetObjectRef` is replaced by a generic `DotNetObjectRef<T>` that is required for both sending and receiving a managed object reference when doing interop with the browser\r\n    \r\n```C#\r\n// Before\r\nIJSRuntime.InvokeAsync(\"SomeJSMethod\", new DotNetObjectRef(someObject));\r\n\r\n[JSInvokable]\r\npublic static Task SomeDotNetMethod(MyObject myObject)\r\n{\r\n    ...\r\n}\r\n\r\n// After\r\nIJSRuntime.InvokeAsync(\"SomeMethod\", DotNetObjectRef.Create(someObject));\r\n\r\n[JSInvokable]\r\npublic static Task SomeDotNetMethod(DotNetObjectRef<MyObject> myObject)\r\n{\r\n    ...\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\n* Microsoft.JSInterop will use System.Text.Json to marshal interop data. To customize serialization, you may use serialization primitives such as `JsonPropertyNameAttribute`, `JsonIgnoreAttribute ` etc.\r\n\r\n* `IJSRuntime.UntrackObjectRef(DotNetObjectRef);` has been removed. To stop tracking an object reference, dispose the `DotNetObjectRef<T>` instance either on the server or the client.\r\n\r\nPlease use https://github.com/aspnet/AspNetCore/issues/10810 for further discussions.","Url":"https://github.com/aspnet/Announcements/issues/364","RelatedDescription":"Open issue \"Breaking changes to Microsoft.JSInterop \" (#364)"},{"Id":"451308302","IsPullRequest":false,"CreatedAt":"2019-06-03T06:11:51","Actor":"davidfowl","Number":"363","RawContent":null,"Title":"Kestrel's transport abstractions have been removed and made public instead of pubternal","State":"open","Body":"As part of moving away from pubternal APIs in we're in the process of exposing the Kestrel transport layer as a public interface in 3.0.

This advisory also provides guidance on what developers can do to update their applications to remove this vulnerability.\r\n\r\nMicrosoft is aware of a denial of service vulnerability exists when ASP.NET Core improperly handles web requests. An attacker who successfully exploited this vulnerability could cause a denial of service against an ASP.NET Core web application. The vulnerability can be exploited remotely, without authentication.\r\n\r\nA remote unauthenticated attacker could exploit this vulnerability by issuing specially crafted requests to the ASP.NET Core application.\r\n\r\nThe update addresses the vulnerability by correcting how the ASP.NET Core web application handles web requests.\r\n\r\n## Discussion\r\n\r\nDiscussion for this issue can be found at https://github.com/aspnet/AspNetCore/issues/10238\r\n\r\n### <a name=\"mitigation-factors\"></a>Mitigation factors\r\n\r\nMicrosoft has not identified any mitigating factors for this vulnerability.\r\n\r\n## <a name=\"affected-software\"></a>Affected software\r\n\r\nAny ASP.NET Core based application that uses any of following vulnerable packages:\r\n\r\nPackage name | Vulnerable versions | Secure versions\r\n------------ | ------------------- | -------------------------\r\nMicrosoft.AspNetCore.SignalR.Protocols.MessagePack | 1.0.0, 1.0.1, 1.0.2, 1.0.3, 1.0.4<br/>1.1.0 | 1.0.11<br/>1.1.5\r\n\r\n## <a name=\"advisory-faq\"></a>Advisory FAQ\r\n\r\n### <a name=\"how-affected\"></a>How do I know if I am affected?\r\n\r\nThe affected assemblies are also available separately as a NuGet package. If you are not using `Microsoft.AspNetCore.SignalR.Protocols.MessagePack` directly you may still be affected if you are using SignalR and the package is a transitive dependency.\r\n\r\n#### Direct dependencies\r\n\r\nDirect dependencies are discoverable by examining your `csproj` file. They can be fixed by [editing the project file](#fixing-direct-dependencies) or using NuGet to update the dependency.\r\n\r\n#### Transitive dependencies\r\n\r\nTransitive dependencies occur when you add a package to your project that in turn relies on another package. For example, if Contoso publishes a package `Contoso.Utility` which, in turn, depends on `Contoso.Internals` and you add the `Contoso.Utility` package to your project now your project has a direct dependency on `Contoso.Utility` and, because `Contoso.Utility` depends 'Contoso.Internals', your application gains a transitive dependency on the `Contoso.Internals` package.\r\n\r\nTransitive dependencies are reviewable in two ways:\r\n\r\n* In the Visual Studio Solution Explorer window, which supports searching.\r\n* By examining the `project.assets.json` file contained in the obj directory of your project for `csproj` based projects\r\n\r\nThe `project.assets.json` files are the authoritative list of all packages used by your project, containing both direct and transitive dependencies.\r\n\r\nThere are two ways to view transitive dependencies. You can either [use Visual Studio’s Solution Explorer](#vs-solution-explorer), or you can review [the `project.assets.json` file](#project-assets-json)).\r\n\r\n##### <a name=\"vs-solution-explorer\"></a>Using Visual Studio Solution Explorer\r\n\r\nTo use Solution Explorer, open the project in Visual Studio, and then press Ctrl+; to activate the search in Solution Explorer. Search for the [vulnerable package](#affected-software) and make a note of the version numbers of any results you find.\r\n\r\nFor example, searching for `Microsoft.AspNetCore.Mvc.Core` in an example project that contains a package that takes a dependency on `Microsoft.AspNetCore.Mvc` shows the following results in Visual Studio 2017:\r\n\r\n![Screenshot of search results in Visual Studio 2017](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/796298/25858816/8ecdc2b4-3491-11e7-9363-746804bb9832.png)\r\n\r\nThe search results appear as a tree. In the previous results, you can see that a reference to `Microsoft.AspNetCore.Mvc.Core` version 1.1.2 is discovered.\r\n\r\nUnder the Dependencies node is a NuGet node. Under the NuGet node is the list of packages you have directly taken a dependency on and their versions.\r\nIn screenshot, the application takes a direct dependency on `Microsoft.AspNetCore.Mvc`. `Microsoft.AspNetCore.Mvc` in turn has leaf nodes that list its dependencies and their versions.\r\nThe `Microsoft.AspNetCore.Mvc` package takes a dependency on a version of `Microsoft.AspNetCore.Mvc.ApiExplorer`, that in turn takes a dependency on a version of `Microsoft.AspNetCore.Mvc.Core`.\r\n\r\n##### <a name=\"project-assets-json\"></a> Manually reviewing project.assets.json\r\n\r\nOpen the *project.assets.json* file from your project’s obj directory in your editor. We suggest you use an editor that understands JSON and allows you to collapse and expand nodes to review this file.\r\nVisual Studio and Visual Studio Code provide JSON friendly editing.\r\n\r\nSearch the *project.assets.json* file for the [vulnerable package](#affected-software), using the format `packagename/` for each of the package names from the preceding table. If you find the assembly name in your search:\r\n\r\n* Examine the line on which they are found, the version number is after the `/`.\r\n* Compare to the [vulnerable versions table](#affected-software).\r\n\r\nFor example, a search result that shows `System.IO.Pipelines/4.5.0` is a reference to version 4.5.0 of `System.IO.Pipelines`.\r\n\r\nIf your *project.assets.json* file includes references to the [vulnerable package](#affected-software), then you need to fix the transitive dependencies.\r\n\r\nIf you have not found any reference to any vulnerable packages, this means either\r\n\r\n* None of your direct dependencies depend on any vulnerable packages, or\r\n* You have already fixed the problem by updating the direct dependencies.\r\n\r\n### <a name=\"how-fix\"></a>How do I fix the issue?\r\n\r\n#### <a name=\"fixing-direct-dependencies\"></a>Fixing direct dependencies\r\n\r\nOpen *projectname.csproj* in your editor. If you're using Visual Studio, right-click the project and choose **Edit projectname.csproj** from the context menu, where projectname is the name of your project. Look for `PackageReference` elements. The following shows an example project file:\r\n\r\n```xml\r\n<Project Sdk=\"Microsoft.NET.Sdk.Web\">\r\n  <PropertyGroup>\r\n    <TargetFramework>netcoreapp2.1</TargetFramework>\r\n  </PropertyGroup>\r\n  <ItemGroup>\r\n    <PackageReference Include=\"Microsoft.AspNetCore.SignalR.Protocols.MessagePack\" Version=\"1.0.0\" />\r\n  </ItemGroup>\r\n</Project>\r\n```\r\n\r\nThe preceding example has a reference to the [vulnerable package](#affected-software), as seen by the single `PackageReference` element. The name of the package is in the `Include` attribute.\r\nThe package version number is in the `Version` attribute. The previous example shows a single direct dependency on `System.IO.Pipelines` version 4.5.0\r\n\r\nTo update the version to the secure package, change the version number to the updated package version as listed on the table [previously](#affected-software).\r\nIn this example, update `System.IO.Pipelines` to the appropriate [fixed package number](#affected-software) for your major version. Save the *csproj* file. The example *csproj* now looks as follows:\r\n\r\n```xml\r\n<Project Sdk=\"Microsoft.NET.Sdk.Web\">\r\n  <PropertyGroup>\r\n    <TargetFramework>netcoreapp2.1</TargetFramework>\r\n  </PropertyGroup>\r\n  <ItemGroup>\r\n    <PackageReference Include=\"Microsoft.AspNetCore.SignalR.Protocols.MessagePack\" Version=\"1.0.11\" />\r\n  </ItemGroup>\r\n</Project>\r\n```\r\n\r\nIf you're using Visual Studio and you save your updated *csproj* file, Visual Studio will restore the new package version.\r\nYou can see the restore results by opening the **Output** window (Ctrl+Alt+O) and changing the **Show output from** drop-down list to **Package Manager**.\r\n\r\nIf you're not using Visual Studio, open a command line and change to your project directory. Execute the `dotnet restore` command to restore the updated dependencies.\r\n\r\nNow recompile your application. If after recompilation you see a *Dependency conflict warning*, you must update your other direct dependencies to versions that take a dependency on the updated package.\r\n\r\n#### <a name=\"transitive-dependencies\"></a>Fixing transitive dependencies\r\n\r\nIf your transitive dependency review found references to the [vulnerable package](#affected-software), you must add a direct dependency to the updated package to your *csproj* file to override the transitive dependency.\r\n\r\nOpen *projectname.csproj* in your editor. If you're using Visual Studio, right-click the project and choose **Edit projectname.csproj** from the context menu, where projectname is the name of your project.\r\nLook for `PackageReference` nodes, for example:\r\n\r\n```xml\r\n<Project Sdk=\"Microsoft.NET.Sdk.\">\r\n  <PropertyGroup>\r\n    <TargetFramework>net461</TargetFramework>\r\n  </PropertyGroup>\r\n  <ItemGroup>\r\n    <PackageReference Include=\"ThirdParty.NotUpdatedYet\" Version=\"2.0.0\" />\r\n  </ItemGroup>\r\n</Project>\r\n```\r\n\r\nYou must add a direct dependency to the updated version of the [vulnerable package](#affected-software) by adding it to the *csproj* file.\r\nYou do this by adding a new line to the dependencies section, referencing the fixed version.\r\nFor example, if your search showed a transitive reference to a vulnerable `System.ServiceModel.Http` version, you'd add a reference to the [fixed package number](#affected-software).\r\n\r\n```xml\r\n<Project Sdk=\"Microsoft.NET.Sdk.Web\">\r\n  <PropertyGroup>\r\n    <TargetFramework>net461</TargetFramework>\r\n  </PropertyGroup>\r\n  <ItemGroup>\r\n    <PackageReference Include=\"Microsoft.AspNetCore.SignalR.Protocols.MessagePack\" Version=\"1.0.11\" />\r\n    <PackageReference Include=\"ThirdParty.NotUpdatedYet\" Version=\"2.0.0\" />\r\n  </ItemGroup>\r\n</Project>\r\n```\r\n\r\nAfter you've added the direct dependency reference, save your *csproj* file.\r\n\r\nIf you're using Visual Studio, save your updated *csproj* file and Visual Studio will restore the new package versions.\r\nYou can see the restore results by opening the **Output** window (Ctrl+Alt+O) and changing the **Show output from** drop-down list to **Package Manager**.\r\n\r\nIf you're not using Visual Studio, open a command line and change to your project directory. Execute the `dotnet restore` command to restore the new dependencies.\r\n\r\n##### Rebuilding your application\r\n\r\nFinally, you must rebuild your application, test, and redeploy.\r\n\r\n## Other Information\r\n\r\n### Reporting Security Issues\r\n\r\nIf you have found a potential security issue in .NET Core, please email details to secure@microsoft.com.

Also, the constructor for ResponseCachingMiddleware has been changed from:\r\n```C#\r\npublic ResponseCachingMiddleware(RequestDelegate next, IOptions<ResponseCachingOptions> options, ILoggerFactory loggerFactory, IResponseCachingPolicyProvider policyProvider, IResponseCachingKeyProvider keyProvider)\r\n```\r\nto:\r\n```C#\r\npublic ResponseCachingMiddleware(RequestDelegate next, IOptions<ResponseCachingOptions> options, ILoggerFactory loggerFactory, ObjectPoolProvider poolProvider)\r\n```\r\n\r\nIf if any changes to these types are critical to your applications, please file an issue in https://github.com/aspnet/Aspnetcore.\r\n\r\nUse https://github.com/aspnet/AspNetCore/issues/9442 for discussion on this topic.","Url":"https://github.com/aspnet/Announcements/issues/354","RelatedDescription":"Open issue \"Making \"pubinternal\" types in ResponseCaching internal\" (#354)"},{"Id":"432739053","IsPullRequest":false,"CreatedAt":"2019-04-12T20:46:40","Actor":"Tratcher","Number":"353","RawContent":null,"Title":"Generic Host restricts Startup constructor injection","State":"open","Body":"TLDR: The only types the generic Host supports for Startup constructor injection are `IHostEnvironment`, `IWebHostEnvironment`, and `IConfiguration`.
