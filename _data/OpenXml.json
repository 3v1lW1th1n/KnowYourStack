Since `OpenXmlAttribute` is an attribute, we should remove the setters from it so the attribute becomes immutable. That's a breaking change, so we'll mark it as obsolete, and the next major version will remove it."},{"Id":"11724126910","Type":"IssuesEvent","CreatedAt":"2020-03-10T10:22:34","Actor":"MoamenMohamed93","Repository":"OfficeDev/Open-XML-SDK","Organization":"OfficeDev","RawContent":null,"RelatedAction":"opened","RelatedUrl":"https://github.com/OfficeDev/Open-XML-SDK/issues/697","RelatedDescription":"Opened issue \"Excel Validation reporting 0 errors on invalid document\" (#697) at OfficeDev/Open-XML-SDK","RelatedBody":"Is this a:\r\n- [X] Issue with the OpenXml library\r\n- [ ] Question on library usage\r\n\r\n**Description**\r\n\r\nInvalid Excel document that shows error message \"We found a problems with some content....\" while opening using Microsoft Excel 2019 is reported as valid by Open XML SDK Validator.\r\n\r\n**Information**\r\n\r\n- .NET Target: .NET Core 3.1\r\n- DocumentFormat.OpenXml Version:  (2.10.1)\r\n\r\n**Repro**\r\n\r\nCreate a Cell with string value and data type set to **Number**. \r\nValidate the created excel using OpenXmlValidator return no errors.\r\n\r\n**Expected**\r\n\r\nThe validation results contain errors."}],"ResultType":"GitHubEvent"},"PowerTools":{"Events":[],"ResultType":"GitHubEvent"}},"RunOn":"2020-03-11T05:30:48.4883379Z","RunDurationInMilliseconds":1722}
