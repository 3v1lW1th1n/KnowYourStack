If both are non-public, then it should use the internal one. If both have the same visibility then it should throw an exception.\r\n\r\nFor this to happen, I modified the `ComponentCatalog ` to work as described. I also had to change the visibility of several methods and constructors to work as described. Since, as per @yaeldekel 's instructions, the create method should be called instead of the constructor in all cases, then I did the following:\r\n1. For most classes, the case was that both the conflictive constructor and create method were private, so I simply made the create method internal.\r\n2. For LabelIndicatorTransform and SkipTakeFilter the conflictive constructors and create methods were public, so I made the constructors internal.\r\n3. For the following classes the constructor was internal, and the create method was private. In these cases I made the constructor private, and the create methods internal.\r\n\r\n```\r\nMicrosoft.ML.Trainers.FieldAwareFactorizationMachinePredictionTransformer\r\nMicrosoft.ML.Transforms.TimeSeries.IidChangePointDetector\r\nMicrosoft.ML.Transforms.TimeSeries.IidSpikeDetector\r\nMicrosoft.ML.Transforms.TimeSeries.SrCnnAnomalyDetector\r\nMicrosoft.ML.Transforms.TimeSeries.SsaChangePointDetector\r\nMicrosoft.ML.Transforms.TimeSeries.SsaForecastingTransformer\r\nMicrosoft.ML.Transforms.TimeSeries.SsaSpikeDetector\r\n```","Url":"https://github.com/dotnet/machinelearning/pull/4485","RelatedDescription":"Open PR \"Fixes #4385 about calling the Create methods when loading models from disk\" (#4485)"},{"Id":"522576606","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2019-11-18T21:16:55","Actor":"frank-dong-ms","Number":"4477","RawContent":null,"Title":"Only for test: open system diagnotise log","State":"closed","Body":"We are excited to review your PR.\r\n\r\nSo we can do the best job, please check:\r\n\r\n- [ ] There's a descriptive title that will make sense to other developers some time from now. \r\n- [ ] There's associated issues.
