Most users will probably not notice, but any code that\n    depended on stream behavior always being deferred until next tick will\n    need to adjust.\n\nThe mississippi methods 'to', 'from', 'through', and so on, have been\nreplaced with their Minipass counterparts, and streaming interaction\nwith the file system is done via fs-minipass.\n\nThe following modules are of interest here:\n\n-   [minipass](http://npm.im/minipass) The core stream library.\n\n-   [fs-minipass](http://npm.im/fs-minipass)  Note that the 'WriteStream'\n    class from fs-minipass is _not_ a Minipass stream, but rather a plain\n    old EventEmitter that duck types as a Writable.\n\n-   [minipass-collect](http://npm.im/minipass-collect) Gather up all the\n    data from a stream.  Cacache only uses Collect.PassThrough, which is a\n    basic Minipass passthrough stream which emits a 'collect' event with\n    the completed data just before the 'end' event.\n\n-   [minipass-pipeline](http://npm.im/minipass-pipeline) Connect one or\n    more streams into a pipe chain.  Errors anywhere in the pipeline are\n    proxied down the chain and then up to the Pipeline object itself.\n    Writes go into the head, reads go to the tail.  Used in place of\n    pump() and pumpify().\n\n-   [minipass-flush](http://npm.im/minipass-flush) A Minipass passthrough\n    stream that defers its 'end' event until after a flush() method has\n    completed (either calling the supplied callback, or returning a\n    promise.)  Use in place of flush-write-stream (aka mississippi.to).\n\nStreams from through2, concat-stream, and the behavior provided by\nend-of-stream are all implemented in Minipass itself.\n\nFeatures of interest to cacache, which make Minipass a particularly good\nfit:\n\n-   All of the 'endish' events are normalized, so we can just listen on\n    'end' and know that finish, prefinish, and close will be handled as\n    well.\n-   Minipass doesn't waste time [containing\n    zalgo](https://blog.izs.me/2013/08/designing-apis-for-asynchrony).\n-   Minipass has built-in support for promises that indicate the end or\n    error: stream.promise(), stream.collect(), and stream.concat().\n-   With reliable and consistent timing guarantees, much less\n    error-checking logic is required.  We can be more confident that an\n    error is being thrown or emitted in the correct place, rather than in\n    a callback which is deferred, resulting in a hung promise or\n    uncaughtException.\n\nThe biggest downside of Minipass is that it lacks some of the internal\ncharacteristics of node-core streams, which many community modules use\nto identify streams.  They have no \\_writableState or \\_readableState\nobjects, or \\_read or \\_write methods.  As a result, the is-stream module\n(at least, at the time of this commit) doesn't recognize Minipass\nstreams as readable or writable streams.\n\nAll in all, the changes required of downstream users should be minimal,\nbut are unlikely to be zero.

However when using variables while still providing fallback values for older browsers who don't support variables, the variables will be ignored when using `ng build --prod`. This only happens when using the flag `--prod`.\r\n\r\n## üî¨ Minimal Reproduction\r\n\r\nFor reproduction purposes I created a simple Angular App.\r\n\r\n```bash\r\ngit clone https://github.com/David-Development/angular-css-minify-bug-app\r\ncd angular-css-minify-bug-app\r\nnpm install\r\nng serve \r\n```\r\n\r\nYou'll notice that both divs look the same (both have rounded edges on the left side). So far, everything is correct.\r\n\r\nHowever, after running `ng build --prod`, you'll notice, that the second div has no round edges on the left side anymore. Somehow (I guess by doing some minifying) angular will merge the four attributes (`border-top-left-radius / border-bottom-left-radius / border-top-right-radius / border-bottom-right-radius`) together. The problem is, that by merging those attributes together, it is not considering variables.\r\n\r\n\r\n## üî• Exception or Error\r\nThe following css code: \r\n<pre><code>\r\n--control-border-radius: 10px;\r\n\r\nborder-top-left-radius: 1px;\r\nborder-bottom-left-radius: 1px;\r\n    \r\nborder-top-left-radius: var(--control-border-radius);\r\nborder-bottom-left-radius: var(--control-border-radius);\r\nborder-top-right-radius: 0px;\r\nborder-bottom-right-radius: 0px;\r\n</code></pre>\r\n\r\nis being converted to: (using `ng build --prod`)\r\n\r\n<pre><code>\r\n--control-border-radius: 10px;\r\n...\r\nborder-top-left-radius: 1px;\r\nborder-bottom-left-radius: 1px;\r\n    \r\nborder-top-left-radius: var(--control-border-radius);\r\nborder-bottom-left-radius: var(--control-border-radius);\r\nborder-top-right-radius: 0px;\r\nborder-bottom-right-radius: 0px;\r\nborder: 1px 0px 0px 1px;\r\n</code></pre>\r\n\r\n\r\n## üåç Your Environment\r\nTested in Angular 7 and 9\r\n\r\n## Related issue:\r\n- https://github.com/angular/angular-cli/issues/10579\r\n\r\nUnfortunately the described workaround does not work for me.\r\n```\r\n/* clean-css ignore:start */\r\n...\r\n/* clean-css ignore:end */\r\n``` \r\n","Url":"https://github.com/angular/angular-cli/issues/15684","RelatedDescription":"Open issue \"CSS variables incorrectly optimized using prod flag\" (#15684)"},{"Id":"498785065","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2019-09-26T09:59:29","Actor":"alan-agius4","Number":"15681","RawContent":null,"Title":"fix(@ngtools/webpack): `exportLazyModuleMap` should not be executed i‚Ä¶","State":"open","Body":"‚Ä¶n Ivy\r\n\r\nThe export lazy module map is required only for string based lazy loading which is not supported in Ivy.","Url":"https://github.com/angular/angular-cli/pull/15681","RelatedDescription":"Open PR \"fix(@ngtools/webpack): `exportLazyModuleMap` should not be executed i‚Ä¶\" (#15681)"},{"Id":"498714218","IsPullRequest":false,"CreatedAt":"2019-09-26T07:40:38","Actor":"leon","Number":"15680","RawContent":null,"Title":"Custom component suffix --suffix=Route","State":"open","Body":"# üöÄ Feature request\r\n\r\n### Command (mark with an `x`)\r\n<!-- Can you pin-point the command or commands that are relevant for this feature request? -->\r\n<!-- ‚úçÔ∏èedit: -->\r\n```\r\n- [ ] new\r\n- [ ] build\r\n- [ ] serve\r\n- [ ] test\r\n- [ ] e2e\r\n- [x] generate\r\n- [ ] add\r\n- [ ] update\r\n- [ ] lint\r\n- [ ] xi18n\r\n- [ ] run\r\n- [ ] config\r\n- [ ] help\r\n- [ ] version\r\n- [ ] doc\r\n```\r\n\r\n### Description\r\nI would like to be able to change the default .component suffix to something more descriptive.\r\n\r\nAs most of apps are comprised of components, it would be of more use to easily be able to separate the components into their different type.\r\n\r\nnav-bar.ui.ts // presentational component\r\ninvoices.container.ts // smart component\r\nusers.route.ts // route component\r\n\r\nThe Style guide mentions that you can add your own types\r\n\r\n> Do use consistent type names for all components following a pattern that describes the component's feature then its type.

Simplified resulting HTML (removing some classes on the button, all classes visible in stackblitz) is shown below. \r\n\r\n```\r\n<button id=\"my-button\">\r\n  <span class=\"mat-button-wrapper\">Click me!</span>\r\n</button>\r\n```\r\nAs a result, when the user clicks on the center of the button (where the text is), the event.target doesn't get the target.id=\"my-button\"; instead, target.id=\"\" and Google Tag Manager doesn't trigger. If the user clicks on the edge of the button, then the target.id=\"my-button\".\r\n\r\n#### Reproduction\r\n\r\nStackBlitz:\r\n\r\nhttps://stackblitz.com/edit/angular-ljrxvd\r\n\r\nSteps to reproduce:\r\n1. In Stackblitz app, click on text in the button. The displayed event.target.id = '' and the outer HTML is the inserted <span>.\r\n2. Next, click on the EDGE of the button (avoiding the text). The displayed event.target.id = 'my-button' and the outer HTML is the inserted <button id=\"my-button\">.\r\n\r\nGoogle Tag Manager will not catch the majority of clicks which trigger the \"span\", not the button with the ID. (This stackblitz demo is not integrated with GTM.)\r\n\r\nIs there some way to overcome this and use Google Tag Manager as intended (set up triggers and tags non programmatically)?\r\n\r\nIs there some way to ensure the event.target.id is the id of the button?\r\n  \r\n#### Environment\r\n\r\n- Angular: 8.2.7\r\n- CDK/Material: 8.2.1\r\n- Browser(s): Chrome, Safari\r\n- Operating System (e.g. Windows, macOS, Ubuntu): Currently testing on Mac\r\n","Url":"https://github.com/angular/components/issues/17199","RelatedDescription":"Closed issue \"Google Tag Manager incompatible with MatButtonModule\" (#17199)"},{"Id":"498590200","IsPullRequest":false,"CreatedAt":"2019-09-26T08:05:39","Actor":"stayingcool","Number":"17204","RawContent":null,"Title":"Unable to copy text from disabled matInput on firefox.
