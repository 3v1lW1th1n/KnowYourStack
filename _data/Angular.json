In my case I have a custom error handler where I attempt to bring the user to an `error` page, when trying to navigate to the error page another error is thrown: \r\n\r\n`Error: Cannot activate an already activated outlet`.\r\n\r\nI believe this happens because the `users` route is a lazy loaded child route of \r\nthe `dashboard` route which is not lazy loaded. It seems that the <router-outlet> directive\r\nresponsible for attaching the dashboard (default) component is not deactivated if building \r\nthe lazy loaded module fails.\r\n\r\nA snippet of my routes config:\r\n\r\n<pre>\r\n[{\r\n   path: 'dashboard',\r\n   component: DefaultPageComponent,\r\n   children: [{\r\n       path: 'home',\r\n       loadChildren: './home/home.module#HomeModule'\r\n  }, {\r\n       path: 'users',\r\n       loadChildren: './users/users.module#UsersModule\r\n  }]\r\n}]\r\n</pre>\r\n\r\nMy guess that the parent `DefaultPageComponent` is involved is based on me trying to \r\ndeliberately invoke the same error on a lazy loaded route that did NOT have a parent route, \r\nthe intentional error was thrown and my custom error handler was able to navigate to the\r\nerror route successfully.\r\n\r\nLink to stackblitz repo is below. Please note that this happens only \r\nwhen visiting the lazy loaded route directly from browser's address bar so after\r\nopening the stackblitz, please change the URI to `/dashboard/users`. When navigating to the failing `/dashboard/users` programatically (or using routerLink), the error handler\r\nis able to successfully navigate to the error page.\r\n\r\nThere are ways for me to get around this but it would be nice to have it working without any \r\nmessy logic.\r\n\r\nThanks for taking the time!\r\n\r\n## 🔬 Minimal Reproduction\r\n<!--\r\nPlease create and share minimal reproduction of the issue starting with this template: https://stackblitz.com/fork/angular-issue-repro2\r\n-->\r\n<!-- ✍️--> https://stackblitz.com/edit/router-bug-report\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<!--\r\nIf StackBlitz is not suitable for reproduction of your issue, please create a minimal GitHub repository with the reproduction of the issue.\r\nA good way to make a minimal reproduction is to create a new app via `ng new repro-app` and add the minimum possible code to show the problem. \r\nShare the link to the repo below along with step-by-step instructions to reproduce the problem, as well as expected and actual behavior.\r\n\r\nIssues that don't have enough info and can't be reproduced will be closed.\r\n\r\nYou can read more about issue submission guidelines here: https://github.com/angular/angular/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md#-submitting-an-issue\r\n-->\r\n\r\n## 🔥 Exception or Error\r\n<pre><code>\r\n<!-- If the issue is accompanied by an exception or an error, please share it below: -->\r\n<!-- ✍️-->\r\nError: Uncaught (in promise): Error: Cannot activate an already activated outlet\r\nError: Cannot activate an already activated outlet\r\n    at RouterOutlet.activateWith (router_outlet.ts:127)\r\n    at ActivateRoutes.activateRoutes (activate_routes.ts:187)\r\n    at eval (activate_routes.ts:133)\r\n    at Array.forEach (<anonymous>)\r\n    at ActivateRoutes.activateChildRoutes (activate_routes.ts:132)\r\n    at ActivateRoutes.activate (activate_routes.ts:42)\r\n    at MapSubscriber.eval [as project] (activate_routes.ts:27)\r\n    at MapSubscriber._next (map.ts:84)\r\n    at MapSubscriber.Subscriber.next (Subscriber.ts:99)\r\n    at TapSubscriber._next (tap.ts:125)\r\n    at resolvePromise (zone.js:831)\r\n    at resolvePromise (zone.js:788)\r\n    at eval (zone.js:892)\r\n    at ZoneDelegate.invokeTask (zone.js:423)\r\n    at Object.onInvokeTask (ng_zone.ts:262)\r\n    at ZoneDelegate.invokeTask (zone.js:422)\r\n    at Zone.runTask (zone.js:195)\r\n    at drainMicroTaskQueue (zone.js:601)\r\n    at ZoneTask.invokeTask (zone.js:502)\r\n    at ZoneTask.invoke (zone.js:487)\r\n</code></pre>\r\n\r\n\r\n## 🌍  Your Environment\r\n\r\n**Angular Version:**\r\n<pre>7.2.5<code>\r\n<!-- run `ng version` and paste output below -->\r\n<!-- ✍️-->\r\n\r\n</code></pre>\r\n\r\n**Anything else relevant?**\r\n<!-- ✍️Is this a browser specific issue?
