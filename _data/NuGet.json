(In addition, we want to be able to debug them in Visual Studio.)  The projects reference each other, and also reference other NuGet packages, e.g. to bring unmanaged libraries to project output.\r\n\r\nBy default, when I reference a NuGet package, its build targets and content files are brought to the first referencing project, but not to the projects that reference it. The same happens if I reference a package indirectly (project X references package A, package A references package B, package B has build targets and/or content files).\r\n* I am happy about this behavior, because Visual Studio automatically copies the build output of the project to the referencing project. There is no need to execute the targets again in the referencing project; in addition, if they were executed again, this could make the build non-deterministic (if the build target depends on some property, it would need to be set in the referencing project as well).\r\n\r\nBut this also causes the build target to be excluded by the package generated by `dotnet pack` / `msbuild /t:Pack`. The generated package has the following dependency declarations:\r\n```<dependency id=\"PackageName\" version=\"PackageVersion\" exclude=\"Build,Analyzers\" />```\r\nSo the the package built from the project will ignore the build targets of the referenced package - if I reference this package in another project, they won't be executed (the files won't be brought to the project output).\r\n\r\nOption 1: Set `PrivateAssets`. This is a problem, because I have to set this for every package and project reference in the solution, and there can be perhaps a hundred of them. In addition, this changes the behavior during the build, causing them to be executed in every referencing project. (As above, I only want the target to be executed once, and also I want it to be executed once if the generated package is referenced by another project.)\r\n\r\nOption 2: Use `buildTransitive`. This requires me to modify every package in question, which may not be under my control. In addition, what will happen if another project references my project? Will this cause the transitive target to be executed again by the referencing project? (Again, this is behavior which I don't want.)\r\n\r\nOption 3: Hook to some MsBuild target and modify the generated nuspec file before packing. I didn't succeed with that. If I run `msbuild /t:Pack`, then if I execute my target before `GenerateNuspec`, the nuspec file doesn't exist yet; if I run it after GenerateNuspec, it is too late because it has already been packed into the package. (In addition - as far as I know - there is no property containing the location of the nuspec file.) If I run `msbuild /t:GenerateNuspec;Pack`, it doesn't pack anything.\r\n\r\nWhat other options are there? I want to preserve the default behavior of Visual Studio when building (to not bring the imported targets to referencing projects, and to instead depend on the copying of the output directory), but I also want to preserve the default behavior of NuGet (do not generate the `exclude` declarations to modify the default behavior; or, alternately, to perform arbitrary modification of the generated nuspec file and remove them before packing).\r\n\r\nSee related issues: https://github.com/dotnet/sdk/issues/1266 , https://github.com/NuGet/Home/issues/3697 , https://github.com/NuGet/Home/issues/6388 ."},{"Id":"12144235706","Type":"IssuesEvent","CreatedAt":"2020-04-24T07:05:14","Actor":"v-longmin","Repository":"NuGet/Home","Organization":"NuGet","RawContent":null,"RelatedAction":"closed","RelatedUrl":"https://github.com/NuGet/Home/issues/9045","RelatedDescription":"Closed issue \"[Localization][CHS][CHT] String “By” should be translated to “作者:”\" (#9045) at NuGet/Home","RelatedBody":"## Details about Problem\r\nVS Version: D16.5\\29708.193\r\nOS Version: windows-10-enterprise-rs4-zh-cn\r\n## Installation\r\n1.
