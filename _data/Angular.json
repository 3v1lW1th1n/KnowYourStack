What I am trying to achieve requires carefully setting various CSS properties on different elements in a well-defined series of events. \r\n\r\nMy efforts are being messed up because `sequence([])` seems to combine individual query() steps that lack an `animate()` function into ONE `query()` call. So a sequence that looks like this:\r\n\r\n```\r\nsequence([\r\n    query('.my-class', [\r\n        style({\r\n            display: 'none'\r\n        })   \r\n    ]),\r\n    // ...\r\n    // 1. Various other animated steps\r\n    // ...\r\n    query('.my-class', [\r\n        style({\r\n            display: 'block'\r\n        })   \r\n    ]),\r\n    // ...\r\n    // 2. Various other animated steps\r\n    // ...\r\n])\r\n```\r\n\r\n... ends up acting like this:\r\n\r\n```\r\nsequence([\r\n    query('.my-class', [\r\n        style({\r\n            display: 'none',\r\n            display: 'block'\r\n        })   \r\n    ]),\r\n    // ...\r\n    // 1. Various other animated steps\r\n    // ...\r\n    // ...\r\n    // 2.

For example, it would be easy to create the TS AST structure Call(Ternary(a, b, c)), but that would result in printed code of:\r\n\r\n```\r\na ? b : c()\r\n```\r\n\r\nWhereas the actual structure we meant to generate is:\r\n\r\n```\r\n(a ? b : c)()\r\n```\r\n\r\nTo avoid this confusion, precedence-sensitive operations like ternary are defensively wrapped in parentheses. However, there are certain positions into which it's safe to emit these operations in an un-wrapped form: arguments of calls (except for comma expressions) for example.\r\n\r\nThis commit strips the defensive parentheses on arguments to function calls,\r\nunless the argument is a comma-exprssion.\r\n\r\nFW-1273\r\n\r\n## PR Checklist\r\nPlease check if your PR fulfills the following requirements:\r\n\r\n- [ ] The commit message follows our guidelines: https://github.com/angular/angular/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md#commit\r\n- [ ] Tests for the changes have been added (for bug fixes / features)\r\n- [ ] Docs have been added / updated (for bug fixes / features)\r\n\r\n\r\n## PR Type\r\nWhat kind of change does this PR introduce?\r\n\r\n<!-- Please check the one that applies to this PR using \"x\". -->\r\n\r\n- [ ] Bugfix\r\n- [ ] Feature\r\n- [ ] Code style update (formatting, local variables)\r\n- [ ] Refactoring (no functional changes, no api changes)\r\n- [ ] Build related changes\r\n- [ ] CI related changes\r\n- [ ] Documentation content changes\r\n- [ ] angular.io application / infrastructure changes\r\n- [ ] Other...

In those cases, we fall into logic that resets state for the next navigation. One piece of this resetting is to set the `browserUrlTree` to the most recent `urlAfterRedirects`i.\r\n\r\nHowever, there was bug in this logic because in some cases the `urlAfterRedirects` is a stale value. This happens any time a URL won't be processed, and the previous URL will also not be processed. This creates unpredictable behavior, not the least of which ends up being a broken `back` button.\r\n\r\nThis PR kicks off new navigations with the current value the router assumes is in the browser. All the logic around how to handle future navigations is based on this value compared to the current transition, so it's important to kick off all new navigations with the current value so in the edge case described above we don't end up with an old value being set into `browserUrlTree`.\r\n\r\nFixes #30340\r\nRelated to #30160\r\n","Url":"https://github.com/angular/angular/pull/30344","RelatedDescription":"Open PR \"fix(router): ensure navigations start with the current URL value inca…\" (#30344)"},{"Id":"442344244","IsPullRequest":false,"CreatedAt":"2019-05-04T14:31:35","Actor":"darkbasic","Number":"30356","RawContent":null,"Title":"ng update to Angular 8 fails: Cannot read property 'module' of undefined","State":"open","Body":"<!--🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅\r\n\r\nOh hi there! 😄\r\n\r\nTo expedite issue processing please search open and closed issues before submitting a new one.\r\nExisting issues often contain information about workarounds, resolution, or progress updates.\r\n\r\n🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅-->\r\n\r\n\r\n# 🐞 Bug report\r\n\r\n### Command (mark with an `x`)\r\n<!-- Can you pin-point the command or commands that are effected by this bug? -->\r\n<!-- ✍️edit: -->\r\n```\r\n- [ ] new\r\n- [ ] build\r\n- [ ] serve\r\n- [ ] test\r\n- [ ] e2e\r\n- [ ] generate\r\n- [ ] add\r\n- [x] update\r\n- [ ] lint\r\n- [ ] xi18n\r\n- [ ] run\r\n- [ ] config\r\n- [ ] help\r\n- [ ] version\r\n- [ ] doc\r\n```\r\n\r\n\r\n### Description\r\n\r\n```\r\n$ ng update @angular/core --from 7 --to 8 --migrate-only\r\n            ------ Static Query migration ------\r\n            In preparation for Ivy, developers can now explicitly specify the\r\n            timing of their queries.

To extend webpack configuration, we used below npm module -\r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/meltedspark/angular-builders\r\n\r\nWe updated the angular.json file as per documentation of above module.\r\n\r\nWe were able to successfully use this module to extend webpack config but observed that our loader was run for all html files within project except index.html. Here is our custom webpack config that we used alongside the module -\r\n```js\r\nconst path = require('path');\r\nmodule.exports = {\r\n module: {\r\n    rules: [{\r\n      test: /\\.html/,\r\n      use: [\r\n          '<custom-loader>'\r\n       ]\r\n    }]\r\n }\r\n```\r\nWhile debugging, we found that index.html is handled separately using IndexHTMLWebpackPlugin by CLI which we assume might be the cause of this behavior.\r\n\r\n**Why we need custom loader?**\r\nWe have a large website developed in a federated model and maintained by many teams across different geographic locations. To maintain consistency across all pages for Header/Footer content we have developed it separately as a Preact application. We use this Webpack loader to update index.html with HTML/JS/CSS of our application.\r\n\r\nWe are using Index.html to inject the code to keep Preact application out of Angular context.\r\n\r\n@alan-agius4 I had discussed this with @mgechev during Angular conference last week and he suggested me to file a bug and reach out to you","Url":"https://github.com/angular/angular-cli/issues/14392","RelatedDescription":"Open issue \"Angular CLI not allowing custom webpack loader to run on index.html\" (#14392)"},{"Id":"442388147","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2019-05-09T20:19:54","Actor":"kyliau","Number":"14391","RawContent":null,"Title":"build: fix external block in BUILD files","State":"closed","Body":"external code block should not include deps.","Url":"https://github.com/angular/angular-cli/pull/14391","RelatedDescription":"Closed or merged PR \"build: fix external block in BUILD files\" (#14391)"},{"Id":"442344937","IsPullRequest":false,"CreatedAt":"2019-05-09T17:19:47","Actor":"alexeagle","Number":"14390","RawContent":null,"Title":"Before running a third-party schematic, inform the user","State":"open","Body":"Make sure that users know who to file issues or escalate for help when `ng update` or `ng new` runs third-party code.\r\n\r\nThis should ensure that users don't waste a day having us redirect their issues.","Url":"https://github.com/angular/angular-cli/issues/14390","RelatedDescription":"Open issue \"Before running a third-party schematic, inform the user\" (#14390)"},{"Id":"442202417","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2019-05-09T17:12:23","Actor":"alan-agius4","Number":"14388","RawContent":null,"Title":"fix(@angular/cli): print full error when package is not found","State":"closed","Body":"Before: \r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/17563226/57452250-00627e00-726c-11e9-80fe-3a8a7645d9d9.png)\r\n\r\nAfter:\r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/17563226/57452296-18d29880-726c-11e9-8a55-01c87d352ac9.png)\r\n\r\n","Url":"https://github.com/angular/angular-cli/pull/14388","RelatedDescription":"Closed or merged PR \"fix(@angular/cli): print full error when package is not found\" (#14388)"},{"Id":"442099961","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2019-05-09T17:11:58","Actor":"alan-agius4","Number":"14385","RawContent":null,"Title":"fix(@angular-devkit/build-angular): propagate protractor errors during execution","State":"closed","Body":"","Url":"https://github.com/angular/angular-cli/pull/14385","RelatedDescription":"Closed or merged PR \"fix(@angular-devkit/build-angular): propagate protractor errors during execution\" (#14385)"},{"Id":"441996395","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2019-05-09T17:11:34","Actor":"clydin","Number":"14381","RawContent":null,"Title":"refactor(@angular-devkit/schematics): update rxjs usage in rules","State":"closed","Body":"rxjs has improved over time and this updates the rules to take advantage of improvements where applicable.

These files should be in the `deps` instead. (Note that in previous releases, we didn't permit these files in deps.)\n\n### Features\n\n-   `rollup_bundle`: new output_group lets you select .js and .js.map files together for different output flavors, thanks [@&#8203;jbedard](https://togithub.com/jbedard) \n-   `rollup_bundle`: UMD bundles can now be requested es5 and es5 minified, thanks [@&#8203;jbedard](https://togithub.com/jbedard) \n\n### Fixes\n\n-   don't depend on Windows PowerShell, fixes [angular/angular#&#8203;29760](https://togithub.com/angular/angular/issues/29760)\n-   fixes for karma: get right dependency versions, use the same version of karma-jasmine as Angular CLI\n-   add missing progress_messages, fixes [#&#8203;705](https://togithub.com/bazelbuild/rules_nodejs/issues/705)\n-   add LICENSE files for [@&#8203;bazel/bazel](https://togithub.com/bazel/bazel) mirrored packages\n-   don't create `nodejs_binary` targets when the package.json `bin` entry is empty, fixes [#&#8203;692](https://togithub.com/bazelbuild/rules_nodejs/issues/692) - thanks [@&#8203;manekinekko](https://togithub.com/manekinekko) \n-   external source maps on Windows, thanks [@&#8203;devversion](https://togithub.com/devversion) \n-   `jasmine_node_test` uses native test wrapper on windows, thanks [@&#8203;laszlocsomor](https://togithub.com/laszlocsomor)\n\n### [`v0.27.12`](https://togithub.com/bazelbuild/rules_nodejs/releases/0.27.12)\n\n[Compare Source](https://togithub.com/bazelbuild/rules_nodejs/compare/0.27.10...0.27.12)\n\nFixed an issue with transitive node_modules not being available to the `rollup_bundle` rule. Such deps don't need to be repeated now.\n\nIntroduced new package <http://npmjs.com/package/@&#8203;bazel/labs> - this contains more experimental features that might be breaking or even removed in the future.\n\nThis contains the start of a `webpack_bundle` rule.\n\n### [`v0.27.10`](https://togithub.com/bazelbuild/rules_nodejs/releases/0.27.10)\n\n[Compare Source](https://togithub.com/bazelbuild/rules_nodejs/compare/0.27.9...0.27.10)\n\n-   add a special case when Angular Package Format packages are found in node_modules, generating a special BUILD file for them so that devmode scripts flow to downstream targets\n-   you can now access the devmode manifest output of a `ts_devserver`, useful for plumbing through to your own server\n-   packages can now publish a `bazelBin` key in their package.json, indicating additional attributes to put on the generated `nodejs_binary`\n\n### [`v0.27.9`](https://togithub.com/bazelbuild/rules_nodejs/releases/0.27.9)\n\n[Compare Source](https://togithub.com/bazelbuild/rules_nodejs/compare/0.27.8...0.27.9)\n\nChanges to `@bazel/jasmine`/`jasmine_node_test`:\n\n-   more fixes for  sharding and loading\n-   can produce coverage data\n-   fix deprecation warnings about load path\n\n### [`v0.27.8`](https://togithub.com/bazelbuild/rules_nodejs/compare/0.27.7...0.27.8)\n\n[Compare Source](https://togithub.com/bazelbuild/rules_nodejs/compare/0.27.7...0.27.8)\n\n### [`v0.27.7`](https://togithub.com/bazelbuild/rules_nodejs/releases/0.27.7)\n\n[Compare Source](https://togithub.com/bazelbuild/rules_nodejs/compare/0.27.6...0.27.7)\n\nFixes for jasmine_node_test\n\nNote: 0.27.6 and 0.27.5 had a regression in the `web_package` and `ts_devserver` rules and should not be used.\n\n### [`v0.27.6`](https://togithub.com/bazelbuild/rules_nodejs/compare/0.27.5...0.27.6)\n\n[Compare Source](https://togithub.com/bazelbuild/rules_nodejs/compare/0.27.5...0.27.6)\n\n### [`v0.27.5`](https://togithub.com/bazelbuild/rules_nodejs/compare/0.27.4...0.27.5)\n\n[Compare Source](https://togithub.com/bazelbuild/rules_nodejs/compare/0.27.4...0.27.5)\n\n### [`v0.27.4`](https://togithub.com/bazelbuild/rules_nodejs/releases/0.27.4)\n\n[Compare Source](https://togithub.com/bazelbuild/rules_nodejs/compare/0.27.3...0.27.4)\n\nMinor bugfix for `jasmine_node_test` following sharding feature\n\nTo use this release, update your WORKSPACE to:\n\n    http_archive(\n        name = \"build_bazel_rules_nodejs\",\n        urls = [\"https://github.com/bazelbuild/rules_nodejs/releases/download/0.27.4/rules_nodejs-0.27.4.tar.gz\"],\n        sha256 = \"251a023b6c5c5c97db1bfe24652dc19dad05f4da68f8e1821d92d911fa3f4ef4\",\n    )\n\n### [`v0.27.3`](https://togithub.com/bazelbuild/rules_nodejs/releases/0.27.3)\n\n[Compare Source](https://togithub.com/bazelbuild/rules_nodejs/compare/0.27.2...0.27.3)\n\n`jasmine_node_test` now support the `shard_count` attribute, to parallelize the specs in the test.

Please describe:\r\n</code></pre>\r\n\r\n## Current behavior\r\nIn Angular 5, I was able to use -webkit-line-clamp to limit text to 1 or 2 lines depending on the context.  After upgrading to Angular 6, this stopped working.  I reverted back to v5 and it worked again.  The scss styling I am using is <pre><code>\r\n    -webkit-line-clamp: 1;\r\n    display: -webkit-box;\r\n    overflow: hidden;\r\n    text-overflow: ellipsis;\r\n    -webkit-box-orient: vertical;\r\n</code></pre>\r\n\r\n\r\n## Expected behavior\r\n-webkit-line-clamp should continue to work after upgrading\r\n\r\n\r\n## Minimal reproduction of the problem with instructions\r\nI created a project with Angular CLI for v5, added an element that wraps, then upgraded the project to Angular 6.  The git project can be found here: https://github.com/briantq/ng-line-clamp  I have two branches, v5 and v6.  v5 is Angular 5 and when running 'ng serve' will render correctly.  v6 is the upgrade to Angular 6 and when running 'ng serve', will not truncate. \r\n\r\n\r\n## What is the motivation / use case for changing the behavior?\r\nFor list views, we don't want to render full content, instead only a preview.  Due to responsive design, we don't know how much text we need to render so rely on line-clamp.  Preview renders way too much content and is no longer a manageable. \r\n\r\n## Environment\r\n\r\n<pre><code>\r\nAngular version: 6.X.X\r\n<!-- Check whether this is still an issue in the most recent Angular version -->\r\n\r\nBrowser:\r\n- [ X ] Chrome (desktop) version 66\r\n- [ X ] Chrome (Android) version 66\r\n- [ ] Chrome (iOS) version XX\r\n- [ ] Firefox version XX\r\n- [ ] Safari (desktop) version XX\r\n- [ X ] Safari (iOS) version 11.3\r\n- [ ] IE version XX\r\n- [ ] Edge version XX\r\n \r\nFor Tooling issues:\r\n- Node version: 8.9.4\r\n- Platform:  Windows\r\n\r\nOthers:\r\nNot that I can think of.

So I wanted to add a sideNav when a specific width is found.\r\n\r\nUsing the sideNav with its current API required me to add 3/4 of my app into the `<mat-sidenav-content>` definitely not what I want, esp since the sideNav should only exist when the screen size is less that \"X\"px.\r\n\r\nI understand that methods `mode=\"push\"` require the content to be in `<mat-sidenav-content>`.\r\n\r\nHere in this [STACKBLITZ](https://stackblitz.com/edit/angular-pzuyhx?file=app%2Fsidenav-fixed-example.html) I have programmed a workaround that requires some CSS-wizardry as you will see.\r\n\r\nYet I dont know how I could add my standalone SideNav into a standalone component, so that I have the same UX.\r\n\r\n#### Update - refactored sidenav into standalone component.\r\n[Stackblitz 2.0](https://stackblitz.com/edit/angular-pzuyhx-6c9ilx?file=app%2Fsidenav-fixed-example.html)","Url":"https://github.com/angular/components/issues/15967","RelatedDescription":"Open issue \"Standalone SideNav\" (#15967)"},{"Id":"440938068","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2019-05-06T22:59:35","Actor":"vanessanschmitt","Number":"15965","RawContent":null,"Title":"chore: add skeleton files for MDC-based implementation of chips","State":"open","Body":"","Url":"https://github.com/angular/components/pull/15965","RelatedDescription":"Open PR \"chore: add skeleton files for MDC-based implementation of chips\" (#15965)"},{"Id":"440831052","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2019-05-06T18:39:17","Actor":"TrevorKarjanis","Number":"15964","RawContent":null,"Title":"fix(breakpoint-observer): fix the breakpoint observer emit count and accuracy","State":"open","Body":"The breakpoint observer emits multiple and incorrect states when more than one query changes.\r\nDebounce the observer emissions to eliminate the incorrect states and emit once.\r\n\r\nReferences [#10925](https://github.com/angular/components/issues/10925)\r\n\r\nI have reproduced this in Chrome, Firefox, Safari, Edge, and IE. It occurs because the media query API fires an event when a query match changes. The breakpoint observer emits once for each event, updating the state of one query each time. Therefore, the observer may emit multiple times for one change and the reported intermediary states can be incorrect. I have reproduced up to five emissions for a single change.\r\n\r\n[https://stackblitz.com/edit/angular-6pmabc](https://stackblitz.com/edit/angular-6pmabc)\r\n\r\n> matches: false \r\n> breakpoints:\r\n> {\r\n>   \"(max-width: 599.99px)\": false,\r\n>   \"(min-width: 600px) and (max-width: 959.99px)\": false,\r\n>   \"(min-width: 960px) and (max-width: 1279.99px)\": false,\r\n>   \"(min-width: 1280px) and (max-width: 1919.99px)\": false,\r\n>   \"(min-width: 1920px)\": false\r\n> }\r\n> matches: true \r\n> breakpoints:\r\n> {\r\n>   \"(max-width: 599.99px)\": false,\r\n>   \"(min-width: 600px) and (max-width: 959.99px)\": true,\r\n>   \"(min-width: 960px) and (max-width: 1279.99px)\": false,\r\n>   \"(min-width: 1280px) and (max-width: 1919.99px)\": false,\r\n>   \"(min-width: 1920px)\": false\r\n> }\r\n\r\nPR [#11007](https://github.com/angular/components/pull/11007) attempted to resolve this issue. However, the issue still reproduces. My understanding is that the AsapScheduler uses a microtask which fails to debounce the media query events. Using the AsyncScheduler resolves the issue. AsyncScheduler uses a timer, setInterval, that may technically be slower on the first bounce but is more efficient across multiple.\r\n\r\nMind my ignorance with Angular testing. I chose to replace flush with task to maintain test coverage.","Url":"https://github.com/angular/components/pull/15964","RelatedDescription":"Open PR \"fix(breakpoint-observer): fix the breakpoint observer emit count and accuracy\" (#15964)"}],"ResultType":"GitHubIssue"}},"RunOn":"2019-05-10T05:30:05.5137298Z","RunDurationInMilliseconds":3357}
