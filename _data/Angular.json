Enabling CheckOnce can give a pretty big performance boost over the default strategy, as such on the project I work on our guidance is to use OnPush and only fallback to the default strategy if it proves unreasonable. The issue is that (at least from what I can glean from the docs and typings) ChangeDetectionStrategy has to be set on each component, this results in `changeDetection: ChangeDetectionStrategy.OnPush;` being added to the declaration for almost every component in our system and also means developers have to explicitly remember to opt into it.\r\n\r\n### Describe the solution you'd like\r\nThere is a similar property in the component declaration called `encapsulation?: ViewEncapsulation`. This can be set on a component by component level but crucially can also be given a default value when calling `bootstrapModule` by passing the `CompilerOptions` property `defaultEncapsulation?: ViewEncapsulation;`. I would propose a similar solution for this. Something like `defaultChangeDetectionStrategy?: ChangeDetectionStrategy` which behaves in a similar way. \r\n\r\n### Describe alternatives you've considered\r\nYou could specify it at a module level but I think it would be a weird thing to declare for a module and would still need to be repeated for different parts of the system, furthermore which strategy should a component declared under multiple modules use (just seems to add complexity).\r\n\r\n### Tangential thoughts\r\nIn general I think there should be more of a push towards onPush (😉). I would personally consider renaming `ChangeDetectionStrategy.Default` to something more descriptive, its not particularly clear to the user what thats doing and in my opinion steers them towards it being the defacto value. I would also like to see the documentation around it guiding first time users more towards using onPush in almost all cases (mentioning it in the Getting started guide for instance).","Url":"https://github.com/angular/angular/issues/32834","RelatedDescription":"Open issue \"[Proposal] Ability to set a default ChangeDetectionStrategy at a module/application level\"

update cacache to version 13.0.0","State":"open","Body":"This PR contains the following updates:\n\n| Package | Type | Update | Change |\n|---|---|---|---|\n| [cacache](https://togithub.com/npm/cacache) | dependencies | major | [`12.0.3` -> `13.0.0`](https://renovatebot.com/diffs/npm/cacache/12.0.3/13.0.0) |\n\n---\n\n### Release Notes\n\n<details>\n<summary>npm/cacache</summary>\n\n### [`v13.0.0`](https://togithub.com/npm/cacache/blob/master/CHANGELOG.md#&#8203;1300httpsgithubcomnpmcacachecomparev1203v1300-2019-09-25)\n\n[Compare Source](https://togithub.com/npm/cacache/compare/v12.0.3...v13.0.0)\n\n##### ⚠ BREAKING CHANGES\n\n-   This subtly changes the streaming interface of\n    everything in cacache that streams, which is, well, everything in\n    cacache.  Most users will probably not notice, but any code that\n    depended on stream behavior always being deferred until next tick will\n    need to adjust.\n\nThe mississippi methods 'to', 'from', 'through', and so on, have been\nreplaced with their Minipass counterparts, and streaming interaction\nwith the file system is done via fs-minipass.\n\nThe following modules are of interest here:\n\n-   [minipass](http://npm.im/minipass) The core stream library.\n\n-   [fs-minipass](http://npm.im/fs-minipass)  Note that the 'WriteStream'\n    class from fs-minipass is _not_ a Minipass stream, but rather a plain\n    old EventEmitter that duck types as a Writable.\n\n-   [minipass-collect](http://npm.im/minipass-collect) Gather up all the\n    data from a stream.  Cacache only uses Collect.PassThrough, which is a\n    basic Minipass passthrough stream which emits a 'collect' event with\n    the completed data just before the 'end' event.\n\n-   [minipass-pipeline](http://npm.im/minipass-pipeline) Connect one or\n    more streams into a pipe chain.  Errors anywhere in the pipeline are\n    proxied down the chain and then up to the Pipeline object itself.\n    Writes go into the head, reads go to the tail.  Used in place of\n    pump() and pumpify().\n\n-   [minipass-flush](http://npm.im/minipass-flush) A Minipass passthrough\n    stream that defers its 'end' event until after a flush() method has\n    completed (either calling the supplied callback, or returning a\n    promise.)  Use in place of flush-write-stream (aka mississippi.to).\n\nStreams from through2, concat-stream, and the behavior provided by\nend-of-stream are all implemented in Minipass itself.\n\nFeatures of interest to cacache, which make Minipass a particularly good\nfit:\n\n-   All of the 'endish' events are normalized, so we can just listen on\n    'end' and know that finish, prefinish, and close will be handled as\n    well.\n-   Minipass doesn't waste time [containing\n    zalgo](https://blog.izs.me/2013/08/designing-apis-for-asynchrony).\n-   Minipass has built-in support for promises that indicate the end or\n    error: stream.promise(), stream.collect(), and stream.concat().\n-   With reliable and consistent timing guarantees, much less\n    error-checking logic is required.  We can be more confident that an\n    error is being thrown or emitted in the correct place, rather than in\n    a callback which is deferred, resulting in a hung promise or\n    uncaughtException.\n\nThe biggest downside of Minipass is that it lacks some of the internal\ncharacteristics of node-core streams, which many community modules use\nto identify streams.  They have no \\_writableState or \\_readableState\nobjects, or \\_read or \\_write methods.  As a result, the is-stream module\n(at least, at the time of this commit) doesn't recognize Minipass\nstreams as readable or writable streams.\n\nAll in all, the changes required of downstream users should be minimal,\nbut are unlikely to be zero.  Hence the semver major change.\n\n##### Features\n\n-   replace all streams with Minipass streams ([f4c0962](https://togithub.com/npm/cacache/commit/f4c0962))\n-   **deps:** Add minipass and minipass-pipeline ([a6545a9](https://togithub.com/npm/cacache/commit/a6545a9))\n-   **promise:** converted .resolve to native promise, converted .map and .reduce to native ([220c56d](https://togithub.com/npm/cacache/commit/220c56d))\n-   **promise:** individually promisifing functions as needed ([74b939e](https://togithub.com/npm/cacache/commit/74b939e))\n-   **promise:** moved .reject from bluebird to native promise ([1d56da1](https://togithub.com/npm/cacache/commit/1d56da1))\n-   **promise:** removed .fromNode, removed .join ([9c457a0](https://togithub.com/npm/cacache/commit/9c457a0))\n-   **promise:** removed .map, replaced with p-map. removed .try ([cc3ee05](https://togithub.com/npm/cacache/commit/cc3ee05))\n-   **promise:** removed .tap ([0260f12](https://togithub.com/npm/cacache/commit/0260f12))\n-   **promise:** removed .using/.disposer ([5d832f3](https://togithub.com/npm/cacache/commit/5d832f3))\n-   **promise:** removed bluebird ([c21298c](https://togithub.com/npm/cacache/commit/c21298c))\n-   **promise:** removed bluebird specific .catch calls ([28aeeac](https://togithub.com/npm/cacache/commit/28aeeac))\n-   **promise:** replaced .reduce and .mapSeries ([478f5cb](https://togithub.com/npm/cacache/commit/478f5cb))\n\n##### [12.0.3](https://togithub.com/npm/cacache/compare/v12.0.2...v12.0.3) (2019-08-19)\n\n##### Bug Fixes\n\n-   do not chown if not running as root ([2d80af9](https://togithub.com/npm/cacache/commit/2d80af9))\n\n##### [12.0.2](https://togithub.com/npm/cacache/compare/v12.0.1...v12.0.2) (2019-07-19)\n\n##### [12.0.1](https://togithub.com/npm/cacache/compare/v12.0.0...v12.0.1) (2019-07-19)\n\n-   **deps** Abstracted out `lib/util/infer-owner.js` to\n    [@&#8203;npmcli/infer-owner](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@&#8203;npmcli/infer-owner)\n    so that it could be more easily used in other parts of the npm CLI.\n\n</details>\n\n---\n\n### Renovate configuration\n\n:date: **Schedule**: \"after 10pm every weekday,before 4am every weekday,every weekend\" in timezone America/Tijuana.\n\n:vertical_traffic_light: **Automerge**: Disabled by config.

Create new angular project:\r\n`ng new hello`\r\n\r\n2. Create new component:\r\n`ng g c hello`\r\n\r\n3. At the bottom of your **app.component.html** paste this line: (inject the newly created component):\r\n`<app-hello></app-hello>`\r\n\r\n4. Edit the **hello** component:\r\n- css file:\r\n`.demo{ background-image: url(\"/assets/hello.jpg\"); }`\r\n- html file:\r\n`<p class=\"demo\">hello works!</p>`\r\n\r\n5. Paste this script to your package.json:\r\n```\r\n  \"scripts\": {\r\n    \"prod\": \"ng build --prod --base-href=./ --deploy-url=/myapp/\",\r\n    ...\r\n  },...\r\n```\r\n\r\n6. Run this command:\r\n`npm run prod`\r\n\r\n7. Search in the dist/ folder (search in text) the value: \"/assets/hello.jpg\"\r\n\r\n### Result:\r\n- Angular v7 (Result ok) - The search result is located in this line (notice the **myapp**):\r\n`{background-image:url(/myapp/assets/hello.jpg)`\r\n\r\n- Angular v8 (Result Bug) - The search result is located in this line (missing **myapp**):\r\n`{background-image:url(/assets/hello.jpg)`\r\n\r\n\r\n###Conclusion:\r\nIt looks like the build flag `--deploy-url` stop working.

Keep reading...\r\n\r\n### Description\r\n\r\nAn Angular workspace (see [docs](https://angular.io/guide/file-structure#multiple-projects)) creates projects with one tsconfig.json file in the root and more tsconfig.json files for each project which extends the root config json. That's ok. But the names of the tsconfig files in the projects are not valid names to work with e.g. vscode.\r\n\r\nIn a project there are two tsconfig files.\r\n\r\n- tsconfig.spec.json\r\n- tsconfig.app.json\r\n\r\nThe problem is that the IDE (or other tools) can't detect this file, because of the special name.\r\nThe valid name should be `tsconfig.json` like the root file.\r\n\r\nFor example: \r\nIf you add an `exclude` in the `tsconfig.app.json` to exclude other apps in the project folder except itself and the shared-lib, it will not work for e.g. the auto import of vscode. Because the tsconfig.app.json is not load. If I rename it to tsconfig.json it works.\r\nBackground: In my case I do not want to get suggestions about imports of other apps in the project folder. Only fromthe shared-folder. This should be a default configuration of Angular workspace, but it's another issue.\r\n\r\n## 🔬 Minimal Reproduction\r\nJust greate a worksapce.\r\n\r\n```text\r\nng new my-workspace --createApplication=\"false\"\r\nng generate application app1\r\nng generate application app2\r\n```\r\n\r\nor simple greate a project without angular to see the problem.\r\n\r\n```text\r\nauto-import-issue\r\n|= projects\r\n|  |= app1\r\n|  |  |- main.ts\r\n|  |  |- page.ts\r\n|  |  \\- tsconfig.app.json\r\n|  \\= app2\r\n|     |- main.ts\r\n|     |- page.ts\r\n|     \\- tsconfig.app.json\r\n\\- tsconfig.json\r\n```\r\n\r\n## 🌍 Your Environment\r\n<pre><code>\r\nAngular CLI: 8.3.5\r\nNode: 10.15.3\r\nOS: win32 x64\r\nAngular: 8.2.7\r\n... animations, common, compiler, compiler-cli, core, forms\r\n... language-service, platform-browser, platform-browser-dynamic\r\n... router\r\n\r\nPackage                            Version\r\n------------------------------------------------------------\r\n@angular-devkit/architect          0.801.3\r\n@angular-devkit/build-angular      0.803.5\r\n@angular-devkit/build-ng-packagr   0.803.5\r\n@angular-devkit/build-optimizer    0.803.5\r\n@angular-devkit/build-webpack      0.803.5\r\n@angular-devkit/core               8.1.3\r\n@angular-devkit/schematics         8.1.3\r\n@angular/cli                       8.3.5\r\n@ngtools/webpack                   8.3.5\r\n@schematics/angular                8.3.5\r\n@schematics/update                 0.803.5\r\nng-packagr                         5.5.1\r\nrxjs                               6.4.0\r\ntypescript                         3.5.3\r\nwebpack                            4.39.2\r\n</code></pre>\r\n\r\n## Other informations\r\n\r\nMaybe the enviroment like vscode or typescript should wildcard the tsconfig.*.json.\r\nBut in this case we have two tsconfig.json files in a project. For spec and app. This is a conflict. \r\nThe IDE (vscode) should grab the angular.json? You can't expect it. But the Angular team could request it. ... I'm not sure If I understood the intention of the Angular team about these tsconfig files. Maybe it is intended that the tsconfig files are invalid names to prevent loading from other tools like vscode and only Angular should handle it. \r\n\r\nI need the tsconfig sometimes for declaring paths.

I'm not sure why but my guess is that `directTemplateLoading` is supposed to work only for Angular related stuff. Any js files unrelated to Angular (like e.g. AngularJS files) seem to be loaded in a different way.\r\n\r\nThe workaround to add `raw-loader!` in front of every `.html`-require is extremely unpleasant.\r\n","Url":"https://github.com/angular/angular-cli/issues/15653","RelatedDescription":"Closed issue \"Regression: raw-loader is missing\" (#15653)"},{"Id":"496628097","IsPullRequest":false,"CreatedAt":"2019-09-21T08:05:56","Actor":"IgorKurkov","Number":"15648","RawContent":null,"Title":"ng lint --fix rewrite code and rename variable' names while lint the html template","State":"closed","Body":"<!--🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅\r\n\r\nOh hi there! 😄\r\n\r\nTo expedite issue processing please search open and closed issues before submitting a new one.\r\nExisting issues often contain information about workarounds, resolution, or progress updates.\r\n\r\n🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅-->\r\n\r\n\r\n# 🐞 Bug report\r\n\r\n### Command (mark with an `x`)\r\n<!-- Can you pin-point the command or commands that are effected by this bug? -->\r\n<!-- ✍️edit: -->\r\n```\r\n- [ ] new\r\n- [ ] build\r\n- [ ] serve\r\n- [ ] test\r\n- [ ] e2e\r\n- [ ] generate\r\n- [ ] add\r\n- [ ] update\r\n- [x] lint\r\n- [ ] xi18n\r\n- [ ] run\r\n- [ ] config\r\n- [ ] help\r\n- [ ] version\r\n- [ ] doc\r\n```\r\n\r\n### Is this a regression?\r\n\r\n<!-- Did this behavior use to work in the previous version? -->\r\n<!-- ✍️--> Yes, the previous version in which this bug was not present was: ....\r\n\r\n\r\n### Description\r\n\r\n<!-- ✍️--> A clear and concise description of the problem...\r\n`ng lint --fix` affected to code and change it with buggy behavior -

Simplified resulting HTML (removing some classes on the button, all classes visible in stackblitz) is shown below. \r\n\r\n```\r\n<button id=\"my-button\">\r\n  <span class=\"mat-button-wrapper\">Click me!</span>\r\n</button>\r\n```\r\nAs a result, when the user clicks on the center of the button (where the text is), the event.target doesn't get the target.id=\"my-button\"; instead, target.id=\"\" and Google Tag Manager doesn't trigger. If the user clicks on the edge of the button, then the target.id=\"my-button\".\r\n\r\n#### Reproduction\r\n\r\nStackBlitz:\r\n\r\nhttps://stackblitz.com/edit/angular-ljrxvd\r\n\r\nSteps to reproduce:\r\n1. In Stackblitz app, click on text in the button. The displayed event.target.id = '' and the outer HTML is the inserted <span>.\r\n2. Next, click on the EDGE of the button (avoiding the text). The displayed event.target.id = 'my-button' and the outer HTML is the inserted <button id=\"my-button\">.\r\n\r\nGoogle Tag Manager will not catch the majority of clicks which trigger the \"span\", not the button with the ID. (This stackblitz demo is not integrated with GTM.)\r\n\r\nIs there some way to overcome this and use Google Tag Manager as intended (set up triggers and tags non programmatically)?\r\n\r\nIs there some way to ensure the event.target.id is the id of the button?\r\n  \r\n#### Environment\r\n\r\n- Angular: 8.2.7\r\n- CDK/Material: 8.2.1\r\n- Browser(s): Chrome, Safari\r\n- Operating System (e.g. Windows, macOS, Ubuntu): Currently testing on Mac\r\n","Url":"https://github.com/angular/components/issues/17199","RelatedDescription":"Open issue \"Google Tag Manager incompatible with MatButtonModule\" (#17199)"},{"Id":"498122265","IsPullRequest":false,"CreatedAt":"2019-09-25T08:42:48","Actor":"Amitshaale","Number":"17197","RawContent":null,"Title":"How to add triangle in dropdown using angular-material dropdown (mat-menu)","State":"closed","Body":"How to add triangle in mat-menu dropdown?
