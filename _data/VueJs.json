Ive also tested in Browserstack and I couldn't reproduce, it was only happening on actual android devices. Once you load that page, if you scroll up and down really fast sometime pieces of the DOM or images disappear. If you scroll back up and then back down to where you just were the content might be there now.\r\n\r\n### What is expected?\r\nThe DOM you see should be there constantly.\r\n\r\n### What is actually happening?\r\nThe DOM is there but android isn't rendering it for some reason.\r\n\r\n---\r\nWe have isolated it to be an Android OS issue only (Not having the problems on iOS or Desktop devices). We also tried to upgrade to the latest version of Vue, and removed 3rd party dependencies. At this point I don't know if its a Vue problem or something else but I figured I would submit a ticket so see if anyone else has reported an issue like this before.\r\n\r\n<!-- generated by vue-issues.

Create a \"renderless\" component that passes data into the default scoped-slot.\r\n```\r\nrender () {\r\n  return this.$scopedSlots.default(this)\r\n},\r\n```\r\n2. Have a component that uses the \"renderless\" component as root and then populates the scoped-slot with its own template.\r\n3. Have two components with regular slots where one is tunneling the passed content into the second slot. The slots can have different names, it does not affect the issue. Like this:\r\n```\r\n<slot slot=\"slotName\" name=\"slotName\"/>\r\n```\r\n4. Somehow force the \"renderless\" component to update.\r\n\r\n### What is expected?\r\nNo warning should be shown.\r\n\r\n### What is actually happening?\r\nIt triggers the warning:\r\n```\r\nDuplicate presence of slot \"sep\" found in the same render tree - this will likely cause render errors.\r\n\r\nfound in\r\n\r\n---> <MiddleComponent> at /src/components/MiddleComponent.vue\r\n```\r\nIt might also work incorrectly or trigger additional unnecessary re-renders.\r\n\r\n---\r\nThe source code responsible for showing the warning was probably meant for detecting the usage of slots inside v-for loops. However, in this case, it seems to be called incorrectly since the slot is only rendered once. The reason for this might be that the `rendered` flag is not being reset in this situation. Not using a renderless component (doing tunneling outside of a scoped-slot) does not trigger the error. Using scoped-slots instead of regular slots also does not trigger the warning, but that’s because the check is skipped.\r\n\r\nThis is potentially related to #8546.\r\n\r\n<!-- generated by vue-issues.

This prevents double update on v-model in functional components by not transforming model when `Ctor.options.functional` is `true`.\r\n\r\nfix #8436 and eventually https://github.com/vuetifyjs/vuetify/issues/4460","Url":"https://github.com/vuejs/vue/pull/8580","RelatedDescription":"Open PR \"fix(v-model): prevent double v-model update on functional components(#8436)\" (#8580)"},{"Id":"345752206","IsPullRequest":false,"CreatedAt":"2018-07-30T22:22:02","Actor":"bbugh","Number":"8578","RawContent":null,"Title":"Child component <slot v-if=\"false\"> will still evaluate parent slot code","State":"closed","Body":"### Version\r\n2.5.16\r\n\r\n### Reproduction link\r\n[https://github.com/bbugh/v-if-slot-issue/commit/ffd6d476bf378936566b4916c1342af4310ef412](https://github.com/bbugh/v-if-slot-issue/commit/ffd6d476bf378936566b4916c1342af4310ef412)\r\n\r\n### Steps to reproduce\r\n1. Create a child component with a conditional slot:\r\n    ```vue\r\n    <template>\r\n      <div>\r\n        <slot v-if=\"showSlot\" />\r\n      </div>\r\n    </template>\r\n    ```\r\n\r\n2. Use the slot in a parent component, using code that should not be called when `v-if` resolves as `false`:\r\n    ```vue\r\n    <conditional-slot :showSlot=\"false\">\r\n      {{ example.should.not.be.called }}\r\n    </conditional-slot>\r\n\r\n    data: () => ({\r\n      example: {}\r\n    })\r\n    ```\r\n\r\nObserve that slot code is called, and fails because \"example\" is an empty object.\r\n\r\nA runnable demo of this is in the linked repository.\r\n\r\n### What is expected?\r\nThe behavior is expected to match `v-if`'s behavior in other circumstances, which is that the code in the `if` block is not evaluated when the conditional check resolves as false.\r\n\r\n### What is actually happening?\r\nThe parent slot code is always evaluated, regardless of the value of `v-if` in the child component.\r\n\r\n<!-- generated by vue-issues.

Instead of getting an alert that App.vue caught the error in HelloWorld's watcher, the error escapes all the way to the top level. To see the expected behavior, open Hello World and set the watcher to immediate: false. Then hit the button to trigger the watcher. In this case the error is caught by the parent, App.vue. In the immediate case, this does not happen.\r\n\r\n### What is expected?\r\nErrors in immediate watchers should be caught by the parent component(s)'s errorCaptured().\r\n\r\n### What is actually happening?\r\nThe error escapes to the nextTick hander. This handler has no ctx or vm to pass to the errorHandler. When errorHandler does not receive a vm, it cannot call the parent errorCaptured handlers.\r\n\r\n---\r\nThis appears to be an oversight in src/core/instance/state.js. In the case options.immediate is true, cb.call(vm, watcher.value) should be wrapped in a try catch that explicitly calls handleError with the vm.\r\n\r\nA proposed fix:\r\n```\r\n    if (options.immediate) {\r\n      try {\r\n        cb.call(vm, watcher.value)\r\n      } catch (e) {\r\n        handleError(e, vm, `immediate call for watcher ${watcher.expression}`)\r\n      }\r\n    }\r\n```\r\n\r\n<!-- generated by vue-issues.

In this particular case the problem is that the `history` object is not present.\r\n\r\nThis was not really a problem before, `history` was `undefined` and it didn't really matter. The current behavior is different. When an app tries to access the `history` object it completely crashes. A polyfill cannot be implemented either because of this.\r\n\r\nIt would seem the solution to this problem should be simply to stick to hash mode, but Vue Router still tries to access `history` even in hash mode.

(internal/process/next_tick.js:188:7)\r\n```\r\n\r\nPlease note that the unit test is not failing with these errors. They are logged from inside `vue.runtime.common.js`.\r\nThe actual error with which the unit tests fail is:\r\n\r\n```\r\n    TypeError: Cannot read property 'getters' of undefined\r\n\r\n      at VueComponent.mappedGetter (node_modules/vuex/dist/vuex.common.js:850:73)\r\n      at Proxy.render (src/some-component.vue:726:50)\r\n      at Object.<anonymous> (src/__tests__/test-something.ts:19:21)\r\n```\r\n\r\n---\r\n### Hints\r\n\r\n * When removing `Vue.extend` in `src/some-component.vue` the failing test passes.\r\n * The error only occurs when the `SomeComponent` component is used inside a parent component, hence the test in `src/__tests__/test-some-component.ts` test is passing.\r\n * This also happens with version `2.x.x` of vuex and older versions of jest and vue.\r\n * This issue also happens when not using local vue.\r\n\r\nThis issue **might** be related to other issues across the web:\r\n\r\n * [Cannot read property 'getters' of undefined](https://github.com/vuejs/vue-test-utils/issues/363)\r\n * [Throws \"Cannot read property 'getters' of undefined\" using vuex's dynamic modules](https://github.com/vuejs/vuex-router-sync/issues/46)\r\n * [@vue/test-utils 1.0.0-beta.18 broke unit tests](https://github.com/vuejs/vue-test-utils/issues/699)\r\n\r\n<!-- generated by vue-issues.
