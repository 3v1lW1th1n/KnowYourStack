In this case it is not a constructor parameter type, but rather a class property type.\r\n\r\nA class property by itself doesn't need metadata with a type reference:\r\n```\r\n// transpiled src/app/autocomplete.directive.ts without Input() decorator\r\nimport * as tslib_1 from \"tslib\";\r\nimport { Directive } from '@angular/core';\r\nlet AutocompleteDirective = class AutocompleteDirective {\r\n    constructor() { }\r\n};\r\n// this is used in autocomplete.abstract.ts\r\nAutocompleteDirective.EMPTYLIST_ELEMENT = \"_EMPTYLIST_\";\r\nAutocompleteDirective = tslib_1.__decorate([\r\n    Directive({\r\n        selector: '[appAutocomplete]'\r\n    }),\r\n    tslib_1.__metadata(\"design:paramtypes\", [])\r\n], AutocompleteDirective);\r\nexport { AutocompleteDirective };\r\n```\r\n\r\nBut when the property is decorated, the metadata will contain a reference to the type:\r\n```\r\n// transpiled src/app/autocomplete.directive.ts with Input() decorator\r\nimport * as tslib_1 from \"tslib\";\r\nimport { Directive, Input } from '@angular/core';\r\nimport { AutocompleteAbstract } from './autocomplete.abstract';\r\nlet AutocompleteDirective = class AutocompleteDirective {\r\n    constructor() { }\r\n};\r\n// this is used in autocomplete.abstract.ts\r\nAutocompleteDirective.EMPTYLIST_ELEMENT = \"_EMPTYLIST_\";\r\ntslib_1.__decorate([\r\n    Input('appAutocomplete'),\r\n    tslib_1.__metadata(\"design:type\", AutocompleteAbstract)\r\n], AutocompleteDirective.prototype, \"autocomplete\", void 0);\r\nAutocompleteDirective = tslib_1.__decorate([\r\n    Directive({\r\n        selector: '[appAutocomplete]'\r\n    }),\r\n    tslib_1.__metadata(\"design:paramtypes\", [])\r\n], AutocompleteDirective);\r\nexport { AutocompleteDirective };\r\n```\r\n\r\nIn ES5 there are no `class` declarations, so TS instead uses a `var`. One important different between `var` and `class/let/const` is that the latter are all subject to the [Temporal Dead Zone](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Statements/let#Temporal_dead_zone). \r\n\r\nWithout the `Input()` decorator this isn't a problem because there is no circular dependency on the type.\r\n\r\n\r\n","Url":"https://github.com/angular/angular/issues/30141","RelatedDescription":"Open issue \"property decorators break at runtime with ES2015 and circular deps\" (#30141)"},{"Id":"437545458","IsPullRequest":false,"CreatedAt":"2019-04-26T07:53:48","Actor":"mackelito","Number":"30139","RawContent":null,"Title":"RouterLink Fragment wait for element to exsist ","State":"open","Body":"<!--üîÖüîÖüîÖüîÖüîÖüîÖüîÖüîÖüîÖüîÖüîÖüîÖüîÖüîÖüîÖüîÖüîÖüîÖüîÖüîÖüîÖüîÖüîÖüîÖüîÖüîÖüîÖüîÖüîÖüîÖüîÖ\r\n\r\nOh hi there! üòÑ \r\n\r\nTo expedite issue processing please search open and closed issues before submitting a new one.\r\nExisting issues often contain information about workarounds, resolution, or progress updates.\r\n\r\nüîÖüîÖüîÖüîÖüîÖüîÖüîÖüîÖüîÖüîÖüîÖüîÖüîÖüîÖüîÖüîÖüîÖüîÖüîÖüîÖüîÖüîÖüîÖüîÖüîÖüîÖüîÖüîÖüîÖüîÖüîÖüîÖüîÖ-->\r\n\r\n\r\n# üöÄ feature request\r\n\r\n### Relevant Package\r\n<!-- Can you pin-point one or more @angular/* packages the are relevant for this feature request? -->\r\n<!-- ‚úçÔ∏èedit: --> This feature request is for @angular/router\r\n\r\n\r\n### Description\r\n<!-- ‚úçÔ∏è-->\r\nWhen using routerLink fragment to scroll to an anchor it might not work properly if unless the element is already loaded (this might be the case for a component that is rendered once data from a API has been loaded)\r\n\r\nAnother problem is that the anchor might be pushed down in the viewport when data is loaded.\r\nA simple example: https://angular-7fpprl.stackblitz.io/qwe#qwe\r\n\r\n### Describe the solution you'd like\r\n<!-- ‚úçÔ∏è-->\r\nPerhaps there should be some wait mechanism in place that waits for the element to be rendered?
