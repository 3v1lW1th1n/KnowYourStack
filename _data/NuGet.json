The problem is this random name that is assigned to this synthesized project file makes the imports for the generated ProjectName.csproj.nuget.g.props and .targets files not work because the `$(MSBuildProjectName)` macros doesn't evaluate to ProjectName, but to randomname, and thus none of the imports are found.\r\n\r\nHere is one of the nuget imports in question:\r\n```xml\r\n  <Import Project=\"$(MSBuildProjectExtensionsPath)$(MSBuildProjectFile).*.props\" Condition=\"'$(ImportProjectExtensionProps)' == 'true' and exists('$(MSBuildProjectExtensionsPath)')\">\r\n```\r\n\r\nAnd the build error is reported not from my own WPF project file, but from a synthesized one like this: \"C:\\Users\\username\\source\\repos\\WpfApp3\\WpfApp3\\5gejw5ia.tmp_proj\"\r\n\r\nOne can get away with this if the PackageReference doesn't point to a package that actually matters to the compilation. But if you actually use types from that reference, or if that package reference adds msbuild imports that are important, you can end up with a build error or a runtime error down the road.\r\n\r\nHere are the repro steps for one such case:\r\n\r\n1. Create a new WPF app\r\n1. Make sure VS is set to use `PackageReference`\r\n1. `Install-Package Nerdbank.GitVersioning`\r\n1. In the MainWindow.xaml.cs file, add this line of code to `MainWindow()`: `string s = ThisAssembly.AssemblyConfiguration;`\r\n1. Build the project.\r\n\r\nThis should compile fine, and in fact the main project would, but the tmp_proj fails to compile because in fact the MSBuild target that generates `ThisAssembly` doesn't get imported from the PackageReference for the tmp_proj.\r\nNote similar repro steps but using a C# console project works perfectly well -- because there is no tmp_proj involved that scrambles the `$(MSBuildProjectName)`.\r\n\r\nThis bug repros on all versions of NuGet that I have tested since PackageReference support was first added.

Having read through the existing responses, I must say I'm both confused and a little stunned. Perhaps someone can clarify this scenario a bit.\r\n\r\nIn one of our projects we're using Autofac and Autofac.Owin. Now in the \"old\" packages.config world, these would both be \"top\" level. However in the new approach, I don't need Autofac to be top level because Autofac.Owin will indirectly import Autofac. With this in mind, I removed the explicit top level Autofac import for one of our projects. I got a build error because one of its project references imported v4.6 and the Autofac.Owin only depended on 3.5.2, but that's irrelevant for this discussion.\r\n\r\nWhat is relevant, is that when I go to manage the Nuget packages for the project (or solution) there's nothing telling me \"Hey, there's an updated version of Autofac.\" For my money, that's a showstopper. As @akamyshanov pointed out, what if there's a critical security update in the update? Now you can say, \"well, you can add Autofac back as a top level\" but that then entirely defeats the point of having transitive dependencies. Further, now I've got to obsessively track a Nuget package's dependencies to make sure they've always got a top level reference. That's work that I've never had to do before. How is this better?\r\n\r\nUnless I am fundamentally not understanding something, PackageReferences are a ticking timebomb that are 100% worthless until the Nuget package manager will recursively search a package's dependencies and display ALL the available updates.
