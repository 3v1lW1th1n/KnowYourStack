Open the JSFiddle\r\n2. You will see the time it takes to compute a value without caching of computed properties (~1 second) in the output\r\n3. Set \"CACHE = true\" in the first line of the JS part to see the time it takes to compute the value with caching (~2 ms)\r\n\r\nThis issue concerns SSR but for simplicity I created the fiddle which emulates the behavior of the server render:\r\n- `CACHE = true` – the behavior we usually have in the client\r\n- `CACHE = false` – the behavior during SSR\r\n\r\n### What is expected?\r\nI would expect computed properties to have comparable performance characteristics on the server and client, so that I don't need to write custom code. \r\nI.e. I would expect computed properties to be cached during SSR.\r\n\r\n### What is actually happening?\r\nComputed properties are not cached and therefore have drastically different performance characteristics in some cases.\r\n\r\n---\r\n### Description if the issue\r\n\r\nSince [computed properties are not cached during SSR](https://ssr.vuejs.org/guide/universal.html#component-lifecycle-hooks) some components unexpectedly take significantly longer to render. This is the case if it is heavy to compute the property or if it is accessed a lot. \r\n\r\nI would usually expect a computed property to have constant time complexity (`O(1)`) no matter how often we access it. But on the server it suddenly becomes linear time complexity (`O(n)`). This is especially critical when the computed is accessed in a loop. When we have multiple computed properties relaying on each other, each containing loops, this gets *really* bad. Then it has polynomial time with the exponent being the amount of nested computed properties (E.g. `O(n^3)` for three levels of computes, like in the JSFiddle)\r\n\r\n### Real world example\r\n\r\nI noticed this issue because our server renderer suddenly took multiple seconds (5-8 seconds) to respond after enabling a new component for SSR. Normally rendering the app on the server takes about 100ms.\r\n\r\nThe effected component is part of a proprietary code base but it is similar to the one in the JSFiddle. You can see the component in production here: \r\n- Open: https://www.ikea.com/de/de/bereiche/wohnzimmer/\r\n- Click on the \"Serien\" button\r\n- The flyout content is the effected component \r\n\r\nAfter finding out about this I also investigated other occurrences of this: \r\nIn our Vuex store we did not have any nested getters with loops, like described above, however some of the getters are somewhat heavy to compute (~1ms) and accessed a lot in various templates. So I decided to introduce a very simple custom caching layer to our store. This sped up server rendering by about 20%.\r\n\r\n**This could also be a low hanging fruit for optimizing SSR performance:**\r\nBased on analyzing our own app, I would roughly estimate that caching all computed properties could speed up server rendering by about 30% in an average Vue.js app.\r\n\r\nFor me this issue was hard to understand because the affected code seemed harmless at first.\r\n\r\n### Mitigation\r\n\r\nTo mitigate this issue you can move access to computes out of loops: access them once, store them in a local variable and then use this variable in the loop. This is generally a good idea since any look up of a property on a Vue.js VM has a small cost.  \r\n\r\nHowever this is not possible if you have a loop inside your templates.\r\n\r\n### References\r\n\r\n- The code that controls this behavior:\r\nhttps://github.com/vuejs/vue/blob/0948d999f2fddf9f90991956493f976273c5da1f/src/core/instance/state.js#L208-L219\r\n\r\n- The issue that lead to this behavior being introduced: vuejs/vuex#877\r\n\r\n- The commit that introduced this behavior 06741f32\r\n\r\n- Earlier occasion of someone stumbling over this: \r\n  - nuxt/nuxt.js#2447\r\n  - https://forum.vuejs.org/t/ssr-performance-problems-due-to-lack-of-caching/24653/5\r\n\r\n<!-- generated by vue-issues.

Here's a little demo:\r\n\r\nhttps://codesandbox.io/s/vue-routing-example-b1t5d\r\n\r\nYou see that there's a slight delay before the route component gets rendered. It gets quite apparent when you have a `beforeEach` navigation guard that delays the route to be rendered. The 'blinking' effect between the blank page and the rendered component is undesirable and I am trying to improve it.\r\n\r\nI tried using [async component](https://vuejs.org/v2/guide/components-dynamic-async.html#Async-Components) to no avail, and it turned out that the cause was when the router is initialized, it is validating an [initial route](https://github.com/vuejs/vue-router/blob/v3.0.6/src/util/route.js#L52), and it is rendering an empty node since there is [no match](https://github.com/vuejs/vue-router/blob/v3.0.6/src/components/view.js#L51). This explains the blank page/element that I was facing.\r\n\r\nMy proposal is to render the children instead of an empty node, so that there is something to be rendered before the route component takes place. This applies to any kinds of route mismatches though. I made a little example and an e2e test to demonstrate the change.\r\n\r\nAlso, I did [search](https://github.com/vuejs/vue-router/issues?q=is%3Aissue+placeholder) through the issues but none of it seemed to mention this problem (could be very specific to the problem I'm facing, or maybe I missed it, CMIIW), so if this isn't exactly what Vue Router is aiming for, I understand, but maybe you could suggest a solution for me 😅. But if this is good enough, that would be so great, though I'm not sure if I'm doing the e2e test right.\r\n\r\nAnyhow, let me know! Thanks for Vue Router btw, I've been using it for the past 2 years and it's been terrific. \r\n","Url":"https://github.com/vuejs/vue-router/pull/2799","RelatedDescription":"Open PR \"refactor(router-view): render children as placeholder\" (#2799)"},{"Id":"451893108","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2019-06-04T09:52:10","Actor":"briwa","Number":"2798","RawContent":null,"Title":"chore(release): add a missing word in message","State":"closed","Body":"<!--\r\nPlease make sure to read the Pull Request Guidelines:\r\nhttps://github.com/vuejs/vue/blob/dev/.github/CONTRIBUTING.md#pull-request-guidelines\r\n-->\r\n\r\nHello, just came across this code and I noticed that it's missing a word.

I have created an application with a large number of components and modules and therefore a large number of namespaced getters. Every time such a getter is invoked the makeLocalGetters function is called iterating trough all the getters in the store just to create the gettersProxy object. This is overkill for ssr performance and is being flagged as a CPU consuming process in the node profiler. \r\nI have managed to double the number of requests per second my ssr app can handle just by using memoization on the gettersProxy object creation. I think this is really impacting performance.\r\n\r\n### What is expected?\r\nNamespaced getters invokation not to be inefficient with large numbers of getters/modules\r\n\r\n### What is actually happening?\r\nA lot of hits to makeLocalGetters making performance go down\r\n\r\n<!-- generated by vue-issues.
