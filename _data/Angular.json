There is \"latest\" tab where the latest hash is stored. The app is rendered from the latest manifest hash, but sometimes, it gets rendered from the older manifests too. I am unable to reproduce that case, but it happens very rarely. After 10-15 mins, the manifest gets cleared and only one manifest hash is present in the cache storage. This is happening randomly without any consistency.\r\n\r\n\r\n## 🔬 Minimal Reproduction\r\nCreate any angular app with angular service worker running, change some code, redeploy it, and you will see that the older service worker cache manifest are still present.\r\n\r\nIf I check the \"Update On Reload\" under the service worker tab, the older cache manifests are getting cleared instantly. I would like the older cache to be deleted by the angular service worker instantly without checking that option.\r\n\r\nThis is how my ngsw-config looks like:\r\n\r\n<pre><code>\r\n<!-- If the issue is accompanied by an exception or an error, please share it below: -->\r\n<!-- ✍️-->\r\n{\r\n  \"configVersion\": 1,\r\n  \"index\": \"/index.html\",\r\n  \"appData\": [\"/index.html\", \"/*.bundle.css\", \"/*.bundle.js\", \"/*.chunk.js\"],\r\n  \"assetGroups\": [\r\n    {\r\n      \"name\": \"app\",\r\n      \"installMode\": \"prefetch\",\r\n      \"resources\": {\r\n

   \"installMode\": \"prefetch\",\r\n      \"updateMode\": \"prefetch\",\r\n      \"resources\": {\r\n        \"files\": [\"/assets/**\"]\r\n      }\r\n    }\r\n  ]\r\n}\r\n</code></pre>\r\n\r\nAnd this is how I have registered it in app.module.ts:\r\n<pre><code>\r\n@NgModule({\r\n  declarations: [AppComponent],\r\n  imports: [\r\n    BrowserModule,\r\n    RouterModule,\r\n    APP_ROUTING,\r\n    ServiceWorkerModule.register('/ngsw-worker.js', {\r\n      enabled: environment.production\r\n    })\r\n  ],\r\n  providers: [],\r\n  bootstrap: [AppComponent]\r\n})\r\n</code></pre>\r\n\r\nThis is what my app.component.ts looks like:\r\n\r\n<pre><code>\r\nimport { Component } from '@angular/core';\r\nimport { SwUpdate } from '@angular/service-worker';\r\n\r\n@Component({\r\n  selector: 'app-root',\r\n  templateUrl: './app.component.html',\r\n  styleUrls: ['./app.component.css']\r\n})\r\nexport class AppComponent {\r\n  title = 'app';\r\n  constructor(private updates: SwUpdate) {\r\n    this.updates.available.subscribe((event: any) => {\r\n      this.updates.activateUpdate().then(() => {\r\n        document.location.reload(true);\r\n      });\r\n    });\r\n  }\r\n</code></pre>\r\n\r\n## 🔥 Exception or Error\r\n\r\nThis how the multiple manifests looks like in Cache Storage:\r\n\r\n<pre><code>\r\n113eb2d75d6b2b62654822b31924678b90ee76e9: {configVersion: 1, index: \"/index.html\",…}..\r\n23er43ertgvcx6751cvb8u8u9o0mnb6765098h76: {configVersion: 1, index: \"/index.html\",…}..\r\n987ujvsskjfd56snsnf34flo3298fcdgnzx768z7: {configVersion: 1, index:

is:\r\n\r\n<pre><code>\r\n{ latest: \"113eb2d75d6b2b62654822b31924678b90ee76e9\" }\r\n</code></pre>\r\n\r\n\r\n## 🌍  Your Environment\r\n\r\n**Angular Version:**\r\n<pre>\r\nAngular CLI:

However, the sample is not very practical if AoT is unsupported.\r\n\r\nThe article in question can be found here: https://angular.io/api/upgrade/static/downgradeModule \r\n\r\n## 🔬 Minimal Reproduction\r\n\r\n### What's the affected URL?**\r\nhttps://angular.io/api/upgrade/static/downgradeModule\r\n\r\n### Reproduction Steps**\r\nRunning the code from the sample\r\n\r\n```\r\nconst downgradedNg2AModule = downgradeModule(async(extraProviders: StaticProvider[]) => {\r\n  const rootInjector = await getRootInjector(extraProviders);\r\n  const moduleAFactory = await rootInjector.get(Compiler).compileModuleAsync(Ng2AModule);\r\n  return moduleAFactory.create(rootInjector);\r\n});\r\n```\r\n\r\n### Expected vs Actual Behavior**\r\n<!-- If applicable please describe the difference between the expected and actual behavior after following the repro steps. -->\r\n<!-- ✍️edit:-->\r\n\r\n\r\n## 📷Screenshot\r\n<!-- Often a screenshot can help to capture the issue better than a long description. -->\r\n<!-- ✍️upload a screenshot:-->\r\n\r\n\r\n## 🔥 Exception or Error\r\n<pre><code>\r\n<!-- If the issue is accompanied by an exception or an error, please share it below: -->\r\n<!-- ✍️-->\r\n\r\n</code></pre>\r\n\r\n\r\n## 🌍  Your Environment\r\n\r\n### Browser info\r\nAll browsers\r\n\r\n\r\n","Url":"https://github.com/angular/angular/issues/29975","RelatedDescription":"Open issue \"Clarify multiple downgradeModules example\" (#29975)"},{"Id":"434743683","IsPullRequest":false,"CreatedAt":"2019-04-18T12:25:15","Actor":"santoshyadav198613","Number":"29974","RawContent":null,"Title":"Tour of heroes should show how to unsubscribe to service or use async pipe as it is better option","State":"open","Body":"<!--🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅\r\n\r\nOh hi there! 😄\r\n\r\nTo expedite issue processing please search open and closed issues before submitting a new one.\r\nExisting issues often contain information about workarounds, resolution, or progress updates.\r\n\r\n🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅-->\r\n\r\n# 📚 Docs or angular.io bug report\r\n\r\n### Description\r\n\r\n<!-- ✍️edit:--> A clear and concise description of the problem...\r\n\r\nTour of heroes service example does not show how to unsubscribe to observables.\r\nAlso add and example to use async pipe\r\n\r\n## 🔬 Minimal Reproduction\r\n\r\n### What's the affected URL?**\r\n<!-- ✍️edit:--> https://pr29909-a95b02a.ngbuilds.io/tutorial/toh-pt4\r\n\r\n### Reproduction Steps**\r\n<!-- If applicable please list the steps to take to reproduce the issue -->\r\n<!-- ✍️edit:-->\r\n\r\n### Expected vs Actual Behavior**\r\n<!-- If applicable please describe the difference between the expected and actual behavior after following the repro steps. -->\r\n<!-- ✍️edit:-->\r\n\r\n\r\n## 📷Screenshot\r\n<!-- Often a screenshot can help to capture the issue better than a long description. -->\r\n<!-- ✍️upload a screenshot:-->\r\n\r\n\r\n## 🔥 Exception or Error\r\n<pre><code>\r\n<!-- If the issue is accompanied by an exception or an error, please share it below: -->\r\n<!-- ✍️-->\r\n\r\n</code></pre>\r\n\r\n\r\n## 🌍  Your Environment\r\n\r\n### Browser info\r\n<!-- ✍️Is this a browser specific issue?

In the `foo` project I'm importing things from `shared`, but these imports doesn't work when I run `npm run build:ssr && npm run serve:ssr`.

Having the workspace information stored in `angular.json` is a misnomer as it is possible to have non-Angular projects and builders defined there. \r\n\r\n## Describe the solution you'd like\r\n\r\nWith the new Workspace API, storage of the workspace configuration is abstracted. It would be great to support a more agnostic config file such as `workspace.json` or `projects.json`. \r\n\r\nCurrently, folks can already build node apps or web-components apps in an Angular CLI workspace, but the naming of the configuration file deters folks from doing it.\r\n\r\nOne of the best things about the Angular community is how well we collaborate with other communities. Having the CLI to be more generic and used in those communities will reinforce this.\r\n\r\nThe `angular.json` file could be supported for backward compatibility. This would improve the experience for doing things outside of Angular within a workspace.\r\n\r\n## Describe alternatives you've considered\r\n\r\nAn alternative could be creating a separate CLI altogether such as the NestJS CLI but it would be great to have 1 agnostic CLI since the Angular CLI is capable of doing both.","Url":"https://github.com/angular/angular-cli/issues/14204","RelatedDescription":"Open issue \"feat: Rename angular.json to workspace.json\" (#14204)"},{"Id":"434154672","IsPullRequest":false,"CreatedAt":"2019-04-17T08:25:34","Actor":"DmitriyIvanko","Number":"14200","RawContent":null,"Title":"Simple bug: Can't resolve '\\app-test\\src\\styles.sass' in '\\app-test'","State":"open","Body":"<!--🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅\r\n\r\nOh hi there! 😄\r\n\r\nTo expedite issue processing please search open and closed issues before submitting a new one.\r\nExisting issues often contain information about workarounds, resolution, or progress updates.\r\n\r\n🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅-->\r\n\r\n\r\n# 🐞 Bug report\r\n\r\n### Command (mark with an `x`)\r\n<!-- Can you pin-point the command or commands that are effected by this bug? -->\r\n<!-- ✍️edit: -->\r\n```\r\n- [ x ] new\r\n```\r\n\r\n### Description\r\n\r\n<!-- ✍️--> \r\nWhen creating a new project, select the option \"Sass [http://sass-lang.com]\".

Currently, this does not seem to be the case.\r\n\r\n## 🔬 Minimal Reproduction\r\n\r\n1. Use this browserslist:\r\n```\r\n> 0.5%\r\n\r\nlast 2 versions\r\nFirefox ESR\r\nnot dead\r\nIE 9-11\r\n```\r\n\r\n2. In `tsconfig.json`, set `target` to `es5`\r\n\r\n3. `ng build --prod`\r\n\r\n4. You will get those polyfills file:\r\n```\r\nchunk {2} polyfills.def630dd003427531b93.js (polyfills) 42.7 kB [initial] [rendered]\r\n```\r\n\r\n5. Update your `browserslist` so that it just contains `last 1 chrome version`\r\n\r\n6. `ng build --prod`\r\n\r\n7. You get the same polyfills file:\r\n```\r\nchunk {2} polyfills.def630dd003427531b93.js (polyfills) 42.7 kB [initial] [rendered]\r\n```\r\n\r\n\r\n## 🔥 Exception or Error\r\n\r\nWe should get a bigger polyfills file with corejs etc. in there first case where IE 9-11 is part of the browserslist.\r\n\r\n## 🌍 Your Environment\r\n\r\n- Windows 10\r\n- Project was migrated to Angular 8-beta and CLI
