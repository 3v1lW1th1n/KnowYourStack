This advisory also provides guidance on what developers can do to update their applications correctly.\r\n\r\nMicrosoft is aware of an elevation of privilege vulnerability exists when a ASP.NET Core web application, created using vulnerable project templates, fails to properly sanitize web requests. An attacker who successfully exploited this vulnerability could perform content injection attacks and run script in the security context of the logged-on user.\r\n\r\nTo exploit the vulnerability, an attacker could send a specially crafted email, containing a malicious link, to a user. Alternatively, an attacker could use a chat client to social engineer a user into clicking the malicious link. However, in all cases to exploit this vulnerability a user must click a maliciously crafted link from an attacker.\r\n\r\nThe security update addresses the vulnerability by correcting the ASP.NET Core project templates.\r\n\r\nDevelopers who have generated applications from the vulnerable templates should change their code using the following instructions. They should also change their code to address a further vulnerability,  [CVE-2018-0783](https://github.com/aspnet/Announcements/issues/284), which is in the same templates. Finally installing the latest .NET Core SDK, version 2.1.4, from https://www.microsoft.com/net/download/ will update the templates to correct the issue for any new applications created.\r\n\r\n### Discussion\r\n\r\nPlease use **** TODO: FILL IN ISSUE LINK *** for discussion of this advisory.\r\n\r\n### Mitigation Factors\r\nASP.NET Core applications which are not created using the ASP.NET Core 2.0 Individual Authentication templates are not vulnerable to this issue.\r\n\r\n## Affected Software\r\nThe vulnerabilities affect any Microsoft .NET Core project if it uses any of affected runtime versions listed below and have generated applications using Individual Authentication with usernames and passwords stored within the application. Applications which use Azure Active Directory, or Azure Active Directory B2C are not affected.\r\n\r\nVulnerable .NET SDK Version | Fixed SDK Version\r\n----------------| -------------------------\r\n2.0.0, 2.0.2, 2.0.3, 2.1.2, 2.1.3 |  2.1.4\r\n\r\n### Advisory FAQ\r\n#### How do I know if I am affected?\r\n\r\nYour application will be affected if you generated it using the ASP.NET 2.0 Web Application template or the ASP.NET 2.0 Web Application (Model/View/Controller) template from a vulnerable SDK version where you have selected individual authentication where user accounts are stored in-app.\r\n\r\nTo check the runtimes installed on a computer you must view the contents of the runtime folder. By default these are\r\n\r\n| Operating System          | Location          |\r\n|---------------------------|-------------------|\r\n| Windows | C:\\Program Files\\dotnet\\sdk\\ |\r\n| macOS | /usr/local/share/dotnet/sdk/    |\r\n| Supported Linux platforms | /usr/share/dotnet/sdk/   |\r\n\r\nEach SDK version is installed in its own directory, where the directory name is the version number. If you do not have a directory for 2.1.4 then any applications generated for ASP.NET Core 2.0 using Individual Authentication may be vulnerable..

Open `Pages\\Account\\Manage\\EnableAuthenticator.cshtml.cs` find the `OnPostAsync()` method and search for the following line\r\n\r\n```\r\n<div id=\"qrCodeData\" data-url=\"@Html.Raw(Model.AuthenticatorUri)\"></div>\r\n```\r\n\r\nReplace this line with the following code, removing the call to `Html.Raw()`\r\n\r\n```C#\r\n<div id=\"qrCodeData\" data-url=\"@Model.AuthenticatorUri\"></div>\r\n```\r\n\r\n2. Open the `Pages\\Account\\Manage\\EnableAuthenticator.cshtml.cs` and search for the following line, inside the `OnGetAsync()` method;\r\n\r\n```C#\r\nawait LoadSharedKeyAndQrCodeUriAsync(user);\r\n```\r\n\r\nRemove the code shown below which follows the call to `LoadSharedKeyAndQrCodeUriAsync(user);`\r\n\r\n```C#\r\nif (string.IsNullOrEmpty(SharedKey))\t\t\r\n{\t\t\r\n    await _userManager.ResetAuthenticatorKeyAsync(user);\t\t\r\n    await LoadSharedKeyAndQrCodeUriAsync(user);\t\t\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nThe `OnGetAsync()` method should now look like\r\n\r\n```C#\r\npublic async Task<IActionResult> OnGetAsync()\r\n{\r\n    var user = await _userManager.GetUserAsync(User);\r\n    if (user == null)\r\n    {\r\n        throw new ApplicationException($\"Unable to load user with ID '{_userManager.GetUserId(User)}'.\");\r\n    }\r\n\r\n    await LoadSharedKeyAndQrCodeUriAsync(user);\r\n\r\n    return Page();\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\n3. Still in the `Pages\\Account\\Manage\\EnableAuthenticator.cshtml.cs` file  and search for the `LoadSharedKeyAndQrCodeUriAsync(ApplicationUser user) function` and replace it with \r\n\r\n```C#\r\nprivate async Task LoadSharedKeyAndQrCodeUriAsync(ApplicationUser user)\r\n{\r\n    // Load the authenticator key & QR code URI to display on the form\r\n    var unformattedKey = await _userManager.GetAuthenticatorKeyAsync(user);\r\n    if (string.IsNullOrEmpty(unformattedKey))\r\n    {\r\n        await _userManager.ResetAuthenticatorKeyAsync(user);\r\n        unformattedKey = await _userManager.GetAuthenticatorKeyAsync(user);\r\n     }\r\n\r\n    SharedKey = FormatKey(unformattedKey);\r\n    AuthenticatorUri = GenerateQrCodeUri(user.Email, unformattedKey);\r\n }\r\n```\r\n\r\n4. Recompile your application and test you can generate 2fa recovery codes correctly, then redeploy your application.\r\n\r\n#### For ASP.NET Core 2.0 Web Application (Model/View/Controller)\r\n\r\n1. Open the `Controllers\\ManageController.cs` file and find the declaration for `private const string AuthenticatorUriFormat`. Add the following new const declaration below it;\r\n\r\n```C#\r\nprivate const string RecoveryCodesKey = nameof(RecoveryCodesKey);\r\n```\r\n\r\n2. Still in `Controllers\\ManageController.cs` file and find the `EnableAuthenticator()` function. Replace its contents with\r\n\r\n```C#\r\n[HttpGet]\r\npublic async Task<IActionResult> EnableAuthenticator()\r\n{\r\n    var user = await _userManager.GetUserAsync(User);\r\n    if (user == null)\r\n    {\r\n        throw new ApplicationException($\"Unable to load user with ID '{_userManager.GetUserId(User)}'.\");\r\n    }\r\n\r\n    var model = new EnableAuthenticatorViewModel();\r\n    await LoadSharedKeyAndQrCodeUriAsync(user, model);\r\n\r\n    return View(model);\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\n3.

Still in `Controllers\\ManageController.cs` file create the following method after `EnableAuthenticator(EnableAuthenticatorViewModel model)`;\r\n\r\n```C#\r\n[HttpGet]\r\npublic IActionResult ShowRecoveryCodes()\r\n{\r\n    var recoveryCodes = (string[])TempData[RecoveryCodesKey];\r\n    if (recoveryCodes == null)\r\n    {\r\n        return RedirectToAction(nameof(TwoFactorAuthentication));\r\n    }\r\n\r\n    var model = new ShowRecoveryCodesViewModel { RecoveryCodes = recoveryCodes };\r\n    return View(model);\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\n5. Still in `Controllers\\ManageController.cs` file create the following method after the `GenerateQrCodeUri(string email, string unformattedKey)` method\r\n\r\n```C#\r\nprivate async Task LoadSharedKeyAndQrCodeUriAsync(ApplicationUser user, EnableAuthenticatorViewModel model)\r\n{\r\n    var unformattedKey = await _userManager.GetAuthenticatorKeyAsync(user);\r\n    if (string.IsNullOrEmpty(unformattedKey))\r\n    {\r\n        await _userManager.ResetAuthenticatorKeyAsync(user);\r\n        unformattedKey = await _userManager.GetAuthenticatorKeyAsync(user);\r\n    }\r\n\r\n    model.SharedKey = FormatKey(unformattedKey);\r\n    model.AuthenticatorUri = GenerateQrCodeUri(user.Email, unformattedKey);\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\n6. Still in `Controllers\\ManageController.cs` Create a new action method in the controller file, `GenerateRecoveryCodesWarning()` containing the following code\r\n\r\n```C#\r\n[HttpGet]\r\npublic async Task<IActionResult> GenerateRecoveryCodesWarning()\r\n{\r\n    var user = await _userManager.GetUserAsync(User);\r\n    if (user == null)\r\n    {\r\n        throw new ApplicationException($\"Unable to load user with ID '{_userManager.GetUserId(User)}'.\");\r\n    }\r\n\r\n    if (!user.TwoFactorEnabled)\r\n    {\r\n        throw new ApplicationException($\"Cannot generate recovery codes for user with ID '{user.Id}' because they do not have 2FA enabled.\");\r\n    }\r\n\r\n    return View(nameof(GenerateRecoveryCodesWarning));\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\n7. Open the `Models\\ManageViewModels\\EnableAuthenticatorViewModel.cs` file and add the following `using` reference;\r\n\r\n```C#\r\nusing Microsoft.AspNetCore.Mvc.ModelBinding;\r\n```\r\n\r\nthen replace the class declaration with \r\n\r\n```C# \r\npublic class EnableAuthenticatorViewModel\r\n{\r\n    [Required]\r\n    [StringLength(7, ErrorMessage = \"The {0} must be at least {2} and at max {1} characters long.\", MinimumLength = 6)]\r\n    [DataType(DataType.Text)]\r\n    [Display(Name = \"Verification Code\")]\r\n    public string Code { get; set; }\r\n\r\n    [BindNever]\r\n    public string SharedKey { get; set; }\r\n\r\n    [BindNever]\r\n    public string AuthenticatorUri { get; set; }\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\n8. Open the `Views\\Manage\\EnableAuthenticator.cshtml` file and replace the following line\r\n\r\n```\r\n<div id=\"qrCodeData\" data-url=\"@Html.Raw(Model.AuthenticatorUri)\"></div>\r\n```\r\n\r\nwith\r\n\r\n```\r\n<div id=\"qrCodeData\" data-url=\"@Model.AuthenticatorUri\"></div>\r\n```\r\n\r\nremove the call to `Html.Raw()`.\r\n\r\n9.

This advisory also provides guidance on what developers can do to update their applications correctly.\r\n\r\nMicrosoft is aware of a Cross Site Request Forgery vulnerability in the individual authentication templates for ASP.NET Core 2.0. An attacker who successfully exploited this vulnerability could change the recovery codes associated with the victim's user account without his/her consent. As a result, a victim of this attack may be permanently locked out of his/her account after loosing access to his/her 2FA device, as the initial recovery codes would be no longer valid.\r\n\r\nThe security update addresses the vulnerability by correcting the ASP.NET Core project templates.\r\n\r\nDevelopers who have generated applications from the vulnerable templates should change their code using the following instructions. They should also change their code to address a further vulnerability,  CVE-2018-0784, which is in the same templates.  ***** TODO: ADD LINK TO OTHER ISSUE ***** \r\n\r\nYou should also install the latest .NET Core SDK, version 2.1.4, from https://www.microsoft.com/net/download/ as will update the templates to correct the issue for any _new_ applications created after its installation. Existing applications must be manually updated using the instructions below.\r\n\r\n### Discussion\r\n\r\nPlease use **** TODO: FILL IN ISSUE LINK *** for discussion of this advisory.\r\n\r\n### Mitigation Factors\r\nASP.NET Core applications which are not created using the ASP.NET Core 2.0 Individual Authentication templates are not vulnerable to this issue.\r\n\r\n## Affected Software\r\nThe vulnerabilities affect any Microsoft .NET Core project if it uses any of affected runtime versions listed below and have generated applications using Individual Authentication with usernames and passwords stored within the application. Applications which use Azure Active Directory, or Azure Active Directory B2C are not affected.\r\n\r\nVulnerable .NET SDK Version | Fixed SDK Version\r\n----------------| -------------------------\r\n2.0.0, 2.0.2, 2.0.3, 2.1.2, 2.1.3 |  2.1.4\r\n\r\n### Advisory FAQ\r\n#### How do I know if I am affected?\r\n\r\nYour application will be affected if you generated it using the ASP.NET 2.0 Web Application template or the ASP.NET 2.0 Web Application (Model/View/Controller) template from a vulnerable SDK version where you have selected individual authentication where user accounts are stored in-app.\r\n\r\nTo check the runtimes installed on a computer you must view the contents of the runtime folder. By default these are\r\n\r\n| Operating System          | Location          |\r\n|---------------------------|-------------------|\r\n| Windows | C:\\Program Files\\dotnet\\sdk\\ |\r\n| macOS | /usr/local/share/dotnet/sdk/    |\r\n| Supported Linux platforms | /usr/share/dotnet/sdk/   |\r\n\r\nEach SDK version is installed in its own directory, where the directory name is the version number. If you do not have a directory for 2.1.4 then any applications generated for ASP.NET Core 2.0 using Individual Authentication may be vulnerable..

Create a new View in `Views\\Manage\\ShowRecoveryCodes.cshtml` with the following content\r\n\r\n```\r\n@model ShowRecoveryCodesViewModel\r\n@{\r\n    ViewData[\"Title\"] = \"Recovery codes\";\r\n    ViewData.AddActivePage(ManageNavPages.TwoFactorAuthentication);\r\n}\r\n\r\n<h4>@ViewData[\"Title\"]</h4>\r\n<div class=\"alert alert-warning\" role=\"alert\">\r\n    <p>\r\n        <span class=\"glyphicon glyphicon-warning-sign\"></span>\r\n        <strong>Put these codes in a safe place.</strong>\r\n    </p>\r\n    <p>\r\n        If you lose your device and don't have the recovery codes you will lose access to your account.\r\n    </p>\r\n</div>\r\n<div class=\"row\">\r\n    <div class=\"col-md-12\">\r\n        @for (var row = 0; row < Model.RecoveryCodes.Length; row += 2)\r\n        {\r\n            <code>@Model.RecoveryCodes[row]</code><text>&nbsp;</text><code>@Model.RecoveryCodes[row + 1]</code><br />\r\n        }\r\n    </div>\r\n</div>\r\n```\r\n\r\n7. Create a new `ShowRecoveryCodesViewModel` class in the `Models\\ManageViewModels` folder and create the class as follows\r\n\r\n```c#\r\npublic class ShowRecoveryCodesViewModel\r\n{\r\n    public string[] RecoveryCodes { get; set; }\r\n}\r\n``` \r\n\r\n8.  Delete the `Models\\ManageViewModels\\generateRecoveryCodesViewModel.cs` file.\r\n\r\n9. Open the `Views\\Manage\\GenerateRecoveryCodes.cshtml` file. Replace the contents with \r\n\r\n```\r\n@{\r\n    ViewData[\"Title\"] = \"Generate two-factor authentication (2FA) recovery codes\";\r\n    ViewData.AddActivePage(ManageNavPages.TwoFactorAuthentication);\r\n}\r\n\r\n<h2>@ViewData[\"Title\"]</h2>\r\n\r\n<div class=\"alert alert-warning\" role=\"alert\">\r\n    <p>\r\n        <span class=\"glyphicon glyphicon-warning-sign\"></span>\r\n        <strong>This action generates new recovery codes.</strong>\r\n    </p>\r\n    <p>\r\n        If you lose your device and don't have the recovery codes you will lose access to your account.\r\n    </p>\r\n    <p>\r\n        Generating new recovery codes does not change the keys used in authenticator apps. If you wish to change the key\r\n        used in an authenticator app you should <a asp-action=\"ResetAuthenticatorWarning\">reset your authenticator keys.</a>\r\n    </p>\r\n</div>\r\n\r\n<div>\r\n    <form asp-action=\"GenerateRecoveryCodes\" method=\"post\" class=\"form-group\">\r\n        <button class=\"btn btn-danger\" type=\"submit\">Generate Recovery Codes</button>\r\n    </form>\r\n</div>\r\n```\r\n\r\n10. Edit `Views\\Manage\\TwoFactorAuthentication.cshtml` to change `<a asp-action=\"GenerateRecoveryCodes\" class=\"btn btn-default\">Reset recovery codes</a>` to ` <a asp-action=\"GenerateRecoveryCodesWarning\" class=\"btn btn-default\">Reset recovery codes</a>`.\r\n\r\n11. Recompile your application and test you can generate 2fa recovery codes correctly, then redeploy your application.\r\n\r\n## Other Information\r\n### Reporting Security Issues\r\n\r\nIf you have found a potential security issue in .NET Core, please email details to secure@microsoft.com.
