I try to build again w/out shutting those processes down and the build fails b/c the dll is in use (by one or both of the orphaned dotnet.exe processes). As soon as I manually kill the orphaned dotnet.exe processes in task manager, I can then build again.\r\n\r\n## Actual behavior\r\nIf I cancel (Ctrl-C) prior to the tests starting, the build server shuts down all the dotnet.exe processes properly. The only orphaned dotnet.exe processes left around on cancellation of the shell script is whenever I interrupt the script while the xunit test runner is running.\r\n\r\n## Environment data\r\n`dotnet --info` output:\r\n\r\n.NET Core SDK (reflecting any global.json):\r\n Version:   2.2.101\r\n Commit:    236713b0b7\r\n\r\nRuntime Environment:\r\n OS Name:     Windows\r\n OS Version:  6.1.7601\r\n OS Platform: Windows\r\n RID:         win7-x64\r\n Base Path:   C:\\Program Files\\dotnet\\sdk\\2.2.101\\\r\n\r\nHost (useful for support):\r\n  Version: 2.2.0\r\n  Commit:  1249f08fed\r\n\r\n.NET Core SDKs installed:\r\n  1.0.0-preview1-002702 [C:\\Program Files\\dotnet\\sdk]\r\n  1.0.0-preview2-003121 [C:\\Program Files\\dotnet\\sdk]\r\n  1.0.0-preview2-003131 [C:\\Program Files\\dotnet\\sdk]\r\n  1.0.0 [C:\\Program Files\\dotnet\\sdk]\r\n  1.0.4 [C:\\Program Files\\dotnet\\sdk]\r\n  2.0.3 [C:\\Program Files\\dotnet\\sdk]\r\n  2.1.2 [C:\\Program Files\\dotnet\\sdk]\r\n  2.1.4 [C:\\Program Files\\dotnet\\sdk]\r\n  2.1.102 [C:\\Program Files\\dotnet\\sdk]\r\n  2.1.103 [C:\\Program Files\\dotnet\\sdk]\r\n  2.1.104 [C:\\Program Files\\dotnet\\sdk]\r\n  2.1.200 [C:\\Program Files\\dotnet\\sdk]\r\n  2.1.201 [C:\\Program Files\\dotnet\\sdk]\r\n  2.1.202 [C:\\Program Files\\dotnet\\sdk]\r\n  2.1.302 [C:\\Program Files\\dotnet\\sdk]\r\n  2.1.400 [C:\\Program Files\\dotnet\\sdk]\r\n  2.1.401 [C:\\Program Files\\dotnet\\sdk]\r\n  2.1.402 [C:\\Program Files\\dotnet\\sdk]\r\n  2.1.403 [C:\\Program Files\\dotnet\\sdk]\r\n  2.1.500 [C:\\Program Files\\dotnet\\sdk]\r\n  2.1.502 [C:\\Program Files\\dotnet\\sdk]\r\n  2.2.100 [C:\\Program Files\\dotnet\\sdk]\r\n  2.2.101 [C:\\Program Files\\dotnet\\sdk]\r\n\r\n.NET Core runtimes installed:\r\n  Microsoft.AspNetCore.All 2.1.2 [C:\\Program Files\\dotnet\\shared\\Microsoft.AspNetCore.All]\r\n  Microsoft.AspNetCore.All 2.1.4 [C:\\Program Files\\dotnet\\shared\\Microsoft.AspNetCore.All]\r\n  Microsoft.AspNetCore.All 2.1.5 [C:\\Program Files\\dotnet\\shared\\Microsoft.AspNetCore.All]\r\n  Microsoft.AspNetCore.All 2.1.6 [C:\\Program Files\\dotnet\\shared\\Microsoft.AspNetCore.All]\r\n  Microsoft.AspNetCore.All 2.2.0 [C:\\Program Files\\dotnet\\shared\\Microsoft.AspNetCore.All]\r\n  Microsoft.AspNetCore.App 2.1.2 [C:\\Program Files\\dotnet\\shared\\Microsoft.AspNetCore.App]\r\n  Microsoft.AspNetCore.App 2.1.4 [C:\\Program Files\\dotnet\\shared\\Microsoft.AspNetCore.App]\r\n  Microsoft.AspNetCore.App 2.1.5 [C:\\Program Files\\dotnet\\shared\\Microsoft.AspNetCore.App]\r\n  Microsoft.AspNetCore.App 2.1.6 [C:\\Program Files\\dotnet\\shared\\Microsoft.AspNetCore.App]\r\n  Microsoft.AspNetCore.App 2.2.0 [C:\\Program Files\\dotnet\\shared\\Microsoft.AspNetCore.App]\r\n  Microsoft.NETCore.App 1.0.0-rc2-3002702 [C:\\Program Files\\dotnet\\shared\\Microsoft.NETCore.App]\r\n  Microsoft.NETCore.App 1.0.0 [C:\\Program Files\\dotnet\\shared\\Microsoft.NETCore.App]\r\n  Microsoft.NETCore.App 1.0.1 [C:\\Program Files\\dotnet\\shared\\Microsoft.NETCore.App]\r\n  Microsoft.NETCore.App 1.0.4 [C:\\Program Files\\dotnet\\shared\\Microsoft.NETCore.App]\r\n  Microsoft.NETCore.App 1.0.5 [C:\\Program Files\\dotnet\\shared\\Microsoft.NETCore.App]\r\n  Microsoft.NETCore.App 1.1.1 [C:\\Program Files\\dotnet\\shared\\Microsoft.NETCore.App]\r\n  Microsoft.NETCore.App 1.1.2 [C:\\Program Files\\dotnet\\shared\\Microsoft.NETCore.App]\r\n  Microsoft.NETCore.App 2.0.3 [C:\\Program Files\\dotnet\\shared\\Microsoft.NETCore.App]\r\n  Microsoft.NETCore.App 2.0.5 [C:\\Program Files\\dotnet\\shared\\Microsoft.NETCore.App]\r\n  Microsoft.NETCore.App 2.0.6 [C:\\Program Files\\dotnet\\shared\\Microsoft.NETCore.App]\r\n  Microsoft.NETCore.App 2.0.7 [C:\\Program Files\\dotnet\\shared\\Microsoft.NETCore.App]\r\n  Microsoft.NETCore.App 2.0.9 [C:\\Program Files\\dotnet\\shared\\Microsoft.NETCore.App]\r\n  Microsoft.NETCore.App 2.1.2 [C:\\Program Files\\dotnet\\shared\\Microsoft.NETCore.App]\r\n  Microsoft.NETCore.App 2.1.3-servicing-26724-03 [C:\\Program Files\\dotnet\\shared\\Microsoft.NETCore.App]\r\n  Microsoft.NETCore.App 2.1.4 [C:\\Program Files\\dotnet\\shared\\Microsoft.NETCore.App]\r\n  Microsoft.NETCore.App 2.1.5 [C:\\Program Files\\dotnet\\shared\\Microsoft.NETCore.App]\r\n  Microsoft.NETCore.App 2.1.6 [C:\\Program Files\\dotnet\\shared\\Microsoft.NETCore.App]\r\n  Microsoft.NETCore.App 2.2.0 [C:\\Program Files\\dotnet\\shared\\Microsoft.NETCore.App]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"},{"Id":"8778795008","Type":"PullRequestEvent","CreatedAt":"2018-12-19T13:03:46","Actor":"dotnet-maestro[bot]","Repository":"dotnet/cli","Organization":"dotnet","RawContent":null,"RelatedAction":"opened","RelatedUrl":"https://github.com/dotnet/cli/pull/10495","RelatedDescription":"Opened pull request \"Update dependency files\" (#10495) at dotnet/cli","RelatedBody":"This pull request updates the following dependencies\r\n\r\nUpdates from https://github.com/dotnet/sdk\r\n\r\n- Microsoft.NET.Sdk -

appears:\r\n\"An app on your PC needs the following Window feature: .NET Framework 3.5\".\r\n\r\nThis occurs once or twice a day. It does not occur when the application targets .NET Framework 4.7.\r\n\r\nI know that my .NET Core app is responsible for the dialog, because Process Explorer reports fondue.exe as having my .NET Core process as the parent, and the current directory matches that of my application.\r\n\r\nThe dependencies for my .NET Core application are all .NET Core or .NET Standard assemblies. I've attached the application's .deps.json file.\r\n\r\nThis bug should be easy to fix - just remove from .NET Core the ability to invoke fondue with .NET Framework as the target.\r\n\r\nThere is nothing recorded to the Windows Event Log.\r\n![missing feature framework 3 5](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/4536177/50261010-8c9f1080-0445-11e9-8159-bfeb03791566.png)\r\n![fondue](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/4536177/50261041-b3f5dd80-0445-11e9-9b66-849728eb24d6.png)\r\n\r\n[LINQPad.deps.zip](https://github.com/dotnet/coreclr/files/2697243/LINQPad.deps.zip)\r\n","Url":"https://github.com/dotnet/coreclr/issues/21609","RelatedDescription":"Open issue \"Running net core app for a few hours causes .NET Framework 3.5 installation popup\" (#21609)"},{"Id":"392837153","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2018-12-20T00:36:38","Actor":"sbomer","Number":"21608","RawContent":null,"Title":"[WIP] Remove run.exe and config.json","State":"open","Body":"This moves us one step away from buildtools and towards arcade.\r\n\r\nThis replaces run.sh and run.cmd (and all invocations) with \"dotnet.sh msbuild\" and \"msbuild.cmd\".\r\n  - I'm using these wrapper scripts for now instead of those in eng/common in order to retain the very helpful \"Running \\<command\\>\" output in the build logs.\r\n  - I'm using msbuild.cmd instead of dotnet.sh to match the current behavior that uses desktop msbuild on windows, instead of dotnet.\r\n\r\nAll of the arguments that used to be implicitly generated by run.exe and config.json are now explicit, resulting in longer (but easier to copy+paste) commands. Some of these arguments are likely unnecessary, but in this change my goal is just to match the run.exe behavior. Later, I would like to go through and clean up parameters that don't need to be passed in every invocation. I might also consider moving more of the common arguments out into variables in a later change.\r\n\r\nSome of the wrapper scripts now have limited support for parsing \"-Argument=Value\" style parameters, to support our existing buildpipeline infrastructure, since I thought this was easier to test than changing our buildpipeline definitions.

The only orphaned dotnet.exe processes left around on cancellation of the shell script is whenever I interrupt the script while the xunit test runner is running.\r\n\r\n## Environment data\r\n`dotnet --info` output:\r\n\r\n.NET Core SDK (reflecting any global.json):\r\n Version:   2.2.101\r\n Commit:    236713b0b7\r\n\r\nRuntime Environment:\r\n OS Name:     Windows\r\n OS Version:  6.1.7601\r\n OS Platform: Windows\r\n RID:         win7-x64\r\n Base Path:   C:\\Program Files\\dotnet\\sdk\\2.2.101\\\r\n\r\nHost (useful for support):\r\n  Version: 2.2.0\r\n  Commit:  1249f08fed\r\n\r\n.NET Core SDKs installed:\r\n  1.0.0-preview1-002702 [C:\\Program Files\\dotnet\\sdk]\r\n  1.0.0-preview2-003121 [C:\\Program Files\\dotnet\\sdk]\r\n  1.0.0-preview2-003131 [C:\\Program Files\\dotnet\\sdk]\r\n  1.0.0 [C:\\Program Files\\dotnet\\sdk]\r\n  1.0.4 [C:\\Program Files\\dotnet\\sdk]\r\n  2.0.3 [C:\\Program Files\\dotnet\\sdk]\r\n  2.1.2 [C:\\Program Files\\dotnet\\sdk]\r\n  2.1.4 [C:\\Program Files\\dotnet\\sdk]\r\n  2.1.102 [C:\\Program Files\\dotnet\\sdk]\r\n  2.1.103 [C:\\Program Files\\dotnet\\sdk]\r\n  2.1.104 [C:\\Program Files\\dotnet\\sdk]\r\n  2.1.200 [C:\\Program Files\\dotnet\\sdk]\r\n  2.1.201 [C:\\Program Files\\dotnet\\sdk]\r\n  2.1.202 [C:\\Program Files\\dotnet\\sdk]\r\n  2.1.302 [C:\\Program Files\\dotnet\\sdk]\r\n  2.1.400 [C:\\Program Files\\dotnet\\sdk]\r\n  2.1.401 [C:\\Program Files\\dotnet\\sdk]\r\n  2.1.402 [C:\\Program Files\\dotnet\\sdk]\r\n  2.1.403 [C:\\Program Files\\dotnet\\sdk]\r\n  2.1.500 [C:\\Program Files\\dotnet\\sdk]\r\n  2.1.502 [C:\\Program Files\\dotnet\\sdk]\r\n  2.2.100 [C:\\Program Files\\dotnet\\sdk]\r\n  2.2.101 [C:\\Program Files\\dotnet\\sdk]\r\n\r\n.NET Core runtimes installed:\r\n  Microsoft.AspNetCore.All 2.1.2 [C:\\Program Files\\dotnet\\shared\\Microsoft.AspNetCore.All]\r\n  Microsoft.AspNetCore.All 2.1.4 [C:\\Program Files\\dotnet\\shared\\Microsoft.AspNetCore.All]\r\n  Microsoft.AspNetCore.All 2.1.5 [C:\\Program Files\\dotnet\\shared\\Microsoft.AspNetCore.All]\r\n  Microsoft.AspNetCore.All 2.1.6 [C:\\Program Files\\dotnet\\shared\\Microsoft.AspNetCore.All]\r\n  Microsoft.AspNetCore.All 2.2.0 [C:\\Program Files\\dotnet\\shared\\Microsoft.AspNetCore.All]\r\n  Microsoft.AspNetCore.App 2.1.2 [C:\\Program Files\\dotnet\\shared\\Microsoft.AspNetCore.App]\r\n  Microsoft.AspNetCore.App 2.1.4 [C:\\Program Files\\dotnet\\shared\\Microsoft.AspNetCore.App]\r\n  Microsoft.AspNetCore.App 2.1.5 [C:\\Program Files\\dotnet\\shared\\Microsoft.AspNetCore.App]\r\n  Microsoft.AspNetCore.App 2.1.6 [C:\\Program Files\\dotnet\\shared\\Microsoft.AspNetCore.App]\r\n  Microsoft.AspNetCore.App 2.2.0 [C:\\Program Files\\dotnet\\shared\\Microsoft.AspNetCore.App]\r\n  Microsoft.NETCore.App 1.0.0-rc2-3002702 [C:\\Program Files\\dotnet\\shared\\Microsoft.NETCore.App]\r\n  Microsoft.NETCore.App 1.0.0 [C:\\Program Files\\dotnet\\shared\\Microsoft.NETCore.App]\r\n  Microsoft.NETCore.App 1.0.1 [C:\\Program Files\\dotnet\\shared\\Microsoft.NETCore.App]\r\n  Microsoft.NETCore.App 1.0.4 [C:\\Program Files\\dotnet\\shared\\Microsoft.NETCore.App]\r\n  Microsoft.NETCore.App 1.0.5 [C:\\Program Files\\dotnet\\shared\\Microsoft.NETCore.App]\r\n  Microsoft.NETCore.App 1.1.1 [C:\\Program Files\\dotnet\\shared\\Microsoft.NETCore.App]\r\n  Microsoft.NETCore.App 1.1.2 [C:\\Program Files\\dotnet\\shared\\Microsoft.NETCore.App]\r\n  Microsoft.NETCore.App 2.0.3 [C:\\Program Files\\dotnet\\shared\\Microsoft.NETCore.App]\r\n  Microsoft.NETCore.App 2.0.5 [C:\\Program Files\\dotnet\\shared\\Microsoft.NETCore.App]\r\n  Microsoft.NETCore.App 2.0.6 [C:\\Program Files\\dotnet\\shared\\Microsoft.NETCore.App]\r\n  Microsoft.NETCore.App 2.0.7 [C:\\Program Files\\dotnet\\shared\\Microsoft.NETCore.App]\r\n  Microsoft.NETCore.App 2.0.9 [C:\\Program Files\\dotnet\\shared\\Microsoft.NETCore.App]\r\n  Microsoft.NETCore.App 2.1.2 [C:\\Program Files\\dotnet\\shared\\Microsoft.NETCore.App]\r\n  Microsoft.NETCore.App 2.1.3-servicing-26724-03 [C:\\Program Files\\dotnet\\shared\\Microsoft.NETCore.App]\r\n  Microsoft.NETCore.App 2.1.4 [C:\\Program Files\\dotnet\\shared\\Microsoft.NETCore.App]\r\n  Microsoft.NETCore.App 2.1.5 [C:\\Program Files\\dotnet\\shared\\Microsoft.NETCore.App]\r\n  Microsoft.NETCore.App 2.1.6 [C:\\Program Files\\dotnet\\shared\\Microsoft.NETCore.App]\r\n  Microsoft.NETCore.App 2.2.0 [C:\\Program Files\\dotnet\\shared\\Microsoft.NETCore.App]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n","Url":"https://github.com/dotnet/cli/issues/10493","RelatedDescription":"Closed issue \"dotnet build-server shutdown won't stop dotnet.exe during tests\" (#10493)"},{"Id":"392592426","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2018-12-19T13:03:40","Actor":"dotnet-maestro[bot]","Number":"10494","RawContent":null,"Title":"Update dependency files","State":"open","Body":"This pull request updates the following dependencies\r\n\r\nUpdates from https://github.com/dotnet/arcade\r\n\r\n- Microsoft.DotNet.Arcade.Sdk -

I'd like to create two packages, one for each target platform.\r\n\r\n## Steps to reproduce\r\n\r\n1. Create a new console application: `dotnet new console`\r\n2. Add `net461` as additional target framework\r\n3. Set `PackageId` using a conditional `PropertyGroup`\r\n4.

While stripping all private fields from types is generally OK, we can't do this for structs. Fortunately, for private fields the compiler doesn't really care what they are, but what their characteristics are. For example:\r\n\r\n1. Does the struct have any fields?\r\n\r\n2. Does the struct contain any reference types (to validate generic instantiations that have the unmanaged constraint)?\r\n\r\n3. Does the struct use the generic parameter in a field declaration (to validate cyclic layout problems)?\r\n\r\nThis adds dummy fields to structs to conform to these rules. These aren't computed separately but are instead taken from .NET Core.\r\n\r\nFor more details, see this issue in CoreFX:\r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/dotnet/corefx/issues/6185","Url":"https://github.com/dotnet/standard/pull/1012","RelatedDescription":"Closed or merged PR \"Add private fields for structs\" (#1012)"},{"Id":"390224712","IsPullRequest":false,"CreatedAt":"2018-12-12T19:00:27","Actor":"YairHalberstadt","Number":"1011","RawContent":null,"Title":"Add HashSet.TryGetValue to .Net Standard","State":"closed","Body":"This method is already implemented by .Net Core 2.0 and .Net Framework 4.7.2, so I imagine this would be relatively easy to include in .Net Standard 2.1.","Url":"https://github.com/dotnet/standard/issues/1011","RelatedDescription":"Closed issue \"Add HashSet.TryGetValue to .Net Standard\" (#1011)"},{"Id":"390052989","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2018-12-12T16:50:02","Actor":"terrajobst","Number":"1009","RawContent":null,"Title":"Clean-up reference assembly","State":"closed","Body":"This aligns the physical representation of the reference assembly with how it look like in .NET Core.

This field obscures the `_securityDescriptor` field in the base class (`ObjectSecurity`).  `ObjectSecurity` exposes a public method, `SetSecurityDescriptorBinaryForm` which is expected to populate the object with a user supplied descriptor.  If `SetSecurityDescriptorBinaryForm` is called on a `DirectoryObjectSecurity` class only `ObjectSecurity._securityDescriptor` is populated.  `DirectoryObjectSecurity._securityDescriptor` is still `null`.  When `DirectoryObjectSecurity.GetAccessRules` is called, it accesses `DirectoryObjectSecurity._securityDescriptor` which is `null`.  It appears `DirectoryObjectSecurity._securityDescriptor` was added when the code was ported .NET core as the current full framework versions do not have the new private field.  The issue was identified using the `ActiveDirectoryPowershell` module in PSH core as it uses these objects to inspect the permissions on a principal.\r\n\r\n**To repro**\r\n\r\nOpen PSH core on Windows 1809 or later\r\nRun Get-ADUser administrator -prop *\r\n\r\ncmd will fail with NullReferenceException\r\n\r\n```ps\r\nPS C:\\Users\\administrator.TQDFT5D> get-aduser administrator -prop *\r\nget-aduser : Object reference not set to an instance of an object.\r\nAt line:1 char:1\r\n+ get-aduser administrator -prop *\r\n+ ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\r\n+ CategoryInfo          : NotSpecified: (administrator:ADUser) [Get-ADUser], NullReferenceException\r\n+ FullyQualifiedErrorId : ActiveDirectoryCmdlet:System.NullReferenceException,Microsoft.ActiveDirectory.Management.Commands.GetADUser\r\n```\r\n\r\n**Stack Trace**\r\n\r\nPS C:\\Users\\administrator.TQDFT5D> $error[0].Exception.StackTrace\r\n```\r\n   at System.Security.AccessControl.DirectoryObjectSecurity.GetRules(Boolean access, Boolean includeExplicit, Boolean includeInherited, Type targetType)\r\n   at System.Security.AccessControl.DirectoryObjectSecurity.GetAccessRules(Boolean includeExplicit, Boolean includeInherited, Type targetType)\r\n   at Microsoft.ActiveDirectory.Management.Commands.ADAccountFactory`1.ScanACLForChangePasswordRight(ActiveDirectorySecurity adsSecurity, Boolean& denySelfFound, Boolean& denyWorldFound, Boolean& allowSelfFound, Boolean& allowWorldFound)\r\n   at Microsoft.ActiveDirectory.Management.Commands.ADAccountFactory`1.ToExtendedCannotChangePassword(String extendedAttribute, String[] directoryAttributes, ADEntity userObj, ADEntity directoryObj, CmdletSessionInfo cmdletSessionInfo)\r\n   at Microsoft.ActiveDirectory.Management.Commands.AttributeConverterEntry.InvokeToExtendedConverter(ADEntity userObj, ADEntity directoryObj, CmdletSessionInfo cmdletSessionInfo)\r\n   at Microsoft.ActiveDirectory.Management.Commands.ADFactory`1.Construct(ADEntity directoryObj, AttributeSetRequest requestedAttributes)\r\n   at Microsoft.ActiveDirectory.Management.Commands.ADPrincipalFactory`1.Construct(ADEntity directoryObj, AttributeSetRequest requestedAttributes)\r\n   at Microsoft.ActiveDirectory.Management.Commands.ADFactory`1.GetExtendedObjectFromIdentity(T identityObj, String identityQueryPath, ICollection`1 propertiesToFetch, Boolean showDeleted, Boolean showLinkTtl)\r\n   at Microsoft.ActiveDirectory.Management.Commands.ADFactory`1.GetExtendedObjectFromIdentity(T identityObj, String identityQueryPath, ICollection`1 propertiesToFetch, Boolean showDeleted)\r\n   at Microsoft.ActiveDirectory.Management.Commands.ADGetCmdletBase`3.ADGetCmdletBaseProcessCSRoutine()\r\n   at Microsoft.ActiveDirectory.Management.CmdletSubroutinePipeline.Invoke()\r\n   at Microsoft.ActiveDirectory.Management.Commands.ADCmdletBase`1.ProcessRecord()\r\n```","Url":"https://github.com/dotnet/corefx/issues/34151","RelatedDescription":"Open issue \"DirectoryObjectSecurity.GetAccessRules throws NullReferenceException when SetSecurityDescriptorBinaryForm is used to initialize the object\" (#34151)"},{"Id":"392280230","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2018-12-18T22:15:20","Actor":"safern","Number":"34145","RawContent":null,"Title":"Add update versions repository step to new official builds pipeline","State":"closed","Body":"Until we stop doing this step once all repos are using the new dependency flow we need buildtools since the update versions task lives in buildtools.

As the caller it's possible to reduce the memory cost by using strategies like `List<T>.Empty`, copy on write, and/or custom versions for low counts (MSBuild did all those), but that adds complexity and a longer code path.\r\n\r\nBoth these types have a private field for _syncRoot. They don't use it themselves, it's for external use. If we could remove that it would shrink them all by 4-8 bytes. Right now the current size of an empty List<T> looks like 24-48 bytes so that's 17%. (The reduction in the size of a collection with contents would be much smaller.)\r\n\r\nIt would be possible to remove _syncRoot by returning `this` but in the unlikely case where calling code was already using `this` for some other locking purpose that could cause deadlock or thread safety problems. Instead, we could safely return an object from the`ConditionalWeakTable`. That would be safe and indistinguishable by callers.\r\n\r\nRetrieving this object would be significantly slower so this would only be worth it if it was rarely used. I think SyncRoot was deprecated almost from the beginning. My guess is that usage is low or very low (apisof.net won't help us here as it doesn't show usage through interfaces). If that's true the heavy usage of these types might make this change worthwhile.\r\n\r\n","Url":"https://github.com/dotnet/corefx/issues/34149","RelatedDescription":"Open issue \"Consider removing SyncRoot on popular collections in favor of object in ConditionalWeakTable\" (#34149)"},{"Id":"392299724","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2018-12-18T19:24:55","Actor":"bgribaudo","Number":"34147","RawContent":null,"Title":"Adding Kill(bool entireProcessTree) -- terminates a process tree","State":"open","Body":"[Implements API approved by #26234]\r\n\r\n## Summary\r\nWhen `Kill(bool entireProcessTree)`'s argument is false, behaves identical to `Kill()`; when true, terminates the current process and all descendant processes (children, grandchildren, etc.).\r\n\r\n## Platform Implementation Status\r\nImplemented for Windows, OSX and Linux; not implemented for UAP, UnknownUnix or FreeBSD. \r\n\r\n## Notes\r\nPotential low-hanging fruit: Behind-the-scenes, the logic in this PR enumerates child processes.

Since you generate package references without strong identity you will remove any corresponding references specified in the project using the same name, even though they might have different metadata.\r\n\r\nmsbuild logging says\r\n```\r\n    _JoinedResolvedCompileFileDefinitions=\r\n        Newtonsoft.Json\r\n                ExternallyResolved=true\r\n                HintPath=C:\\Users\\username\\.nuget\\packages\\newtonsoft.json\\11.0.2\\lib\\net45\\Newtonsoft.Json.dll\r\n                NuGetPackageId=Newtonsoft.Json\r\n                NuGetPackageVersion=11.0.2\r\n                NuGetSourceType=Package\r\n                Private=false\r\n        System.Collections.Immutable\r\n                ExternallyResolved=true\r\n                HintPath=C:\\Users\\username\\.nuget\\packages\\system.collections.immutable\\1.5.0\\lib\\netstandard2.0\\System.Collections.Immutable.dll\r\n                NuGetPackageId=System.Collections.Immutable\r\n                NuGetPackageVersion=1.5.0\r\n                NuGetSourceType=Package\r\n                Private=false\r\n        System.Reflection.Metadata\r\n                ExternallyResolved=true\r\n                HintPath=C:\\Users\\username\\.nuget\\packages\\system.reflection.metadata\\1.6.0\\lib\\netstandard2.0\\System.Reflection.Metadata.dll\r\n                NuGetPackageId=System.Reflection.Metadata\r\n                NuGetPackageVersion=1.6.0\r\n                NuGetSourceType=Package\r\n                Private=false\r\n    Entfernte Elemente: \r\n    Reference=\r\n        Newtonsoft.Json\r\n                HintPath=..\\..\\..\\ThirdParty\\Newtonsoft.Json.dll\r\n        System.Collections.Immutable\r\n                HintPath=..\\..\\..\\ThirdParty\\System.Collections.Immutable.dll\r\n        System.Reflection.Metadata\r\n                HintPath=..\\..\\..\\ThirdParty\\System.Reflection.Metadata.dll\r\n    Hinzugefügte Elemente: \r\n    Reference=\r\n        Newtonsoft.Json\r\n                ExternallyResolved=true\r\n                HintPath=C:\\Users\\username\\.nuget\\packages\\newtonsoft.json\\11.0.2\\lib\\net45\\Newtonsoft.Json.dll\r\n                NuGetPackageId=Newtonsoft.Json\r\n                NuGetPackageVersion=11.0.2\r\n                NuGetSourceType=Package\r\n                Private=false\r\n        System.Collections.Immutable\r\n                ExternallyResolved=true\r\n                HintPath=C:\\Users\\username\\.nuget\\packages\\system.collections.immutable\\1.5.0\\lib\\netstandard2.0\\System.Collections.Immutable.dll\r\n                NuGetPackageId=System.Collections.Immutable\r\n                NuGetPackageVersion=1.5.0\r\n                NuGetSourceType=Package\r\n                Private=false\r\n        System.Reflection.Metadata\r\n                ExternallyResolved=true\r\n                HintPath=C:\\Users\\username\\.nuget\\packages\\system.reflection.metadata\\1.6.0\\lib\\netstandard2.0\\System.Reflection.Metadata.dll\r\n                NuGetPackageId=System.Reflection.Metadata\r\n                NuGetPackageVersion=1.6.0\r\n                NuGetSourceType=Package\r\n                Private=false\r\n```\r\nThe problem goes away if we specify the reference as\r\n```xml\r\n    <Reference Include=\"Newtonsoft.Json, Version=12.0.0.0\">\r\n      <HintPath>$(ReferenceBasePath)Newtonsoft.Json.dll</HintPath>\r\n    </Reference>\r\n```\r\nbut this is something we do *not* want due to the amount of projects and number of references we would have to maintain manually.

However, .NET hasn't had a (great) built-in way to deal with JSON. Instead we've relied on [Json.NET] which continues to serve the .NET ecosystem well.\r\n\r\n[Json.NET]: https://www.newtonsoft.com/json\r\n\r\nMoving forward, we plan on making some changes to our JSON support:\r\n\r\n* **We need high-performance JSON APIs**. We need a new set of JSON APIs that are highly tuned for performance by using `Span<T>` and allows for processing UTF-8 directly without having to transcode to UTF-16 `string` instances. Both aspects are critical for our web server Kestrel, where throughput is a key requirement.\r\n\r\n* **Remove dependency from ASP.NET Core to Json.NET**. Today, ASP.NET Core has a dependency on Json.NET. While this provides a tight integration between ASP.NET Core and Json.NET, it also means that application developers cannot freely choose which JSON library they are using. This is also problematic for customers of Json.NET as the version is dictated by the underlying platform. However, Json.NET is frequently updated and application developers often want to -- or even have to -- use a specific version. Thus, we want to remove the dependency from ASP.NET Core 3.0 to Json.NET so that customers can choose which version to use, without fearing they might accidentally break the underlying platform. In addition, this makes it also possible to plug-in an entirely different JSON library.\r\n\r\n* **Provide an ASP.NET Core integration package for Json.NET**. Json.NET has basically become the Swiss Army knife of JSON processing in .NET. It provides many options and facilities that allow customers to handle their JSON needs with ease. We don't want to compromise on the Json.NET support customers are getting today, for example, the ability to configure the JSON serialization via the `AddJsonOptions` extension method. Thus, we want to provide the Json.NET integration as a NuGet package that developers can optionally install so they get all the bells and whistles they get from Json.NET today. The other part of this work item is to ensure we have the right extension points so that other parties can provide similar integration packages for their JSON library of choice.\r\n\r\nBelow are more details around this plan.\r\n\r\n## The need for high-performance JSON APIs\r\n\r\nThe requirements for the .NET stack have changed a bit since the arrival of .NET Core. Historically, .NET has valued usability and convenience. With .NET Core, we've added a focus on performance, and we've made significant investments to serve high performance needs. And the [improvements we made][techempower] in the popular TechEmpower benchmark are a testament to that.\r\n\r\n[techempower]: https://www.techempower.com/blog/2016/11/16/framework-benchmarks-round-13/\r\n\r\nWith .NET Core 2.1, we've added a brand new primitive called [Span\\<T>][span-msdn] that allows us to represent native memory and arrays in a uniform way. With this type, we've also added a set of parsing and encoding APIs that are much more memory efficient without having to resort to unsafe code.\r\n\r\n[span-msdn]: https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/magazine/mt814808.aspx\r\n\r\nPart of the work of minimizing allocations is to avoid having to transcode UTF-8 payloads into UTF-16 strings, purely for parsing reasons. Currently, Json.NET is implemented by reading UTF-16. We need the ability to read (and write) JSON documents directly in UTF-8 because most network protocols (including HTTP) use UTF-8.\r\n\r\nDuring .NET Core 2.1 we've learned that updating our existing APIs to leverage `Span<T>` has limits. While we did add a bunch of overloads that accept spans, we also had to produce brand new APIs that are designed around minimizing allocations and dealing with buffers, which we exposed in `System.Buffers` namespaces. And with `System.IO.Pipelines` we've also added a programming model that enables developers to share buffers without having to deal with lifetime issues.\r\n\r\nBased on these experiences we believe in order to support JSON parsing, we'll need to expose a new set of JSON APIs that are specifically geared for high-performance scenarios.\r\n\r\nYou might wonder why we can't just update Json.NET to include support for parsing JSON using `Span<T>`? Well, James Newton-King -- the author of Json.NET -- has the following to say about that:\r\n\r\n> Json.NET was created over 10 years ago, and since then it has added a wide range of features aimed to help developers work with JSON in .NET. In that time Json.NET has also become far and away NuGet's most depended on and downloaded package, and is the go-to library for JSON support in .NET. Unfortunately, Json.NET's wealth of features and popularity works against making major changes to it. Supporting new technologies like `Span<T>` would require fundamental breaking changes to the library and would disrupt existing applications and libraries that depend on it.\r\n>\r\n> Going forward Json.NET will continue to be worked on and invested in, both addressing known issues today and supporting new platforms in the future. Json.NET has always existed alongside other JSON libraries for .NET, and there will be nothing to prevent you using one or more together, depending on whether you need the performance of the new JSON APIs or the large feature set of Json.NET.\r\n\r\n## Move Json.NET integration into a separate NuGet package\r\n\r\nToday, you cannot use ASP.NET Core without Json.NET because it is a dependency of ASP.NET Core itself. Over the years, we've received feedback that the dependency can conflict with other libraries that have their own dependency on a different version of Json.NET. In the past, we've considered addressing this issue by using a private copy of Json.NET in ASP.NET. However, this would create problems when developers want to configure Json.NET (for instance, in order to control how the serializer behaves when formatting JSON objects).\r\n\r\nMoving forward we'd like to:\r\n\r\n1. Replace the internal usage of Json.NET in ASP.NET Core by the new platform-provided JSON APIs.\r\n\r\n2. Factor the public facing usage of Json.NET into an optional integration package that can be acquired from NuGet.\r\n\r\nSo the existing integration between ASP.NET Core and Json.NET will continue to be supported, but will be moving out of the platform and into a separate package. However, since the integration is then designed to sit on top of the platform, it will also allow customers to update Json.NET to later versions.\r\n\r\nFurthermore, customers who need more performance can also choose to use the new JSON APIs, at the expense of the rich feature set that Json.NET offers.\r\n\r\n## Discussion\r\n\r\nFor a discussion, please go to https://github.com/dotnet/corefx/issues/33115.","Url":"https://github.com/dotnet/announcements/issues/90","RelatedDescription":"Open issue \"The future of JSON in .NET Core 3.0\" (#90)"},{"Id":"368440353","IsPullRequest":false,"CreatedAt":"2018-10-09T23:44:06","Actor":"vivmishra","Number":"89","RawContent":null,"Title":"October 2018 .NET Updates","State":"open","Body":"# October 2018 .NET Updates\r\n\r\nThe following .NET updates were released in October 2018.

LTS releases are stable release which receive critical updates and are supported for at least three years. Current releases can include new features that may undergo future change based on feedback. Current releases are supported for three months after the subsequent .NET Core major or minor release. Both LTS and Current releases receive critical fixes throughout their lifecycle, for security, reliability, or to add support for new operating system versions. You must stay up-to-date with the latest patches to qualify for support. \r\n\r\n## .NET Core 2.0 Lifecycle\r\n\r\n[.NET Core 2.0](https://blogs.msdn.microsoft.com/dotnet/2017/08/14/announcing-net-core-2-0/) was released in August 2017 as a Current release. Per the lifecycle policy, Current releases reach end of life 3 months after a subsequent release (Current or LTS). .NET Core 2.1 released May 2018 and began the end of life countdown for .NET Core 2.0. The 3 month maintenance period for .NET Core 2.0 was scheduled to end August 2018 but was [extended to October](https://blogs.msdn.microsoft.com/dotnet/2018/06/20/net-core-2-0-will-reach-end-of-life-on-september-1-2018/) to allow time to address an issue some customers were experiencing while migrating to .NET Core 2.1.\r\n\r\n## .NET Core 2.0 Downloads\r\n\r\n.NET Core 2.0 installers, zips and tar.gzs will remain available, but unsupported.

This advisory also provides guidance on what developers can do to update their applications to remove this vulnerability.\r\n\r\nMicrosoft is aware of a denial of service vulnerability in .NET Core when System.IO.Pipelines improperly handles requests. An attacker who successfully exploited this vulnerability could cause a denial of service against an application that is leveraging System.IO.Pipelines. The vulnerability can be exploited remotely, without authentication. A remote unauthenticated attacker could exploit this vulnerability by providing specially crafted requests to the application.\r\n\r\nThe update addresses the vulnerability by correcting how System.IO.Pipelines handles requests.\r\n\r\nIf you are using ASP.NET Core 2.1 you will also need to update your ASP.NET version this by following the instructions in the [ASP.NET Core bulletin](https://github.com/aspnet/Announcements/issues/316).\r\n\r\n## Discussion\r\n\r\nDiscussion for this issue can be found at https://github.com/dotnet/corefx/issues/32228\r\n\r\n### <a name=\"mitigation-factors\"></a>Mitigation factors\r\n\r\nThere are no mitigating factors for this vulnerability.\r\n\r\n## <a name=\"affected-software\"></a>Affected software\r\n\r\nAny .NET Core based application that uses the System.IO.Pipelines package with a vulnerable version listed below.\r\n\r\nPackage name | Vulnerable versions | Secure versions\r\n------------ | ------------------- | -------------------------\r\nSystem.IO.Pipelines | 4.5.0 | 4.5.1\r\n\r\n## <a name=\"advisory-faq\"></a>Advisory FAQ\r\n\r\n### <a name=\"how-affected\"></a>How do I know if I am affected?\r\n\r\n#### Applications which use System.IO.Pipelines\r\n\r\nSystem.IO.Pipelines is distributed both in ASP.NET Core 2.1 and separately as a NuGet package. If you are not using Microsoft.AspNetCore.App or .All, you may still be affected if you are referencing the System.IO.Pipelines package.\r\n\r\n##### Direct dependencies\r\n\r\nDirect dependencies are discoverable by examining your `csproj` file. They can be fixed by [editing the project file](#fixing-direct-dependencies) or using NuGet to update the dependency.\r\n\r\n##### Transitive dependencies\r\n\r\nTransitive dependencies occur when you add a package to your project that in turn relies on another package. For example, if Contoso publishes a package `Contoso.Utility` which, in turn, depends on `Contoso.Internals` and you add the `Contoso.Utility` package to your project now your project has a direct dependency on `Contoso.Utility` and, because `Contoso.Utility` depends 'Contoso.Internals', your application gains a transitive dependency on the `Contoso.Internals` package.\r\n\r\nTransitive dependencies are reviewable in two ways:\r\n\r\n* In the Visual Studio Solution Explorer window, which supports searching.\r\n* By examining the `project.assets.json` file contained in the obj directory of your project for `csproj` based projects\r\n\r\nThe `project.assets.json` files are the authoritative list of all packages used by your project, containing both direct and transitive dependencies.\r\n\r\nThere are two ways to view transitive dependencies. You can either [use Visual Studio’s Solution Explorer](#vs-solution-explorer), or you can review [the `project.assets.json` file](#project-assets-json)).\r\n\r\n##### <a name=\"vs-solution-explorer\"></a>Using Visual Studio Solution Explorer\r\n\r\nTo use Solution Explorer, open the project in Visual Studio, and then press Ctrl+; to activate the search in Solution Explorer. Search for the [vulnerable package](#affected-software) and make a note of the version numbers of any results you find.\r\n\r\nFor example, searching for `Microsoft.AspNetCore.Mvc.Core` in an example project that contains a package that takes a dependency on `Microsoft.AspNetCore.Mvc` shows the following results in Visual Studio 2017:\r\n\r\n![Screenshot of search results in Visual Studio 2017](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/796298/25858816/8ecdc2b4-3491-11e7-9363-746804bb9832.png)\r\n\r\nThe search results appear as a tree. In the previous results, you can see that a reference to `Microsoft.AspNetCore.Mvc.Core` version 1.1.2 is discovered.\r\n\r\nUnder the Dependencies node is a NuGet node. Under the NuGet node is the list of packages you have directly taken a dependency on and their versions.\r\nIn screenshot, the application takes a direct dependency on `Microsoft.AspNetCore.Mvc`. `Microsoft.AspNetCore.Mvc` in turn has leaf nodes that list its dependencies and their versions.\r\nThe `Microsoft.AspNetCore.Mvc` package takes a dependency on a version of `Microsoft.AspNetCore.Mvc.ApiExplorer`, that in turn takes a dependency on a version of `Microsoft.AspNetCore.Mvc.Core`.\r\n\r\n##### <a name=\"project-assets-json\"></a> Manually reviewing project.assets.json\r\n\r\nOpen the *project.assets.json* file from your project’s obj directory in your editor. We suggest you use an editor that understands JSON and allows you to collapse and expand nodes to review this file.\r\nVisual Studio and Visual Studio Code provide JSON friendly editing.\r\n\r\nSearch the *project.assets.json* file for the [vulnerable package](#affected-software), using the format `packagename/` for each of the package names from the preceding table. If you find the assembly name in your search:\r\n\r\n* Examine the line on which they are found, the version number is after the `/`.\r\n* Compare to the [vulnerable versions table](#affected-software).\r\n\r\nFor example, a search result that shows `System.IO.Pipelines/4.5.0` is a reference to version 4.5.0 of `System.IO.Pipelines`.\r\n\r\nIf your *project.assets.json* file includes references to the [vulnerable package](#affected-software), then you need to fix the transitive dependencies.\r\n\r\nIf you have not found any reference to any vulnerable packages, this means either\r\n\r\n* None of your direct dependencies depend on any vulnerable packages, or\r\n* You have already fixed the problem by updating the direct dependencies.\r\n\r\n### <a name=\"how-fix\"></a>How do I fix the issue?\r\n\r\n#### <a name=\"fixing-direct-dependencies\"></a>Fixing direct dependencies\r\n\r\nOpen *projectname.csproj* in your editor. If you're using Visual Studio, right-click the project and choose **Edit projectname.csproj** from the context menu, where projectname is the name of your project. Look for `PackageReference` elements. The following shows an example project file:\r\n\r\n```xml\r\n<Project Sdk=\"Microsoft.NET.Sdk.Web\">\r\n  <PropertyGroup>\r\n    <TargetFramework>netcoreapp2.1</TargetFramework>\r\n  </PropertyGroup>\r\n  <ItemGroup>\r\n    <PackageReference Include=\"System.IO.Pipelines\" Version=\"4.5.0\" />\r\n  </ItemGroup>\r\n</Project>\r\n```\r\n\r\nThe preceding example has a reference to the [vulnerable package](#affected-software), as seen by the single `PackageReference` element. The name of the package is in the `Include` attribute.\r\nThe package version number is in the `Version` attribute. The previous example shows a single direct dependency on `System.IO.Pipelines` version 4.5.0\r\n\r\nTo update the version to the secure package, change the version number to the updated package version as listed on the table [previously](#affected-software).\r\nIn this example, update `System.IO.Pipelines` to the appropriate [fixed package number](#affected-software) for your major version. Save the *csproj* file. The example *csproj* now looks as follows:\r\n\r\n```xml\r\n<Project Sdk=\"Microsoft.NET.Sdk.Web\">\r\n  <PropertyGroup>\r\n    <TargetFramework>netcoreapp2.1</TargetFramework>\r\n  </PropertyGroup>\r\n  <ItemGroup>\r\n    <PackageReference Include=\"System.IO.Pipelines\" Version=\"4.5.1\" />\r\n  </ItemGroup>\r\n</Project>\r\n```\r\n\r\nIf you're using Visual Studio and you save your updated *csproj* file, Visual Studio will restore the new package version.\r\nYou can see the restore results by opening the **Output** window (Ctrl+Alt+O) and changing the **Show output from** drop-down list to **Package Manager**.\r\n\r\nIf you're not using Visual Studio, open a command line and change to your project directory. Execute the `dotnet restore` command to restore the updated dependencies.\r\n\r\nNow recompile your application. If after recompilation you see a *Dependency conflict warning*, you must update your other direct dependencies to versions that take a dependency on the updated package.\r\n\r\n#### <a name=\"transitive-dependencies\"></a>Fixing transitive dependencies\r\n\r\nIf your transitive dependency review found references to the [vulnerable package](#affected-software), you must add a direct dependency to the updated package to your *csproj* file to override the transitive dependency.\r\n\r\nOpen *projectname.csproj* in your editor. If you're using Visual Studio, right-click the project and choose **Edit projectname.csproj** from the context menu, where projectname is the name of your project.\r\nLook for `PackageReference` nodes, for example:\r\n\r\n```xml\r\n<Project Sdk=\"Microsoft.NET.Sdk.\">\r\n  <PropertyGroup>\r\n    <TargetFramework>net461</TargetFramework>\r\n  </PropertyGroup>\r\n  <ItemGroup>\r\n    <PackageReference Include=\"ThirdParty.NotUpdatedYet\" Version=\"2.0.0\" />\r\n  </ItemGroup>\r\n</Project>\r\n```\r\n\r\nYou must add a direct dependency to the updated version of the [vulnerable package](#affected-software) by adding it to the *csproj* file.\r\nYou do this by adding a new line to the dependencies section, referencing the fixed version.\r\nFor example, if your search showed a transitive reference to a vulnerable `System.ServiceModel.Http` version, you'd add a reference to the [fixed package number](#affected-software).\r\n\r\n```xml\r\n<Project Sdk=\"Microsoft.NET.Sdk.Web\">\r\n  <PropertyGroup>\r\n    <TargetFramework>net461</TargetFramework>\r\n  </PropertyGroup>\r\n  <ItemGroup>\r\n    <PackageReference Include=\"System.IO.Pipelines\" Version=\"4.5.1\" />\r\n    <PackageReference Include=\"ThirdParty.NotUpdatedYet\" Version=\"2.0.0\" />\r\n  </ItemGroup>\r\n</Project>\r\n```\r\n\r\nAfter you've added the direct dependency reference, save your *csproj* file.\r\n\r\nIf you're using Visual Studio, save your updated *csproj* file and Visual Studio will restore the new package versions.\r\nYou can see the restore results by opening the **Output** window (Ctrl+Alt+O) and changing the **Show output from** drop-down list to **Package Manager**.\r\n\r\nIf you're not using Visual Studio, open a command line and change to your project directory. Execute the `dotnet restore` command to restore the new dependencies.\r\n\r\n#### Rebuilding your application\r\n\r\nFinally you must rebuild your application, test, and redeploy.\r\n\r\n## Other Information\r\n\r\n### Reporting Security Issues\r\n\r\nIf you have found a potential security issue in .NET Core, please email details to secure@microsoft.com.

Please try this build and provide support.\r\n\r\n## Discussion\r\n\r\nPlease share your thoughts on this change and see what others are saying at:\r\n\r\n* [dotnet/coreclr #19843](https://github.com/dotnet/coreclr/issues/19843)\r\n\r\n## Current Status\r\n\r\nARM64 builds are functional, for console and ASP.NET Core apps.\r\n\r\n## Details\r\n\r\nInitial support for ARM64 was added in the .NET Core 2.1 release. The team is not maintaining .NET Core 2.x branches with respect to ARM64. All ARM64 improvements will be made in the .NET Core 3.0 branch (currently [master](https://github.com/dotnet/coreclr)).\r\n\r\nSee [Installing .NET Core 3.0 on Linux ARM64](https://gist.github.com/richlander/467813274cea8abc624553ee72b28213) to install .NET Core on your ARM64 machine. Builds are available from the [daily builds page](https://github.com/dotnet/core/blob/master/daily-builds.md).\r\n\r\n## Bug Queries\r\n\r\nthe following bugs queries are available for ARM64:\r\n\r\n* [dotnet/coreclr](https://github.com/dotnet/coreclr/issues?q=is%3Aopen+is%3Aissue+label%3Aarch-arm64)\r\n* [dotnet/corefx](https://github.com/dotnet/corefx/issues?q=is%3Aopen+is%3Aissue+label%3Aarch-arm64)\r\n\r\n## Operating Systems\r\n\r\n.NET Core 3.0 ARM64 builds are tested on the following operating systems:\r\n\r\n* Ubuntu 16.04 and 18.04\r\n* Debian 9\r\n\r\n## Test Hardware\r\n\r\n.NET Core 3.0 ARM64 builds have been tested on the following hardware:\r\n\r\n* [NVIDIA Jetson TX2 Module](https://developer.nvidia.com/embedded/buy/jetson-tx2)\r\n* [Pine A64](https://www.pine64.org/?page_id=46823)\r\n* [Qualcomm Centriq 2400](https://www.qualcomm.com/products/qualcomm-centriq-2400-processor)\r\n* [Qualcomm Snapdragon](https://www.qualcomm.com/snapdragon/always-connected-pc)\r\n* [Raspberry Pi3](https://www.raspberrypi.org/products/raspberry-pi-3-model-b-plus/)","Url":"https://github.com/dotnet/announcements/issues/82","RelatedDescription":"Open issue \".NET Core Runtime ARM64 Status\" (#82)"},{"Id":"349693735","IsPullRequest":false,"CreatedAt":"2018-08-22T18:23:01","Actor":"richlander","Number":"80","RawContent":null,"Title":"Improving Performance of ARM32 Docker Images with .NET Core Package Cache","State":"closed","Body":"# Improving Performance of ARM32 Docker Images with .NET Core Package Cache\r\n\r\n.NET Core SDK distributions include a compressed copy of NuGet packages for .NET Core, ASP.NET Core and EF Core. These packages are decompressed upon installation of the .NET Core SDK. The packages are not currently included in ARM32 distributions due to the time and space cost to decompress the packages. Instead, they will be added to [.NET Core ARM32 Docker images](https://hub.docker.com/r/microsoft/dotnet/), where these costs can be paid as part of image creation.\r\n\r\nThese NuGet packages include content for two purposes:\r\n\r\n- Reference assemblies for .NET Core, for code compilation.\r\n- Pre-compiled assemblies (compiled with [crossgen](https://github.com/dotnet/coreclr/blob/master/Documentation/building/crossgen.md)) for .NET Core, for use in self-contained applications.\r\n\r\nIn both cases, the presence of these packages avoid the need to access remote NuGet feeds for .NET Core assemblies as part of package restore.\r\n\r\nThis change only affects [.NET Core 2.1 SDK ARM32 Docker images](https://hub.docker.com/r/microsoft/dotnet/). This change will be made in August 2018.\r\n\r\n## Discussion\r\n\r\nPlease share your thoughts on this change and see what others are saying at:\r\n\r\n* [dotnet/dotnet-docker #653](https://github.com/dotnet/dotnet-docker/issues/653)\r\n\r\n## .NET Core SDK NugetFallbackFolder\r\n\r\nThe .NET Core SDK includes a compressed copy of all NuGet package, in LZMA format. It exists at the following version-specific location:\r\n\r\n```\r\nroot@3778032bc43d:/# ls -l /usr/share/dotnet/sdk/2.1.302/*.lzma\r\n-rw-r--r-- 1 1004 sudo 35995936 Jul  2 22:51 /usr/share/dotnet/sdk/2.1.302/nuGetPackagesArchive.lzma\r\n```\r\n\r\nThis file is decompressed to the following location: `/usr/share/dotnet/sdk/NuGetFallbackFolder/`\r\n\r\nA package restore for a .NET Core assembly will restore the assembly from the NuGetFallbackFolder location and copy it to the user NuGet cache. At that point, regular NuGet behavior is used.\r\n\r\n## Impact of this change\r\n\r\nThere should be no functional difference in behavior after this change. .NET SDK commands should complete faster and require fewer package restore network requests.\r\n\r\nThe following examples demonstrates the benefit of this change. The improvement can be observed with package restore. Build times (assuming no restore) are not affected.\r\n\r\n### .NET Core 2.1 SDK image after this change\r\n\r\n> The change has already been made in the `microsoft/dotnet-nightly` repo, as you can see in the example below.

This issue was resolved earlier this year, with the [May 2018 Preview of Quality Rollup](https://blogs.msdn.microsoft.com/dotnet/2018/05/15/net-framework-may-2018-preview-of-quality-rollup/). We recently learned that some applications, including Johnson Controls’ C-CURE 9000 Software, were negatively impacted by this change as this update requires all client and server workstations to be updated simultaneously with the appropriate Microsoft updates. The changes made to .NET Framework 4.7.1 were also integrated into .NET Framework 4.6 and later servicing releases. As a result, this advisory applies to .NET Framework 4.6 and later versions.\r\n\r\nThis advisory is provided so that developers can correctly diagnose this issue and be aware of our guidance. We will continue to update this issue as we have new information to share.\r\n\r\n## Discussion\r\n\r\nPlease share your thoughts on this change and see what others are saying at:\r\n\r\n* [microsoft/dotnet #832](https://github.com/Microsoft/dotnet/issues/832)\r\n\r\n## Guidance\r\n\r\nThis guidance only applies to customers that have experienced this issue.\r\n\r\nWe have released [an update for .NET Framework 4.6](https://blogs.msdn.microsoft.com/dotnet/2018/08/30/net-framework-august-2018-preview-of-quality-rollup/) and later that resolves the issue. **You must deploy the .NET Framework update for this issue to all .NET Framework 4.6+ machines that communicate via serialized objects**. After doing that, cross-machine serialization will work as expected. \r\n \r\nPlease consult your software vendor to understand if this impacts the software you are using.\r\n\r\n## Technical Context\r\n\r\nIn the [May 2018 Preview of Quality Rollup](https://blogs.msdn.microsoft.com/dotnet/2018/05/15/net-framework-may-2018-preview-of-quality-rollup/), we made a change to the internal type CultureAwareComparer to implement ISerializable. We made the change in order to address [issue with serializing/deserializing a CultureAwareComparer](https://github.com/Microsoft/dotnet/blob/master/releases/net471/KnownIssues/521954%20-%20BCL%20CultureAwareComparer%20with%20ignore%20casing%20on%20serialized%20on%20previous%20versions%20of%20.NET%20do%20not%20correctly%20deserialize%20on%20.NET%204.7.1.md).\r\n\r\nThe issue reported was that a type that contains an instance of CultureAwareComparer was not able to correctly serialize and deserialize across different versions of the .NET Framework. There are a few types in .NET Framework that do this, the most commonly impacted one being the Dictionary<TKey, TValue> type.\r\n \r\nThe change to implement the ISerializable interface had unintended side effects when exchanging this type across different machines. We have had a small number of reports from customers who have been affected.\r\n\r\nA common, but not unique way, of exchanging objects across machines is to use WCF in conjunction with a serializer. One of the common serializers being DataContractSerializer. The side-effect of the change prevented data serialized on systems where the type implements ISerializable to correctly deserialize of systems where the type does NOT implement ISerializable. The same is true of the opposite case, that systems where the type does not implement ISerializable will not correctly deserialize data from systems where the type does implement ISerializable.\r\n\r\nWe have an updated fix that we intend to release within the next month that will remove the implementation of the ISerializable interface on the type and use a different internal mechanism for ensuring the cross-version serialization continues to work as expected. This change addresses the break experienced with WCF.\r\n\r\nThe upcoming fix will remove the implementation of the ISerializable interface on the type and use a different mechanism for ensuring the cross-version serialization of that type continues to work. This change addresses the break experienced with WCF.\r\n\r\n## Symptoms\r\n\r\nAn application that is affected by this issue will most likely crash when trying to deserialize an object. It may print or log an error message similar to the following one:\r\n\r\n```\r\nThe formatter threw an exception while trying to deserialize the message: \r\nThere was an error while trying to deserialize parameter . The InnerException message was ''EndElement' 'Comparer' from namespace '' is not expected. Expecting element '_compareInfo'.'.  Please see InnerException for more details.\r\n```\r\n","Url":"https://github.com/dotnet/announcements/issues/81","RelatedDescription":"Open issue \"Advisory serializing/deserializing a CultureAwareComparer with .NET Framework 4.6+\" (#81)"},{"Id":"348162872","IsPullRequest":false,"CreatedAt":"2018-08-07T04:26:40","Actor":"richlander","Number":"79","RawContent":null,"Title":"August 2018 .NET Updates","State":"open","Body":"# August 2018 .NET Updates\r\n\r\nThe following .NET updates were released in August 2018.

Debian Jessie is no longer a supported operating system for .NET Core. Docker users need to switch to Debian Stretch-based (AKA Debian 9) images to stay in support.\r\n\r\n## Discussion\r\n\r\nPlease share your thoughts on this change and see what others are saying at:\r\n\r\n* [dotnet/dotnet-docker #647](https://github.com/dotnet/dotnet-docker/issues/647)\r\n\r\n## Context\r\n\r\nJessie-based images are currently provided for .NET Core 1.0, 1.1 and 2.0. .NET Core 1.0 and 1.1 expose multi-arch tags, such as `1.0-runtime` and `1.1-sdk`, that support Debian Jessie. When pulled for a Linux Docker daemon (on Linux or Windows), these tags pull Jessie-based images. .NET Core 2.0 supports Jessie, but it is not the default. .NET Core 2.0 multi-arch tags, such as `2.0-runtime` and `2.0-sdk`, pull Debian Stretch-based images, when pulled for a Linux Docker daemon. We made a conscious decision with .NET Core 2.0 to move off of Jessie as the default to avoid this problem, based the Jessie 2018 EOL date. .NET Core 2.1 does not support Jessie, only Stretch.\r\n\r\nWe recently posted about our policy for underlying operating system dependencies with Docker:\r\n\r\n> For each major and minor .NET version, we may take a new major operating system version dependency. As I mentioned earlier, we adopted Debian 9 as the base image for .NET Core 2.0. We stayed with Debian 9 for .NET Core 2.1, since Debian 10 (AKA “Buster”) has not been released. Debian 9 will remain the default base image for .NET Core 2.1 for the life of .NET Core 2.1. **Once we adopt an underlying operating system major version, we will not change it for the life of that given .NET release.**\r\n\r\nSource: https://blogs.msdn.microsoft.com/dotnet/2018/06/18/staying-up-to-date-with-net-container-images/\r\n\r\n## Plan\r\n\r\nWe will continue to re-build .NET Core 1.0 and 1.1 multi-arch tags on top of Jessie for the remaining [supported lifetime of .NET Core 1.0 and 1.1](https://github.com/dotnet/core/blob/master/microsoft-support.md). We will also provide a Stretch-based image for .NET Core 1.1. This tag will look like the following: `1.1-runtime-stretch` or `1.1.9-sdk-stretch`. This is same format that Jessie has used.\r\n\r\nWe will produce Jessie-based images for NET Core 2.0 until October 2018, which is when [.NET Core 2.0 support ends](https://github.com/dotnet/core/blob/master/microsoft-support.md). .NET Core 2.0 multi-arch tags support Debian Stretch, not Jessie, as described above.\r\n\r\nIn summary, .NET Core is no longer supported on Debian Jessie, with Docker or otherwise. We will produce Docker images for Jessie until .NET Core 1.0, 1.1 and 2.0 support ends, respectively, to avoid breaking applications.

See Guidance section.~~\r\n\r\n~~Guidance has changed for Windows 7, Windows Server 2008 and Windows Server 2008 R2. See Guidance section.~~\r\n\r\nThe [July 2018 Security and Quality Rollup updates for .NET Framework](https://portal.msrc.microsoft.com/en-US/security-guidance/advisory/CVE-2018-8356) was released earlier this month. We have received multiple customer reports of [applications that fail to start or don't run correctly](https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/help/4345913) after installing the July 2018 update. These reports are specific to applications that initialize a COM component and run with restricted permissions.\r\n\r\nWe have stopped distributing the .NET Framework July 2018 updates on Windows Update and are actively working on fixing and re-shipping this month's updates. If you installed the July 2018 update and have not yet seen any negative behavior, we recommend that you leave your systems as-is but closely monitor them and ensure that you apply upcoming .NET Framework updates.\r\n\r\nAs a team, we regret that this release was shipped with this flaw. This release was tested using our regular and extensive testing process. We discovered while investigating this issue that we have a test hole for the specific combination of COM activation and restricted permissions, including impersonation. We will be mitigating that gap going forward. Again, we are sorry for any inconvenience that this product flaw has caused.\r\n\r\nWe will continue to update this issue and [post](https://blogs.msdn.microsoft.com/dotnet/2018/07/20/advisory-on-july-2018-net-framework-updates/) as we have new information.\r\n\r\n## Discussion\r\nPlease share your thoughts/experience on this advisory and see what others are saying at:\r\n\r\n* [microsoft/dotnet #811](https://github.com/Microsoft/dotnet/issues/811)\r\n\r\n## Guidance\r\n\r\nWe strongly recommend that you install [.NET Framework August 2018 Update](https://blogs.msdn.microsoft.com/dotnet/2018/08/14/august-2018-security-and-quality-rollup/).\r\n\r\n~~We recommend that you install [.NET Framework July 2018 Update](https://blogs.msdn.microsoft.com/dotnet/2018/07/30/net-framework-july-2018-update/) on your systems if you experienced the symptoms described in this advisory. If you did not experience these symptoms, we recommend you wait to update your machines until the next regular update, in August.~~\r\n\r\n~~On Windows 7, Windows Server 2008, and Windows Server 2008 R2, we have found that the combination of [July 2018 Security and Quality Rollup updates for .NET Framework](https://portal.msrc.microsoft.com/en-US/security-guidance/advisory/CVE-2018-8356) and  [.NET Framework July 2018 Update](https://blogs.msdn.microsoft.com/dotnet/2018/07/30/net-framework-july-2018-update/) do not resolve all symptoms. On these Windows versions, if you are experiencing these symptoms after installing this combination of patches, we recommend that you uninstall (only) the Monthly Rollup patch and then install the appropriate Security Only patch listed at [July 2018 Security and Quality Rollup updates for .NET Framework](https://portal.msrc.microsoft.com/en-US/security-guidance/advisory/CVE-2018-8356).~~\r\n\r\n## Technical Context\r\n\r\nThe .NET Framework runtime uses the process token to determine whether the process is being run within an elevated context.

You must update your projects using the following instructions to address both types of dependency.\r\n\r\n### <a name=\"project-format\"></a>.NET Core Project formats\r\n\r\n.NET Core has two different project file formats, depending on what software created the project.\r\n\r\n1. `project.json` is the format used in .NET Core 1.0 and Microsoft Visual Studio 2015.\r\n2. `csproj` is the format used in .NET Core 1.1, .NET Core 2.0 and Microsoft Visual Studio 2017.\r\n\r\n#### Direct dependencies\r\n\r\nDirect dependencies are discoverable by examining your `csproj` file or your `project.json` file. They can be fixed by [editing the project file](#direct-dependencies) or using NuGet to update the dependency.\r\n\r\n The `System.Private.ServiceModel` package is not meant to be directly depended on and will not appear in your direct dependency list.\r\n\r\n#### Transitive dependencies\r\n\r\nTransitive dependencies occur when you add a package to your project that in turn relies on another package. For example, if Contoso publishes a package `Contoso.Utility` which, in turn, depends on `Contoso.Internals` and you add the `Contoso.Utility` package to your project now your project has a direct dependency on `Contoso.Utility` and, because `Contoso.Utility` depends 'Contoso.Internals', your application gains a transitive dependency on the `Contoso.Internals` package.\r\n\r\nTransitive dependencies are reviewable in three ways, depending on your [project format](#project-format):\r\n\r\n* In the Visual Studio Solution Explorer window, which supports searching.\r\n* By examining the `project.assets.json` file contained in the obj directory of your project for `csproj` based projects *OR*.\r\n* By examining the `project.lock.json` file contained in the root directory of your project for `project.json` based projects.\r\n\r\nThe `project.assets.json` and `project.lock.json` files are the authoritative list of all packages used by your project, containing both direct and transitive dependencies.\r\n\r\n#### <a name=\"direct-dependencies-vs2017\"></a>Fixing direct dependencies in a csproj based project / Visual Studio 2017\r\n\r\nOpen *projectname.csproj* in your editor. If you're using Visual Studio, right-click the project and choose **Edit projectname.csproj** from the context menu, where projectname is the name of your project. Look for `PackageReference` elements. The following shows an example project file:\r\n\r\n```xml\r\n<Project Sdk=\"Microsoft.NET.Sdk.Web\">\r\n  <PropertyGroup>\r\n    <TargetFramework>netcoreapp2.0</TargetFramework>\r\n  </PropertyGroup>\r\n  <ItemGroup>\r\n    <PackageReference Include=\"System.ServiceModel.Http\" Version=\"4.4.0\" />\r\n  </ItemGroup>\r\n</Project>\r\n```\r\n\r\nThe preceding example has a reference to the [vulnerable package](#affected-software), as seen by the single `PackageReference` element. The name of the package is in the `Include` attribute.\r\nThe package version number is in the `Version` attribute. The previous example shows a single direct dependency on `System.ServiceModel.Http` version 4.4.0.\r\n\r\nTo update the version to the secure package, change the version number to the updated package version as listed on the table [previously](#affected-software).\r\nIn this example, update `System.ServiceModel.Http` to the appropriate [fixed package number](#affected-software) for your major version. Save the *csproj* file. The example *csproj* now looks as follows:\r\n\r\n```xml\r\n<Project Sdk=\"Microsoft.NET.Sdk.Web\">\r\n  <PropertyGroup>\r\n    <TargetFramework>netcoreapp2.0</TargetFramework>\r\n  </PropertyGroup>\r\n  <ItemGroup>\r\n    <PackageReference Include=\"System.ServiceModel.Http\" Version=\"4.4.3\" />\r\n  </ItemGroup>\r\n</Project>\r\n```\r\n\r\nIf you're using Visual Studio and you save your updated *csproj* file, Visual Studio will restore the new package version.\r\nYou can see the restore results by opening the **Output** window (Ctrl+Alt+O) and changing the **Show output from** drop-down list to **Package Manager**.\r\n\r\nIf you're not using Visual Studio, open a command line and change to your project directory. Execute the `dotnet restore` command to restore the updated dependencies.\r\n\r\nNow recompile your application. If after recompilation you see a *Dependency conflict warning*, you must update your other direct dependencies to versions that take a dependency on the updated package.\r\n\r\n#### <a name=\"direct-dependencies-vs2015\"></a> Fixing Direct Dependencies in project.json based project / Visual Studio 2015\r\n\r\nOpen your `project.json` file in your editor. Look for the dependencies section. Below is an example dependencies section:\r\n\r\n``` json\r\n    \"dependencies\": {\r\n      \"Microsoft.NETCore.App\": {\r\n        \"version\": \"1.0.1\",\r\n        \"type\": \"platform\"\r\n      },\r\n     \"Microsoft.AspNetCore.Mvc.Core\": \"1.0.6\",\r\n     \"System.ServiceModel.Http\" : \"4.0.0\"\r\n    }\r\n```\r\n\r\nThis example has three direct dependencies: `Microsoft.NETCore.App`, `Microsoft.AspNetCore.Mvc.Core` and `System.ServiceModel.Http`.\r\n\r\n`Microsoft.NetCore.App` is the platform the application targets, you should ignore this. The other packages expose their version to the right of the package name. In our example, our non-platform packages are version 1.0.1.\r\n\r\nReview your direct dependencies for any instance of the packages and versions listed above. In the example above, there is a direct dependency on a vulnerable package, `System.ServiceModel.Http` version 4.4.0.\r\n\r\nTo update to the fixed package, change the version number to be the appropriate package for your release. In the example, this would be updating `System.ServiceModel.Http` to 4.4.3.\r\n\r\nAfter updating the vulnerable package versions, save your `project.json` file.\r\n\r\nThe dependencies section in our example `project.json` would now look as follows:\r\n\r\n```json\r\n  \"dependencies\": {\r\n    \"Microsoft.NETCore.App\": {\r\n      \"version\": \"1.0.1\",\r\n      \"type\": \"platform\"\r\n    },\r\n    \"Microsoft.AspNetCore.Mvc.Core\": \"1.0.6\",\r\n    \"System.ServiceModel.Http \": \"4.4.3\"\r\n  }\r\n```\r\n\r\nIf you are using Visual Studio and save your updated `project.json` file, Visual Studio will restore the new package version. You can see the restore results by opening the Output Window (Ctrl+Alt+O) and changing the Show output from drop-down list to Package Manager.\r\n\r\nIf you are not using Visual Studio, open a command line and change to your project directory. Execute the `dotnet restore` command to restore your new dependency.\r\n\r\nAfter you have addressed all of your direct dependencies, you must also review your transitive dependencies.\r\n\r\nAfter you've addressed all of your direct dependencies, you must review your transitive dependencies.\r\n\r\n#### Discovering and fixing transitive dependencies\r\n\r\nThere are two ways to view transitive dependencies. You can either [use Visual Studio’s Solution Explorer](#vs-solution-explorer), or you can review [the `project.assets.json` file](#project-assets-json) or the [the `project.lock.json` file](#project-lock-json).\r\n\r\n##### <a name=\"vs-solution-explorer\"></a>Using Visual Studio Solution Explorer\r\n\r\nTo use Solution Explorer, open the project in Visual Studio, and then press Ctrl+; to activate the search in Solution Explorer. Search for the [vulnerable package](#affected-software) and make a note of the version numbers of any results you find.\r\n\r\nFor example, searching for `Microsoft.AspNetCore.Mvc.Core` in an example project that contains a package that takes a dependency on `Microsoft.AspNetCore.Mvc` shows the following results in Visual Studio 2017:\r\n\r\n![Screenshot of search results in Visual Studio 2017](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/796298/25858816/8ecdc2b4-3491-11e7-9363-746804bb9832.png)\r\n\r\nThe search results appear as a tree. In the previous results, you can see that a reference to `Microsoft.AspNetCore.Mvc.Core` version 1.1.2 is discovered.\r\n\r\nUnder the Dependencies node is a NuGet node. Under the NuGet node is the list of packages you have directly taken a dependency on and their versions.\r\nIn screenshot, the application takes a direct dependency on `Microsoft.AspNetCore.Mvc`. `Microsoft.AspNetCore.Mvc` in turn has leaf nodes that list its dependencies and their versions.\r\nThe `Microsoft.AspNetCore.Mvc` package takes a dependency on a version of `Microsoft.AspNetCore.Mvc.ApiExplorer`, that in turn takes a dependency on a version of `Microsoft.AspNetCore.Mvc.Core`.\r\n\r\n##### <a name=\"project-assets-json\"></a> Manually reviewing project.assets.json (csproj/VS2017)\r\n\r\nOpen the *project.assets.json* file from your project’s obj directory in your editor. We suggest you use an editor that understands JSON and allows you to collapse and expand nodes to review this file.\r\nVisual Studio and Visual Studio Code provide JSON friendly editing.\r\n\r\nSearch the *project.assets.json* file for the [vulnerable package](#affected-software), using the format `packagename/` for each of the package names from the preceding table. If you find the assembly name in your search:\r\n\r\n* Examine the line on which they are found, the version number is after the `/`.\r\n* Compare to the [vulnerable versions table](#affected-software).\r\n\r\nFor example, a search result that shows `System.ServiceModel.Http/4.3.0` is a reference to version 4.3.0 of `System.ServiceModel.Http`.\r\n\r\nIf your *project.assets.json* file includes references to the [vulnerable package](#affected-software), then you need to fix the transitive dependencies.\r\n\r\nIf you have not found any reference to any vulnerable packages, this means either\r\n\r\n* None of your direct dependencies depend on any vulnerable packages, or\r\n* You have already fixed the problem by updating the direct dependencies.\r\n\r\nIf your transitive dependency review found references to the [vulnerable package](#affected-software), you must add a direct dependency to the updated package to your *csproj* file to override the transitive dependency.\r\n\r\nOpen *projectname.csproj* in your editor. If you're using Visual Studio, right-click the project and choose **Edit projectname.csproj** from the context menu, where projectname is the name of your project.\r\nLook for `PackageReference` nodes, for example:\r\n\r\n```xml\r\n<Project Sdk=\"Microsoft.NET.Sdk.\">\r\n  <PropertyGroup>\r\n    <TargetFramework>net461</TargetFramework>\r\n  </PropertyGroup>\r\n  <ItemGroup>\r\n    <PackageReference Include=\"ThirdParty.NotUpdatedYet\" Version=\"2.0.0\" />\r\n  </ItemGroup>\r\n</Project>\r\n```\r\n\r\nYou must add a direct dependency to the updated version of the [vulnerable package](#affected-software) by adding it to the *csproj* file.\r\nYou do this by adding a new line to the dependencies section, referencing the fixed version.\r\nFor example, if your search showed a transitive reference to a vulnerable `System.ServiceModel.Http` version, you'd add a reference to the [fixed package number](#affected-software).\r\n\r\n```xml\r\n<Project Sdk=\"Microsoft.NET.Sdk.Web\">\r\n  <PropertyGroup>\r\n    <TargetFramework>net461</TargetFramework>\r\n  </PropertyGroup>\r\n  <ItemGroup>\r\n    <PackageReference Include=\"System.ServiceModel.Http\" Version=\"4.3.2\" />\r\n    <PackageReference Include=\"ThirdParty.NotUpdatedYet\" Version=\"2.0.0\" />\r\n  </ItemGroup>\r\n</Project>\r\n```\r\n\r\nAfter you've added the direct dependency reference, save your *csproj* file.\r\n\r\nIf you're using Visual Studio, save your updated *csproj* file and Visual Studio will restore the new package versions.\r\nYou can see the restore results by opening the **Output** window (Ctrl+Alt+O) and changing the **Show output from** drop-down list to **Package Manager**.\r\n\r\nIf you're not using Visual Studio, open a command line and change to your project directory. Execute the `dotnet restore` command to restore the new dependencies.\r\n\r\n##### <a name=\"project-lock-json\"></a> Manually reviewing project.lock.json (project.json/VS2015)\r\n\r\nOpen the `project.lock.json` file in your editor. We suggest you use an editor that understands json and allows you to collapse and expand nodes to review this file; both Visual Studio and Visual Studio Code provide this functionality.\r\n\r\nIf you are using Visual Studio the `project.lock.json` file is “under” the `project.json` file. Click the right pointing triangle, ▷, to the left of the `project.json` file to expand the solution tree to expose the `project.lock.json` file. The following image shows a project with the `project.json` file expanded to show the `project.lock.json` file.\r\n\r\n![project lock json](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/796298/25858179/f6e01200-348f-11e7-8a77-7176d8dd3f03.png)\r\n\r\nSearch the `project.lock.json` file for the vulnerable packages, using the format `packagename/`, using each of the package names from the table above. If you find any vulnerable assembly name in your search examine the line on which they are found, the version number is after the `/` and compare to the vulnerable versions table above. For example a search result that shows `System.ServiceModel.Http/4.0.1` is a reference to v4.0.1 of `System.ServiceModel.Http`.   If your `project.lock.json` file includes references to any of the package versions shown above then you will need to fix the transitive dependencies.\r\n\r\nIf you have not found any reference to a vulnerable version of `System.ServiceModel.Http` this means none of your direct dependencies depend on any vulnerable packages or you have already fixed the problem by updating the direct dependencies.\r\n\r\nIf your transitive dependency review found references to any of the vulnerable packages you must add a direct dependency to the updated package to your `project.json` file to override the transitive dependency. Open your `project.json` and find the dependencies section. For example:\r\n\r\n``` json\r\n  \"dependencies\": {\r\n    \"Microsoft.NETCore.App\": {\r\n      \"version\": \"1.0.1\",\r\n      \"type\": \"platform\"\r\n    },\r\n    \"Microsoft.AspNetCore.Mvc\": \"1.0.0\"\r\n  }\r\n```\r\n\r\nFor each of the vulnerable packages your search returned you must add a direct dependency to the updated version by adding it to the `project.json` file. You do this by adding a new line to the dependencies section, referring the fixed version. For example, if your search showed a transitive reference to the vulnerable `System.ServiceModel.Http` version 1.0.0 you would add a reference to the appropriate fixed version, 1.0.6. Edit the `project.json` file as follows:\r\n\r\n``` json\r\n  \"dependencies\": {\r\n    \"Microsoft.NETCore.App\": {\r\n      \"version\": \"1.0.1\",\r\n      \"type\": \"platform\"\r\n    },\r\n    \"System.ServiceModel.Http\": \"4.1.2\",\r\n    \"Microsoft.AspNetCore.Mvc\": \"1.0.0\"\r\n  }\r\n```\r\n\r\nAfter you have added direct dependencies to the fixed packages, save your `project.json` file.\r\n\r\nIf you are using Visual Studio save your updated `project.json` file and Visual Studio will restore the new package versions. You can see the restore results by opening the Output Window (Ctrl+Alt+O) and changing the Show output from drop-down list to Package Manager.\r\n\r\nIf you are not using Visual Studio open a command line and change to your project directory. Execute the `dotnet restore` command to restore your new dependencies.\r\n\r\n#### Rebuilding your application\r\n\r\nFinally you must rebuild your application, test, and redeploy.\r\n\r\n## Other Information\r\n\r\n### Reporting Security Issues\r\n\r\nIf you have found a potential security issue in .NET Core, please email details to secure@microsoft.com.

Co-location of images improves image discovery. The .NET Core runtime and SDK images are already co-located. We are adding the ASP.NET Core runtime images to the [microsoft/dotnet](https://hub.docker.com/r/microsoft/dotnet/) repo as a third image type.

This advisory also provides guidance on what developers can do to update their applications to remove this vulnerability.\r\n\r\nMicrosoft is aware of a denial of service vulnerability that exists when .NET Framework and .NET Core improperly process XML documents. An attacker who successfully exploited this vulnerability could cause a denial of service against a .NET Framework, .NET Core, or .NET native application.\r\n\r\nThe update addresses the vulnerability by correcting how .NET Framework, .NET Core, and .NET native applications handle XML document processing.\r\n\r\nIf your application is an ASP.NET Core application, developers are also advised to update to [ASP.NET Core 2.0.8](https://www.nuget.org/packages/Microsoft.AspNetCore.All/2.0.8).\r\n\r\n## Discussion\r\n\r\nDiscussion for this issue can be found at https://github.com/dotnet/corefx/issues/29578\r\n\r\n### <a name=\"mitigation-factors\"></a>Mitigation factors\r\n\r\n* If an application does not process signed XML, it is not affected by this vulnerability.\r\n* If your application targets .NET Core 1.x or .NET native 1.x, it is not affected as the vulnerable package is not available for these platforms.\r\n\r\n## <a name=\"affected-software\"></a>Affected software\r\n\r\nAny .NET Core, .NET native, or ASP.NET Core based application that uses System.Security.Cryptography.Xml with a version of 4.4.1 or earlier.\r\n\r\nPackage name | Vulnerable versions | Secure versions\r\n------------ | ---------------- | -------------------------\r\nSystem.Security.Cryptography.Xml | ≤4.4.1 |  4.4.2 or later\r\n\r\n## <a name=\"advisory-faq\"></a>Advisory FAQ\r\n### <a name=\"how-affected\"></a>How do I know if I am affected?\r\n\r\n.NET Core has two types of dependencies: direct and transitive. Direct dependencies are dependencies where you specifically add a package to your project, transitive dependencies occur when you add a package to your project that in turn relies on another package.\r\n\r\nFor example, the `Microsoft.AspNetCore.Mvc` package depends on the `Microsoft.AspNetCore.Mvc.Core` package. When you add a dependency on `Microsoft.AspNetCore.Mvc` in your project, you're taking a transitive dependency on `Microsoft.AspNetCore.Mvc.Core`.\r\n\r\nAny application that has a direct or transitive dependency on the [affected package](#affected-software) can be exposed to the vulnerability if it does not meet any of the [mitigation factors](#mitigation-factors).\r\n\r\n### <a name=\"how-fix\"></a>How do I fix the issue?\r\n---\r\n\r\nIf you're targeting ASP.NET Core 2.0 and using the `Microsoft.AspNetCore.All` metapackage:\r\n\r\n* Update its version number to [2.0.8](https://www.nuget.org/packages/Microsoft.AspNetCore.All/2.0.8) to pull in updated packages that update their transitive dependencies to the fixed version of `System.Security.Cryptography.Xml`.\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n.NET Core projects have two types of dependencies: direct and transitive. You must update your projects using the following instructions to address both types of dependency.\r\n\r\n#### Direct dependencies\r\n\r\nDirect dependencies are discoverable by examining your *csproj* file. They can be fixed by [editing the csproj file](#direct-dependencies) or using NuGet to update the dependency.\r\n\r\n#### Transitive dependencies\r\n\r\nTransitive dependencies occur when you add a package to your project that in turn relies on another package. For example, if Contoso publishes a package `Contoso.Utility` which, in turn, depends on `Contoso.Internals` and you add the `Contoso.Utility` package to your project now your project has a direct dependency on `Contoso.Utility` and, because `Contoso.Utility` depends 'Contoso.Internals', your application gains a transitive dependency on the `Contoso.Internals` package.\r\n\r\nTransitive dependencies are reviewable in two ways:\r\n\r\n* In the Visual Studio Solution Explorer window, which supports searching.\r\n* By examining the *project.assets.json* file contained in the obj directory of your project.\r\n\r\nThe *project.assets.json* files are the authoritative list of all packages used by your project, containing both direct and transitive dependencies.\r\n\r\n#### <a name=\"direct-dependencies\"></a>Fixing direct dependencies\r\n\r\nOpen *projectname.csproj* in your editor. If you're using Visual Studio, right-click the project and choose **Edit projectname.csproj** from the context menu, where projectname is the name of your project. Look for `PackageReference` elements. The following shows an example project file:\r\n\r\n```xml\r\n<Project Sdk=\"Microsoft.NET.Sdk\">\r\n  <PropertyGroup>\r\n    <TargetFramework>netcoreapp2.0</TargetFramework>\r\n  </PropertyGroup>\r\n  <ItemGroup>\r\n    <PackageReference Include=\"System.Security.Cryptography.Xml\" Version=\"4.4.1\" />\r\n  </ItemGroup>\r\n</Project>\r\n```\r\n\r\nThe preceding example has a reference to the [vulnerable package](#affected-software), as seen by the single `PackageReference` element. The name of the package is in the `Include` attribute.\r\nThe package version number is in the `Version` attribute. The previous example shows a single direct dependency on `System.Security.Cryptography.Xml` version 4.4.1.\r\n\r\nTo update the version to the secure package, change the version number to the updated package version as listed on the table [previously](#affected-software).\r\nIn this example, update `System.Security.Cryptography.Xml` to a [fixed package number](#affected-software). Save the *csproj* file. The example *csproj* now looks as follows:\r\n\r\n```xml\r\n<Project Sdk=\"Microsoft.NET.Sdk\">\r\n  <PropertyGroup>\r\n    <TargetFramework>netcoreapp2.0</TargetFramework>\r\n  </PropertyGroup>\r\n  <ItemGroup>\r\n    <PackageReference Include=\"System.Security.Cryptography.Xml\" Version=\"4.4.2\" />\r\n  </ItemGroup>\r\n</Project>\r\n```\r\n\r\nIf you're using Visual Studio and you save your updated *csproj* file, Visual Studio will restore the new package version.\r\nYou can see the restore results by opening the **Output** window (Ctrl+Alt+O) and changing the **Show output from** drop-down list to **Package Manager**.\r\n\r\nIf you're not using Visual Studio, open a command line and change to your project directory. Execute the `dotnet restore` command to restore the updated dependencies.\r\n\r\nNow recompile your application. If after recompilation you see a *Dependency conflict warning*, you must update your other direct dependencies to versions that take a dependency on the updated package.\r\n\r\nAfter you've addressed all of your direct dependencies, you must review your transitive dependencies.\r\n\r\n#### Discovering and fixing transitive dependencies\r\n\r\nThere are two ways to view transitive dependencies. You can either [use Visual Studio’s Solution Explorer](#vs-solution-explorer), or you can [review the *project.assets.json* file](#project-assets-json).\r\n\r\n##### <a name=\"vs-solution-explorer\"></a>Using Visual Studio Solution Explorer\r\n\r\nTo use Solution Explorer, open the project in Visual Studio 2017, and then press Ctrl+; to activate the search in Solution Explorer. Search for the [vulnerable package](#affected-software) and make a note of the version numbers of any results you find.\r\n\r\nFor example, searching for `Microsoft.AspNetCore.Mvc.Core` in an example project that contains a package that takes a dependency on `Microsoft.AspNetCore.Mvc` shows the following results in Visual Studio 2017:\r\n\r\n![Screenshot of search results in Visual Studio 2017](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/796298/25858816/8ecdc2b4-3491-11e7-9363-746804bb9832.png)\r\n\r\nThe search results appear as a tree. In the previous results, you can see that a reference to `Microsoft.AspNetCore.Mvc.Core` version 1.1.2 is discovered.\r\n\r\nUnder the Dependencies node is a NuGet node. Under the NuGet node is the list of packages you have directly taken a dependency on and their versions.\r\nIn screenshot, the application takes a direct dependency on `Microsoft.AspNetCore.Mvc`. `Microsoft.AspNetCore.Mvc` in turn has leaf nodes that list its dependencies and their versions.\r\nThe `Microsoft.AspNetCore.Mvc` package takes a dependency on a version of `Microsoft.AspNetCore.Mvc.ApiExplorer`, that in turn takes a dependency on a version of `Microsoft.AspNetCore.Mvc.Core`.\r\n\r\n##### <a name=\"project-assets-json\"></a>Manually reviewing project.assets.json\r\n\r\nOpen the *project.assets.json* file from your project’s obj directory in your editor. We suggest you use an editor that understands JSON and allows you to collapse and expand nodes to review this file.\r\nVisual Studio and Visual Studio Code provide JSON friendly editing.\r\n\r\nSearch the *project.assets.json* file for the [vulnerable package](#affected-software), using the format `packagename/` for each of the package names from the preceding table. If you find the assembly name in your search:\r\n\r\n* Examine the line on which they are found, the version number is after the `/`.\r\n* Compare to the [vulnerable versions table](#affected-software).\r\n\r\nFor example, a search result that shows `System.Security.Cryptography.Xml/4.4.0` is a reference to version 4.4.0 of `System.Security.Cryptography.Xml`.\r\nIf your *project.assets.json* file includes references to the [vulnerable package](#affected-software), then you need to fix the transitive dependencies.\r\n\r\n##### Fixing transitive dependencies\r\n\r\nIf you have not found any reference to any vulnerable packages, this means either\r\n\r\n* None of your direct dependencies depend on any vulnerable packages, or\r\n* You have already fixed the problem by updating the direct dependencies.\r\n\r\nIf your transitive dependency review found references to the [vulnerable package](#affected-software), you must add a direct dependency to the updated package to your *csproj* file to override the transitive dependency.\r\n\r\nOpen *projectname.csproj* in your editor. If you're using Visual Studio, right-click the project and choose **Edit projectname.csproj** from the context menu, where projectname is the name of your project.\r\nLook for `PackageReference` nodes, for example:\r\n\r\n```xml\r\n<Project Sdk=\"Microsoft.NET.Sdk.\">\r\n  <PropertyGroup>\r\n    <TargetFramework>net461</TargetFramework>\r\n  </PropertyGroup>\r\n  <ItemGroup>\r\n    <PackageReference Include=\"ThirdParty.NotUpdatedYet\" Version=\"2.0.0\" />\r\n  </ItemGroup>\r\n</Project>\r\n```\r\n\r\nYou must add a direct dependency to the updated version of the [vulnerable package](#affected-software) by adding it to the *csproj* file.\r\nYou do this by adding a new line to the dependencies section, referencing the fixed version.\r\nFor example, if your search showed a transitive reference to a vulnerable `System.Security.Cryptography.Xml` version, you'd add a reference to the [fixed package number](#affected-software).\r\n\r\n```xml\r\n<Project Sdk=\"Microsoft.NET.Sdk.Web\">\r\n  <PropertyGroup>\r\n    <TargetFramework>net461</TargetFramework>\r\n  </PropertyGroup>\r\n  <ItemGroup>\r\n    <PackageReference Include=\"System.Security.Cryptography.Xml\" Version=\"4.4.2\" />\r\n    <PackageReference Include=\"ThirdParty.NotUpdatedYet\" Version=\"2.0.0\" />\r\n  </ItemGroup>\r\n</Project>\r\n```\r\n\r\nAfter you've added the direct dependency reference, save your *csproj* file.\r\n\r\nIf you're using Visual Studio, save your updated *csproj* file and Visual Studio will restore the new package versions.\r\nYou can see the restore results by opening the **Output** window (Ctrl+Alt+O) and changing the **Show output from** drop-down list to **Package Manager**.\r\n\r\nIf you're not using Visual Studio, open a command line and change to your project directory. Execute the `dotnet restore` command to restore the new dependencies.\r\n\r\n#### Rebuilding your application\r\n\r\nFinally you must rebuild your application, test, and redeploy.\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\nIf you're targeting .NET native for a Universal Windows Platform (UWP) application, you should update your dependencies and republish your application.\r\n\r\nIf you submit an application to the Windows Store with an outdated reference, the store will update the reference automatically, which has the potential for compatibility issues. Thus, we recommend updating your application directly and testing its functionality before resubmitting.\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n## Other Information\r\n\r\n### Reporting Security Issues\r\n\r\nIf you have found a potential security issue in .NET Core, please email details to secure@microsoft.com.
