But there are some need to consider:\r\n1. It affects every single Vue instance created, including third party components.\r\n2. the same named data or method cannot be used for children under 2 separated parents\r\n\r\n`props`, vuex or listeners are not good practice for really big project which has 30 nested components.\r\nwe need to pass the same data over and over between components.\r\n\r\nIf there would be something like 'global' mixin (just global in one component and its children, grandchildren,...), and when we add it to a single component, we could use it its any level children.\r\n\r\n### What does the proposed API look like?\r\nI am not sure about how API look like.\r\nthere is an [example](http://jsfiddle.net/mudin/zg0x2t35/25/)\r\n\r\nJS:\r\n`````\r\nclass User {\r\n\tconstructor(name){\r\n  \tthis.name = name;\r\n  }\r\n}\r\n\r\n// Mixins\r\nlet mixin1 = {\r\n  data: function() {\r\n    return {\r\n      user: new User('user1')\r\n    }\r\n  },\r\n}\r\n\r\nlet mixin2 = {\r\n  data: function() {\r\n    return {\r\n      user: new User('user2'),\r\n      msg: \"this is user2's mixin\"\r\n    }\r\n  }\r\n}\r\n\r\n// Child1 component\r\nVue.component('Child1', {\r\n  template: '#child1'\r\n});\r\n\r\n// Child2 component\r\nVue.component('Child2', {\r\n  template: '#child2'\r\n});\r\n\r\n// 2nd parent component\r\nVue.component('Parent2', {\r\n  template: '#parent2',\r\n  mixins:[mixin2]\r\n});\r\n\r\n// 1st parent component\r\nVue.component('Parent1', {\r\n  template: '#parent1',\r\n  mixins:[mixin1]\r\n});\r\n\r\n\r\n// Initialize Vue\r\nnew Vue({\r\n  el: '#app'\r\n})\r\n\r\n`````\r\n\r\nHTML:\r\n`````\r\n<!-- parent1 Template -->\r\n<template id=\"parent1\">\r\n  <div  style=\"background:green\">\r\n    I am parent1 <br>\r\n    username: {{user.name}}<br>\r\n    msg: {{msg}}\r\n    <p style=\"margin:10px\">\r\n      <parent2></parent2>\r\n      <child2></child2>\r\n    </p>\r\n  </div>\r\n</template>\r\n\r\n<!-- parent2 Template -->\r\n<template id=\"parent2\">\r\n  <div style=\"background:blue\">\r\n    I am parent2 <br>\r\n    username: {{user.name}}<br>\r\n    msg: {{msg}}\r\n    <pre>\r\n      <child1></child1>\r\n    </pre>\r\n  </div>\r\n</template>\r\n\r\n<!-- child1 Template -->\r\n<template id=\"child1\">\r\n  <div  style=\"background:white\">\r\n    I am child 1 <br>\r\n    username: {{user}}<br>\r\n    msg: {{msg}}\r\n  </div>\r\n</template>\r\n\r\n<!-- child2 Template -->\r\n<template id=\"child2\">\r\n  <div  style=\"background:yellow\">\r\n    I am child 2 <br>\r\n    username: {{user}}<br>\r\n    msg: {{msg}}\r\n  </div>\r\n</template>\r\n\r\n<!-- ------------------- -->\r\n\r\n<div class=\"container\">\r\n  <div id=\"app\">\r\n    <parent1 />\r\n    <parent2 />\r\n  </div>\r\n</div>\r\n\r\n`````\r\n\r\nin any component under `parent1` or `parent2` components,  data `user`, `msg`, .. should be accessible without updating the component code.\r\n\r\nThank you\r\n\r\n<!-- generated by vue-issues.

The class would be removed on leave.\r\n\r\nThe other option would be to create a new prop `active-class=\"classname\"` which is added one frame after insertion, and removed when the leave transition is to start (basically rolling the `enter-to-class` and `leave-class` into one prop)\r\n\r\n<!-- generated by vue-issues.

I have created an application with a large number of components and modules and therefore a large number of namespaced getters.

This is overkill for ssr performance and is being flagged as a CPU consuming process in the node profiler. \r\nI have managed to double the number of requests per second my ssr app can handle just by using memoization on the gettersProxy object creation. I think this is really impacting performance.\r\n\r\n### What is expected?\r\nNamespaced getters invokation not to be inefficient with large numbers of getters/modules\r\n\r\n### What is actually happening?\r\nA lot of hits to makeLocalGetters making performance go down\r\n\r\n<!-- generated by vue-issues.

Plugins _alter_ an existing store / module, modules provide some completed state based functionality. \r\n\r\nTherefore it can often be the case where a reusable and freely distributed module is desirable (e.g. to include in multiple projects or multiple component libraries). \r\n\r\nAt the moment Vuex's documentation strikes a surprising balance of brevity and coverage (although in my opinion plugins could use some more expansion). However, the mention of how to make and distribute vuex modules is completely absent. \r\n\r\nSince Vue and the Vue ecosystem has lowered the barrier to entry to web development, not using Vue has complete coverage of the nuances of JavaScript and the many core libraries that help it work on the web (e.g. Babel)\r\n\r\nThus it would be relevant and beneficial to provide a complete example (even if it is minimal) of how to make a truly reusable module.\r\n\r\n\r\n### What does the proposed API look like?\r\nI would consider something simplistic (e.g. the counter app). However, I would suggest 2  modifications:\r\n\r\n1. an async / await version (as this can cause trouble with bundling)\r\n2. a typescript variant\r\n\r\n```js\r\n// reusable module\r\n\r\nconst state = () => ({\r\n  count: 0,\r\n  delay: 500\r\n})\r\n\r\nconst getters = {\r\n\r\n}\r\n\r\nconst actions = {\r\n  async updateCount({state, commit}, byHowMuch) {\r\n    let newCount = await setTimeout( () => state.count   byHowMuch, state.delay)\r\n    commit('setCount', newCount)\r\n  }\r\n}\r\n\r\nconst mutations = {\r\n  setCount(state, amount) {\r\n    state.count = amount\r\n  }\r\n}\r\n\r\n\r\nexport {namespaced:true, state, mutations, actions, getters}\r\n```\r\n\r\n\r\nthen provide the configuration file for how to use rollup and deploy to npm / yarn \r\n\r\n\r\nthen provide how to incorporate with nuxt\r\n\r\n\r\n```\r\n// <nuxt-project>/store/AsyncCountModule/index.js\r\nimport AsyncCountModule from 'AsyncCountModule'\r\n\r\nexport AsyncCountModule //<-- this doesnt work \r\n```\r\n\r\n<!-- generated by vue-issues.
