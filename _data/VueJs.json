This means that there can be changes in the state tree that are impossible for plugins to know about through the existing subscription methods like `subscribe` and `subscribeAction`. A common use case would be a plugin that saves the Vuex state to local storage.

One could take the module, register it and (re)make components to utilize the vuex module as desired.
