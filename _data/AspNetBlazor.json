However, to me it's very unfortunate, that a Blazor project is so tightly integrated into it's ASP-like infrastructure, as well as Razor templates.\n\nIt would be nice to have a stripped-down version of Blazor (something like Console App template for .NET Core) which looks like a Rust STDWEB project and allows to either create a wasm library, which can be integrated via the generated convenience .js file, or avoid everything else all together, allowing your program main function to be an entry point to the whole app, allowing access to HTML5 apis.\n\nIn my opinion, such a template will allow to greatly increase the amount of use cases for Blazor and C# as a web language all together.\n\nFurther integration with bundlers like Parcel will allow to make lightweight mixed projects possible.\n\nHowever, maybe I am missing something and there is an undocumented way of using CoreRT or Mono tools to do it. If that's true, I will strongly ask to provide some information.
