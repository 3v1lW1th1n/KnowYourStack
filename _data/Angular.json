In some scenarios this order might be important (for example with `ngModelChange` and `input` listeners), so this commit updates the logic to put new listeners at the end of the list. In order to avoid performance implications, we keep a pointer to the last listener in the list, so adding a new listener takes constant amount of time.\r\n\r\nThis PR resolves FW-1528.\r\n\r\n\r\n## PR Type\r\nWhat kind of change does this PR introduce?\r\n\r\n- [x] Bugfix\r\n\r\n\r\n## Does this PR introduce a breaking change?\r\n\r\n- [ ] Yes\r\n- [x] No","Url":"https://github.com/angular/angular/pull/32484","RelatedDescription":"Open PR \"fix(ivy): maintain coalesced listeners order\" (#32484)"},{"Id":"489437625","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2019-09-04T22:41:00","Actor":"kyliau","Number":"32483","RawContent":null,"Title":"fix(language-service): use tsLSHost to do module resolution","State":"open","Body":"This is a patch PR for https://github.com/angular/angular/pull/32479\r\n\r\nThis PR fixes a critical performance issue where the language\r\nservice makes a MASSIVE number of filesystem calls when performing\r\nmodule resolution.\r\nThis is because there is no caching.

This greatly simplifies property binding metadata retrieval (we just need to look it up at one index) and lets us to remove chunks of code / logic (`getFirstBindingIndex ` can go away). Also regular and host binding properties gets unified (`collectHostPropertyBindings` can be removed). \r\n\r\nTo know where property bindings are located for a given `TNode` we can remove 2 fields from `TNode` (`propertyMetadataStartIndex ` / `propertyMetadataEndIndex `) and replace it with just one  (`propertyBindings`) filled in the `ngDevMode` only.\r\n\r\nFinally, property binding metadata are stored for properties only and there is no processing for attribute bindings.\r\n\r\nI believe that this refactoring removes code, simplifies logic and opens up possibilities of other refactorings (perf-motivated goal here is to get rid of the `bind` function).\r\n","Url":"https://github.com/angular/angular/pull/32457","RelatedDescription":"Closed or merged PR \"refactor(ivy): simplify property binding metadata\" (#32457)"},{"Id":"488690413","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2019-09-04T18:36:11","Actor":"mircowidmer","Number":"32459","RawContent":null,"Title":"docs: fix typo in structural directive example","State":"closed","Body":"Fixes #32458\r\n\r\n## PR Checklist\r\nPlease check if your PR fulfills the following requirements:\r\n\r\n- [x] The commit message follows our guidelines: https://github.com/angular/angular/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md#commit\r\n- [x] Docs have been added / updated (for bug fixes / features)\r\n\r\n\r\n## PR Type\r\nWhat kind of change does this PR introduce?\r\n\r\n<!-- Please check the one that applies to this PR using \"x\". -->\r\n\r\n- [ ] Bugfix\r\n- [ ] Feature\r\n- [ ] Code style update (formatting, local variables)\r\n- [ ] Refactoring (no functional changes, no api changes)\r\n- [ ] Build related changes\r\n- [ ] CI related changes\r\n- [x] Documentation content changes\r\n- [ ] angular.io application / infrastructure changes\r\n- [ ] Other...

I expected this behaviour because I'm not using the router to navigate.  \r\n\r\nHowever, using the browser forward/back buttons after this **does** register query changes. The same happens when calling `location.go` twice before using the browser buttons.\r\n\r\nI can understand the routing may be needed because you could use the history to navigate to a different page, but then I'd expect the same behaviour on the first entry (on the first location push and the first back press).  \r\n\r\nIn my use case, I am trying to catch the pop state manually when within the same page. This works nicely for every entry added, but the inconsistent behaviour of the router is getting in the way.

That missing `/` at the end is a very important difference.\r\n\r\nSo the real problem here is that back in Angular 7.1.3 my e2e were passing while making use of the `baseHref` build flag and now they are not in latest Angular 8 version. The reason why they are not passing is because `await browser.get('connect');` should navigate to `http://localhost:4200/ext/connect` but instead it is trying to navigate to `http://localhost:4200/connect`. This is because the `browser.baseUrl` is `http://localhost:4200/ext` and if you go into the [code of Protractor](https://github.com/angular/protractor/blob/5.4.1/lib/browser.ts#L859) you will see that it uses `browser.baseUrl` with the `url.resolve(...)` method. And `url.resolve('http://localhost:4200/ext', 'connect');` returns `'http://localhost:4200/connect'`.\r\n\r\nNote: my Angular.json build has this for the baseHref: `\"baseHref\": \"/ext/\"`\r\n\r\n\r\n## 🔬 Minimal Reproduction\r\n<!--\r\nSimple steps to reproduce this bug.\r\n\r\nPlease include: commands run (including args), packages added, related code changes.\r\n\r\nIf reproduction steps are not enough for reproduction of your issue, please create a minimal GitHub repository with the reproduction of the issue. \r\nA good way to make a minimal reproduction is to create a new app via `ng new repro-app` and add the minimum possible code to show the problem. \r\nShare the link to the repo below along with step-by-step instructions to reproduce the problem, as well as expected and actual behavior.\r\n\r\nIssues that don't have enough info and can't be reproduced will be closed.\r\n\r\nYou can read more about issue submission guidelines here: https://github.com/angular/angular-cli/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md#-submitting-an-issue\r\n-->\r\n1. Create a new Angular 8 project\r\n2. Modify the angular.json file so that the basic build option uses a `baseHref` of `/ext/`\r\n3. Add routes, pages, and components so that `http://localhost:4200/ext/connect` is a valid page\r\n4. Update `app.po.ts`'s `navigateTo()` method so that you use `return brwoser.get('connect');`\r\n5. Run `ng e2e`\r\n6. Observe that you get a 404 error because it tries to navigate to `http://localhost:4200/connect` instead of `http://localhost:4200/ext/connect`\r\n\r\n\r\n## 🌍 Your Environment\r\n<pre><code>\r\n<!-- run `ng version` and paste output below -->\r\n<!-- ✍️-->\r\n\r\n     _                      _                 ____ _     ___\r\n    / \\   _ __   __ _ _   _| | __ _ _ __     / ___| |   |_ _|\r\n   / △ \\ | '_ \\ / _` | | | | |/ _` | '__|   | |   | |    | |\r\n  / ___ \\| | | | (_| | |_| | | (_| | |      | |___| |___ | |\r\n /_/   \\_\\_| |_|\\__, |\\__,_|_|\\__,_|_|       \\____|_____|___|\r\n                |___/\r\n    \r\n\r\nAngular CLI: 8.3.2\r\nNode: 10.16.0\r\nOS: linux x64\r\nAngular: 8.2.4\r\n... animations, common, compiler, compiler-cli, core, forms\r\n... language-service, platform-browser, platform-browser-dynamic\r\n... router\r\n\r\nPackage                            Version\r\n------------------------------------------------------------\r\n@angular-devkit/architect          0.803.2\r\n@angular-devkit/build-angular      0.803.2\r\n@angular-devkit/build-optimizer    0.803.2\r\n@angular-devkit/build-webpack      0.803.2\r\n@angular-devkit/core               8.3.2\r\n@angular-devkit/schematics         8.3.2\r\n@angular/cdk                       8.1.4\r\n@angular/cli                       8.3.2\r\n@angular/flex-layout               8.0.0-beta.27\r\n@angular/material                  8.1.4\r\n@angular/material-moment-adapter   8.1.4\r\n@ngtools/webpack                   8.3.2\r\n@schematics/angular                8.3.2\r\n@schematics/update                 0.803.2\r\nrxjs                               6.5.2\r\ntypescript                         3.5.3\r\nwebpack                            4.39.2\r\n</code></pre>\r\n","Url":"https://github.com/angular/angular-cli/issues/15522","RelatedDescription":"Open issue \"ng e2e - Protractor's browser.baseUrl Doesn't Match baseHref Build Option Anymore\" (#15522)"},{"Id":"488746797","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2019-09-04T18:57:41","Actor":"alan-agius4","Number":"15512","RawContent":null,"Title":"fix(@angular-devkit/build-angular): fix permission errors for ES5 bu…","State":"closed","Body":"…ndles\r\n\r\ncopyFilesSync will also copy permissions which may result in permissions errors.\r\n\r\nCloses #15490","Url":"https://github.com/angular/angular-cli/pull/15512","RelatedDescription":"Closed or merged PR \"fix(@angular-devkit/build-angular): fix permission errors for ES5 bu…\" (#15512)"},{"Id":"489228950","IsPullRequest":false,"CreatedAt":"2019-09-04T15:20:00","Actor":"nickykapur","Number":"15521","RawContent":null,"Title":"Compile production copy with different themes, depending on parameter","State":"open","Body":"<!--🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅\r\n\r\nOh hi there! 😄\r\n\r\nTo expedite issue processing please search open and closed issues before submitting a new one.\r\nExisting issues often contain information about workarounds, resolution, or progress updates.\r\n\r\n🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅-->\r\n\r\n\r\n# 🚀 Feature request\r\n\r\n\r\n### Command (mark with an `x`)\r\n<!-- Can you pin-point the command or commands that are relevant for this feature request? -->\r\n<!-- ✍️edit: -->\r\n```\r\n- [ ] new\r\n- [x] build\r\n- [x] serve\r\n- [ ] test\r\n- [ ] e2e\r\n- [ ] generate\r\n- [ ] add\r\n- [ ] update\r\n- [ ] lint\r\n- [ ] xi18n\r\n- [ ] run\r\n- [ ] config\r\n- [ ] help\r\n- [ ] version\r\n- [ ] doc\r\n```\r\n\r\n### Description\r\n<!-- ✍️--> the problem is, that there should be a way to send parameters to the build, serve command to know which themes to use when building a pack for production.\r\n\r\n### Describe the solution you'd like\r\n<!-- ✍️--> It would be nice the common CSS file should be able to support multiple css files, and while building the application ng build .. --prod [ParameterA or ParameterB or ...], not only for CSS even for specific images or logos on the site.\r\n\r\ndepending the parameter it will build with a different CSS file.

Run `ng build --prod`.\r\n4. Go into the `dist` directory and open the `vendor` bundle file. It should be called something like `vendor-es5.e7633243d6659fd2e6e7.js`.\r\n5. Prettify the file so it's more readable.\r\n\r\nAt this point try doing a code search for `ng:///`. You should get some code that looks like this:\r\n\r\n```js\r\nObject.defineProperty(t, ie, {\r\nconfigurable: !0,\r\nget: function () {\r\n    return null === i && (i = It().compileNgModule(_p, \"ng:///\" + t.name + \"/ngModuleDef.js\", {\r\n    type: t,\r\n    bootstrap: qt(e.bootstrap || bp).map(gt),\r\n    declarations: r.map(gt),\r\n    imports: qt(e.imports || bp).map(gt).map(Sp),\r\n    exports: qt(e.exports || bp).map(gt).map(Sp),\r\n    emitInline: !0,\r\n    schemas: e.schemas ? qt(e.schemas) : null,\r\n    id: e.id || null\r\n    })), i\r\n}\r\n});\r\n```\r\n\r\nSince the code is mangled it's a little hard to tell, but these `ng:///` strings come from some JIT-specific code in `@angular/core` that is originally here: https://github.com/angular/angular/blob/master/packages/core/src/render3/jit/directive.ts#L108. This code is only relevant in JIT mode and it shouldn't be in the AOT-compiled production bundle. \r\n\r\nTo illustrate the point that the `vendorChunk` option is causing the code to be retained, you can turn off the `vendorChunk` flag in the `angular.json`, run the build again and observe that the code isn't there anymore.\r\n\r\nAlso this project was created by running `ng new` and then changing the `vendorChunk` option in the `angular.json`.\r\n\r\n## 🌍 Your Environment\r\n<pre><code>\r\n@angular-devkit/architect         0.900.0-next.2\r\n@angular-devkit/build-angular     0.900.0-next.2\r\n@angular-devkit/build-optimizer   0.900.0-next.2\r\n@angular-devkit/build-webpack     0.900.0-next.2\r\n@angular-devkit/core              9.0.0-next.2\r\n@angular-devkit/schematics        9.0.0-next.2\r\n@angular/cli                      9.0.0-next.2\r\n@ngtools/webpack                  9.0.0-next.2\r\n@schematics/angular               9.0.0-next.2\r\n@schematics/update                0.900.0-next.2\r\nrxjs                              6.4.0\r\ntypescript                        3.5.3\r\nwebpack                           4.39.3\r\n\r\n</code></pre>\r\n\r\n","Url":"https://github.com/angular/angular-cli/issues/15505","RelatedDescription":"Open issue \"JIT code not being tree shaken with Ivy and a vendor chunk\" (#15505)"},{"Id":"488175716","IsPullRequest":false,"CreatedAt":"2019-09-02T12:52:28","Actor":"rcarjan","Number":"15504","RawContent":null,"Title":"Libraries / modules not loaded when editing component template","State":"open","Body":"<!--🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅\r\n\r\nOh hi there! 😄\r\n\r\nTo expedite issue processing please search open and closed issues before submitting a new one.\r\nExisting issues often contain information about workarounds, resolution, or progress updates.\r\n\r\n🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅-->\r\n\r\n\r\n# 🐞 Bug report\r\n\r\n### Command (mark with an `x`)\r\n```\r\n- [ ] new\r\n- [ ] build\r\n- [x] serve\r\n- [ ] test\r\n- [ ] e2e\r\n- [ ] generate\r\n- [ ] add\r\n- [ ] update\r\n- [ ] lint\r\n- [ ] xi18n\r\n- [ ] run\r\n- [ ] config\r\n- [ ] help\r\n- [ ] version\r\n- [ ] doc\r\n```\r\n\r\n### Is this a regression?\r\n\r\nNo (not sure?)\r\n\r\n\r\n### Description\r\n\r\nHello,\r\nI am having an issue when editing a component inside my project.
