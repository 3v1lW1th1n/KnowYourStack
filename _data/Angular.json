There is no way to actually grab the HTML inside ng-content with ALL events, nothing stripped.  This is a missing feature.  There is nowhere in angular to grab the content, change/modify it and then dump it back into a different element.  \r\n\r\nWhen using a component with ng-content in the template, there is no way to grab the actual templated HTML from the child component.  I can retrieve the angular-event stripped HTML but that does not help me.\r\n\r\nExample: Collapse Table\r\n\r\nCollapse Table Component\r\n`selector: 'collapse-table'`\r\n\r\nCollapse Table HTML Template\r\n```\r\n<table #tableContent>\r\n    <ng-content></ng-content>\r\n</table>\r\n```\r\n\r\nUsage: \r\n\r\n```\r\n<collapse-table>\r\n    <thead>\r\n        <tr>\r\n            <th>Test</th>\r\n        </tr>\r\n    </thead>\r\n    <tbody>\r\n        <tr *ngFor=\"let item of items\">\r\n            <td (click)=\"test()\">{{item.test}}</td>\r\n        </tr>\r\n    </tbody>\r\n</collapse-table>\r\n```\r\n\r\nInside Collapse Table Component I am using a @ViewChild and grabbing tableContent.  The innerHtml of tableContent strips out the (click)=\"test()\" event, which I need!

Every language is served under a different path, e.g.:\r\n```\r\nhttps://coolapp.com/en/\r\nhttps://coolapp.com/de/\r\n```\r\nWhen changing the language both service workers do collide in their responsibility, as both match their pattern: \r\n```\r\n    {\r\n      \"positive\": true,\r\n      \"regex\": \"^\\\\/.*$\"\r\n    }\r\n```\r\nand want to serve their `index.html`. By scoping them to their respective location on the server they do not collide anymore. \r\n\r\n### Workaround (nasty)\r\nDefine different `\"ngswConfigPath\": \"src/ngsw-config.json\"` (full duplicates) in your `angular.json` for each environment and specify the `navigationUrls` accordingly:\r\n```\r\n\"navigationUrls\": [\r\n    \"/de/**\",\r\n    \"!/**/*.*\",\r\n    \"! /**/*__*\",\r\n    \"! /**/*__*/**\"\r\n  ]\r\n```","Url":"https://github.com/angular/angular-cli/issues/13368","RelatedDescription":"Open issue \"ServiceWorker: Standard NavigationUrls do not respect baseHref\" (#13368)"},{"Id":"395789182","IsPullRequest":false,"CreatedAt":"2019-01-04T08:23:41","Actor":"whoopnip","Number":"13364","RawContent":null,"Title":"assets not included in build or serve on one machine but works fine on another","State":"closed","Body":"<!--\r\nIF YOU DON'T FILL OUT THE FOLLOWING INFORMATION YOUR ISSUE MIGHT BE CLOSED WITHOUT INVESTIGATING\r\n-->\r\n### Bug Report or Feature Request (mark with an `x`)\r\n```\r\n- [x] bug report -> please search issues before submitting\r\n- [ ] feature request\r\n```\r\n\r\n### Command (mark with an `x`)\r\n```\r\n- [ ] new\r\n- [x] build\r\n- [x] serve\r\n- [ ] test\r\n- [ ] e2e\r\n- [ ] generate\r\n- [ ] add\r\n- [ ] update\r\n- [ ] lint\r\n- [ ] xi18n\r\n- [ ] run\r\n- [ ] config\r\n- [ ] help\r\n- [ ] version\r\n- [ ] doc\r\n```\r\n\r\n### Versions\r\n<!--\r\nOutput from: `node --version`, `npm --version` and `ng --version`.\r\n  Windows (7/8/10).

Modern browsers are being optimized for ES6 now. ES5 is no longer necessary or optimal.\r\n2. Smaller generated code files.\r\n3.
