Using watchers is sufficient only for a single property in `v-show`, but it's cumbersome when the condition is like `v-show=\"a < 1 && !b || c > 2\"`. So I propose to add a new pair of lifecycle hooks (events): `shown` and `hidden`.\r\n\r\n### What does the proposed API look like?\r\n```\r\nshown() {\r\n    console.log('The component is shown')\r\n}\r\nhidden() {\r\n    console.log('The component is hidden')\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\n<!-- generated by vue-issues.
