There is no use of discards or pattern matching and all those new feature that makes the code cleaner and more efficient. I would start with PresentationCore because I think it is the oldest project.\r\n\r\nHere are the things I would change in PresentationCore:\r\n- Use discards with unused out parameter.\r\n- Use pattern matching instead of \"as\" and then null check.\r\n- Use Null-conditional operators instead of null check and then calling the method.\r\n- Replace literal string parameter name with nameof(parameter).\r\n- And other cleanup which is a case per case.\r\n\r\nThere wouldn't be any breaking change because it's only cleanup.\r\n\r\nI would like to do this cleanup in PresentationCore as my first issue. I know cleanup is probably not in your priorities which is why I would like to do this and it's very easy to review because it's not suppose to change the behavior of the code.

That presenter creates a ContentPresenter for each child.\r\n\r\nWhen the content of the cell is another UIElement, however, the automation tree has two elements for each cell (one for the ContentPresenter and one for the contained UIElement). This causes problems with navigation using caps+arrows (you stop at the ContentPresenter before navigating to the UIElement) and with some (cough, Narrator) screen readers that read out the ContentPresenter as \"Custom\".\r\n\r\nThere should be a way to have the automation peers of the GridViewRowPresenter skip the ContentPresenters of cells that have a UIElement as their content (for example, provide a way to specify the AutomationPeers of the content created using a FrameworkElementFactory).\r\n\r\nSee the following source for code that replicates the problem.\r\n     public partial class MainWindow : Window\r\n    {\r\n        private readonly ObservableCollection<RowViewModel> _source;\r\n\r\n        public MainWindow()\r\n        {\r\n            InitializeComponent();\r\n\r\n            _source = new ObservableCollection<RowViewModel>();\r\n            this.View.ItemsSource = _source;\r\n\r\n            GridView grid = this.View.View as GridView;\r\n            grid.Columns.Add(CreateGridViewColumn(100.0, \"Alpha\", 5.0));\r\n            grid.Columns.Add(CreateGridViewColumn(100.0, \"Beta\", 5.0));\r\n            grid.Columns.Add(CreateGridViewColumn(100.0, \"Gamma\", 5.0));\r\n\r\n            _source.Add(new RowViewModel(1));\r\n            _source.Add(new RowViewModel(2));\r\n            _source.Add(new RowViewModel(3));\r\n        }\r\n\r\n        private GridViewColumn CreateGridViewColumn(double width, string name, double padding)\r\n        {\r\n            GridViewColumn column = new GridViewColumn();\r\n            column.Width = width + padding;\r\n            column.Header = name;\r\n            column.CellTemplate = MainWindow.CreateItemDataTemplate(name);\r\n\r\n            return column;\r\n        }\r\n\r\n\r\n        private static DataTemplate CreateItemDataTemplate(string columnName)\r\n        {\r\n            var template = new DataTemplate();\r\n\r\n            FrameworkElementFactory factory = new FrameworkElementFactory(typeof(ContentPresenter));\r\n            factory.SetBinding(ContentPresenter.ContentProperty, new Binding(string.Format(CultureInfo.InvariantCulture, \"[{0}]\", columnName)));\r\n\r\n            template.VisualTree = factory;\r\n\r\n            return template;\r\n        }\r\n    }\r\n\r\n    class RowViewModel\r\n    {\r\n        private readonly string _id;\r\n        private readonly Dictionary<string, object> _rowMap = new Dictionary<string, object>();\r\n\r\n        public RowViewModel(int id)\r\n        {\r\n            _id = id.ToString();\r\n        }\r\n\r\n        public object this[string columnName]\r\n        {\r\n            get\r\n            {\r\n                if (!_rowMap.TryGetValue(columnName, out object value))\r\n                {\r\n                    value = new TextBlock() { Text = columnName + _id };\r\n                }\r\n                return value;\r\n            }\r\n        }\r\n    }\r\n","Url":"https://github.com/dotnet/wpf/issues/2212","RelatedDescription":"Open issue \"ContentPresenters created by GridViewRowPresenters are visible to automation\" (#2212)"},{"Id":"524362845","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2019-11-19T13:48:33","Actor":"dotnet-maestro[bot]","Number":"2200","RawContent":null,"Title":"[master] Update dependencies from dnceng/internal/dotnet-wpf-int","State":"closed","Body":"This pull request updates the following dependencies\r\n\r\n[marker]: <> (Begin:46a15fe4-6c2c-480d-9cdd-08d71053b252)\r\n## From https://dev.azure.com/dnceng/internal/_git/dotnet-wpf-int\r\n- **Build**: 20191118.21\r\n- **Date Produced**: 11/19/2019 2:20 AM\r\n- **Commit**: f53863434c8067a1053c38453de0d438cca08028\r\n- **Branch**: refs/heads/master\r\n- **Updates**:\r\n  -
