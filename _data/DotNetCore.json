This change makes the padding consistent and fixes `build wasm release`.  To be honest it seems arbitrary anyway for longs/doubles as the shadow stack passed into the frame is not 8 byte aligned.  I did a bit of investigation and it seems that it's possible that aligning 8 byte values at 8 byte boundaries can give a performance increase for Wasm depending on the rest of the tooling and the Wasm runtime.  So I've left the 8 byte padding logic in there so that at some point it will be easier to align with real addresses.\r\n\r\nCleaned up some unused variables and out parameters.

So... as in title - it extends current `dotnet CLI` with `dotnet add file`. \r\n\r\nThis feature is probably mostly useful for F# developers - in C# users can use globbing, but in F# order of files in project matters - so we specify every `.fs` file separately in the project file. Having this feature will be also great for better editor integration - VSCode (with Ionide) is used by a huge part of the F# community and we provide \"solution explorer\" view in the editor but we need good commands to add files and/or move the up-down (again the order of files matters) - we currently provide that functionality using a custom utility (https://github.com/ionide/Forge) but... well, let's just say it's not my best work ever. \r\n\r\nSo there's a couple of things to discuss here:\r\n - would you be open to having such a feature?\r\n - how to determine default location of the file (probably on top of the group, current implementation adds it adds the bottom)\r\n - should it have something like `--above` and `--below` options that would allow specifying a location of the file (it's a common scenario to say \"I want to add helpers.fs above my_test.fs\")\r\n - should it allow not only adding but also moving files (changing the order of files and moving files up/down) is another common scenario during the development of F# projects\r\n\r\nCC: @cartermp \r\n\r\nP.S. the changes includes all generated translation files, please let me know if they shouldn't be included in PR - there's no contribution guide in the repo that would specify such details

A FuncEval may time out on entering the lock if for example it calls a virtual or interface method for the first time. Failing the FuncEval when the lock is held enables the debugger to fall back to other options for expression evaluation.\r\n- Also added polls for debugger suspension before acquiring the slot backpatching lock on background threads that often operate in preemptive GC mode. A common case in master is when the debugger breaks while the tiering delay timer is active, the timer ticks shortly afterwards (after debugger suspension completes) and if a thread pool thread is already available, the background thread would block while holding the lock. This is less common in 3.1 because the callback pulses the GC mode at the beginning, but still may occur occasionally. The poll checks for debugger suspension and pulses the GC mode to block before acquiring the lock.\r\n\r\n### Customer impact\r\n\r\n- This is a top feedback item for VS on 3.x: [feedback ticket](https://developercommunity.visualstudio.com/content/problem/855101/to-prevent-an-unsafe-abort-popup-appears-often-in.html)\r\n\r\n### Regression?\r\n\r\nYes, regression from 2.x, starting in 3.0\r\n\r\n### Testing\r\n\r\n- It's a timing issue and was reproduced by inducing specific timings in various phases of tiering\r\n- Verified that the timeout does not occur after the fix in the vast majority of cases.

Since the lock is acquired in preemptive GC mode, it is still possible that after the check at the start of a FuncEval, another thread acquires the lock and the FuncEval may time out. The polling makes it less likely for the lock to be taken by background tiering work, for example if a FuncEval starts while rejitting a method.\r\n- The expression evaluation experience may be worse when it is detected that the lock is held, and may still happen from unfortunate timing\r\n- Low risk for the change itself\r\n\r\nPort of https://github.com/dotnet/runtime/pull/2380\r\nFix for https://github.com/dotnet/runtime/issues/1537","Url":"https://github.com/dotnet/coreclr/pull/28006","RelatedDescription":"Closed or merged PR \"[3.1] Fail FuncEval if slot backpatching lock is held by any thread\" (#28006)"},{"Id":"564203743","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2020-02-18T21:32:58","Actor":"GrabYourPitchforks","Number":"28014","RawContent":null,"Title":"[release/3.1] Port dotnet/runtime#31946 fix for string.Replace infinite loop","State":"closed","Body":"Issue https://github.com/dotnet/runtime/issues/1060 reports that in a linguistic (non-ordinal) call to `string.Replace`, if the target string contains code points with zero collation weight, the `string.Replace` logic can enter an infinite loop.\r\n\r\nThis has already been fixed in .NET 5 (see https://github.com/dotnet/runtime/pull/31946).

Not a functional regression.\r\n\r\n## Testing\r\nFix has been perf tested (see https://github.com/dotnet/runtime/pull/31904#issuecomment-584190637) and fuzzed (see https://github.com/dotnet/runtime/pull/31904#issuecomment-583706262).\r\n\r\n## Risk\r\nLow. No functional changes; only performance changes. We have excellent unit test coverage and fuzzer coverage over this code.\r\n\r\n## Code Reviewer\r\n@tannergooding","Url":"https://github.com/dotnet/coreclr/pull/28013","RelatedDescription":"Closed or merged PR \"[release/3.1] Port dotnet/runtime#31904 fix for slow UTF-8 transcoding performance\" (#28013)"},{"Id":"562935739","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2020-02-14T17:49:00","Actor":"sdmaclea","Number":"28011","RawContent":null,"Title":"WIP -- Port linuxdac from master","State":"closed","Body":"This is an early port of the prototype cross OS DAC work from the 5.0 branch to the 3.1 branch.\r\n\r\nIt is intended to indicate some of the gross characteristics of the eventual PR.  It is looking for 20% feedback on approach we should take with supporting this feature for 3.1 LTS.\r\n\r\nPlease note this was the earliest functional port from the 5.0 branch, so it is not fully representative of real code, but it is likely representative of the types of changes required to get a DAC cross OS compiled.\r\n\r\nI wanted feedback before I drafted a final back port for 3.1.\r\n\r\nKey points:\r\n\r\n- Changes are primarily to build configuration.\r\n    - Changes to CMake file to separate concept of Host/Compiler platform and Target/Runtime platform\r\n   - Changes to C++ `#ifdef` to separate concept of Host/Compiler platform and Target/Runtime platform\r\n- These changes are not intended to change the runtime.  For this version runtime changes were not required. The cross OS DAC was built and then tested against official released bits.\r\n- The 5.0 implementation will eventually depend on a new export of the `g_DacTable`.  Ideally we would port that here too. This is a minor runtime change.\r\n\r\nOptions:\r\n\r\n- 3.1 PR w/ minimal backport of the 5.0 Linux DAC required to support the Print Exception scenario.\r\n- 3.1 PR w/ with changes as a patch to be applied only during Cross OS DAC build. Plus infra changes to apply the patch and build the new binaries\r\n- Official build of cross OS DAC out of a separate 3.1DAC branch. Merge 3.1 regularly.  \r\n- Do not support scenario\r\n- Develop alternate approach\r\n\r\n/cc @tommcdon ","Url":"https://github.com/dotnet/coreclr/pull/28011","RelatedDescription":"Closed or merged PR \"WIP -- Port linuxdac from master\" (#28011)"},{"Id":"565025740","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2020-02-14T01:45:09","Actor":"dotnet-maestro[bot]","Number":"28018","RawContent":null,"Title":"[release/3.1] Update dependencies from dotnet/arcade","State":"closed","Body":"This pull request updates the following dependencies\r\n\r\n[marker]: <> (Begin:88e1281a-0536-412d-736c-08d72a4ce44a)\r\n## From https://github.com/dotnet/arcade\r\n- **Subscription**: 88e1281a-0536-412d-736c-08d72a4ce44a\r\n- **Build**: 20200213.5\r\n- **Date Produced**: 2/13/2020 9:34 PM\r\n- **Commit**: 15f00efd583eab4372b2e9ca25bd80ace5b119ad\r\n- **Branch**: refs/heads/release/3.x\r\n- **Updates**:\r\n  - **Microsoft.DotNet.Arcade.Sdk** -> 1.0.0-beta.20113.5\r\n  - **Microsoft.DotNet.Build.Tasks.Feed** -> 2.2.0-beta.20113.5\r\n  - **Microsoft.DotNet.Build.Tasks.Packaging** -> 1.0.0-beta.20113.5\r\n  - **Microsoft.DotNet.Helix.Sdk** -> 2.0.0-beta.20113.5\r\n\r\n[marker]: <> (End:88e1281a-0536-412d-736c-08d72a4ce44a)\r\n\r\n","Url":"https://github.com/dotnet/coreclr/pull/28018","RelatedDescription":"Closed or merged PR \"[release/3.1] Update dependencies from dotnet/arcade\" (#28018)"},{"Id":"564882854","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2020-02-13T22:24:20","Actor":"Anipik","Number":"28016","RawContent":null,"Title":"update branding for 3.1.3","State":"closed","Body":"","Url":"https://github.com/dotnet/coreclr/pull/28016","RelatedDescription":"Closed or merged PR \"update branding for 3.1.3\" (#28016)"},{"Id":"564883079","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2020-02-13T20:26:57","Actor":"Anipik","Number":"28017","RawContent":null,"Title":"branding for 2.1.17","State":"closed","Body":"","Url":"https://github.com/dotnet/coreclr/pull/28017","RelatedDescription":"Closed or merged PR \"branding for 2.1.17\" (#28017)"},{"Id":"561936487","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2020-02-13T19:59:55","Actor":"omajid","Number":"28010","RawContent":null,"Title":"[release/3.1] Support glibc deprecation of sys/sysctl.h ","State":"closed","Body":"I can't build `release/3.1` out of the box on Fedora 31 with glibc 2.30.

If no, what is the benefit of the new feature?\r\n\r\nThanks.\r\n","Url":"https://github.com/dotnet/standard/issues/1748","RelatedDescription":"Closed issue \"Is it legal to decompile .NET libraries?\" (#1748)"},{"Id":"595131445","IsPullRequest":false,"CreatedAt":"2020-04-06T13:46:58","Actor":"Nekuskus","Number":"1754","RawContent":null,"Title":"System.TypeInitializationException","State":"open","Body":"I keep getting `System.TypeInitializationException: System.IO.FileNotFoundException: Can't find file or assembly 'System.Private.CoreLib, Version=4.0.0.0', Culture=neutral, PublicKeyToken=7cec85d7bea7798e` exception after moving my app from .NET Core to .NET Framework 4.7.2.

An unknown status string causes a CryptographicException to be thrown due to the missing mappings.\r\n\r\nThe fix is to correctly handle these additional statuses, mapping them such that the behavior matches what Windows and Linux do.\r\n\r\n## Customer Impact\r\n\r\nInitially reported by a customer in dotnet/runtime#35238. Customers that attempt to build an `X509Chain` on macOS with a certificate that causes one of the unknown statuses to be triggered will receive a `CryptographicException` instead of the `X509ChainStatusFlags` which other platforms correctly report. This may cause compatibility issues as developers are porting from other platforms to macOS.\r\n\r\n## Regression\r\n\r\nNo.\r\n\r\n## Testing\r\n\r\nContains unit tests for all but the basic constraints scenario due to missing functionality in release 3.1 to aid testing. All are tested in dotnet/runtime.\r\n\r\n## Risk\r\n\r\n**Low.**  All of the new codes have been encountered in testing and measured against Windows for cross-platform consistency.

It is adding .NET Framework configurations to our OOB packages so that they won't require netsandard shims for projects ingesting them and targeting .NET Framework.\r\n\r\nThings that need to happen before merging this PR:\r\n\r\n- [X] Add Net461 configurations to all projects that today ship as NuGet packages and have a .NET Standard asset when consumer targets .NET Framework 4.6.1/4.6.2/4.7/4.7.1/4.7.2/4.8. (This will be done with the first commit, so that it is easier to review this commit by commit.)\r\n- [X] Add Net461 configuration to OpenSSL OOB package which also needs it, but it will be treated specially given that it requires some special types in S.S.C.Algorithms that are not present in 461. (Done with commit 10df782)\r\n- [x] Baseline all of the packages that have new configurations from steps 1 and 2, and now service all packages above that depend on them so that all new package versions will depend on these new packages that have the new configs. After doing this, all of our latest NuGet packages should not require the .NET Standard shims. (Done with 14b5db5)\r\n- [x] Do some extensive testing to make sure API wasn't regressed by adding these new configurations. (I have more info on how I did this here https://github.com/dotnet/corefx/pull/42901#issuecomment-611770142).\r\n\r\n**Customer Impact**\r\n\r\nCustomers that have hit problems caused by this issue have been trying to add manual workarounds on their projects and custom logic for deploying. Once this is fixed, customers will have to remove those workarounds from their projects and reference the new packages in order to get the benefits of not needing the extra facades or binding redirects for their application.\r\n\r\n**Regression?**\r\n\r\nNo.\r\n\r\n**Packaging reviewed?**\r\n\r\nIt will involve packaging changes, so it will require a review by packaging experts.\r\n\r\n**Risk**\r\n\r\nLow. We didn't increase Assembly Version in order to not require new binding redirects from apps. The risk here is that we are effectively causing NuGet to use a different asset from the package to pass to the compiler and a different one as well for the implementation, but we did extensive testing to ensure that we were not removing or adding API and that there was no visible difference between the assets that they used to get and the ones they will get now.\r\n","Url":"https://github.com/dotnet/corefx/pull/42901","RelatedDescription":"Closed or merged PR \"Adding .NET Framework configurations to OOB packages so that they won't require the netstandard shims when targeting .NET Framework\" (#42901)"},{"Id":"599126181","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2020-04-13T21:23:23","Actor":"dotnet-maestro-bot","Number":"42903","RawContent":null,"Title":"Update BuildTools to rc1-05113-01 (release/2.1)","State":"closed","Body":"/cc @dotnet/maestro-reviewers-core","Url":"https://github.com/dotnet/corefx/pull/42903","RelatedDescription":"Closed or merged PR \"Update BuildTools to rc1-05113-01 (release/2.1)\" (#42903)"},{"Id":"597967932","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2020-04-10T20:32:09","Actor":"pranavkm","Number":"42902","RawContent":null,"Title":"Update branding to preview5","State":"closed","Body":"","Url":"https://github.com/dotnet/corefx/pull/42902","RelatedDescription":"Closed or merged PR \"Update branding to preview5\" (#42902)"},{"Id":"587757768","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2020-04-10T16:19:35","Actor":"alnikola","Number":"42888","RawContent":null,"Title":"[release/3.1] Client certificate authentication on HTTP/2 in WinHttpHandler","State":"closed","Body":"This is port of dotnet/runtime#33158.\r\n\r\n**Description**\r\nPre-release WinHTTP's version supports client certificate-based authentication over HTTP/2, but the feature must be explicitly opted-in.

At first I was RDPing to my work computer, but the latency was making it very hard to work. At work I have VS-2017 but couldn't find that download, but found VS-2019 online. So I installed VS-2019 at home and accidentally got the PREVIEW version. When it works I'm productive, but it often has issues. I am currently on 16.6.0 Preview 4.0. Clean boot this morning, started VS, opened a solution and started writing code in C#. I haven't opened a single tool, compiled or anything. And WHAM, up pops a Yellow bar saying an error occurred and I should save and restart. I didn't copy down the exact working of the error message before it disappeared when I went to find the version of VS I'm running.  But this reported stack trace is EXACTLY what I saw when I searched for the issue here.</p><p>I feel like (but can't verify) nearly every issue I've had has to do with threads, background or foreground, that try to communicate with the team server (on-premise at work) and timeout. Our team server is used just for source control and a few basic builds we use when we want to produce a releasable product. Our team server was TFS 2017 Express (we only have 3 developers) but VS-2019 from first use did nothing but complain about DevOps services not available, so I upgraded it to Azure DevOps Server 2019 Update 1.1 Express. I still get that complaint occasionally but after several forced \"Connect\" to the team server it will work again.<br></p><p>In case it matters:<br>* I have .Net Framework 4.8.03752 (according the the VS-2019 Help About)<br>* I have 4 C# cs files open, and 2 xaml files open (in full XAML view, I rarely use the Design view).<br>* I am connected to work using a hardware tunnel established using a Sophos RED device (attached to my gateway router) which connects to my workplace's Sophos XG210 gateway firewall, attached to one NIC of my machine. The other NIC is connected to my gateway router for my normal internet connection traffic. Appropriate routes exist to send only work traffic to the RED. The VOIP phone attached the RED so I can have a work phone extension at home works flawlessly.</p>\r\n\r\n#### Scott Steesy on 4/29/2020, 05:50 AM: \r\n\r\n<p>Further info. Before restarting VS I noticed that above every function in the editor is just says \"- references\" and not the usual information for # of references with a hyperlink to show them. At first I thought to myself \"why would local code references need a JSON-RPC call\", then I remembered that it also shows the person that last edited that function, which to do MUST be hitting source control on the team server. so maybe that is what died in the background. BTW, I can't say as I ever have needed to know the last editor, so if I could turn that off to fix some of my problems i'd do it.</p>\r\n\r\n#### Visual Studio Feedback System on 4/29/2020, 08:48 PM: \r\n\r\n<p>We have directed your feedback to the appropriate engineering team for further evaluation.

VB apparently gets no such code option even though the code styles for these cases is nearly identical between C# and VB.\n\nFor instance, if you go into the Code Style settings for Basic, in the Prefer object initializer, you get the following example:\n\n```\n' Prefer:\nDim c = New Customer() With {\n    . Age = 21\n}\n\n' Over:\nDim c = New Customer()\nc.Age = 21\n```\n\nI prefer style of having the brace on the new line for anything more than a simple property. IE, in the above example, the default refactor code would generate:\n\n```\nDim c = New Customer() With\n{\n    . Age = 21,\n    . IDNumber = 42\n}\n```\n\n^ That's my prefered style for anything more than a single property being set. If I only have a single property being set, then I manually collapse to 1 line:\n\n```\nDim c = New Customer() With { . Age = 21 }\n```\n\n^ I don't know if you can have the refactor do a single line for single property instances and do the brace on a new line for 2+ properties, but that would be even better.\n\n---\n### Original Comments\n\n#### Visual Studio Feedback System on 4/26/2020, 04:37 AM: \n\nThank you for taking the time to provide your suggestion.

The debug build is working at the moment, but that's probably more luck due to the different number of locals it creates.  The changes here bring the offset used in the unboxing stub into line with the offset used in RhUnbox, i.e. the one returned by `obj.GetRawData()` which is the offset of a byte field.  `long`s were using the field offset from `ldflda` which gets 8 byte aligned and hence does not match the offset for a `byte` (4).

So... as in title - it extends current `dotnet CLI` with `dotnet add file`. \r\n\r\nThis feature is probably mostly useful for F# developers - in C# users can use globbing, but in F# order of files in project matters - so we specify every `.fs` file separately in the project file. Having this feature will be also great for better editor integration - VSCode (with Ionide) is used by a huge part of the F# community and we provide \"solution explorer\" view in the editor but we need good commands to add files and/or move the up-down (again the order of files matters) - we currently provide that functionality using a custom utility (https://github.com/ionide/Forge) but... well, let's just say it's not my best work ever. \r\n\r\nSo there's a couple of things to discuss here:\r\n - would you be open to having such a feature?\r\n - how to determine default location of the file (probably on top of the group, current implementation adds it adds the bottom)\r\n - should it have something like `--above` and `--below` options that would allow specifying a location of the file (it's a common scenario to say \"I want to add helpers.fs above my_test.fs\")\r\n - should it allow not only adding but also moving files (changing the order of files and moving files up/down) is another common scenario during the development of F# projects\r\n\r\nCC: @cartermp \r\n\r\nP.S. the changes include all generated translation files, please let me know if they shouldn't be included in PR -

This means [.NET Core 2.2](https://devblogs.microsoft.com/dotnet/announcing-net-core-2-2/) is no longer supported and updates will no longer be provided. We recommend moving to [.NET Core 3.1](https://devblogs.microsoft.com/dotnet/announcing-net-core-3-1/), our long term support (LTS) release.\r\n\r\n- [Download .NET Core 3.1](https://www.microsoft.com/net/download/dotnet-core/3.1)\r\n- [.NET Core 2.2 end-of-life statement](https://devblogs.microsoft.com/dotnet/net-core-2-2-will-reach-end-of-life-on-december-23-2019/)\r\n\r\nWe've created an issue at [dotnet/core#4084](https://github.com/dotnet/core/issues/4084) for your questions and comments.\r\n\r\n## .NET Core 2.2 Lifecycle\r\n\r\n.NET Core releases belong to one of two [support lifecycles](https://www.microsoft.com/net/platform/support-policy): long term support (LTS) and Current. LTS releases are stable release which receive critical updates and are supported for at least three years. Current releases can include new features that may undergo future change based on feedback. Current releases are supported for three months after the subsequent .NET Core major or minor release. Both LTS and Current releases receive critical fixes throughout their lifecycle, for security, reliability, or to add support for new operating system versions. You must stay up-to-date with the latest patches to qualify for support. \r\n\r\n[.NET Core 2.2](https://devblogs.microsoft.com/dotnet/announcing-net-core-2-2/) was released in December 2018 as a Current release. Per the lifecycle policy, Current releases reach end of life 3 months after a subsequent release (Current or LTS). **.NET Core 3.0** released in **September 2019** and began the end of life countdown for .NET Core 2.2 that concluded on December 23, 2019. \r\n\r\n## .NET Core 2.2 Downloads\r\n\r\n.NET Core 2.2 installers, zips and tar.gzs will remain available, but unsupported. This includes existing releases available on Linux package feeds. Previous versions, including 2.2, will be accessible through the [Download Archives](https://www.microsoft.com/net/download/archives). \r\n\r\n## Policy Information\r\n\r\nAdditional lifecycle and support details  and background can be seen in the following:\r\n\r\n* [.NET Core Support Lifecycle](https://www.microsoft.com/net/platform/support-policy)\r\n* [Microsoft Support for .NET Core](https://github.com/dotnet/core/blob/master/microsoft-support.md)\r\n* [.NET Core OS Lifecycle Policy](https://github.com/dotnet/core/blob/master/os-lifecycle-policy.md)\r\n* [Support and Versioning](https://blogs.msdn.microsoft.com/dotnet/2016/07/26/net-support-and-versioning/)\r\n","Url":"https://github.com/dotnet/announcements/issues/147","RelatedDescription":"Open issue \".NET Core 2.2 has reached end of life\" (#147)"},{"Id":"541189878","IsPullRequest":false,"CreatedAt":"2019-12-20T20:42:33","Actor":"vivmishra","Number":"146","RawContent":null,"Title":"Announcing Availability of Localized IntelliSense for .NET Core 3.0 and 3.1","State":"open","Body":"This week we released localized [IntelliSense](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/visualstudio/ide/using-intellisense?view=vs-2019) files for .NET Core 3.0 and 3.1, in following 10 Visual Studio supported languages: \r\n- Brazilian Portuguese\r\n- Chinese (simplified)\r\n- Chinese (traditional)\r\n- French\r\n- German\r\n- Italian\r\n- Japanese\r\n- Korean\t\r\n- Russian\r\n- Spanish\r\n\r\nThe files (in zip archives) are available for download from [**Download localized .NET Core IntelliSense files**](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/download/dotnet-core/intellisense).\r\n\r\n * [Checksums for 3.0 zip files](https://dotnetcli.blob.core.windows.net/dotnet/checksums/3.0.0-intellisense-sha.txt)\r\n * [Checksums for 3.1 zip files](https://dotnetcli.blob.core.windows.net/dotnet/checksums/3.1.0-intellisense-sha.txt)\r\n\r\nYou can see [the .NET Core Guide](https://aka.ms/dotnet-core-intellisense) for instructions on how to use these files with Visual Studio.\r\n\r\nBy default, when you're developing .NET Core projects, the SDK only includes the English version of the IntelliSense files. But now you can enhance your localized Visual Studio development experience by adding the localized IntelliSense files from the download site into your local development environment.\r\n\r\nLastly, with this release we have made the localized IntelliSense available as zip archives that does require you to manually extract and copy the files to respective SDK install folders.

This means some folks will lose their Collaborator badge and the ability to interact with the CI system.*\r\n\r\nOver the years, we’ve added a bunch of folks as collaborators with read permissions to our public repos. The rationale was that we wanted to be able to assign issues to community members because GitHub only allowed assigning issues to users with an explicit permission grant for the repository. However, they changed this in [June 2019](https://github.blog/2019-06-25-assign-issues-to-issue-commenters/). Now, we can assign issues to all users with explicit permissions as well as to users that have commented on the specific issue.\r\n\r\nAlso, we recently started to audit and tighten the permissions for our organizations. As a result, it became clear that large number of repo-specific permission grants are hard to review and audit. Internally, our goal is to grant all permissions via teams instead.\r\n\r\nHence, we plan to remove all collaborators from public repos that only have read permissions (folks with triage permissions will remain). The full list of affected repos is listed below.\r\n\r\nThis shouldn’t impact your ability to work with us, but losing explicit read-only has the following implications:\r\n\r\n-   **You’ll lose the collaborator badge**. We understand that this is visually appealing and for some people it might have been a badge of honor. But given that GitHub also shows a Contributor bade for folks whose PRs got merged, we don’t think it this will be a major take back.    \r\n    ![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/5169960/70491508-43acf580-1ab6-11ea-94df-74ea2dde98b4.png)\r\n\r\n-   ~~**You lose the ability to interact with the CI system**. As a collaborator, you can use comments to [send commands to the CI system](https://github.com/dotnet/runtime/blob/master/docs/project/pullrequest-builds.md). While this can be useful at times, we generally don’t expect (or desire) contributors to do that. Of course, anyone can still access the CI logs.~~\r\n\r\n- **You might lose the ability to interact with the CI system**. Based on your feedback we have decided to give externals access to interact with the CI system *on a case by case basis*. If you believe you need to have that ability, please [leave a comment like Kevin's](https://github.com/dotnet/runtime/issues/718#issuecomment-563717478).\r\n\r\n| Public Repo                | \\#collaborators with read |\r\n|----------------------------|---------------------------|\r\n| arcade                     | 1                         |\r\n| BenchmarkDotNet            | 11                        |\r\n| cli                        | 2                         |\r\n| command-line-api           | 14                        |\r\n| coreclr                    | 18                        |\r\n| corefx                     | 180                       |\r\n| corefxlab                  | 4                         |\r\n| corert                     | 7                         |\r\n| core-sdk                   | 1                         |\r\n| docs                       | 3                         |\r\n| interactive-window         | 1                         |\r\n| machinelearning            | 1                         |\r\n| machinelearning-samples    | 1                         |\r\n| msbuild-language-service   | 1                         |\r\n| runtime                    | 128                       |\r\n| spark                      | 5                         |\r\n| standard                   | 1                         |\r\n| windowsdesktop             | 1                         |\r\n| winforms-datavisualization | 1                         |\r\n| Grand Total                | 381                       |\r\n\r\n### Discussion\r\n\r\nTo discuss this, please comment on the corresponding issue at https://github.com/dotnet/runtime/issues/718.","Url":"https://github.com/dotnet/announcements/issues/144","RelatedDescription":"Open issue \"Removal of read-collaborator access\" (#144)"},{"Id":"532249858","IsPullRequest":false,"CreatedAt":"2019-12-03T20:36:29","Actor":"MichaelSimons","Number":"143","RawContent":null,"Title":".NET Core `latest` Docker tags updated to 3.1","State":"open","Body":"# .NET Core `latest` Docker tags updated to 3.1\r\n\r\nThe `latest` tags for the [dotnet/core](https://hub.docker.com/_/microsoft-dotnet-core) repos have been updated to reference [.NET Core 3.1](https://devblogs.microsoft.com/dotnet/announcing-net-core-3-1/).\r\n\r\n## Discussion\r\n \r\nYou can share your thoughts on this change or see what others are saying at:\r\n \r\n* [dotnet/dotnet-docker#1337](https://github.com/dotnet/dotnet-docker/issues/1511)\r\n\r\n## Details\r\n\r\n* [dotnet-docker#1509](https://github.com/dotnet/dotnet-docker/pull/1509)\r\n\r\nThe `latest` tags for the [dotnet/core](https://hub.docker.com/_/microsoft-dotnet-core) repos are always intended to reference the latest supported version of .NET Core.

Our planning has reached a point where we have a schedule for the coreclr, corefx and core-setupmoves into dotnet/runtime that we want to share out with the community.\r\n\r\n### November 13th\r\nWe’ll move all changes from the original repositories into dotnet/runtime up to 5PM PST on November 13th. We’ll try to help as many pull requests as possible get merged by then. At that point, if there’s any pull requests still open we’ll have to close them. If you’d still like to continue those pull requests, we’d encourage you to bring them to dotnet/runtime in a new pull request.\r\n\r\nThe repositories themselves will be effectively archived at this point. The state of the “master” branch will be recorded with a tag, named “master-archive”, but the branch itself will be deleted. The default branch for the repositories will be named “archive” and it will be a single commit with a README.md and CONTRIBUTING.md file pointing to our dotnet/runtime repository.\r\n\r\nThe repositories will remain active for servicing changes to .NET Core 3.1 and earlier hence we will not be using the GitHub archive capability. \r\n\r\n### November 22nd\r\nThe dotnet/runtime repository will be made public and available for community contribution. Even though the repository will be created on November 13th it will take several days to get it back into a working order: fixing up our build scripts, recreating our Azure Dev Ops build definitions, etc … Until those tasks are completed it will not be possible to accept pull request and hence the repository will remain private. Once we are in a state that pull requests can be merged again the repository will be made public.\r\n\r\nOur expectation is that will occur on November 22nd. If it is ready sooner it will be made public sooner. If the work takes longer than we planned then we will add an update to this announcement with a new expected date.\r\n\r\n### December 1st-2nd\r\nAll issues, open and closed, will be migrated from corefx, coreclr and core-setup into dotnet/runtime. This will be using GitHub’s existing issue transfer feature in a bulk migration. This means all of the existing issue links will continue to function via redirects.\r\n\r\nThis does mean though that labels will not transfer with the issues. Labels will be re-applied as a post processing step by our engineering team once the issue migration completes.\r\n\r\nEven though our issues won’t be fully migrated until this time we’d like the community to begin filing issues on dotnet/runtime as soon as it’s public rather than continuing to file issues on the original repositories.\r\n\r\n### Migrating Commits\r\nThe dotnet/runtime repository will be a new commit history from the original repositories. We are using this consolidation as an opportunity to clean up our history with the goal of having a cleaner, smaller history as a starting point. This means commits will be rewritten in the following ways as they are migrated to dotnet/runtime:\r\n\r\n1. Author information, contributor information, changed file list and time stamps from the original commit will be preserved.\r\n1. Links to issues, pull requests or commits in the repository using GitHub short links will be rewritten so they continue to point the original repository. \r\n1. Every commit will be appended with a link to the original commit it was mapped from.\r\n\r\nThe actual contents of the commit though will be updated to match the new directory layout of the dotnet/runtime repository.","Url":"https://github.com/dotnet/announcements/issues/133","RelatedDescription":"Open issue \"Repository Consolidation Timeline\" (#133)"},{"Id":"513963125","IsPullRequest":false,"CreatedAt":"2019-10-29T14:32:55","Actor":"mthalman","Number":"132","RawContent":null,"Title":"Release of Alpine 3.10 Docker images","State":"open","Body":"# .NET Core Alpine Docker images updated to Alpine 3.10\r\n\r\nDocker images for .NET Core have been released that support Alpine 3.10.

With [.NET Standard 2.0](https://devblogs.microsoft.com/dotnet/announcing-net-standard-2-0/), we tried to make it much more viable to share code between .NET Framework, .NET Core, and Xamarin which resulted in approximately 38K .NET Frameworks APIs being available in .NET Core 2.0. We also built the [Windows Compatibility Pack](https://devblogs.microsoft.com/dotnet/announcing-the-windows-compatibility-pack-for-net-core/) which made another 21K .NET Framework APIs available to .NET Core, resulting in almost 60K additional APIs. And in .NET Core 3.0 we added WPF and WinForms, which increased the number of .NET Framework APIs ported to .NET Core to over 120k, which is more than half of all .NET Framework APIs.\r\n\r\nIt’s also worth pointing out that we added about 62K APIs to .NET Core that don’t exist in .NET Framework. If we compare their total number of APIs, .NET Core has about 80% of the API surface of .NET Framework.\r\n\r\n<p align=\"center\">\r\n<img src=\"https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/5169960/66777114-f8db7c80-ee7c-11e9-9161-acfe1c491586.png\" width=\"600\" align=\"center\">\r\n</p>\r\n\r\nWe announced that the [future of .NET](https://devblogs.microsoft.com/dotnet/net-core-is-the-future-of-net/) will be based on .NET Core. And at Build 2019, [Scott Hunter stated](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZlO1utbB2GQ&t=54m20s) that AppDomains, remoting, Web Forms, WCF server, and Windows Workflow won’t be ported to .NET Core.\r\n\r\nWith .NET Core 3.0, we’re at the point where we’ve ported all technologies that are required for modern workloads, be that desktop apps, mobile apps, console apps, web sites, or cloud services. That’s not to say that we don’t have any gaps or opportunities for new technologies, but we generally believe we won’t be finding them in the .NET Framework code base anymore. Moving forward, we’re focusing our resources on incorporating new technologies.\r\n\r\nSimultaneously, we’re looking into releasing more of the [.NET Framework code base under the MIT license](https://github.com/microsoft/referencesource) on GitHub to allow the community to create OSS projects for technologies we’re not intending to bring to .NET Core. For example, there already are community projects for [CoreWF](https://github.com/UiPath/corewf) and [CoreWCF](https://github.com/CoreWCF/CoreWCF).\r\n\r\nWe’d like to thank everyone who filed issues with requests for APIs being ported.

While this is still work in progress, we'd like to give you an update on where we are.\r\n\r\nSo far, we've identified the following repos:\r\n\r\n* dotnet/**runtime**\r\n\t- Will contain [coreclr](https://github.com/dotnet/coreclr), [corefx](https://github.com/dotnet/corefx), [core-setup](https://github.com/dotnet/core-setup), [aspnet/Extensions](https://github.com/aspnet/Extensions), and some of [mono/mono](https://github.com/mono/mono)\r\n* [dotnet/**sdk**](https://github.com/dotnet/sdk)\r\n\t- Will contain [toolset](https://github.com/dotnet/toolset), [sdk](https://github.com/dotnet/sdk), [cli](https://github.com/dotnet/cli)\r\n* dotnet/**installer**\r\n\t- Renamed from [core-sdk](https://github.com/dotnet/core-sdk)\r\n* dotnet/**aspnetcore**\r\n\t- Moved from [aspnet/AspNetCore](https://github.com/aspnet/AspNetCore) and will also contain [aspnet/AspNetCore-Tooling](https://github.com/aspnet/AspNetCore-Tooling)\r\n* dotnet/**efcore**\r\n\t- Moved from [aspnet/EntityFrameworkCore](https://github.com/aspnet/EntityFrameworkCore)\r\n* [dotnet/**winforms**](https://github.com/dotnet/winforms)\r\n\t- Unchanged, but listed for clarity \r\n* [dotnet/**wpf**](https://github.com/dotnet/wpf)\r\n\t- Unchanged, but listed for clarity\r\n\r\n### Name changes\r\n\r\nYou might notice that we changed our mind on naming from our [earlier announcement][ann]. Based on your feedback, we decided to go with **dotnet/runtime** instead of **dotnet/platform** and **dotnet/sdk** instead of **dotnet/cli**.\r\n\r\nSeveral people pointed out that the previous names weren't relatable to how we talk about the product, for example on download pages. So, we decided to match the product distributions as the primary design point for the new names. We generally refer to the bits you need to run your app as *the runtime* and the bits you need to build apps as *the SDK*. This also matches the naming chosen by other platforms.\r\n\r\n### New repos can't be used for .NET Core 3.x or earlier\r\n\r\nThe consolidated repositories are going to be about .NET 5 and going forward. It will not be possible to build .NET Core 3.1 or earlier from these repositories. As such, only the master branch from each of the repositories will be brought forward. There will be no porting of the individual release branches in the source repositories.\r\n\r\n### Personal names and email addresses\r\n\r\nSince we're planning on rebasing the history in the merged repositories, we can map your name and email address to new values as well. We primarily do this to support our friends in the LGBTQ+ community who have changed their names to reflect their identities. However, anybody is welcome to use this to change their email and name.\r\n\r\nWhatever your reason might be: we value your contributions and we hope this small gesture makes your life a little bit better. So if you changed your name/email – or simply prefer us to use different values – please [submit a request](mailto:dotnet@microsoft.com&subject=.NET%20repo%20consolidation%3A%20request%20for%20name%20change&body=Hey%2C%20%0A%0AI%E2%80%99d%20like%20to%20change%20my%20email%2Fdisplay%20name%20in%20the%20consolidated%20repo%20from%20%0A%0A%20%20%20%20%20%20%20%20My%20Old%20Name%20%3Cold.me%40example.org%3E%20%0A%0Ato%20%0A%0A%20%20%20%20%20%20%20%20My%20New%20Name%20%3Cnew.me%40example.org%3E%20%0A%0AThanks%21%20%0A).\r\n\r\n### More is coming\r\n\r\nWe'll share more updates in the upcoming months.
