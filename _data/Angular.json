If `<a>` is used for the menu entries, the `href` injected by `routeLink` makes it focusable and even if `<span>` is used instead, `routeLink` still injects a `tabindex=0` to always make it focusable.\r\nWhen the user then clicks on a link the surrounding `<nav>` element looses its focus as focus moves to the link that has been clicked instead. Even setting `tabindex=\"-1\"` only prevents tabbing to the link but still allows focus via mouse click.\r\n\r\nThere should either be a configuration parameter to prevent setting of `tabindex` or the feature should be reverted as `tabindex` can always be configured manually if necessary.\r\n\r\n## üî¨ Minimal Reproduction\r\n<!--\r\nPlease create and share minimal reproduction of the issue starting with this template: https://stackblitz.com/fork/angular-issue-repro2\r\n-->\r\nhttps://stackblitz.com/edit/angular-issue-repro2-qudebd\r\n\r\n```html\r\n<nav tabindex=\"0\">\r\n  <ol>\r\n    <li>\r\n      <!-- becomes focusable because of href attribute -->\r\n      <a routerLink=\"bikes\" routerLinkActive=\"active\">Bikes</a>\r\n    </li>\r\n    <li>\r\n      <!-- becomes focusable because of tabindex attribute -->\r\n      <span routerLink=\"cars\" routerLinkActive=\"active\">Cars</span>\r\n    </li>\r\n  </ol>\r\n</nav>\r\n```\r\n<!--\r\nIf StackBlitz is not suitable for reproduction of your issue, please create a minimal GitHub repository with the reproduction of the issue.

It used to work work fine in both Chrome and IE (Edge, 10, 11) till I ran the `ng-build --prod` for the first time to deploy it on the server. Since then the app is breaking in all of the IE versions, but still works fine in Chrome. I traced the bug and narrowed it down to the following function:\r\n\r\n```\r\n  init(): Promise<boolean> {\r\n        return new Promise<boolean>((resolve, reject) => {\r\n            this._sessionService.getCurrentLoginInformations().toPromise().then((result: GetCurrentLoginInformationsOutput) => {\r\n                this._application = result.application;\r\n                this._user = result.user;\r\n                this._tenant = result.tenant;\r\n                resolve(true);\r\n            }, (err) => {\r\n                reject(err);\r\n            });\r\n        });\r\n    }\r\n```\r\nThe issue is that in IE nothing is getting populated for neither of the result variable properties. but again all is good when running it in Chrome! \r\nDo I need to refactor the above code some how to make it digestible for IE?\r\n\r\nNote: In the error below the 'version' is a property for the 'application' property of the 'GetCurrentLoginInformationsOutput'\r\n\r\nNot quite sure if it relevants but I also get the following prompt in IE console:\r\n\r\n> Could not locate webpack:///(webpack)-dev-server/client* specified in source map \r\n\r\n## üî• Exception or Error\r\n<pre><code>\r\n<!-- If the issue is accompanied by an exception or an error, please share it below: -->\r\n[object Error]: {description: \"Uncaught (in promise): TypeError: Unable to get property 'version' of undefined or null reference TypeError: Unable to get property 'version' of undefined or null reference at AccountComponent (eval code:31:9) at createClass (eval code:12653:13) at createDirectiveInstance (eval code:12496:5) at createViewNodes (eval code:13954:21) at createRootView (eval code:13843:5) at callWithDebugContext (eval code:15268:9) at debugCreateRootView (eval code:14551:5) at ComponentFactory_.prototype.create (eval code:11448:9) at ComponentFactoryBoundToModule.prototype.create (eval code:4235:9) at ViewContainerRef_.prototype.createComponent (eval code:11645:9)\", message: \"Uncaught (in promise): TypeError: Unable to get property 'version' of undefined or null reference TypeError: Unable to get property 'version' of undefined or null reference at AccountComponent (eval code:31:9) at createClass (eval code:12653:13) at createDirectiveInstance (eval code:12496:5) at createViewNodes (eval code:13954:21) at createRootView (eval code:13843:5) at callWithDebugContext (eval code:15268:9) at debugCreateRootView (eval code:14551:5) at ComponentFactory_.prototype.create (eval code:11448:9) at ComponentFactoryBoundToModule.prototype.create (eval code:4235:9) at ViewContainerRef_.prototype.createComponent (eval code:11645:9)\", promise: Object, rejection: Object, stack: \"Error: Uncaught (in promise): TypeError: Unable to get property 'version' of undefined or null reference TypeError: Unable to get property 'version' of undefined or null reference at AccountComponent (eval code:31:9) at createClass (eval code:12653:13) at createDirectiveInstance (eval code:12496:5) at createViewNodes (eval code:13954:21) at createRootView (eval code:13843:5) at callWithDebugContext (eval code:15268:9) at debugCreateRootView (eval code:14551:5) at ComponentFactory_.prototype.create (eval code:11448:9) at ComponentFactoryBoundToModule.prototype.create (eval code:4235:9) at ViewContainerRef_.prototype.createComponent (eval code:11645:9) at resolvePromise (eval code:824:25) at resolvePromise (eval code:795:17) at Anonymous function (eval code:873:17) at ZoneDelegate.prototype.invokeTask (eval code:423:13) at onInvokeTask (eval code:4952:17) at ZoneDelegate.prototype.invokeTask (eval code:423:13) at Zone.prototype.runTask (eval code:192:21) at drainMicroTaskQueue (eval code:602:25) at ZoneTask.invokeTask (eval code:503:21) at invokeTask (eval code:1540:9)\"...}\r\n\r\ndescription: \"Uncaught (in promise): TypeError: Unable to get property 'version' of undefined or null reference TypeError: Unable to get property 'version' of undefined or null reference at AccountComponent (eval code:31:9) at createClass (eval code:12653:13) at createDirectiveInstance (eval code:12496:5) at createViewNodes (eval code:13954:21) at createRootView (eval code:13843:5) at callWithDebugContext (eval code:15268:9) at debugCreateRootView (eval code:14551:5) at ComponentFactory_.prototype.create (eval code:11448:9) at ComponentFactoryBoundToModule.prototype.create (eval code:4235:9) at ViewContainerRef_.prototype.createComponent (eval code:11645:9)\"\r\nmessage: \"Uncaught (in promise): TypeError: Unable to get property 'version' of undefined or null reference TypeError: Unable to get property 'version' of undefined or null reference at AccountComponent (eval code:31:9) at createClass (eval code:12653:13) at createDirectiveInstance (eval code:12496:5) at createViewNodes (eval code:13954:21) at createRootView (eval code:13843:5) at callWithDebugContext (eval code:15268:9) at debugCreateRootView (eval code:14551:5) at ComponentFactory_.prototype.create (eval code:11448:9) at ComponentFactoryBoundToModule.prototype.create (eval code:4235:9) at ViewContainerRef_.prototype.createComponent (eval code:11645:9)\"\r\n\r\n\r\n</code></pre>\r\n\r\n\r\n## üåç Your Environment\r\n<pre><code>\r\n<!-- run `ng version` and paste output below -->\r\n<!-- ‚úçÔ∏è-->\r\n\r\n</code></pre>\r\n\r\n**Anything else relevant?**\r\n<!-- ‚úçÔ∏èIs this a browser specific issue?

This means either a project doesn't have consistent css standards or they have to be manually added later.\r\n\r\n### Describe the solution you'd like\r\nAutomatically add the relevant css linting tool to the package.json\r\n\r\n- https://www.npmjs.com/package/csslint\r\n- https://www.npmjs.com/package/sass-lint\r\n- https://www.npmjs.com/package/lesshint\r\n\r\nAnd of course add the relevant command to package.json e.g.\r\n```\r\n  \"scripts\": {\r\n    \"ng\": \"ng\",\r\n    \"start\": \"ng serve\",\r\n    \"build\": \"ng build\",\r\n    \"test\": \"ng test\",\r\n    \"lint\": \"ng lint && sass-lint\",\r\n    \"e2e\": \"ng e2e\"\r\n  },\r\n```\r\n\r\n### Describe alternatives you've considered\r\nManually installing the library for every new project, or ensuring every developer has it installed in their Code Editor.","Url":"https://github.com/angular/angular-cli/issues/13502","RelatedDescription":"Closed issue \"Add relevant css lint to generated project\" (#13502)"},{"Id":"402760211","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2019-01-24T18:14:52","Actor":"cexbrayat","Number":"13515","RawContent":null,"Title":"fix(@schematics/angular): update latest version of devkit","State":"closed","Body":"Same thing that happened in the `beta.0` relase: devkit has not been updated when releasing `rc.0`.\r\n\r\nInstalling the CLI `7.3.0-rc.0` brings devkit in version `0.13.0-beta.0`","Url":"https://github.com/angular/angular-cli/pull/13515","RelatedDescription":"Closed or merged PR \"fix(@schematics/angular): update latest version of devkit\" (#13515)"},{"Id":"402801472","IsPullRequest":false,"CreatedAt":"2019-01-24T16:58:40","Actor":"abhijeet1995","Number":"13516","RawContent":null,"Title":"Angular cli","State":"closed","Body":"üõëüõëüõëüõëüõëüõëüõëüõëüõëüõëüõëüõëüõëüõëüõëüõëüõëüõëüõëüõëüõëüõëüõëüõëüõëüõëüõë\r\n\r\nPlease help us process issues more efficiently by filing an\r\nissue using one of the following templates:\r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/angular/angular-cli/issues/new/choose\r\n\r\nThank you!\r\n\r\nüõëüõëüõëüõëüõëüõëüõëüõëüõëüõëüõëüõëüõëüõëüõëüõëüõëüõëüõëüõëüõëüõëüõëüõëüõëüõëüõëafter successfully install angular cli when i used ng command then message show me ng is not recognized as an internal or external command operable program or batch file  ","Url":"https://github.com/angular/angular-cli/issues/13516","RelatedDescription":"Closed issue \"Angular cli\" (#13516)"},{"Id":"402749920","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2019-01-24T15:06:14","Actor":"cexbrayat","Number":"13514","RawContent":null,"Title":"docs: remove non existing format command","State":"open","Body":"This dc page has been mentionning clang format for a long time but this is not available out of the box.","Url":"https://github.com/angular/angular-cli/pull/13514","RelatedDescription":"Open PR \"docs: remove non existing format command\" (#13514)"},{"Id":"402505427","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2019-01-24T01:42:22","Actor":"louislarry","Number":"13513","RawContent":null,"Title":"fix(@angular-devkit/schematics): add missing aliases to collection-schema.json","State":"open","Body":"","Url":"https://github.com/angular/angular-cli/pull/13513","RelatedDescription":"Open PR \"fix(@angular-devkit/schematics): add missing aliases to collection-schema.json\" (#13513)"},{"Id":"402404868","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2019-01-24T00:13:08","Actor":"hansl","Number":"13512","RawContent":null,"Title":"ci: checkout existing branch on snapshots","State":"closed","Body":"","Url":"https://github.com/angular/angular-cli/pull/13512","RelatedDescription":"Closed or merged PR \"ci: checkout existing branch on snapshots\" (#13512)"},{"Id":"402380454","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2019-01-23T18:58:31","Actor":"kyliau","Number":"13511","RawContent":null,"Title":"fix(@schematics/angular): Add types annotations to e2e AppPage","State":"closed","Body":"This is a cherry-pick of dc2e40a100040ad3ff4265a9bc7303fde3d3a800\r\nOriginal PR: https://github.com/angular/angular-cli/pull/13406\r\n\r\nWhen app.po.ts is compiled under Bazel with Typescript 3.2,\r\nAppPage produces the following error:\r\n\r\ne2e/src/app.po.ts:4:3 - error TS2742: The inferred type of 'navigateTo' cannot be named without a reference to '../../external/npm/node_modules/@types/selenium-webdriver/index'.

The usage guidelines are pretty clear: use checkbox when the change is pending form submission and toggle button when the change is effective immediately.\r\n\r\nmat-slide-toggle sits in the middle ground in terms of apparent semantics and can plausibly be used in both situations. Currently it only presents as a checkbox. Maybe we could keep this as a default option and add an input that uses button with aria-pressed semantics.\r\n\r\nWAI guidelines for toggle buttons: https://www.w3.org/TR/wai-aria-practices/#button\r\n\r\n> Toggle button: A two-state button that can be either off (not pressed) or on (pressed). To tell assistive technologies that a button is a toggle button, specify a value for the attribute aria-pressed. For example, a button labeled mute in an audio player could indicate that sound is muted by setting the pressed state true. Important: it is critical the label on a toggle does not change when its state changes. In this example, when the pressed state is true, the label remains \"Mute\" so a screen reader would say something like \"Mute toggle button pressed\". Alternatively, if the design were to call for the button label to change from \"Mute\" to \"Unmute,\" the aria-pressed attribute would not be needed.\r\n\r\n#### Is there anything else we should know?\r\n\r\nI looked at google3 examples of mat-slide-toggle especially in Cloud Console, and it's pretty split down the middle whether it's a part of a form or effectively a button with immediate action.","Url":"https://github.com/angular/material2/issues/14949","RelatedDescription":"Open issue \"mat-slide-toggle add option to behave as an ARIA toggle button rather than a checkbox\" (#14949)"},{"Id":"402466866","IsPullRequest":false,"CreatedAt":"2019-01-24T21:09:06","Actor":"scriptsure","Number":"14936","RawContent":null,"Title":"mat-list-item' is not a known element","State":"closed","Body":"Getting following issue when trying to import list:\r\n\r\nERROR Error: Uncaught (in promise): Error: Template parse errors:\r\n'mat-list-item' is not a known element:\r\n1.
