Reference that issue as well. -->\r\n\r\nI ran into a compiling error with Bulma 0.8.0 when trying to use `inherit` value for the `$text-strong` variable. I found out this is due to breaking changes in commit 0f988eadd9cbca055966e4418a704b85e19999ff in which a lot of default colors have been modified. This particular line was throwing the error when using `inherit` value for `$text-strong`:\r\n\r\n```\r\n$input-placeholder-color: rgba($text-strong, 0.3) !default\r\n``` \r\n\r\nI think we may often use this particular value for the `$text-strong` and `$text-light` variables because there are a lot of cases where a `<strong>` tag in a text should just inherit its parent color. \r\nAlso I think it doesn't really make sense to use the strong text color as default in any other derived variable.\r\n\r\n### Proposed solution\r\n\r\n<!-- Which specific problem does this PR solve and how?  -->\r\n<!-- If it fixes a particular Issue, add \"Fixes #ISSUE_NUMBER\" in your title -->\r\nIn this PR I just put back the old default values, replacing `$text-strong` by `$grey-darker` and `$text-light` by `$grey`. By the way this is what [the docs](https://bulma.io/documentation/form/input/#variables) actually says.\r\n\r\n### Tradeoffs\r\n\r\n<!-- What are the drawbacks of this solution? Are there alternative ones? -->\r\n<!-- Think of performance, build time, usability, complexity, coupling…) -->\r\nThere are still other derived variables which use the `$text-strong` and `$text-light` ones as default. All of these changes have been made in commit 0f988eadd9cbca055966e4418a704b85e19999ff.  \r\nMaybe it could be a better idea to roll back the whole commit but I'm not really sure about that.\r\n\r\n### Testing Done\r\n\r\n<!-- BEFORE SUBMITTING YOUR PR, MAKE SURE TO FOLLOW THESE STEPS: -->\r\n<!-- 1.

Because it has the same height as the element that it wraps, it can only contain the following Bulma elements:\r\n> \r\n> * `input`\r\n> * `select`\r\n> * `button`\r\n> * `icon`\r\n\r\nHowever, in reading the blog post from 2017 where [control was split into field and control in v.04.0](https://bulma.io/2017/03/10/new-field-element/), the examples cover using a `span` inside a control and why I can't have a complex control of HTML elements inside a control element:\r\n\r\n```html\r\n<!-- Before -->\r\n<label class=\"label\">Username</label>\r\n<p class=\"control has-icon has-icon-right\">\r\n  <input class=\"input is-success\" type=\"text\" placeholder=\"Text input\" value=\"bulma\">\r\n  <span class=\"icon is-small\">\r\n    <i class=\"fas fa-check\"></i>\r\n  </span>\r\n  <span class=\"help is-success\">This username is available</span>\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<!-- After -->\r\n<div class=\"field\">\r\n  <label class=\"label\">Username</label>\r\n  <p class=\"control has-icon has-icon-right\">\r\n    <input class=\"input is-success\" type=\"text\" placeholder=\"Text input\" value=\"bulma\">\r\n    <span class=\"icon is-small\">\r\n      <i class=\"fas fa-check\"></i>\r\n    </span>\r\n  </p>\r\n  <p class=\"help is-success\">This username is available</p>\r\n</div>\r\n```\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n### Steps to Reproduce\r\n\r\nNot exactly steps to reproduce, but additional context: I'm asking specifically because I want to use Bulma with Telerik Kendo UI, and Kendo UI translates it's \"`<kendo-dropdownlist>` element into something like the following for an empty dropdown list, and its top-level elements are span and input, which violates the rules in the Bulma documentation HOWEVER everything seems to \"work ok\" - I think this is because the span is actually the floating listbox and therefore not part of the actual layout rules applied by Bulma, but it's been about 3+ years since I last did Web apps:\r\n\r\n```html\r\n<div class=\"field\">\r\n  <label class=\"label\" for=\"Status\" id=\"Status_label\">Status</label>\r\n  <p class=\"control\">\r\n    <span title=\"\" class=\"k-widget k-dropdown\" unselectable=\"on\" role=\"listbox\" aria-haspopup=\"true\" aria-expanded=\"false\" tabindex=\"0\" aria-owns=\"Status_listbox\" aria-labelledby=\"Status_label\" aria-live=\"polite\" aria-disabled=\"false\" aria-busy=\"false\" style=\"\" data-children-count=\"1\">\r\n      <span unselectable=\"on\" class=\"k-dropdown-wrap k-state-default\">\r\n        <span unselectable=\"on\" class=\"k-input\" data-children-count=\"0\"></span>\r\n        <span unselectable=\"on\" class=\"k-select\" aria-label=\"select\" data-children-count=\"0\">\r\n        <span class=\"k-icon k-i-arrow-60-down\"></span>\r\n      </span>\r\n    </span>\r\n    <input id=\"Status\" name=\"Status\" type=\"text\" value=\"\" data-lpignore=\"true\" autocomplete=\"off\" data-role=\"dropdownlist\" style=\"display: none;\">\r\n   </span>\r\n  </p>\r\n</div>\r\n```\r\n\r\n### Expected behavior\r\n\r\nClarify documentation that a control can contain the four elements, or any element that is not directly in the layout of the control element (e.g., floating above as in a pop-up control)\r\n\r\n### Actual behavior\r\n\r\nIt seems to be OK to have spans and other elements, as long as it's not directly in the element's \"has layout\" path.  But, again, it's been 3+ years since I've built a Web app, so I may be overlooking something, especially with Flexbox, as this is my first Flexbox app.\r\n","Url":"https://github.com/jgthms/bulma/issues/2728","RelatedDescription":"Open issue \"[Question] Is the documented limitations for Control correct or is it overly generalized?\" (#2728)"},{"Id":"532198717","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2019-12-03T20:35:38","Actor":"dangowans","Number":"2727","RawContent":null,"Title":"Update links.json","State":"closed","Body":"Adding a link to the list component.\r\n\r\n<!-- PLEASE READ THE FOLLOWING INSTRUCTIONS -->\r\n<!-- DO NOT REBUILD THE CSS OUTPUT IN YOUR PR -->\r\n\r\n<!-- Choose one of the following: -->\r\nThis is a **documentation fix**.\r\nI found a reference to the list documentation through Google, but no link in the Bulma documentation.\r\n\r\n### Proposed solution\r\n\r\nAdd a link in the documentation.\r\n\r\n### Tradeoffs\r\n\r\nNone.\r\n\r\n### Testing Done\r\n\r\nNone.\r\n\r\n### Changelog updated?\r\n\r\nNo.\r\n","Url":"https://github.com/jgthms/bulma/pull/2727","RelatedDescription":"Closed or merged PR \"Update links.json\" (#2727)"},{"Id":"532009001","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2019-12-03T14:05:26","Actor":"jhuettinger","Number":"2726","RawContent":null,"Title":"Navbar improvement","State":"open","Body":"<!-- PLEASE READ THE FOLLOWING INSTRUCTIONS -->\r\n<!-- DO NOT REBUILD THE CSS OUTPUT IN YOUR PR -->\r\n\r\n<!-- Choose one of the following: -->\r\nThis is a **improvement**.\r\n<!-- New feature?

Add an `input` with the attributes `type=\"checkbox\" class=\"navbar-checkbox\" id=\"navbar-checkbox\"` on top of the navbar\r\n\r\n2. Change the `<a>` tag of the navbar-burger to a `<label>` tag and add the attribute `for=\"navbar-checkbox\"` \r\n\r\nIt should look like this:\r\n```\r\n<nav class=\"navbar\" role=\"navigation\" aria-label=\"main navigation\">\r\n    <input type=\"checkbox\" class=\"navbar-checkbox\" id=\"navbar-checkbox\">\r\n    <div class=\"navbar-brand\">\r\n\r\n        <label class=\"navbar-burger burger\" aria-label=\"menu\" for=\"navbar-checkbox\"\r\n           data-target=\"navbarBasicExample\">\r\n            <span aria-hidden=\"true\"></span>\r\n            <span aria-hidden=\"true\"></span>\r\n            <span aria-hidden=\"true\"></span>\r\n        </label>\r\n    </div>\r\n\r\n    <div id=\"navbarBasicExample\" class=\"navbar-menu\">\r\n        ...\r\n    </div>\r\n</nav>\r\n```\r\n\r\n### Tradeoffs\r\n\r\nNone.\r\n\r\n### Testing Done\r\n\r\nTesting succeeded with the proposed changes to the basic example from the bulma docs.\r\n\r\n### Changelog updated?\r\n\r\nNo.\r\n\r\n<!-- Thanks! -->\r\n","Url":"https://github.com/jgthms/bulma/pull/2726","RelatedDescription":"Open PR \"Navbar improvement\" (#2726)"},{"Id":"531667810","IsPullRequest":false,"CreatedAt":"2019-12-03T02:31:32","Actor":"veryverygoodgood","Number":"2725","RawContent":null,"Title":"Part 3: What's with Jeremy Thomas closing important issues before we even get a chance to reply?","State":"closed","Body":"> It seems your ideas are not compatible with the very foundation of Bulma: CSS classes are independent from the underlying HTML.
