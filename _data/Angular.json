Previously, this was done with\r\nfullTemplateTypeCheck: true, even if strictTemplates was false.

In ES5 format this results in class declarations that have the following form:\r\n\r\n```\r\nvar Child = /** @class */ (function (_super) {\r\n    __extends(Child_Inner, _super);\r\n    function Child_Inner() {...}\r\n    return Child_Inner;\r\n}(Parent));\r\n```\r\n\r\nBut then ngcc is adding definitions into the class as follows:\r\n\r\n```\r\nvar Child = /** @class */ (function (_super) {\r\n    __extends(Child_Inner, _super);\r\n    function Child_Inner() {...}\r\n    Child.ɵfac = ...;\r\n    Child.ɵdir = ...;\r\n    return Child_Inner;\r\n}(Parent));\r\n```\r\n\r\nNote that the new definitions are referring to `Child` which is the outer class identifier.\r\n\r\nUnfortunately this `Child` identifier has not been initialised at the time the definitions are attached, so we get a `Reference` error.\r\n\r\nOne approach was to move the definitions outside of the IIFE as follows:\r\n\r\n```\r\nvar Child = /** @class */ (function (_super) {\r\n    __extends(Child_Inner, _super);\r\n    function Child_Inner() {...}\r\n    return Child_Inner;\r\n}(Parent));\r\nChild.ɵfac = ...;\r\nChild.ɵdir = ...;\r\n```\r\nThis works for this case, but fails if the decorator definition contains references to identifiers that are only defined inside the IIFE. For example:\r\n\r\n```\r\nvar BrowserModule = /** @class */ (function () {\r\n    function BrowserModule(parentModule) {...}\r\n    BrowserModule_1 = BrowserModule;\r\n    var BrowserModule_1;\r\n    BrowserModule = BrowserModule_1 = __decorate([\r\n      __param(0, Optional()),\r\n      __param(0, SkipSelf()),\r\n      __param(0, Inject(BrowserModule_1)),\r\n      __metadata(\"design:paramtypes\", [Object])\r\n    ], BrowserModule);\r\n    return BrowserModule;\r\n}());\r\nBrowserModule.ɵmod = ɵngcc0.ɵɵdefineNgModule({ type: BrowserModule });\r\nBrowserModule.ɵinj = ɵngcc0.ɵɵdefineInjector({\r\n  factory: function BrowserModule_Factory(t) {\r\n    return new (t || BrowserModule)(ɵngcc0.ɵɵinject(BrowserModule_1, 12));\r\n  },\r\n  providers: BROWSER_MODULE_PROVIDERS,\r\n  imports: [CommonModule, ApplicationModule]\r\n});\r\n```\r\n\r\nHere you can see that the `ɵɵdefineInjector()` call references `BrowserModule_1` which is only defined within the IIFE.\r\n\r\nAlso this is not correct because it stops the class from being tree shaken, since the IIFE is the unit of tree shaking.\r\n\r\nSo the proper solution is to teach ngcc/ngtsc which identifiers to use when generating ES5 definitions.\r\n","Url":"https://github.com/angular/angular/pull/33533","RelatedDescription":"Open PR \"ngcc - use inner/outer class names as appropriate\" (#33533)"},{"Id":"516182890","IsPullRequest":false,"CreatedAt":"2019-11-01T15:28:55","Actor":"mattlewis92","Number":"33532","RawContent":null,"Title":"Ivy: fullTemplateTypeCheck never completes","State":"open","Body":"<!--🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅\r\n\r\nOh hi there! 😄\r\n\r\nTo expedite issue processing please search open and closed issues before submitting a new one.\r\nExisting issues often contain information about workarounds, resolution, or progress updates.\r\n\r\n🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅-->\r\n\r\n\r\n# 🐞 bug report\r\n\r\n### Affected Package\r\nThe issue is caused by package @angular/compiler\r\n\r\n\r\n### Is this a regression?\r\nYes, the previous version in which this bug was not present was 8.x\r\n\r\n\r\n### Description\r\nWhen testing 9.x on our app it never completed with `fullTemplateTypeCheck` enabled.

This function returns locales that have been explicitly registered, the same as before v9, by a call to `registerLocaleData()` but now it will also fallback to looking for the locale data on the global scope, `ng.common.locale[..]`.\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\nThe previous PR #33504 simply updated the current locale files, which are UMD, to support being attached to global scope. This is not optimal for a number of reasons:\r\n\r\n* The locale data lookup is based on a normalized form of the locale name, which is not included in the UMD files. This meant that the global lookup had to do an O(n) search of the global locales to match the normalized locale name.\r\n* The UMD locale files contain a large amount of boilerplate to handle the different usage scenarios. Also the current locale files are split into \"basic\" and \"extra\" bundles, each containing the boilerplate. Since the locale scripts must be applied during translation, after the build has completed, there is little chance to compact these files and so the resulting bundle sizes (e.g. of `main.js`) are increased significantly.\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\nThis PR takes a different approach. The locale data files are generated from CLDR data on a periodic basis. Therefore it is straightforward to generate additional locale files that are optimised for the global attachment use case that is required here. These new files have the following properties:\r\n\r\n* Each \"global\" locale data file contains both the \"basic\" and \"extra\" data in a single file, pre-arranged in the format that `findLocaleData()` requires.\r\n* The files do not contain any general UMD boilerplate. They contain a simple IIFE that attaches the locale data to the appropriate global scope.\r\n* The name of the property on the global scope is the \"normalized\" locale name, making it trivial to retrieve the locale data in the `findLocaleData()` function.","Url":"https://github.com/angular/angular/pull/33523","RelatedDescription":"Open PR \"i18n - support global locale data\" (#33523)"},{"Id":"515744098","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2019-10-31T21:02:52","Actor":"JoostK","Number":"33522","RawContent":null,"Title":"fix(ivy): ensure module scope is rebuild on dependent change","State":"open","Body":"During incremental compilations, ngtsc needs to know which metadata\r\nfrom a previous compilation can be reused, versus which metadata has to\r\nbe recomputed as some dependency was updated.

This causes the app compilation to break, and potentially breaks subsequent migrations as the TS project is no longer valid (e.g. the undecorated classes-with-di migration).\r\n\r\nThe migration currently naively assumes the `main.ts` files is always next to the tsconfig.\r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/angular/angular-cli/blob/e70a2b04bd6bcc545e8f994601acecd75d0c6084/packages/schematics/angular/migrations/update-9/update-app-tsconfigs.ts#L85-L89\r\n\r\nThis is not very reliable as often the target is structured differently, or the `main.ts` file has a different name. This is totally valid since there is an builder option called `main` that can be set to an arbitrary file.\r\n\r\nIdeally the migration would not try to guess the path to the main file, but rather rely on the builder options. An example of a scenario that currently breaks:\r\n\r\n```\r\n| packages/my-lib/tsconfig.json\r\n| packages/my-lib/src/main.ts \r\n```\r\n\r\nIn those cases, the current migration logic will insert `./main.ts` into the tsconfig, while it should be actually `./src/main.ts`. Same most likely applies to the `polyfills.ts` file. Ideally this would be resolved through the `polyfills` builder option.\r\n\r\ncc. @filipesilva ","Url":"https://github.com/angular/angular-cli/issues/16035","RelatedDescription":"Open issue \"v9 migration for updating project tsconfig creates invalid file references\" (#16035)"},{"Id":"516401680","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2019-11-01T23:41:33","Actor":"muradm","Number":"16034","RawContent":null,"Title":"feat(@angular/cli): Support XDG Base Directory Specfication","State":"open","Body":"Explained here: https://specifications.freedesktop.org/basedir-spec/basedir-spec-latest.html\r\n\r\nCurrent change affects reading of global config from `.angular-config.json`.

This\r\nmeans that the packages-dist script fails in case release output\r\nhas been built previously. This has only an effect in non-windows\r\nenvironments.\r\n\r\nWe can reasonably fix this by making the folder/files writable\r\nbefore trying to delete them.
