The repo is here - [https://github.com/alvipeo/ng8-callback](https://github.com/alvipeo/ng8-callback).\r\n\r\nIn two words - I need Oauth 2.0 implicit flow auth and I use Azure B2C for that. When user logs in he's redirected to azure and then redirected back to my app with this request:\r\n\r\n>> https://localhost:4200/run#state=dc81c410-4cbd-4218-bc78-9c5b5e9bebe5&client_info={...}\r\n\r\nSince `/run#state` doesn't work I rewrite it to `/run/state` using router events subscription. And then I have the `:state` defined in my routes. So it should just work.\r\n\r\nI can open the page successfully with the rewritten Url in a browser:\r\n>> https://localhost:4200/run/state=f5f2c20f-ed72-4631-b834-80bf60aa6cd7&client_info={...}\r\n\r\nBut when this same request comes from authority angular router redirects user to the root (`/`)!\r\nAnd it does seem to me as a bug. If not, no one could tell me what's wrong with my code.\r\n\r\nMore details on the problem - https://stackoverflow.com/q/58716466/2896495.\r\n","Url":"https://github.com/angular/angular/issues/33610","RelatedDescription":"Open issue \"Angular 8 request from authority reply causes redirect to root\" (#33610)"},{"Id":"518191759","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2019-11-06T02:10:46","Actor":"AndrewKushnir","Number":"33609","RawContent":null,"Title":"fix(ivy): wrap functions from \"providers\" in parentheses in Closure mode","State":"open","Body":"Due to the fact that Tsickle runs between analyze and transform phases in Angular, Tsickle may transform nodes (add comments with type annotations for Closure) that we captured during the analyze phase. As a result, some patterns where a function is returned from another function may trigger automatic semicolon insertion, which breaks the code (makes functions return `undefined` instead of a function). In order to avoid the problem, this commit updates the code to wrap all functions in some expression (\"privders\" and \"viewProviders\") in parentheses.

regression?\r\n\r\n<!-- Did this behavior use to work in the previous version? -->\r\nNot sure\r\n\r\n\r\n### Description\r\nI have an angular library `my-lib` which makes a api call in using `http.get('/api/products')`. This library is built using `ng build my-lib`. \r\n\r\nThere is the app `my-app` which is using the `my-lib` library, my app itself makes an api call using `http.get('/api/orders')`. \r\n\r\n`my-app` is built using\r\n\r\n`ng build --prod --base-href=/mib2b/ --deploy-url=/mib2b/`\r\n\r\nNow the issue is that when the app run the following api calls are initiated \r\n```\r\nlocalhost:4200/mib2b/api/orders\r\nlocalhost:4200/api/products\r\n```\r\nAs we can see the call from within the library is not honoring the base-href. \r\nIs there a reason why this is like that and i believe it should be fixed.\r\n\r\n\r\n## 🌍 Your Environment\r\n<pre><code>\r\nAngular CLI: 8.1.3\r\nNode: 10.16.3\r\nOS: linux x64\r\nAngular: 8.1.3\r\n... animations, cli, common, compiler, compiler-cli, core, forms\r\n... language-service, platform-browser, platform-browser-dynamic\r\n... router\r\n\r\nPackage                           Version\r\n-----------------------------------------------------------\r\n@angular-devkit/architect         0.801.3\r\n@angular-devkit/build-angular     0.801.3\r\n@angular-devkit/build-optimizer   0.801.3\r\n@angular-devkit/build-webpack     0.801.3\r\n@angular-devkit/core              8.1.3\r\n@angular-devkit/schematics        8.1.3\r\n@angular/http                     7.2.15\r\n@ngtools/webpack                  8.1.3\r\n@schematics/angular               8.1.3\r\n@schematics/update                0.801.3\r\nrxjs                              6.4.0\r\ntypescript                        3.4.5\r\nwebpack                           4.35.2\r\n\r\n</code></pre>\r\n\r\n**Anything else relevant?**\r\n<!-- ✍️Is this a browser specific issue?

Thanks for that!\r\n\r\nI have some problems creating a nice developer workflow, with nice I mean serving es5 compliant code (also for testing). I know about the option creating a special tsconfig-es5.app.json for that purpose and then run with `ng serve --configuration es5`. But this does not solve my problem involving a library (also included in the git repo)\r\n\r\n## 🔬 Minimal Reproduction\r\nI created a GitHub repository, where the code for the following two approaches lives.\r\n\r\n**First Approach**\r\ncheckout https://github.com/shiftcode/ng-issue-investigation/tree/%231-es2015-build-only\r\n\r\n```\r\nnpm i\r\nnpx ng build\r\n```\r\n\r\n\r\nThe typescript library delivers a single artifact with `tsconfig.target = es2015`. When running `npx ng build` everything works as expected. The es2015 class construct will be transpiled to function, so legacy (es5) browsers are supported (yes IE11, looking at you).\r\n\r\n\r\n```\r\n// vendor-es5.js\r\n/***/ \"./node_modules/@sample/ts-library/dist/_es2015/messenger.js\":\r\n/*!*******************************************************************!*\\\r\n  !*** ./node_modules/@sample/ts-library/dist/_es2015/messenger.js ***!\r\n  \\*******************************************************************/\r\n/*! exports provided: Messenger */\r\n/***/ (function (module, __webpack_exports__, __webpack_require__) {\r\n  \"use strict\";\r\n  __webpack_require__.r(__webpack_exports__);\r\n  /* harmony export (binding) */ __webpack_require__.d(__webpack_exports__, \"Messenger\", function () { return Messenger; });\r\n  var Messenger = /** @class */ (function () {\r\n    function Messenger() {\r\n    }\r\n    Messenger.prototype.talk = function () {\r\n      return 'i am just talking';\r\n    };\r\n    return Messenger;\r\n  }());\r\n  //# sourceMappingURL=messenger.js.map\r\n  /***/\r\n})\r\n```\r\n\r\nwhen running `ng serve --configuration es5` IE11 will fail with syntax error, because es2015 class is not transpiled by webpack.\r\n\r\n``` \r\n// vendor.js\r\n/***/ \"./node_modules/@sample/ts-library/dist/_es2015/messenger.js\":\r\n/*!*******************************************************************!*\\\r\n  !*** ./node_modules/@sample/ts-library/dist/_es2015/messenger.js ***!\r\n  \\*******************************************************************/\r\n/*! exports provided: Messenger */\r\n/***/ (function(module, __webpack_exports__, __webpack_require__) {\r\n\r\n\"use strict\";\r\n__webpack_require__.r(__webpack_exports__);\r\n/* harmony export (binding) */ __webpack_require__.d(__webpack_exports__, \"Messenger\", function() { return Messenger; });\r\nclass Messenger {\r\n    talk() {\r\n        return 'i am just talking';\r\n    }\r\n}\r\n//# sourceMappingURL=messenger.js.map\r\n```\r\n\r\nso this approach does not work.\r\n\r\n**Second Approach**\r\ncheckout https://github.com/shiftcode/ng-issue-investigation/tree/%232-multi-platform-lib-build\r\n\r\nRun the following in ng-client:\r\n```\r\nnpm i \r\nnpx ng serve --configuration es5\r\n```\r\n\r\nThe library now provides different entry points, check [package.json](https://github.com/shiftcode/ng-issue-investigation/blob/%232-multi-platform-lib-build/ts-library/package.json) . This is actually the preferred approach, because then we could also use esNext features, because we have a separate build (`tsc --target es5`) transpiling unsupported features.\r\n\r\nWhen running `npx ng serve --configuration es5` everything works as expected in IE11. In comparison running `npx ng build` will not load the correct file for es5 build, instead it loads from `ts-library/dist/_es2015`. (check vendor-es5.js and you will see the string _i am just talking es2015_ instead of _i am just talking es5_).\r\n\r\nSo for me the question remains about how differential loading supports IE11 with live reloading. Hopefully you can also shed some light in why the files are not loaded / or transpiled as expected.\r\n\r\nThanks in advance for any help!\r\n\r\n## 🔥 Exception or Error\r\nPlease see the description above.\r\n\r\n\r\n## 🌍 Your Environment\r\n<pre><code>\r\nAngular CLI: 8.3.17\r\nNode: 12.12.0\r\nOS: darwin x64\r\nAngular: 8.2.13\r\n... animations, common, compiler, compiler-cli, core, forms\r\n... language-service, platform-browser, platform-browser-dynamic\r\n... router\r\n\r\nPackage                           Version\r\n-----------------------------------------------------------\r\n@angular-devkit/architect         0.803.17\r\n@angular-devkit/build-angular     0.803.17\r\n@angular-devkit/build-optimizer   0.803.17\r\n@angular-devkit/build-webpack     0.803.17\r\n@angular-devkit/core              8.3.17\r\n@angular-devkit/schematics        8.3.17\r\n@angular/cli                      8.3.17\r\n@ngtools/webpack                  8.3.17\r\n@schematics/angular               8.3.17\r\n@schematics/update                0.803.17\r\nrxjs                              6.4.0\r\ntypescript                        3.5.3\r\nwebpack                           4.39.2\r\n</code></pre>","Url":"https://github.com/angular/angular-cli/issues/16069","RelatedDescription":"Open issue \"Inconsistency between ng build and ng serve with differential loading\" (#16069)"},{"Id":"517748123","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2019-11-05T12:39:22","Actor":"filipesilva","Number":"16067","RawContent":null,"Title":"ci: bump cache key","State":"open","Body":"Our yarn cache is now at 4gb:\r\n```\r\nNo cache is found for key: angular_devkit-0.11.0-m+RxJhhe6Gc_rzgntffBpEs5LmGYauhWKuRZBYBtlP0=\r\nFound a cache from build 106076 at angular_devkit-0.11.0\r\nSize: 4.0 GB\r\nCached paths:\r\n  * /home/circleci/.cache/yarn\r\n\r\nDownloading cache archive...\r\nUnarchiving cache...\r\n```\r\n\r\nBy bumping the cache key we'll reset it.","Url":"https://github.com/angular/angular-cli/pull/16067","RelatedDescription":"Open PR \"ci: bump cache key\" (#16067)"},{"Id":"517707215","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2019-11-05T11:10:57","Actor":"renovate[bot]","Number":"16065","RawContent":null,"Title":"build: update @babel/core to version 7.7.0","State":"open","Body":"This PR contains the following updates:\n\n| Package | Type | Update | Change |\n|---|---|---|---|\n| [@babel/core](https://babeljs.io/) ([source](https://togithub.com/babel/babel)) | dependencies | minor | [`7.6.4` -> `7.7.0`](https://renovatebot.com/diffs/npm/@babel%2fcore/7.6.4/7.7.0) |\n| [@babel/generator](https://babeljs.io/) ([source](https://togithub.com/babel/babel)) | dependencies | minor | [`7.6.4` -> `7.7.0`](https://renovatebot.com/diffs/npm/@babel%2fgenerator/7.6.4/7.7.0) |\n| [@babel/preset-env](https://babeljs.io/) ([source](https://togithub.com/babel/babel)) | dependencies | minor | [`7.6.3` -> `7.7.1`](https://renovatebot.com/diffs/npm/@babel%2fpreset-env/7.6.3/7.7.1) |\n\n---\n\n### Release Notes\n\n<details>\n<summary>babel/babel</summary>\n\n### [`v7.7.0`](https://togithub.com/babel/babel/blob/master/CHANGELOG.md#v770-2019-11-05)\n\n[Compare Source](https://togithub.com/babel/babel/compare/v7.6.4...v7.7.0)\n\n##### :eyeglasses: Spec Compliance\n\n-   `babel-types`\n    -   [#&#8203;10621](https://togithub.com/babel/babel/pull/10621) throw a TypeError if identifier validation fails.

Currently, `@angular/cli` keeps its global configuration in `$HOME/.angular-config.json` which is poluting user's home directory. According to mentioned above specification, it is advised to keep configuration under `$HOME/.config` directory by default.\r\n\r\n### Describe the solution you'd like\r\nNon intrusive solution is provided with #16034 PR. Basically it makes everything working as it is now, until user decides to move current `$HOME/.angular-config.json` to `$XDG_CONFIG_HOME/angular/.angular-config.json`. Then `@angular/cli` will continue using `.angular-config.json` from new location. Where `$XDG_CONFIG_HOME` as per specification: if provided in the environment new location will be `$XDG_CONFIG_HOME/angular/.angular-config.json` other wise `$HOME/.config/angular/.angular-config.json`. This way it does not break other non XDG users like people under Windows.\r\n\r\n### Describe alternatives you've considered\r\nNo alternatives.","Url":"https://github.com/angular/angular-cli/issues/16049","RelatedDescription":"Open issue \"Support XDG Base Directory Specfication\" (#16049)"},{"Id":"516687667","IsPullRequest":false,"CreatedAt":"2019-11-02T18:55:07","Actor":"doom777","Number":"16047","RawContent":null,"Title":"i18n-locale should inject dir attribute","State":"open","Body":"<!--🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅\r\n\r\nOh hi there! 😄\r\n\r\nTo expedite issue processing please search open and closed issues before submitting a new one.\r\nExisting issues often contain information about workarounds, resolution, or progress updates.\r\n\r\n🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅-->\r\n\r\n\r\n# 🚀 Feature request\r\nAdd dir=\"rtl\" for rtl locales\r\n\r\n### Command (mark with an `x`)\r\n<!-- Can you pin-point the command or commands that are relevant for this feature request? -->\r\n<!-- ✍️edit: -->\r\n```\r\n- [ ] new\r\n- [ x ] build\r\n- [ ] serve\r\n- [ ] test\r\n- [ ] e2e\r\n- [ ] generate\r\n- [ ] add\r\n- [ ] update\r\n- [ ] lint\r\n- [ ] xi18n\r\n- [ ] run\r\n- [ ] config\r\n- [ ] help\r\n- [ ] version\r\n- [ ] doc\r\n```\r\n\r\n### Description\r\n<!-- ✍️--> A clear and concise description of the problem or missing capability...\r\nAngular pages are always LTR, even when specifying an rtl language in `i18n-locale` parameter\r\n\r\n### Describe the solution you'd like\r\n<!-- ✍️--> If you have a solution in mind, please describe it.\r\nWhen running build with `i18n-locale` set to an RTL language such as Hebrew or Arabic, add `dir=\"rtl\"` to html or body tags in index.html.\r\nI know that the cli can modify the html, because `base-href` parameter does it\r\n\r\n### Describe alternatives you've considered\r\n<!-- ✍️--> Have you considered any alternative solutions or workarounds?\r\nManually setting the dir tag, but then what happens if I want to support different build configs for rtl, and ltr locales?

However, this may be troublesome especially if there's a long amount of text to be copied.\r\n\r\nWhat I'm suggesting is to use the [`Clipboard.writeText`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Clipboard/writeText)  method from the [Clipboard API](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Clipboard_API).\r\n\r\nHere's a description of the Clipboard API:\r\n\r\n> The **Clipboard API** provides the ability to respond to clipboard commands (cut, copy, and paste) as well as to asynchronously read from and write to the system clipboard. Access to the contents of the clipboard is gated behind the [Permissions API](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Permissions_API); without user permission, reading or altering the clipboard contents is not permitted.\r\n>\r\n> This API is designed to supersede accessing the clipboard using [`document.execCommand()`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Document/execCommand). _- from [MDN docs for the Clipboard API](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Clipboard_API)_\r\n\r\nCurrently, the Clipboard API is supported in the following browsers:\r\n\r\n![Screenshot of supported browsers table from Clipboard API document on MDN](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/20047125/68081369-f353cf80-fe47-11e9-8d5d-e29bbd04b7a4.jpg)\r\n\r\nHowever, according to the [MDN docs for \"Clipboard availability\"](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Clipboard#Clipboard_availability), it mentions that:\r\n\r\n> The asynchronous clipboard API is a relatively recent addition, and the process of implementing it in browsers is not yet complete. Due to both potential security concerns and technical complexities, the process of integrating this API is happening gradually in most browsers.\r\n\r\n#### Use Case\r\n\r\nThis would add another method of copying text instead of the current approach.","Url":"https://github.com/angular/components/issues/17593","RelatedDescription":"Open issue \"[Clipboard] Add support for Clipboard Web API\" (#17593)"},{"Id":"516786711","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2019-11-03T06:17:45","Actor":"crisbeto","Number":"17592","RawContent":null,"Title":"fix(select): select active item when tabbing away","State":"open","Body":"Currently `mat-select` closes the panel when the user tabs away, however the native select picks the currently-highlighted option.
