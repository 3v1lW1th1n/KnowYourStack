Also, given that for some reason `Renderer` does not have a handy method `toggleClass(classname, condition)`, that code becomes even more verbose.\r\n\r\n### Suggested syntax\r\n\r\nIn order to assure backwards compatibility (for users who have already used the current behavior to purposely override all existing classes), `HostBindingDecorator` could accept a config parameter, something like: `@HostBinding('class', {append: true})` to explicitly specify new behavior with `true`.\r\n\r\n","Url":"https://github.com/angular/angular/issues/29188","RelatedDescription":"Closed issue \"HostBinding('class') syntax to honor hosts's existing classes\" (#29188)"},{"Id":"418764840","IsPullRequest":false,"CreatedAt":"2019-03-08T12:19:34","Actor":"aryaroudi","Number":"29187","RawContent":null,"Title":"ngUpgrade: The problem with upgrade the directives that use `require` attribute","State":"open","Body":"# 🐞 bug report\r\n\r\n### Affected Package\r\n<!-- Can you pin-point one or more @angular/* packages as the source of the bug? -->\r\n<!-- ✍️edit: --> The issue is caused by package @angular/upgrade/static\r\n\r\n\r\n### Is this a regression?\r\n\r\n<!-- Did this behavior use to work in the previous version? -->\r\n<!-- ✍️--> No\r\n\r\n\r\n### Description\r\n\r\n<!-- ✍️--> I upgraded an AJS directive that uses `require` attribute and needs the other directive controller:\r\n\r\n```\r\n            return {\r\n                restrict: 'E',\r\n                require: '^uiDrop',\r\n                scope: true,\r\n                controllerAs: 'uiDropTarget'\r\n            };\r\n```\r\n\r\nSo the question is how it should see the required controller in the upgraded directive?

Valid options are 'parent', 'manual', 'conventional-commits'.\"\r\n    },\r\n    \"registry\": {\r\n      \"type\": \"string\",\r\n      \"description\": \"The NPM registry to publish to.\"\r\n    },\r\n    \"git-commit\": {\r\n      \"type\": \"boolean\",\r\n      \"description\": \"Should changes to each package.json be committed?\"\r\n    },\r\n    \"git-tag\": {\r\n      \"type\": \"boolean\",\r\n      \"description\": \"Should a tag be generated for each package?\"\r\n    },\r\n    \"git-push\": {\r\n      \"type\": \"boolean\",\r\n      \"description\": \"Should the generated commit and tags be pushed to master?\"\r\n    }\r\n  },\r\n  \"additionalProperties\": false,\r\n  \"required\": [\r\n    \"versionStrategy\"\r\n  ]\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\n### Describe alternatives you've considered\r\nI've written my own jenkinsfile, gitlab build, etc, to manage this, however updating the versions before release is still a bit annoying.","Url":"https://github.com/angular/angular-cli/issues/13836","RelatedDescription":"Closed issue \"Publish Builder\" (#13836)"},{"Id":"417754514","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2019-03-06T19:27:06","Actor":"alan-agius4","Number":"13830","RawContent":null,"Title":"feat(@schematics/angular): relocate `ng g service-worker` files","State":"closed","Body":"This is a follow up on https://github.com/angular/angular-cli/pull/13811, with this now all application have the same structure and hence `ng g service-worker` should follow suit and have the same folder structure if generated in a root app, or an app inside the projects.","Url":"https://github.com/angular/angular-cli/pull/13830","RelatedDescription":"Closed or merged PR \"feat(@schematics/angular): relocate `ng g service-worker` files\" (#13830)"},{"Id":"417943617","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2019-03-06T18:18:33","Actor":"hansl","Number":"13835","RawContent":null,"Title":"feat(@angular-devkit/core): analytics interfaces and basic implementations","State":"open","Body":"This is a preliminary analytics interface.

Here is a simplified example.\r\n\r\n```typescript\r\nconst baseStyleRed = {\r\n  backgroundColor: 'red',\r\n};\r\n\r\nconst baseStyleBlue = {\r\n  backgroundColor: 'blue',\r\n};\r\n\r\nexport const appAnimations = [\r\n  trigger('boxTransition', [\r\n    state(\r\n      'red',\r\n      style({\r\n      ...baseStyleRed,\r\n      })\r\n    ),\r\n\r\n    state(\r\n      'blue',\r\n      style({\r\n        ...baseStyleBlue,\r\n      }),\r\n    ),\r\n\r\n    transition('blue <=> red', [animate('250ms ease-out')]),\r\n  ]),\r\n];\r\n```\r\n\r\nEssentially AOT breaks the animation because it doesn't spread the base styles into object passed to the style function. I was able to determine this by looking at the AOT output.\r\n\r\nI have included a reproduction below. It should switch between a red and blue square and never be green. If it's green then you know the styles for the animation states are not being applied.\r\n\r\nThe issue disappears if you check out the commit before the latest and run the prod build again\r\n\r\n## 🔬 Minimal Reproduction\r\n<!--\r\nSimple steps to reproduce this bug.\r\n\r\nPlease include: commands run (including args), packages added, related code changes.\r\n\r\nIf reproduction steps are not enough for reproduction of your issue, please create a minimal GitHub repository with the reproduction of the issue. \r\nA good way to make a minimal reproduction is to create a new app via `ng new repro-app` and add the minimum possible code to show the problem. \r\nShare the link to the repo below along with step-by-step instructions to reproduce the problem, as well as expected and actual behavior.\r\n\r\nIssues that don't have enough info and can't be reproduced will be closed.\r\n\r\nYou can read more about issue submission guidelines here: https://github.com/angular/angular-cli/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md#-submitting-an-issue\r\n-->\r\n\r\n[Reproduction Repo](https://github.com/adamduren/angular-animation-issue/)\r\n[Commit that introduces the bug](https://github.com/adamduren/angular-animation-issue/commit/6ed5395d08ec9a6db8444fb585ead1e3b2d6ffe5)\r\n\r\n```\r\n> git clone git@github.com:adamduren/angular-animation-issue.git\r\n> cd angular-animation-issue\r\n> npm i\r\n> npm run build -- --prod\r\n> cd dist/angular-animation-issue\r\n> npx http-server -p 8000\r\n```\r\n\r\n## 🔥 Exception or Error\r\n<pre><code>N/A</code></pre>\r\n\r\n\r\n## 🌍 Your Environment\r\n<pre><code>Angular CLI: 7.2.4\r\nNode: 10.14.1\r\nOS: darwin x64\r\nAngular: 7.2.7\r\n... animations, common, compiler, compiler-cli, core, forms\r\n... language-service, platform-browser, platform-browser-dynamic\r\n... router\r\n\r\nPackage                           Version\r\n-----------------------------------------------------------\r\n@angular-devkit/architect         0.12.4\r\n@angular-devkit/build-angular     0.12.4\r\n@angular-devkit/build-optimizer   0.12.4\r\n@angular-devkit/build-webpack     0.12.4\r\n@angular-devkit/core              7.2.4\r\n@angular-devkit/schematics        7.2.4\r\n@angular/cli                      7.2.4\r\n@ngtools/webpack                  7.2.4\r\n@schematics/angular               7.2.4\r\n@schematics/update                0.12.4\r\nrxjs                              6.3.3\r\ntypescript                        3.2.4\r\nwebpack                           4.28.4</code></pre>\r\n\r\n**Anything else relevant?**\r\n<!-- ✍️Is this a browser specific issue?

Solution is requested in terms of best practices and/or feature enhancements.\r\n\r\n#### What is the use-case or motivation for this proposal?\r\nWhen using a custom component with a form, the form changes need to be watched and emitted to the parent. If the form has values that ought to be readonly, til now I've used the disabled flag *as a workaround* because a) readonly fields have poor visual appearance -- they are not greyed out b) formbuilder supports initializing as disabled, but not initializing as readonly (as shown here https://angular.io/api/forms/FormBuilder#control).\r\n\r\nHowever, when using the workaround, it becomes difficult to watch and emit changes \"cleanly\" for disabled fields e.g. subscribing to form.valueChanges doesn't get disabled fields, necessitating a duplicative call to getRawValue() after subscribing to changes, to get all the form field data.\r\n\r\n#### Is there anything else we should know?\r\nPotential solutions:\r\na) advise if using readonly attribute is the best practice, rather than using 'disabled' to prevent data entry. If so, hoping there can be some improvements on styling of readonly controls (e.g. they should be greyed out), and also formbuilder should be able to initialize them as readonly. \r\n\r\nb) if angular doesn't intend to support readonly atribute, and instead rely on 'disabled' attribute, then ideally there would be something similar to form.valueChanges that actually gets all form values including disabled controls. \r\n\r\nIf (b) is the solution path, then it's low priority admittedly, since it just avoids a little code duplication. I think the core question though is whether there ought to be better support for readonly controls, and if the angular framework intends to maintain a distinction between 'disabled' vs. 'readonly'. \r\n\r\nFor my purposes, I mainly disable controls in order to achieve the readonly effect, and then I make a point to getRawValue data so i get all the data. From my research on stackoverflow etc. it appears others do similar workarounds.","Url":"https://github.com/angular/material2/issues/15399","RelatedDescription":"Open issue \"improve support for readonly controls OR improve how to subscribe to form changes with disabled controls\" (#15399)"},{"Id":"417787958","IsPullRequest":false,"CreatedAt":"2019-03-06T12:51:50","Actor":"adarowiec","Number":"15398","RawContent":null,"Title":"[Virtual scrolling] Introduce immutable.js as a valid input for iteration","State":"open","Body":"#### Please describe the feature you would like to request.\r\n\r\nMaybe I'm mistaken but there is no way to get immutable.js List working in cdkVirtualFor directive.
