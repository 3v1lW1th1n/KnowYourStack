If further fixes many (but not all) issues flagged by\r\nstatic code analysis.\r\n\r\nFor easier reference, the existing `WmlComparer` class is temporarily retained in the `OpenXmlPowerTools.Previous` namespace. For organizational purposes, the refactored version is stored in the`Comparer` folder, which does however not create a namespace.\r\n\r\nThe objective of this commit is to not create breaking changes. The one exception is the removal of the internal `WmlComparer.Coalesce` method, which was only invoked in one unit test. This is deemed a left-over from previous rewrites and is thus removed. The unit test is commented out for now.\r\n\r\nThis pull request essentially prepares the `WmlComparer` for future enhancements."}],"ResultType":"GitHubEvent"}},"RunOn":"2018-11-19T05:30:39.8064462Z","RunDurationInMilliseconds":1418}
