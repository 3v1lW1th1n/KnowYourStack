The note can be added as part of the source\r\ncode pull request itself, or it can be added in a separate follow-up\r\npull request shortly afterward.\r\n\r\nIf the note for a new feature uses images, the images can be added to\r\n`Documentation/release-notes/images/`.\r\n\r\nAuthors of new fixes and improvements don't need to do anything special\r\nif their changes get cherry-picked from `master` to a release branch.\r\nThe team members who handle final release notes preparation and\r\npublication will copy or move notes as needed from `master.md` to\r\nearlier releases for changes that get cherry-picked.\r\n\r\nThe `master.md` template follows the same section order as the [final\r\npublished release notes][0], but it omits a few details like release\r\ndates that aren't needed in the draft format.\r\n\r\nThe final notes also follow the text formatting rules described in the\r\n[xamarin-docs contribution guidelines][1].  The draft notes don't need\r\nto follow those guidelines too strictly.  For example, it's fine to use\r\nbackticks around paths in these draft notes rather than italics.  That\r\nmakes it easier to avoid unintentional formatting issues when paths\r\ninclude characters like `_` or `*`.\r\n\r\nSimilarly, there's no need to worry about list indentation or line\r\nwrapping in these draft notes.  Authors can optionally wrap lines to 80\r\ncharacters and indent list items to match the example items, but it's\r\nnot required.\r\n\r\nAs part of branching for a new release, the current `master.md` file\r\nwill be renamed to match the new release branch name, and a new empty\r\ntemplate `master.md` file will be added by copying the original template\r\nfrom this commit and updating the version numbers.\r\n\r\n[0]: https://docs.microsoft.com/xamarin/android/release-notes/\r\n[1]: https://github.com/MicrosoftDocs/xamarin-docs/blob/live/contributing-guidelines/template.md"},{"Id":"9957576787","Type":"PullRequestEvent","CreatedAt":"2019-07-05T17:23:24","Actor":"jonpryor","Repository":"xamarin/xamarin-android","Organization":"xamarin","RawContent":null,"RelatedAction":"merged","RelatedUrl":"https://github.com/xamarin/xamarin-android/pull/3328","RelatedDescription":"Merged pull request \"Increase AndroidClientHandler timeouts\" (#3328) at xamarin/xamarin-android","RelatedBody":"`AndroidClientHandler` has no way of accessing the `HttpClient.Timeout` property\r\nin order to set the timeout value of *two* native http client\r\nproperties (connect and read timeouts) and so it uses two custom properties to\r\nprovide these values. So far, the values were set to 100s for the read timeout\r\nand 120s for the connect timeout, which seemed to be a reasonable value for\r\ntheir purposes. However, if a developer sets `HttpClient.Timeout` to a\r\nvalue *larger* than our defaults, `AndroidClientHandler` values \"win\" and the\r\nconnection/read time out earlier. The workaround is to set \"our\" timeouts along\r\nwith the `HttpClient` one, but if the developer cannot do it, for any kind of\r\nreasons (i.e. to avoid platform-specific code) then they are faced with an\r\nannoying situation.\r\n\r\nThe real fix would be to improve `HttpClient` API so that its associated client\r\nhandler can access `HttpClient` properties, but since it's not a quick fix we\r\ncan implement now, this commit bumps the default timeout values to\r\nthe (unreasonable) value of 24h to make sure we use values higher than the most\r\nlikely figures assigned to `HttpClient.Timeout` and to match Xamarin.iOS\r\nNSUrlSessionHandler defaults."},{"Id":"9957511479","Type":"PullRequestEvent","CreatedAt":"2019-07-05T17:07:37","Actor":"jonpryor","Repository":"xamarin/xamarin-android","Organization":"xamarin","RawContent":null,"RelatedAction":"merged","RelatedUrl":"https://github.com/xamarin/xamarin-android/pull/3320","RelatedDescription":"Merged pull request \"Import Configuration.props in Mono.Android-Test.Library\" (#3320) at xamarin/xamarin-android","RelatedBody":"Context: https://devdiv.visualstudio.com/DevDiv/_build/results?buildId=2819142\r\nContext: https://github.com/xamarin/xamarin-android/commit/e9561076a8e8761002931b886991eb1616561864\r\n\r\nWhen this additional test library was added in e956107 it did not import\r\nour Configuration.props file which contains default paths to the Android\r\ntooling that we provision.
