However, if you want to have supporting information close to a title, like tags, or a byline that would not make sense to be spaced as far as a normal paragraph would, you currently have to manually create that CSS.\r\n\r\nA new modifier class that could be attached to any arbitrary number of items following a title-classed element that would make those elements appear closer to the title (or, indeed, a title + a subtitle) would help alleviate a lot of other manual work that would have to be done to, for instance, easily put things like tags or other elements underneath a title without technically making them subtitles.\r\n","Url":"https://github.com/jgthms/bulma/issues/2346","RelatedDescription":"Open issue \"FR: Add modifier class to allow any arbitrary element to appear closer to a title (not just subtitle)\" (#2346)"},{"Id":"406038870","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2019-02-03T00:42:39","Actor":"sherbst","Number":"2345","RawContent":null,"Title":"Removed typo","State":"open","Body":"<!-- PLEASE READ THE FOLLOWING INSTRUCTIONS -->\r\n<!-- DO NOT REBUILD THE CSS OUTPUT IN YOUR PR -->\r\n\r\n<!-- Choose one of the following: -->\r\nThis is a **documentation fix**.\r\n<!-- Improvement?
