So far, I have been successful by adding the \"skipLocationChange: true\" navigationExtra to all my navigate calls, but when I use the router.navigate or router.navigateByUrl calls in interceptors and (more problematically) guards, the url address bar changes to the path I was originally going to before I was redirected.\r\n\r\nOne temporary solution I came up with for the interceptors was placing the navigate call inside a setTimeout().  I don't know if that is the correct way of handling interceptor redirection, but it stopped posting the previous path in the browser address bar.  However, when I use canActivate guards that redirect for invalid access, it always produces the path prior to redirection in the browser address bar, with or without the setTimeout.  This has been an issue for 7.2 in general since I started the project.\r\n\r\n## üî¨ Minimal Reproduction\r\nEasier to discuss rather than produce on stackblitz.\r\nApplication moves to a new screen:\r\n<pre><code>this.router.navigate(['/newscreen', 'screen2'], {skipLocationChange: true});</code></pre>\r\nApplication navigates to the screen component, which then makes an API call:\r\n<pre><code>this.httpClient.get('/someAPI/someMethod')</code></pre>\r\nUnbeknownst to the application, the authentication token for the user has expired.  So when the call gets made through my token interceptor, an HttpErrorResponse object gets sent back to the application, and gets caught in the catchError section of my interceptor.\r\n<pre><code>\r\nif (error instanceof HttpErrorResponse) {\r\n    if (error.status === 401) {\r\n        setTimeout(() => {\r\n            this.router.navigate(['/not-authenticated'], {skipLocationChange: true});\r\n        });\r\n        return EMPTY;\r\n    }\r\n}\r\nreturn throwError(error);\r\n</code></pre>\r\nIf I do not have this setTimeout call here, the browser address bar changes to localhost:4200/newscreen/screen_2, when it should actually stay at localhost:4200 only.\r\n\r\nIn addition, I tried using a canActivate AuthGuard for accessing a component.  In the code, right after my authentication expired, I clicked a button that would send me to root of the application.\r\n<pre><code>this.router.navigate([''], {skipLocationChange: true});</code></pre>\r\nIn my routing, I have the '' path redirecting to my HomeComponent, which has the canActivate AuthGuard, containing the following code:\r\n<pre><code>\r\nconst userToken = this.authService.getAccessToken();\r\nif (userToken) {\r\n  return true;\r\n}\r\nsetTimeout(() => {\r\n  this.router.navigate(['not-authenticated'], {skipLocationChange: true});\r\n});\r\nreturn false;\r\n</code></pre>\r\nThe guard catches the lost authentication, and redirects the user to the not-authenticated page.  However, in the browser address bar, if '/newscreen/screen_3' was my last path/page I was on, it would NOT be localhost:4200; it would be localhost:4200/newscreen/screen_3.\r\n\r\nThis happens everytime I use guards or resolves, and I don't know if this is the normal use of angular routing, or if this is a bug that needs to be fixed.\r\n\r\n\r\n## üî• Exception or Error\r\n<pre><code>\r\n<!-- If the issue is accompanied by an exception or an error, please share it below: -->\r\n<!-- ‚úçÔ∏è-->\r\n\r\n</code></pre>\r\n\r\n\r\n## üåç  Your Environment\r\n\r\n**Angular Version:**\r\n<pre><code>\r\nAngular CLI: 7.3.8\r\nNode: 11.8.0\r\nOS: win32 x64\r\nAngular: 7.2.12\r\n... animations, common, compiler, compiler-cli, core, forms\r\n... language-service, platform-browser, platform-browser-dynamic\r\n... router\r\n\r\nPackage                           Version\r\n-----------------------------------------------------------\r\n@angular-devkit/architect         0.13.8\r\n@angular-devkit/build-angular     0.13.8\r\n@angular-devkit/build-optimizer   0.13.8\r\n@angular-devkit/build-webpack     0.13.8\r\n@angular-devkit/core              7.3.8\r\n@angular-devkit/schematics        7.3.8\r\n@angular/cli                      7.3.8\r\n@ngtools/webpack                  7.3.8\r\n@schematics/angular               7.3.8\r\n@schematics/update                0.13.8\r\nrxjs                              6.4.0\r\ntypescript                        3.2.4\r\nwebpack                           4.29.0\r\n\r\n</code></pre>\r\n\r\n**Anything else relevant?**\r\n<!-- ‚úçÔ∏èIs this a browser specific issue?
