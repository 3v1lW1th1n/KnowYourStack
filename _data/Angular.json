I think this is somehow related to ZoneJS since this issue seems also be happening in MeteorJS when the ZoneJS Bundle is used there (https://github.com/awsp/handsontable-meteor/issues/17).\n\nYou can reproduce it here: https://valor-software.github.io/ng2-handsontable/\n\n**Steps to reproduce:**\n- Open example page in Chrome (47.0.2526.111)\n- Click on a single row\n- CMD+C (on Mac)\n- Click on a different row (has to be writable)\n- CMD+V\n\nTwo rows are inserted.\n\nAny idea why ZoneJS might cause this issue on Chrome?\n\nBest regards and thank you for your help!\n\nPascal Helfenstein\n","Url":"https://github.com/angular/angular/issues/31754","RelatedDescription":"Open issue \"ZoneJS does not work with Handsontable\" (#31754)"},{"Id":"470789858","IsPullRequest":false,"CreatedAt":"2016-01-04T10:08:57","Actor":"Emnalyeriar","Number":"31755","RawContent":null,"Title":"Global imports with browserify ES6 syntax","State":"open","Body":"I'm using Gulp with Browserify as my build tools.\nAngular2 needs zone as a global variable, normally I would do this like that:\n\n``` javascript\nwindow.zone = require('zone.js');\n```\n\nbut I have a problem when it comes to ES6 syntax and TypeScript.\nTried doing it like this:\n\n``` javascript\nimport 'zone.js';\n(<any>window).Zone = zone;\n```\n\nbut this of course shows an error \"Cannot find name zone' because variable zone is not defined anywhere.\nThen I tried defining it like this:\n\n``` javascript\nimport * as zone from 'zone.js';\n(<any>window).Zone = zone;\n```\n\nand now I get \"Cannot find module zone.js\" but the weird thing is that it works and browserify compiles it correctly.\nAlso tried:\n\n``` javascript\nimport {zone} from 'zone.js';\n```\n\nbut this causes the same error \"Cannot find module zone.js.\n\nCould anyone help me how should I import it correctly?\n","Url":"https://github.com/angular/angular/issues/31755","RelatedDescription":"Open issue \"Global imports with browserify ES6 syntax\" (#31755)"},{"Id":"470789929","IsPullRequest":false,"CreatedAt":"2015-12-17T22:22:19","Actor":"IgorMinar","Number":"31756","RawContent":null,"Title":"Document public api for custom patches","State":"open","Body":"Many non-browser platforms have a need to create custom patches to intercept async events (e.g. cordova, electron, etc).\n\nWe should have a document public api for this stuff.\n\n// @adamdbradley @OlsonDev\n\nRelated to https://github.com/angular/angular/issues/5979\n","Url":"https://github.com/angular/angular/issues/31756","RelatedDescription":"Open issue \"Document public api for custom patches\" (#31756)"},{"Id":"470790100","IsPullRequest":false,"CreatedAt":"2015-11-21T01:10:38","Actor":"mhevery","Number":"31757","RawContent":null,"Title":"We should not be creating new zones all the time.","State":"open","Body":"I am looking at this code:\n\n```\n/**\n * requestAnimationFrame is typically recursively called from within the callback function\n * that it executes.

If we tail recurse into the function we will create zones which are infinitely deep and hence we will leak memory, which is why the comment is there to prevent such a thing from happening.  This is an issue because:\n\n1) it makes `raf` special\n2) It does not actually fix the issue, because another common thing to do is to do `setTimetout(..., 0)` from within itself, hence same problem. \n\nSo my current thinking is that it should only create a new zone if the developer explicitly calls `fork` (which is how it works is Dart). Which means that we need to implement long stack trace in some other way.  \n","Url":"https://github.com/angular/angular/issues/31757","RelatedDescription":"Open issue \"We should not be creating new zones all the time.\" (#31757)"},{"Id":"470790267","IsPullRequest":false,"CreatedAt":"2015-11-12T21:59:48","Actor":"gionkunz","Number":"31758","RawContent":null,"Title":"Implementation specific limitations with Zone.js","State":"open","Body":"While investigating the problems with Indexed DB described in #202 , I've noticed that Zone.js proxies seem to modify scope in a way that can cause problems depending on the implementation of event handling within specific code.\n\nAfter monkey patching https://github.com/angular/zone.js/blob/master/lib/patch/event-target.js and https://github.com/angular/zone.js/blob/master/lib/patch/property-descriptor.js I was able to use Indexed DB with correctly established Zones.

(Original on Stackoverflow)](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/57121368/why-did-the-breakpoints-in-vs19-stop-working-after-angular-8-update)\r\n\r\n**Summarization:**\r\nI just updated my angular webproject yesterday from version 7.2.15 to 8.1.2 with the angular cli and the ng update command. But now if I try to debug my typescript code, all of a sudden the breakpoints won't work anymore in visual studio community 2019?\r\n\r\nSo when I activate a breakpoint, then the breakpoint turns white and shows a label text that says something like: Breakpoint set but not yet bound.\r\n\r\n\r\n**What I've already tried:**\r\nWhen using google I found out that other users had a similiar issue and they resolved the problem by setting inside of tsconfig.json. \r\n\r\n```\r\n\"sourceMap\": true\r\n``` \r\n\r\nUnlucky for me this didn't change anything since my tsconfig.json already had the property sourceMap set to true but the breakpoints still wouldn't get hit.\r\n\r\nMy guess is that the angular update somewhat overwrote some setting in some file, which I'm totally not aware of.\r\n\r\n\r\n**Show some code:**\r\nLooking in to the comparison of my commits, I noticed that in tsconfig.json and package.json files a lot of other stuff has also changed like:\r\n\r\n*tsconfig.json*\r\n```\r\n+ \"downlevelIteration\": true,\r\n- \"module\": \"es2015\",\r\n+ \"module\": \"esnext\",\r\n- \"target\": \"es5\",\r\n+ \"target\": \"es2015\",\r\n```\r\n\r\n*package.json:*\r\n```\r\n- \"@angular-devkit/build-angular\": \"^0.12.4\",\r\n+ \"@angular-devkit/build-angular\": \"~0.801.1\",\r\n- \"codelyzer\": \"~4.5.0\",\r\n+ \"codelyzer\": \"^5.0.1\",\r\n- \"zone.js\": \"~0.8.29\"\r\n+ \"zone.js\": \"~0.9.1\"\r\n- \"typescript\": \"3.1.6\"\r\n+ \"typescript\": \"3.4.5\"\r\n```\r\n\r\n\r\n*tslint.json:*\r\n```\r\n- \"use-input-property-decorator\": true,\r\n- \"use-output-property-decorator\": true,\r\n- \"use-host-property-decorator\": true,\r\n+ \"no-inputs-metadata-property\": true,\r\n+ \"no-outputs-metadata-property\": true,\r\n+ \"no-host-metadata-property\": true,\r\n```\r\n\r\n**Expected Result/Behaviour:** Expected would be that the breakpoints would hit so I could see what was going on in my code. But as said the breakpoints just go white and won't get bound.\r\n\r\n**The final question:** So my question in the end would be: How to get the breakpoints working again in VS2019 after the angular 8 update?\r\n\r\n**(21.07.2019) Edit 1:** Meanwhile I also tried to delete the 'node_modules' folder inside the ClientApp folder and reinstall it again with npm install. Unfortunately the breakpoints still won't get hit. \r\n\r\n**(22.07.2019) Edit 2:** \"This can't be the solution?\" : Seems like reverting angular to version 7.2.15 has fixed the breakpoint issue and I can look in to my breakpoints again.

[I also opened a case over at Stackoverflow, regarding this issue.](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/57121368/why-did-the-breakpoints-in-vs19-stop-working-after-angular-8-update) I'll leave this open in case anyone has a better solution to upgrade from @7.2.15 to @latest stable.","Url":"https://github.com/angular/angular-cli/issues/15139","RelatedDescription":"Closed issue \"Why did the breakpoints in vs19 stop working after angular 8 update?\" (#15139)"},{"Id":"470872789","IsPullRequest":false,"CreatedAt":"2019-07-22T04:18:28","Actor":"jol5","Number":"15141","RawContent":null,"Title":"build --prod will hold lot of time ","State":"closed","Body":"<!--üîÖüîÖüîÖüîÖüîÖüîÖüîÖüîÖüîÖüîÖüîÖüîÖüîÖüîÖüîÖüîÖüîÖüîÖüîÖüîÖüîÖüîÖüîÖüîÖüîÖüîÖüîÖüîÖüîÖüîÖüîÖ\r\n\r\nOh hi there! üòÑ\r\n\r\nTo expedite issue processing please search open and closed issues before submitting a new one.\r\nExisting issues often contain information about workarounds, resolution, or progress updates.\r\n\r\nüîÖüîÖüîÖüîÖüîÖüîÖüîÖüîÖüîÖüîÖüîÖüîÖüîÖüîÖüîÖüîÖüîÖüîÖüîÖüîÖüîÖüîÖüîÖüîÖüîÖüîÖüîÖüîÖüîÖüîÖüîÖüîÖüîÖ-->\r\n\r\n\r\n# üêû Bug report\r\n\r\n### Command (mark with an `x`)\r\n<!-- Can you pin-point the command or commands that are effected by this bug? -->\r\n<!-- ‚úçÔ∏èedit: -->\r\n```\r\n- [x ] new\r\n- [ ] build\r\n- [ ] serve\r\n- [ ] test\r\n- [ ] e2e\r\n- [ ] generate\r\n- [ ] add\r\n- [ ] update\r\n- [ ] lint\r\n- [ ] xi18n\r\n- [ ] run\r\n- [ ] config\r\n- [x ] help\r\n- [ ] version\r\n- [ ] doc\r\n```\r\n\r\n### Is this a regression?\r\n\r\n<!-- Did this behavior use to work in the previous version? -->\r\n<!-- ‚úçÔ∏è--> Yes, the previous version in which this bug was not present was: ....\r\n\r\n\r\n### Description\r\n\r\n<!-- ‚úçÔ∏è--> A clear and concise description of the problem...\r\nbuild production will stuck in 92% chunk asset optimization TerserPlugin lot\r\nof time under the win10;\r\nat the same time, it will stuck out of time in centos7,and the cpu work in 130%+...\r\n\r\n## üî¨ Minimal Reproduction\r\ncommand:\r\nnode --max_old_space_size=7480 ./node_modules/@angular/cli/bin/ng build --prod --aot --build-optimizer=false\r\n\r\n</code></pre>\r\n\r\n\r\n## üåç Your Environment\r\n<pre><code>\r\n<!-- run `ng version` and paste output below -->\r\n<!-- ‚úçÔ∏è-->\r\nversion:8.1.0\r\n</code></pre>\r\n\r\nscreen shotcut:\r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/28615922/61604002-6e66f080-ac72-11e9-8d50-efca1db5ca4e.png)\r\n","Url":"https://github.com/angular/angular-cli/issues/15141","RelatedDescription":"Closed issue \"build --prod will hold lot of time \" (#15141)"},{"Id":"470839964","IsPullRequest":false,"CreatedAt":"2019-07-21T23:52:42","Actor":"formster-biz","Number":"15140","RawContent":null,"Title":"Error: Uncaught (in promise): TypeError: Gy(‚Ä¶).storage is not a function when using ng build --prod","State":"open","Body":"# üêû Bug report\r\n\r\n### Command (mark with an `x`)\r\n<!-- Can you pin-point the command or commands that are effected by this bug? -->\r\n- [x] build\r\n\r\n### Is this a regression?\r\n\r\n<!-- Did this behavior use to work in the previous version? -->\r\n<!-- ‚úçÔ∏è--> Yes, the previous version in which this bug was not present was: Yes, but I am not sure exactly what was updated since I had made several changes.

When I deploy using ng build or when I run ng serve, I do not get the error and everything works as expected.\r\n\r\nAdditionally, the error only happens when I try to route to one specific component within my app. \r\nFurther, I have discovered that when I change the \"target\" property under \"compilerOptions\" in my tsconfig.json file from es2018 to es2015 to es5 or back and forth, it changes the error slightly instead of Gy, it may say Xy, or qy.\r\n\r\nBased on suggestions found in some slightly similar issues, I have tried the following:\r\n-Updating all my npm packages\r\n-Upgrading my Angular CLI as per this post: https://stackoverflow.com/a/43931987/10415078\r\n-Running ng update (everything seems to be in order)\r\n\r\n## üî¨ Minimal Reproduction\r\nI am not sure what exactly is causing the error, but I only get it when I navigate to this specific component, and only when I've run ng build --prod.  \r\nHere are my imports for that component, but nothing really changed within this component from the time it worked to the time it didn't.  \r\n\r\n```\r\nimport { Component, OnInit } from '@angular/core';\r\nimport { GENERAL_REF } from '../../dbReferences';\r\nimport {

Let's call this application `tenant` and the library `shared-lib`.\r\nA component in the `tenant` wants to import a stylesheet of a component from `shared-lib`. This particular stylesheet imports a CSS like so:\r\n```\r\n@import 'colors'; // the lib's ng-package.json styleIncludePaths is already configured.\r\n```\r\nThis will compile just fine in the library.\r\n\r\nNow there is a component in `tenant` that wants to import this particular stylesheet.\r\nThis used to work before by doing this:\r\n\r\n1. Import the stylesheet explicitly,  in `projects/tenant/components/tenant-util.component.ts`\r\n```\r\n  styleUrls: [\r\n    '../../../../shared-lib/src/lib/components/util.component.scss',\r\n    './tenant-util.component.scss'\r\n  ]\r\n...\r\n```\r\n2.
