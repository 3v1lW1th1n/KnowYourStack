It’s more applicable for projects that have had multiple contributors over a period of time.

LTS releases are stable release which receive critical updates and are supported for at least three years. Current releases can include new features that may undergo future change based on feedback. Current releases are supported for three months after the subsequent .NET Core major or minor release. Both LTS and Current releases receive critical fixes throughout their lifecycle, for security, reliability, or to add support for new operating system versions. You must stay up-to-date with the latest patches to qualify for support. \r\n\r\n[.NET Core 2.2](https://devblogs.microsoft.com/dotnet/announcing-net-core-2-2/) was released in December 2018 as a Current release. Per the lifecycle policy, Current releases reach end of life 3 months after a subsequent release (Current or LTS). **.NET Core 3.0** released in **September 2019** and began the end of life countdown for .NET Core 2.2 that concluded on December 23, 2019. \r\n\r\n## .NET Core 2.2 Downloads\r\n\r\n.NET Core 2.2 installers, zips and tar.gzs will remain available, but unsupported. This includes existing releases available on Linux package feeds.

But now you can enhance your localized Visual Studio development experience by adding the localized IntelliSense files from the download site into your local development environment.\r\n\r\nLastly, with this release we have made the localized IntelliSense available as zip archives that does require you to manually extract and copy the files to respective SDK install folders. But we plan to make this experience better in future releases.\r\n\r\n## Discussion\r\nTo discuss this issue, please comment on the corresponding issue at [dotnet/core #4032](https://github.com/dotnet/core/issues/4032).\r\n"}],"ResultType":"GitHubEvent"},"CoreCLR":{"Events":[{"Id":"11406847430","Type":"PullRequestEvent","CreatedAt":"2020-01-31T15:05:51","Actor":"danmosemsft","Repository":"dotnet/coreclr","Organization":"dotnet","RawContent":null,"RelatedAction":"merged","RelatedUrl":"https://github.com/dotnet/coreclr/pull/28008","RelatedDescription":"Merged pull request \"Delete ISSUE_TEMPLATE.md\" (#28008) at dotnet/coreclr","RelatedBody":"All issues have been transferred to dotnet/runtime, and issues in coreclr have been disabled.\r\ncc: @danmosemsft "},{"Id":"11406840638","Type":"PullRequestEvent","CreatedAt":"2020-01-31T15:05:04","Actor":"danmosemsft","Repository":"dotnet/coreclr","Organization":"dotnet","RawContent":null,"RelatedAction":"merged","RelatedUrl":"https://github.com/dotnet/coreclr/pull/28009","RelatedDescription":"Merged pull request \"Fix readme link in contributed.md\" (#28009) at dotnet/coreclr","RelatedBody":"cc: @danmosemsft "},{"Id":"11406448980","Type":"PullRequestEvent","CreatedAt":"2020-01-31T14:20:42","Actor":"stephentoub","Repository":"dotnet/coreclr","Organization":"dotnet","RawContent":null,"RelatedAction":"closed","RelatedUrl":"https://github.com/dotnet/coreclr/pull/28007","RelatedDescription":"Closed pull request \"CSG stop-gap change on AsyncLocal for .NET Core 3.1\" (#28007) at dotnet/coreclr","RelatedBody":"Stop-gap change for https://github.com/dotnet/docs/issues/9965"},{"Id":"11406388155","Type":"PullRequestEvent","CreatedAt":"2020-01-31T14:13:51","Actor":"stephentoub","Repository":"dotnet/coreclr","Organization":"dotnet","RawContent":null,"RelatedAction":"opened","RelatedUrl":"https://github.com/dotnet/coreclr/pull/28009","RelatedDescription":"Opened pull request \"Fix readme link in contributed.md\" (#28009) at dotnet/coreclr","RelatedBody":"cc: @danmosemsft "},{"Id":"11406374731","Type":"PullRequestEvent","CreatedAt":"2020-01-31T14:12:18","Actor":"stephentoub","Repository":"dotnet/coreclr","Organization":"dotnet","RawContent":null,"RelatedAction":"opened","RelatedUrl":"https://github.com/dotnet/coreclr/pull/28008","RelatedDescription":"Opened pull request \"Delete ISSUE_TEMPLATE.md\" (#28008) at dotnet/coreclr","RelatedBody":"All issues have been transferred to dotnet/runtime, and issues in coreclr have been disabled.\r\ncc: @danmosemsft "},{"Id":"11402632824","Type":"IssuesEvent","CreatedAt":"2020-01-31T04:04:21","Actor":"danmosemsft","Repository":"dotnet/coreclr","Organization":"dotnet","RawContent":null,"RelatedAction":"closed","RelatedUrl":"https://github.com/dotnet/coreclr/issues/27943","RelatedDescription":"Closed issue \"🎉🎉🎉 dotnet/runtime welcomes you 🎉🎉🎉\" (#27943) at dotnet/coreclr","RelatedBody":"We are excited to announce that we just opened the [dotnet/runtime](https://github.com/dotnet/runtime) repository for community members: https://github.com/dotnet/runtime/issues/253.

The actual fix to make self-contained CoreRT Hello World less than 1 MB, and a bunch of tools that helped me find the fix. I’ve had the tools for a while but they don’t get that much use when they only exist on my machine.\r\n\r\n## The tools\r\nI compiled an empty console app with CoreRT. I used the existing `<IlcGenerateMapFile>true</IlcGenerateMapFile>` property to create a map.xml file in the intermediate directory to lists all the things we compiled. I wondered why `DateTime` formatting is needed for an empty app.\r\n\r\nThe existing map file is good to see _what_ was generated, but not _why_ it was generated.\r\n\r\nThe compiler builds a dependency graph internally that captures the whys. There has been a switch to dump the dependency graph into an XML file for a while - it just wasn’t publicly exposed. In this pull request I’m exposing it as `<IlcGenerateDgmlFile>true</ IlcGenerateDgmlFile>`. This generates up to two dgml.xml files in the intermediate directory (two if we’re running an optimized build with the scanner - in that case, the scan.dgml.xml file tends to be more useful).\r\n\r\nThe next thing is interpreting the dependency graph. I wrote a tool for that some time ago, now I’m checking it in.\r\n\r\nThe input to the tool is the DGML file and name of a node of interest. The output is the list of reasons why that node was include.\r\n\r\nIt looks like this for the DateTime formatting case:\r\n\r\n```\r\n() S_P_CoreLib_System_DateTimeFormat__FormatHebrewMonthName\r\n

This means the compiler needs to assume `DateTime` was boxed (we don’t do precise analysis of what happened to the `typeof` and one might just pass the result of the `typeof` to `FormatterServices.GetUninitializedObject` or reflection, which means an instance of the type could get allocated even without an explicit box anywhere in the code).\r\n\r\nOkay, so `DateTime` is considered boxed, what’s the big deal?\r\n\r\nThe reason number 2 (\"Secondary\") listed in the dump is that `ISpanFormattable.TryFormat` is called somewhere. Since `DateTime` implements `ISpanFormattable`, we need to generate the implementations for that because bad things would happen at runtime if someone called `ISpanFormattable` methods on the boxed `DateTime` and we don’t have the code for that.\r\n\r\n## The fix\r\n\r\nTo break this kind of dependency (virtual/interface method call), we need to break one of the two reasons - either get rid of the object allocation, or get rid of the interface call.\r\n\r\nGetting rid of the allocation is pretty straightforward - don’t reference `DateTime` from the `CommonRuntimeTypes` class. That type is used in codepaths that are more rare.\r\n\r\nMakes the AOT compiled empty program go from 1,113,600 bytes to 962,560 bytes.\r\n"},{"Id":"11419852110","Type":"PullRequestEvent","CreatedAt":"2020-02-03T08:56:03","Actor":"MichalStrehovsky","Repository":"dotnet/corert","Organization":"dotnet","RawContent":null,"RelatedAction":"merged","RelatedUrl":"https://github.com/dotnet/corert/pull/7961","RelatedDescription":"Merged pull request \"Add option to disable printing unhandled exceptions to console\" (#7961) at dotnet/corert","RelatedBody":"Saves another 100 kB of code in a minimal app.\r\n\r\nMostly helps removing noise in finding big things.

Here is a checklist of steps we’ll follow during the process: [https://github.com/dotnet/foundation/blob/master/guidance/new-projects.md](https://github.com/dotnet/foundation/blob/master/guidance/new-projects.md)\r\n2.  Please fill out the application in the template below. If you prefer to submit via e-mail to keep information private, you can use this [application form](https://github.com/dotnet-foundation/projects/blob/master/OnBoardingQuestionaire.docx) and submit to contact@dotnetfoundation.org, referencing this issue number. You can also fill out the Word document and submit it as an [attachement to the issue](https://help.github.com/en/articles/file-attachments-on-issues-and-pull-requests), via Google Doc, etc. If you have questions, fill out what you know and discuss on the issue.\r\n3.  After review and comment by the advisory council, we will submit your questionnaire to the board of directors recommending we add your project.\r\n4.  We will send you a contribution agreement via DocuSign.\r\n5.  We can announce the project is joining, and work through the other steps on the checklist.\r\n\r\n\r\nSome common questions that come up on the questionnaire:\r\n\r\n*   Project Transfer Signatories section: List the top contributors, with contact e-mail. For most projects, this is the top 1-5 contributors who have contributed more than a few hundred lines of code.\r\n*   Contribution vs Assignment: The difference is in the contribution model is who actually owns the copyright. It is important, but in terms of practical operation of the project it’s pretty transparent.\r\n\r\n\r\n*   **Contribution:** The project grants the .NET Foundation a license and rights to the intellectual property and source code. The project agrees that it is their work, and the .NET Foundation can protect your copyright.\r\n*   **Assignment:** The project / company gives the .NET Foundation the project, the .NET Foundation grants it back  \r\n\r\n Normally for community projects we recommend contribution. It’s more applicable for projects that have had multiple contributors over a period of time. Assignment is more applicable for a project that was developed in-house by a company, as they have had complete and traceable ownership of the project throughout its lifespan. Either works fine and has little to no day to day impact on the project once it joins from an actual open source development / shipping software point of view. I’d honestly have to go back and check the transfer agreements for a project to tell you what contribution model they chose. So, whatever makes your lawyers happiest is best.\r\n-->\r\n\r\n## 1.

Description\r\n**Please provide a brief statement about your project in terms that are understandable to the target consumer of the library or project, i.e. an elevator pitch for the project:**\r\n\r\nMarten gives developers a multi-paradigm framework for modelling, storing and querying data on PostgreSQL. Making use of the battle hardened database engine, Marten transparently exposes the JSON(B) capabilities of PostgreSQL for managing objects and events alike, requiring no ceremony to enable friction-less development. Marten is your object (document) and event store, with bells and whistles attached, be it CRUD, Event Sourcing or anything between.\r\n\r\n**Please provide a 1 sentence (<140 character) summary of your to help users when searching the .NET Foundation projects**\r\nPolyglot Persistence providing object (document) and event store Powered by .NET and PostgreSQL\r\n\r\n## 3.   Project Governance\r\nPlease complete this section about who will be maintaining the open source project and how it will run.\r\n**Project Lead:**\r\n(Who is the primary contact point for the community and the .NET Foundation when discussing governance of the project.)\r\n\r\nName: Jeremy D. Miller\r\n Email: jeremydmiller@yahoo.com  \r\n GitHub Profile URL: https://github.com/jeremydmiller\r\n\r\n**Committers:**\r\n\r\n_Which individuals have commit / write access to the repository, what is their GitHub ID and who is their employer (if contributions are on behalf of an employer)_\r\n\r\nJeremy D.

Also describe the process for identifying and appointing new committers._\r\n\r\nChanges are proposed via GH issues. All issues are reviewed and labelled with the proper type and scope. Issues that have the estimated timeline are assigned to a proper milestone. Milestones reflect the package version based on the semantic versioning. \r\nPlans for the new releases are discussed publicly in the issues (see eg. https://github.com/JasperFx/marten/issues/1307 or https://github.com/JasperFx/marten/issues/1391).\r\nQuick surveys, questions, clarifications and in general contact with community is done in dedicated Gitter channel https://gitter.im/JasperFx/marten.\r\nNormally 2 approves from maintainers are needed to merge the Pull Request. \r\nNew committers were appointed once by Jeremy based on the number and quality of commits, activity and helping the community. See more: https://jeremydmiller.com/2018/09/27/marten-3-0-is-released-and-introducing-the-new-core-team/\r\n\r\n**CLA**\r\n\r\n_If already an OSS project, was a Contribution License Agreement in place for contributions accepted? How does the project check who has signed one?_\r\n\r\nNo.\r\n\r\n**CLA Notification Alias**\r\n_Provide an email address that will receive CLA related notifications from the .NET Foundation CLA automation_\r\n\r\n**Project Transfer Type**\r\n\r\n_Projects may join the .NET Foundation in one of two ways and you should chat with your .NET Foundation contact to discuss the best mechanism for your project. You can either a) assign the copyright of the project's source code to the .NET Foundation or b) contribute the project source code to the .NET Foundation under an open source license. Assignment is the preferred approach, but licensing a project to the Foundation may be more appropriate for longer running open source projects that have not previously had a contribution license agreement and have accepted contributions from many different sources.\r\na) Assignment\r\nb) Contribution_\r\n\r\nContribution.\r\n\r\n## 4.   Repository Layout\r\n_The .NET Foundation host guidance for new projects and details on recommended structure here:\r\n[https://github.com/dotnet/home/tree/master/guidance](https://github.com/dotnet/home/tree/master/guidance)\r\n\r\nNote that the open source repository should be the master where changes are made by the core development team using the same PR process that is used for non-committer contributions.\r\n\r\nPlease define below any changes you would want to make to your repositories as part of the process of joining the .NET Foundation_\r\n\r\nI don’t think any repository changes are required as part of this process.\r\n\r\n## 5.   PR Plan\r\n_Please summarize the public relations plan for the announcement when joining the foundation (and releasing as open source if appropriate). What is the main story we wish to promote, through what channels, what issues should we be aware of?  For significant news events then please also work with your .NET Foundation contact to ensure a [full PR plan](https://dotnetfoundation.sharepoint.com/Shared%20Documents/PR/Communications%20Plan%20TEMPLATE.docx?web=1) is developed._\r\n\r\nCurrently we'll promote that through blog post, twitter announcement using twitter handle `@marten_lib` & updated website https://martendb.io. We also want to provide the newsletter and maybe more video tutorials. Contributors also speak about the Event Sourcing with .NET Core and Marten on the local meetups. We also plan to get some sponsorship plan (not clear as yet - https://github.com/JasperFx/marten/issues/1393).\r\n\r\n## 6.   Infrastructure Requirements\r\n_Please describe any infrastructure requirements for the project. For example, how will build servers be operated? Any web hosting or service hosting requirements? Do we need to set up SSL certificates or provide Authenticode Code Signing arrangement for releases?_\r\n\r\nCurrently, we're using the Azure Pipelines and AppVeyor OSS plans and we're happy with that process. We are building our documentation using Storyteller (https://storyteller.github.io/documentation/docs/)  hosted on GitHub pages and Netlify so we also don't need to change it as for now. We might need in the future SSL certificates or Authentication Code Signing.\r\n\r\n## 7.   Additional Notes\r\n_Please provide any additional information required or use this area for notes during the on boarding process. If this open source project has similarities with any other projects in this space then please detail them and why this project is different. If there are any potential issues that you feel the project might need help with early on then also state them here and discuss with your .NET Foundation Contact._\r\n\r\nMarten is sometimes compared to Entity Framework. But Marten is not an ORM, it should be treated as the .NET Document and Event Store that's just backed with PostgreSQL. Our approach to using the PostgreSQL and its sophisticated JSON(B) features is unique in .NET space. It should be more compared to RavenDB rather than Entity Framework.\r\nWe're working on the sustainability of our model (so getting sponsorship) to be able to work on the dedicated time and get more reliability in bigger Enterprise companies. Such help would be more than welcome from .NET Foundation.","Url":"https://github.com/dotnet/foundation/issues/161","RelatedDescription":"Closed issue \"Marten\"

Fail FuncEval if slot backpatching lock is held by any thread","State":"open","Body":"- In many cases cooperative GC mode is entered after acquiring the slot backpatching lock and the thread may block for debugger suspension while holding the lock. A FuncEval may time out on entering the lock if for example it calls a virtual or interface method for the first time. Failing the FuncEval when the lock is held enables the debugger to fall back to other options for expression evaluation.\r\n- Also added polls for debugger suspension before acquiring the slot backpatching lock on background threads that often operate in preemptive GC mode. A common case in master is when the debugger breaks while the tiering delay timer is active, the timer ticks shortly afterwards (after debugger suspension completes) and if a thread pool thread is already available, the background thread would block while holding the lock. This is less common in 3.1 because the callback pulses the GC mode at the beginning, but still may occur occasionally. The poll checks for debugger suspension and pulses the GC mode to block before acquiring the lock.\r\n\r\nRisks:\r\n- The fix is only a heuristic and lessens the problem when it is detected that the lock is held by some thread. Since the lock is acquired in preemptive GC mode, it is still possible that after the check at the start of a FuncEval, another thread acquires the lock and the FuncEval may time out. The polling makes it less likely for the lock to be taken by background tiering work, for example if a FuncEval starts while rejitting a method.\r\n- The expression evaluation experience may be worse when it is detected that the lock is held, and may still happen from unfortunate timing\r\n- Low risk for the change itself\r\n\r\nPort of https://github.com/dotnet/runtime/pull/2380\r\nFix for https://github.com/dotnet/runtime/issues/1537","Url":"https://github.com/dotnet/coreclr/pull/28006","RelatedDescription":"Open PR \"[3.1] Fail FuncEval if slot backpatching lock is held by any thread\" (#28006)"},{"Id":"555745808","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2020-01-27T18:15:56","Actor":"danmosemsft","Number":"28004","RawContent":null,"Title":"Add issue template directing new issues to dotnet/runtime","State":"closed","Body":"","Url":"https://github.com/dotnet/coreclr/pull/28004","RelatedDescription":"Closed or merged PR \"Add issue template directing new issues to dotnet/runtime\" (#28004)"},{"Id":"555024664","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2020-01-25T01:28:40","Actor":"briansull","Number":"28003","RawContent":null,"Title":"Port the 5.0 fix for issue #1104","State":"open","Body":"This is the fix for the 3.1 branch for the runtime issue #1104 \r\nThis a a bug which Sergey Andreenko @sandreenko found where the JIT can\r\noptimize away a range check, allowing an out of bounds read or write.\r\nThe original cause was from PR #23109, where a cut-and-paste typo inverted the \r\ninitialization code for `bool alreadyPresent` in `RangeCheck::IsMonotonicallyIncreasing`\r\n\r\n**Customer Impact**\r\nInvalid code gen that allows an out of bounds read or write.\r\n\r\n**Regression?**\r\nA regression introduced during 3.0 development.\r\n\r\n**Testing**\r\nThe fix has been verified in the runtime repo.\r\n\r\n**Risk**\r\nLow: The fix is straightforward and only impacts 1 line of code.\r\n\r\n**Code Reviewer**\r\n@sandreenko and @BruceForstall ","Url":"https://github.com/dotnet/coreclr/pull/28003","RelatedDescription":"Open PR \"Port the 5.0 fix for issue #1104\" (#28003)"},{"Id":"540149649","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2020-01-17T18:31:43","Actor":"VSadov","Number":"27975","RawContent":null,"Title":"Setting MinLimitTotalWorkerThreads according to CPU quota.","State":"closed","Body":"","Url":"https://github.com/dotnet/coreclr/pull/27975","RelatedDescription":"Closed or merged PR \"Setting MinLimitTotalWorkerThreads according to CPU quota.\" (#27975)"},{"Id":"551004118","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2020-01-17T02:10:57","Actor":"dotnet-maestro-bot","Number":"28002","RawContent":null,"Title":"[automated] Merge branch 'release/3.0' => 'release/3.1'","State":"closed","Body":"I detected changes in the release/3.0 branch which have not been merged yet to release/3.1.

We had changed the logic to match precisely what MSDN's documentation stated and to fix a possible data corruption bug; however, this broke a number of customers' applications by sending them into infinite loops.\r\n\r\nThis PR reverts that change.\r\n\r\n## Customer Impact\r\n\r\nIf customers were relying on the previous behavior of the _completed_ out parameter, their applications could end up in an infinite loop. What makes matters worse is that the sample code on the MSDN page for `Encoder.Convert` and `Decoder.Convert` is also susceptible to this pattern, so we suspect a large number of customers may have based their own application code on the sample.\r\n\r\n## Regression?\r\n\r\nYes, from .NET Framework 4.x and .NET Core 2.x. One half of this change was introduced in .NET Core 3.0 (see https://github.com/dotnet/coreclr/commit/43a5159d39bd52195c5095da4006183f791c696b); the other half was introduced in .NET Core 3.1 (see https://github.com/dotnet/coreclr/commit/c07ec4cd2f88c23edc87500893576d83c20f2e6d).\r\n\r\n## Testing\r\n\r\nThe reversion is already committed in the 5.0 branches (see https://github.com/dotnet/runtime/commit/d49b541ab156d992aeb4bbe410f7a816bb0ac039), so we have been getting test coverage on those nightlies. No notable regressions have been reported.\r\n\r\n## Risk\r\n\r\nSomewhere between minimal and moderate. It's possible that some applications may have taken a dependency on the new behavior. See for instance https://github.com/dotnet/aspnetcore/pull/17747, where ASP.NET appears to have unintentionally taken a dependency on the new behavior and had to proactively make a change so that they behave correctly both before and after this PR goes through.\r\n\r\n/cc @tarekgh @anurse @danmosemsft ","Url":"https://github.com/dotnet/coreclr/pull/27996","RelatedDescription":"Closed or merged PR \"[release/3.1] Port fix to revert EncoderNLS and DecoderNLS Convert changes\" (#27996)"},{"Id":"550396592","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2020-01-15T20:04:13","Actor":"dotnet-maestro-bot","Number":"27999","RawContent":null,"Title":"[automated] Merge branch 'release/3.0' => 'release/3.1'","State":"closed","Body":"I detected changes in the release/3.0 branch which have not been merged yet to release/3.1.

The issue also exists in master/5.0. https://github.com/dotnet/runtime/pull/784 fixes it in master, and this PR ports the fix to 3.0.\r\n\r\nIn addition to the fix described above, this PR also also has a deserialization fix for an `InvalidCastException` thrown when a dictionary element type has a converter that returns a type different from the declared type, e.g. when you're deserializing `Dictionary<string, MyClass>`, where\r\n\r\n```c#\r\nprivate interface IClass { }\r\n\r\nprivate class MyClass : IClass { }\r\n\r\nprivate class MyFactory : JsonConverterFactory\r\n{\r\n    public override bool CanConvert(Type typeToConvert)\r\n    {\r\n        return typeToConvert == typeof(IClass) || typeToConvert == typeof(MyClass);\r\n    }\r\n\r\n    public override JsonConverter CreateConverter(Type typeToConvert, JsonSerializerOptions options)\r\n    {\r\n        return new MyStuffConverter();\r\n    }\r\n}\r\n\r\nprivate class MyStuffConverter : JsonConverter<IClass>\r\n{\r\n    public override IClass Read(ref Utf8JsonReader reader, Type typeToConvert, JsonSerializerOptions options)\r\n    {\r\n        return new MyClass();\r\n    }\r\n\r\n    public override void Write(Utf8JsonWriter writer, IClass value, JsonSerializerOptions options)\r\n    {\r\n        writer.WriteNumberValue(1);\r\n    }\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nIn this case, the read method of the converter for `typeof(MyClass)` returns a type `IClass` (not the declared type, `MyClass`) which causes an `InvalidCastException` later in the deserialization flow.\r\n\r\n## Customer Impact\r\n\r\nThe ability to serialize nested concurrent dictionaries is restored: https://github.com/dotnet/runtime/issues/670. \r\n\r\nThe deserialization scenario is an edge case, but the fix defends against leaking exceptions were it to occur.\r\n\r\n## Regression\r\n\r\nNo. The serialization change's tests are wide-ranging and covers various permutations of nested dictionaries, so a regression is unlikely.\r\n\r\nThe deserialization change adds more support without rescinding support.

I’ve had the tools for a while but they don’t get that much use when they only exist on my machine.\r\n\r\n## The tools\r\nI compiled an empty console app with CoreRT.

I wondered why `DateTime` formatting is needed for an empty app.\r\n\r\nThe existing map file is good to see _what_ was generated, but not _why_ it was generated.\r\n\r\nThe compiler builds a dependency graph internally that captures the whys. There has been a switch to dump the dependency graph into an XML file for a while - it just wasn’t publicly exposed. In this pull request I’m exposing it as `<IlcGenerateDgmlFile>true</ IlcGenerateDgmlFile>`. This generates up to two dgml.xml files in the intermediate directory (two if we’re running an optimized build with the scanner - in that case, the scan.dgml.xml file tends to be more useful).\r\n\r\nThe next thing is interpreting the dependency graph. I wrote a tool for that some time ago, now I’m checking it in.\r\n\r\nThe input to the tool is the DGML file and name of a node of interest.

This means the compiler needs to assume `DateTime` was boxed (we don’t do precise analysis of what happened to the `typeof` and one might just pass the result of the `typeof` to `FormatterServices.GetUninitializedObject` or reflection, which means an instance of the type could get allocated even without an explicit box anywhere in the code).\r\n\r\nOkay, so `DateTime` is considered boxed, what’s the big deal?\r\n\r\nThe reason number 2 (\"Secondary\") listed in the dump is that `ISpanFormattable.TryFormat` is called somewhere. Since `DateTime` implements `ISpanFormattable`, we need to generate the implementations for that because bad things would happen at runtime if someone called `ISpanFormattable` methods on the boxed `DateTime` and we don’t have the code for that.\r\n\r\n## The fix\r\n\r\nTo break this kind of dependency (virtual/interface method call), we need to break one of the two reasons - either get rid of the object allocation, or get rid of the interface call.\r\n\r\nGetting rid of the allocation is pretty straightforward - don’t reference `DateTime` from the `CommonRuntimeTypes` class. That type is used in codepaths that are more rare.\r\n\r\nMakes the AOT compiled empty program go from 1,113,600 bytes to 962,560 bytes.\r\n","Url":"https://github.com/dotnet/corert/pull/7962","RelatedDescription":"Closed or merged PR \"Get CoreRT Hello World selfcontained binary under 1 MB\" (#7962)"},{"Id":"558702617","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2020-02-03T08:56:02","Actor":"MichalStrehovsky","Number":"7961","RawContent":null,"Title":"Add option to disable printing unhandled exceptions to console","State":"closed","Body":"Saves another 100 kB of code in a minimal app.\r\n\r\nMostly helps removing noise in finding big things.

in the first case we can observe temp project called restore.csproj).\r\n\r\nHere we think the relevant code for [the first](https://github.com/dotnet/cli/blob/release/3.1.1xx/src/Microsoft.DotNet.Cli.Utils/Command.cs#L48-L66) and for [the second](https://github.com/dotnet/cli/blob/release/3.1.1xx/src/Microsoft.DotNet.Cli.Utils/ProcessStartInfoExtensions.cs#L33_L63) cases.\r\n\r\nNamely, the part for calling the process:\r\n\r\n```c#\r\n_process.Start();\r\nvar taskOut = _stdOut?.BeginRead(_process.StandardOutput);\r\nvar taskErr = _stdErr?.BeginRead(_process.StandardError);\r\n_process.WaitForExit();\r\ntaskOut?.Wait();\r\ntaskErr?.Wait();\r\n```\r\n\r\nprobably violates [the documentation](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/api/system.diagnostics.process.standardoutput?view=netcore-3.1) (even though `StreamForwarder` uses Read() operation, which is also synchronous)\r\n\r\n> A deadlock condition can result if the parent process calls p.WaitForExit before p.StandardOutput.ReadToEnd and the child process writes enough text to fill the redirected stream.\r\n\r\n","Url":"https://github.com/dotnet/sdk/issues/10589","RelatedDescription":"Open issue \"dotnet hangs randomly on reading stderr or stdout from child processes\"

A few observations:\r\n\r\n- The templates don't seem ordered\r\n- The templates aren't filtered based on the platform you're running on. I've gotten feedback that it's bizarre that WPF shows up when running `dotnet new` on non windows platforms.\r\n- It's not clear which templates are `item` vs `project` templates.\r\n\r\nSome suggestions:\r\n- Templates should be ordered by something.\r\n- They should be filtered based on the platform (don't show irrelevant templates even if it's possible to build them but not run them).\r\n- Show project templates by default and have an option to show all templates (or to filter by a specific template type)\r\n\r\nHere's an example of what my `dotnet new` looks

Versioning","State":"closed","Body":"Update CLI version numbers and branding strings.\n## THIS IS A BREAKING CHANGE\n\nAnyone testing with an older build of CLI may be broken by this change. The SDK version is moving from `rc2` to `preview1`, a lower preview version string. Please uninstall/delete any older installation of dotnet prior to using a new version that includes this change.\n\nAlso note that folks depending on CLI-produced NuGet packages will be affected. Tools NuGet packages will also be affected. Anyone depending on `1.0.0-*` version of CLI produced NuGet packages will need to include the updated version suffix e.g. `1.0.0-preview1-*` to get the latest packages. See the table below for details.\n### Branding changes\n- Microsoft .NET Core SDK --> Microsoft .NET Core 1.0 RC2 - SDK Preview 1\n- Microsoft .NET Core --> Microsoft .NET Core 1.0 RC2 - Runtime\n- Microsoft .NET Core Host --> Microsoft .NET Core 1.0 RC2 - Host\n### Versioning changes\n\nThe version update is less straightforward. The Shared Framework and its dependencies will remain RC2. The ProjectModel and its dependencies will also remain RC2. The remaining packages produced in this repo, namely the CLI and its dependencies, will have their version updated to `preview1`.\n\n| Component | Old Ver Suffix | New Ver Suffix |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| Host | rc2 | rc2 |\n| Shared Framework | rc2 | rc2 |\n| SDK | rc2 | preview1 |\n| dotnet-compile-fsc.nupkg | rc2 | preview1 |\n| Microsoft.DotNet.Cli.Utils.nupkg | rc2 | preview1 |\n| Microsoft.DotNet.Compiler.Common | rc2 | preview1 |\n| Microsoft.DotNet.Files | rc2 | preview1 |\n| Microsoft.DotNet.InternalAbstractions | rc2 | rc2 |\n| Microsoft.DotNet.ProjectModel | rc2 | rc2 |\n| Microsoft.DotNet.ProjectModel.Loader | rc2 | preview1 |\n| Microsoft.DotNet.ProjectModel.Workspaces | rc2 | preview1 |\n| Microsoft.Extensions.DependencyModel | rc2 | rc2 |\n| Microsoft.Extensions.Testing.Abstractions | rc2 | preview1 |\n","Url":"https://github.com/dotnet/sdk/issues/10584","RelatedDescription":"Closed issue \"Update CLI Branding and Versioning\" (#10584)"},{"Id":"558451090","IsPullRequest":false,"CreatedAt":"2020-02-01T01:04:16","Actor":"tylerphelan","Number":"10583","RawContent":null,"Title":"Dotnet publish with -r ubuntu-x64 and --self-contained=false fails to find framework","State":"closed","Body":"## Steps to reproduce\r\n```\r\n$ docker run -it ubuntu:18.04 bash\r\n$ apt-get update\r\n$ apt-get install liblttng-ust0 libcurl3 libssl1.0.0 libkrb5-3 zlib1g libicu60 -y\r\n$ dotnet --version\r\n> 2.2.101\r\n$ dotnet --list-runtimes\r\n> Microsoft.AspNetCore.All 2.2.1 [/tmp/dotnet/shared/Microsoft.AspNetCore.All]\r\n> Microsoft.AspNetCore.App 2.2.1 [/tmp/dotnet/shared/Microsoft.AspNetCore.App]\r\n> Microsoft.NETCore.App 2.2.1 [/tmp/dotnet/shared/Microsoft.NETCore.App]\r\n$ dotnet new webapi\r\n$ dotnet publish -r ubuntu-x64 --self-contained=false\r\n$ cd bin/Debug/netcoreapp2.2/ubuntu-x64/publish/\r\n$ ./project --server.urls http://0.0.0.0:8080\r\n> The specified framework 'Microsoft.AspNetCore.App', version '2.2.0' was not found.\r\n  - Check application dependencies and target a framework version installed at:\r\n      /tmp/project/bin/Debug/netcoreapp2.2/ubuntu-x64/publish/\r\n  - Installing .NET Core prerequisites might help resolve this problem:\r\n      http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkID=798306&clcid=0x409\r\n  - The .NET Core framework and SDK can be installed from:\r\n      https://aka.ms/dotnet-download\r\n```\r\n\r\n## Expected  behavior\r\n\r\nWe are not sure if this is a valid workflow but we expected `Microsoft.AspNetCore.App` to be found.\r\n\r\n## Actual behavior\r\n\r\nThe error seen above with missing framework.\r\n\r\n## Environment data\r\n`dotnet --info` output:\r\n```\r\n.NET Core SDK (reflecting any global.json):\r\n Version:   2.2.101\r\n Commit:    29ae5ac2c2\r\n\r\nRuntime Environment:\r\n OS Name:     ubuntu\r\n OS Version:  14.04\r\n OS Platform: Linux\r\n RID:         ubuntu.14.04-x64\r\n Base Path:   /tmp/dotnet/sdk/2.2.101/\r\n\r\nHost (useful for support):\r\n  Version: 2.2.1\r\n  Commit:  878dd11e62\r\n\r\n.NET Core SDKs installed:\r\n  2.2.101 [/tmp/dotnet/sdk]\r\n\r\n.NET Core runtimes installed:\r\n  Microsoft.AspNetCore.All 2.2.1 [/tmp/dotnet/shared/Microsoft.AspNetCore.All]\r\n  Microsoft.AspNetCore.App 2.2.1 [/tmp/dotnet/shared/Microsoft.AspNetCore.App]\r\n  Microsoft.NETCore.App 2.2.1 [/tmp/dotnet/shared/Microsoft.NETCore.App]\r\n```\r\n\r\nThis is using an SDK built from source against ubuntu 18.04 and everything else seems to be working: https://github.com/dotnet/cli/blob/master/Documentation/project-docs/developer-guide.md#buildingrunning\r\n\r\nI don't see why the framework wouldn't be found.

LTS releases are stable release which receive critical updates and are supported for at least three years. Current releases can include new features that may undergo future change based on feedback. Current releases are supported for three months after the subsequent .NET Core major or minor release. Both LTS and Current releases receive critical fixes throughout their lifecycle, for security, reliability, or to add support for new operating system versions. You must stay up-to-date with the latest patches to qualify for support. \r\n\r\n[.NET Core 2.2](https://devblogs.microsoft.com/dotnet/announcing-net-core-2-2/) was released in December 2018 as a Current release. Per the lifecycle policy, Current releases reach end of life 3 months after a subsequent release (Current or LTS). **.NET Core 3.0** released in **September 2019** and began the end of life countdown for .NET Core 2.2 that concluded on December 23, 2019. \r\n\r\n## .NET Core 2.2 Downloads\r\n\r\n.NET Core 2.2 installers, zips and tar.gzs will remain available, but unsupported. This includes existing releases available on Linux package feeds.

This means some folks will lose their Collaborator badge and the ability to interact with the CI system.*\r\n\r\nOver the years, we’ve added a bunch of folks as collaborators with read permissions to our public repos. The rationale was that we wanted to be able to assign issues to community members because GitHub only allowed assigning issues to users with an explicit permission grant for the repository. However, they changed this in [June 2019](https://github.blog/2019-06-25-assign-issues-to-issue-commenters/). Now, we can assign issues to all users with explicit permissions as well as to users that have commented on the specific issue.\r\n\r\nAlso, we recently started to audit and tighten the permissions for our organizations. As a result, it became clear that large number of repo-specific permission grants are hard to review and audit. Internally, our goal is to grant all permissions via teams instead.\r\n\r\nHence, we plan to remove all collaborators from public repos that only have read permissions (folks with triage permissions will remain). The full list of affected repos is listed below.\r\n\r\nThis shouldn’t impact your ability to work with us, but losing explicit read-only has the following implications:\r\n\r\n-   **You’ll lose the collaborator badge**. We understand that this is visually appealing and for some people it might have been a badge of honor. But given that GitHub also shows a Contributor bade for folks whose PRs got merged, we don’t think it this will be a major take back.    \r\n    ![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/5169960/70491508-43acf580-1ab6-11ea-94df-74ea2dde98b4.png)\r\n\r\n-   ~~**You lose the ability to interact with the CI system**. As a collaborator, you can use comments to [send commands to the CI system](https://github.com/dotnet/runtime/blob/master/docs/project/pullrequest-builds.md). While this can be useful at times, we generally don’t expect (or desire) contributors to do that. Of course, anyone can still access the CI logs.~~\r\n\r\n- **You might lose the ability to interact with the CI system**. Based on your feedback we have decided to give externals access to interact with the CI system *on a case by case basis*. If you believe you need to have that ability, please [leave a comment like Kevin's](https://github.com/dotnet/runtime/issues/718#issuecomment-563717478).\r\n\r\n| Public Repo                | \\#collaborators with read |\r\n|----------------------------|---------------------------|\r\n| arcade                     | 1                         |\r\n| BenchmarkDotNet            | 11                        |\r\n| cli                        | 2                         |\r\n| command-line-api           | 14                        |\r\n| coreclr                    | 18                        |\r\n| corefx                     | 180                       |\r\n| corefxlab                  | 4                         |\r\n| corert                     | 7                         |\r\n| core-sdk                   | 1                         |\r\n| docs                       | 3                         |\r\n| interactive-window         | 1                         |\r\n| machinelearning            | 1                         |\r\n| machinelearning-samples    | 1                         |\r\n| msbuild-language-service   | 1                         |\r\n| runtime                    | 128                       |\r\n| spark                      | 5                         |\r\n| standard                   | 1                         |\r\n| windowsdesktop             | 1                         |\r\n| winforms-datavisualization | 1                         |\r\n| Grand Total                | 381                       |\r\n\r\n### Discussion\r\n\r\nTo discuss this, please comment on the corresponding issue at https://github.com/dotnet/runtime/issues/718.","Url":"https://github.com/dotnet/announcements/issues/144","RelatedDescription":"Open issue \"Removal of read-collaborator access\" (#144)"},{"Id":"532249858","IsPullRequest":false,"CreatedAt":"2019-12-03T20:36:29","Actor":"MichaelSimons","Number":"143","RawContent":null,"Title":".NET Core `latest` Docker tags updated to 3.1","State":"open","Body":"# .NET Core `latest` Docker tags updated to 3.1\r\n\r\nThe `latest` tags for the [dotnet/core](https://hub.docker.com/_/microsoft-dotnet-core) repos have been updated to reference [.NET Core 3.1](https://devblogs.microsoft.com/dotnet/announcing-net-core-3-1/).\r\n\r\n## Discussion\r\n \r\nYou can share your thoughts on this change or see what others are saying at:\r\n \r\n* [dotnet/dotnet-docker#1337](https://github.com/dotnet/dotnet-docker/issues/1511)\r\n\r\n## Details\r\n\r\n* [dotnet-docker#1509](https://github.com/dotnet/dotnet-docker/pull/1509)\r\n\r\nThe `latest` tags for the [dotnet/core](https://hub.docker.com/_/microsoft-dotnet-core) repos are always intended to reference the latest supported version of .NET Core.

That means that .NET Core manifest tags are no longer usable on those Windows versions.\r\n\r\nIf you pull a manifest tag on one of the Windows versions described, you may get one of the following error messages:\r\n\r\n* `a Windows version 10.0.18362-based image is incompatible with a 10.0.17134 host`\r\n* `no matching manifest for windows/amd64 in the manifest list entries`\r\n* `no matching manifest for unknown in the manifest list entries`\r\n\r\nIf you need to still use Nano Server, version 1803 images (even though it is no longer supported), you will need to use tags that include the Nano Server version (these are non-manifest tags), for example `mcr.microsoft.com/dotnet/core/runtime:3.0-nanoserver-1803`.","Url":"https://github.com/dotnet/announcements/issues/140","RelatedDescription":"Open issue \"Windows Server, version 1803 no longer supported by .NET Core\" (#140)"},{"Id":"522994983","IsPullRequest":false,"CreatedAt":"2019-11-14T17:15:08","Actor":"leecow","Number":"139","RawContent":null,"Title":".NET Core 3.1.0 Preview 3","State":"open","Body":".NET Core 3.1.0 Preview 3 is available and https://github.com/dotnet/core/issues/3809 has been opened for discussion.\r\n\r\n[Release Notes](https://github.com/dotnet/core/blob/master/release-notes/3.1/preview/3.1.0-preview3.md)\r\n[Download](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/download/dotnet-core/3.1)\r\n\r\n**Blog posts**\r\n\r\n[.NET Core](https://devblogs.microsoft.com/dotnet/announcing-net-core-3-1-preview-3/)\r\n[ASP.NET Core](https://devblogs.microsoft.com/aspnet/asp-net-core-updates-in-net-core-3-1-preview-3/)\r\n\r\nPlease report any issues you find with .NET Core 3.1 Preview 3, either responding to this issue, creating a new issue or creating a new issue in one of the following repos:\r\n\r\n* [aspnet/Home](https://github.com/aspnet/Home) - for ASP.NET Core questions\r\n* [aspnet/EntityFrameworkCore](https://github.com/aspnet/EntityFrameworkCore) - for Entity Framework Core questions\r\n* [dotnet/cli](https://github.com/dotnet/cli/issues) - for CLI tools and questions\r\n* [dotnet/corefx](https://github.com/dotnet/corefx/issues) - for API issues and questions\r\n* [dotnet/coreclr](https://github.com/dotnet/coreclr/issues) - for runtime issues\r\n* [dotnet/core-setup](https://github.com/dotnet/core-setup/issues) - for installer issues\r\n* [dotnet/winforms](https://github.com/dotnet/winforms/issues) - for Winforms issues\r\n* [dotnet/wpf](https://github.com/dotnet/wpf/issues) - for WPF issues\r\n* [nuget/home](https://github.com/nuget/home/issues) - for NuGet questions and issues\r\n","Url":"https://github.com/dotnet/announcements/issues/139","RelatedDescription":"Open issue \".NET Core 3.1.0 Preview 3\" (#139)"},{"Id":"522864668","IsPullRequest":false,"CreatedAt":"2019-11-14T13:37:28","Actor":"TaraOverfield","Number":"138","RawContent":null,"Title":"November 2019 .NET Updates","State":"open","Body":"The following .NET updates were released on November 2019.

Our planning has reached a point where we have a schedule for the coreclr, corefx and core-setupmoves into dotnet/runtime that we want to share out with the community.\r\n\r\n### November 13th\r\nWe’ll move all changes from the original repositories into dotnet/runtime up to 5PM PST on November 13th. We’ll try to help as many pull requests as possible get merged by then. At that point, if there’s any pull requests still open we’ll have to close them. If you’d still like to continue those pull requests, we’d encourage you to bring them to dotnet/runtime in a new pull request.\r\n\r\nThe repositories themselves will be effectively archived at this point. The state of the “master” branch will be recorded with a tag, named “master-archive”, but the branch itself will be deleted. The default branch for the repositories will be named “archive” and it will be a single commit with a README.md and CONTRIBUTING.md file pointing to our dotnet/runtime repository.\r\n\r\nThe repositories will remain active for servicing changes to .NET Core 3.1 and earlier hence we will not be using the GitHub archive capability. \r\n\r\n### November 22nd\r\nThe dotnet/runtime repository will be made public and available for community contribution. Even though the repository will be created on November 13th it will take several days to get it back into a working order: fixing up our build scripts, recreating our Azure Dev Ops build definitions, etc … Until those tasks are completed it will not be possible to accept pull request and hence the repository will remain private. Once we are in a state that pull requests can be merged again the repository will be made public.\r\n\r\nOur expectation is that will occur on November 22nd. If it is ready sooner it will be made public sooner. If the work takes longer than we planned then we will add an update to this announcement with a new expected date.\r\n\r\n### December 1st-2nd\r\nAll issues, open and closed, will be migrated from corefx, coreclr and core-setup into dotnet/runtime. This will be using GitHub’s existing issue transfer feature in a bulk migration. This means all of the existing issue links will continue to function via redirects.\r\n\r\nThis does mean though that labels will not transfer with the issues. Labels will be re-applied as a post processing step by our engineering team once the issue migration completes.\r\n\r\nEven though our issues won’t be fully migrated until this time we’d like the community to begin filing issues on dotnet/runtime as soon as it’s public rather than continuing to file issues on the original repositories.\r\n\r\n### Migrating Commits\r\nThe dotnet/runtime repository will be a new commit history from the original repositories. We are using this consolidation as an opportunity to clean up our history with the goal of having a cleaner, smaller history as a starting point. This means commits will be rewritten in the following ways as they are migrated to dotnet/runtime:\r\n\r\n1. Author information, contributor information, changed file list and time stamps from the original commit will be preserved.\r\n1. Links to issues, pull requests or commits in the repository using GitHub short links will be rewritten so they continue to point the original repository. \r\n1. Every commit will be appended with a link to the original commit it was mapped from.\r\n\r\nThe actual contents of the commit though will be updated to match the new directory layout of the dotnet/runtime repository.","Url":"https://github.com/dotnet/announcements/issues/133","RelatedDescription":"Open issue \"Repository Consolidation Timeline\" (#133)"},{"Id":"513963125","IsPullRequest":false,"CreatedAt":"2019-10-29T14:32:55","Actor":"mthalman","Number":"132","RawContent":null,"Title":"Release of Alpine 3.10 Docker images","State":"open","Body":"# .NET Core Alpine Docker images updated to Alpine 3.10\r\n\r\nDocker images for .NET Core have been released that support Alpine 3.10.

With [.NET Standard 2.0](https://devblogs.microsoft.com/dotnet/announcing-net-standard-2-0/), we tried to make it much more viable to share code between .NET Framework, .NET Core, and Xamarin which resulted in approximately 38K .NET Frameworks APIs being available in .NET Core 2.0. We also built the [Windows Compatibility Pack](https://devblogs.microsoft.com/dotnet/announcing-the-windows-compatibility-pack-for-net-core/) which made another 21K .NET Framework APIs available to .NET Core, resulting in almost 60K additional APIs. And in .NET Core 3.0 we added WPF and WinForms, which increased the number of .NET Framework APIs ported to .NET Core to over 120k, which is more than half of all .NET Framework APIs.\r\n\r\nIt’s also worth pointing out that we added about 62K APIs to .NET Core that don’t exist in .NET Framework. If we compare their total number of APIs, .NET Core has about 80% of the API surface of .NET Framework.\r\n\r\n<p align=\"center\">\r\n<img src=\"https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/5169960/66777114-f8db7c80-ee7c-11e9-9161-acfe1c491586.png\" width=\"600\" align=\"center\">\r\n</p>\r\n\r\nWe announced that the [future of .NET](https://devblogs.microsoft.com/dotnet/net-core-is-the-future-of-net/) will be based on .NET Core. And at Build 2019, [Scott Hunter stated](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZlO1utbB2GQ&t=54m20s) that AppDomains, remoting, Web Forms, WCF server, and Windows Workflow won’t be ported to .NET Core.\r\n\r\nWith .NET Core 3.0, we’re at the point where we’ve ported all technologies that are required for modern workloads, be that desktop apps, mobile apps, console apps, web sites, or cloud services. That’s not to say that we don’t have any gaps or opportunities for new technologies, but we generally believe we won’t be finding them in the .NET Framework code base anymore. Moving forward, we’re focusing our resources on incorporating new technologies.\r\n\r\nSimultaneously, we’re looking into releasing more of the [.NET Framework code base under the MIT license](https://github.com/microsoft/referencesource) on GitHub to allow the community to create OSS projects for technologies we’re not intending to bring to .NET Core. For example, there already are community projects for [CoreWF](https://github.com/UiPath/corewf) and [CoreWCF](https://github.com/CoreWCF/CoreWCF).\r\n\r\nWe’d like to thank everyone who filed issues with requests for APIs being ported.

While this is still work in progress, we'd like to give you an update on where we are.\r\n\r\nSo far, we've identified the following repos:\r\n\r\n* dotnet/**runtime**\r\n\t- Will contain [coreclr](https://github.com/dotnet/coreclr), [corefx](https://github.com/dotnet/corefx), [core-setup](https://github.com/dotnet/core-setup), [aspnet/Extensions](https://github.com/aspnet/Extensions), and some of [mono/mono](https://github.com/mono/mono)\r\n* [dotnet/**sdk**](https://github.com/dotnet/sdk)\r\n\t- Will contain [toolset](https://github.com/dotnet/toolset), [sdk](https://github.com/dotnet/sdk), [cli](https://github.com/dotnet/cli)\r\n* dotnet/**installer**\r\n\t- Renamed from [core-sdk](https://github.com/dotnet/core-sdk)\r\n* dotnet/**aspnetcore**\r\n\t- Moved from [aspnet/AspNetCore](https://github.com/aspnet/AspNetCore) and will also contain [aspnet/AspNetCore-Tooling](https://github.com/aspnet/AspNetCore-Tooling)\r\n* dotnet/**efcore**\r\n\t- Moved from [aspnet/EntityFrameworkCore](https://github.com/aspnet/EntityFrameworkCore)\r\n* [dotnet/**winforms**](https://github.com/dotnet/winforms)\r\n\t- Unchanged, but listed for clarity \r\n* [dotnet/**wpf**](https://github.com/dotnet/wpf)\r\n\t- Unchanged, but listed for clarity\r\n\r\n### Name changes\r\n\r\nYou might notice that we changed our mind on naming from our [earlier announcement][ann]. Based on your feedback, we decided to go with **dotnet/runtime** instead of **dotnet/platform** and **dotnet/sdk** instead of **dotnet/cli**.\r\n\r\nSeveral people pointed out that the previous names weren't relatable to how we talk about the product, for example on download pages. So, we decided to match the product distributions as the primary design point for the new names. We generally refer to the bits you need to run your app as *the runtime* and the bits you need to build apps as *the SDK*. This also matches the naming chosen by other platforms.\r\n\r\n### New repos can't be used for .NET Core 3.x or earlier\r\n\r\nThe consolidated repositories are going to be about .NET 5 and going forward. It will not be possible to build .NET Core 3.1 or earlier from these repositories. As such, only the master branch from each of the repositories will be brought forward. There will be no porting of the individual release branches in the source repositories.\r\n\r\n### Personal names and email addresses\r\n\r\nSince we're planning on rebasing the history in the merged repositories, we can map your name and email address to new values as well. We primarily do this to support our friends in the LGBTQ+ community who have changed their names to reflect their identities. However, anybody is welcome to use this to change their email and name.\r\n\r\nWhatever your reason might be: we value your contributions and we hope this small gesture makes your life a little bit better. So if you changed your name/email – or simply prefer us to use different values – please [submit a request](mailto:dotnet@microsoft.com&subject=.NET%20repo%20consolidation%3A%20request%20for%20name%20change&body=Hey%2C%20%0A%0AI%E2%80%99d%20like%20to%20change%20my%20email%2Fdisplay%20name%20in%20the%20consolidated%20repo%20from%20%0A%0A%20%20%20%20%20%20%20%20My%20Old%20Name%20%3Cold.me%40example.org%3E%20%0A%0Ato%20%0A%0A%20%20%20%20%20%20%20%20My%20New%20Name%20%3Cnew.me%40example.org%3E%20%0A%0AThanks%21%20%0A).\r\n\r\n### More is coming\r\n\r\nWe'll share more updates in the upcoming months.
