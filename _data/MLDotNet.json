But we cannot in ML.NET, as of today.\r\n\r\nWhen implementing this feature improvement in ML.NET, there could be the following two approaches:\r\n\r\n- Modify schema comprehension to be able to map Bitmap fields/properties to Image columns of a data view.\r\n\r\n- Add another version of ImageLoading transformer that loads/decodes the image from a byte vector, rather than from a disk file identified by path.\r\n\r\nIn any case, this is an important scenario to implement because not being able to load images from in-memory streams and only from files can be a big handicap in performance for on-line scenarios like the ones mentioned.\r\n\r\nWith the current implementation in ML.NET, the only workaround is to save the upcoming image from http and in-memory into a temporary file on the disk and load it from there. But that is a very \"coarse/poor\" workaround, not performant at all for a real application in production. \r\n\r\nThe following is a sample app I created for this online scenario where the user uploads an image from the browser into a service (Web API) and ultimately you get it as an in-memory image stream.\r\n\r\nSEE CODE HERE:\r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/CESARDELATORRE/TensorFlowImageClassificationWebAPI\r\n\r\n\r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/1712635/51009187-00dc4980-1504-11e9-866d-2c69bbd0db74.png)\r\n\r\n- That web form uploads the image through Http into a service (Web API) in the server-side. At that point, the image is an in-memory image stream.\r\n\r\n- In this implementation the sample app works because I implemented a workaround so the submitted image is temporarily stored as a file, then loaded from the file into the DataView through the pipeline...)\r\n\r\nBasically, when the C# method in the Web API gets the image as an in-memory stream it should be able to load it directly in the DataView. The following code is an example:\r\n\r\n```cs\r\n        // Controller's method from Web API \r\n        [HttpPost]\r\n        [ProducesResponseType(200)]\r\n        [ProducesResponseType(400)]\r\n        [Route(\"classifyimage\")]\r\n        public async Task<IActionResult> ClassifyImage(IFormFile imageFile)\r\n        {\r\n                if (imageFile.Length == 0)\r\n                    return BadRequest();\r\n\r\n                // WORKAROUND: Save image into a temporal file\r\n                //Save the temp image image into the temp-folder \r\n                string fileName = await _imageWriter.UploadImageAsync(imageFile, _imagesTmpFolder);\r\n                string imageFilePath = Path.Combine(_imagesTmpFolder, fileName);\r\n\r\n                // Use image filename as the workaround...\r\n                // Rest of the implementation with ML.NET API for scoring TensorFlow model...\r\n                // ...\r\n           \r\n        }\r\n```\r\n\r\nTo sum up:\r\n\r\nI believe it is \"a must\" for ML.NET to be able to load in-memory image streams into the DataView to use those images when scoring TensorFlow models (in addition \"from files\") because of the mentioned on-line and in-memory scenarios that are pretty common.\r\n\r\n","Url":"https://github.com/dotnet/machinelearning/issues/2121","RelatedDescription":"Open issue \"ImageLoadingEstimator for TensorFlow scoring should allow in-memory image streams as input in addition to images from files on drive \" (#2121)"},{"Id":"398096620","IsPullRequest":false,"CreatedAt":"2019-01-11T01:54:03","Actor":"wschin","Number":"2120","RawContent":null,"Title":"Several functions in FCC scorer not used/tested","State":"open","Body":"As title.
