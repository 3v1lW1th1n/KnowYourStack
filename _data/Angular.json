This appears to be due to that DebugElement collects based on elements, so the component is registered with DebugElement but if there is a directive with the same selector it is lost.\r\n\r\n\r\n## üî¨ Minimal Reproduction\r\nhttps://stackblitz.com/edit/angular-1dxvad?file=src%2Fapp%2Fdashboard%2Fdashboard-overloaded.directive.spec.ts\r\n\r\nIf you view this reproduction, you'll see a test running. There are two directives, the DashboardComponent and DashboardOverloadedDirective (it does nothing except console.log). You can see both get instantiated in the test component because they share the same `app-dashboard` selector.\r\n\r\nNow, when I write a test to query the debugElement by the two directives, both queries return the DashboardComponent instead of the actual directive. The test is below from the stackblitz demo.\r\n\r\n```ts\r\nit('should query for the directives separately', function() {\r\n    const component = fixture.debugElement.query(By.directive(DashboardComponent));\r\n    const overloaded = fixture.debugElement.query(By.directive(DashboardOverloadedDirective));\r\n    expect(component.componentInstance.constructor.name).not.toEqual(overloaded.componentInstance.constructor.name);\r\n})\r\n```\r\n\r\nI would expect that `debugElement.query(By.directive(DashboardOverloadedDirective))` would return an instance of the DashboardOverloadedDirective and not the DashboardComponent.\r\n\r\nWith some debugging I see that the test only creates a debugElement for the DashboardComponent (set a breakpoint on https://github.com/angular/angular/blob/master/packages/core/src/debug/debug_node.ts#L44), which makes sense in some ways because its one element. However, I have no way to access the controller for the directive on that element. \r\n\r\n## üî• Exception or Error\r\n\r\nThe error is that both queries above resolve to the same DashboardComponent.\r\n\r\n\r\n## üåç  Your Environment\r\n\r\n**Angular Version:**\r\n<pre><code>\r\nAngular CLI: 7.0.3\r\nNode: 10.12.0\r\nOS: darwin x64\r\nAngular: 7.0.0\r\n... animations, common, compiler, compiler-cli, core, forms\r\n... http, language-service, platform-browser\r\n... platform-browser-dynamic, platform-server, router\r\n\r\nPackage                            Version\r\n------------------------------------------------------------\r\n@angular-devkit/architect          0.10.3\r\n@angular-devkit/build-angular      0.10.3\r\n@angular-devkit/build-ng-packagr   0.10.3\r\n@angular-devkit/build-optimizer    0.10.3\r\n@angular-devkit/build-webpack      0.10.3\r\n@angular-devkit/core               7.0.3\r\n@angular-devkit/schematics         7.0.3\r\n@angular/cli                       7.0.3\r\n@ngtools/json-schema               1.1.0\r\n@ngtools/webpack                   7.0.3\r\n@schematics/angular                7.0.3\r\n@schematics/update                 0.10.3\r\nng-packagr                         4.3.0\r\nrxjs                               6.3.3\r\ntypescript                         3.1.3\r\nwebpack                            4.19.1\r\n</code></pre>\r\n\r\n**Anything else relevant?**\r\n\r\nThe workaround is to grab the directive `fixture.debugElement.query(By.directive(DashboardComponent)).injector.get(DashboardOverloadedDirective)` but is not obvious.","Url":"https://github.com/angular/angular/issues/29014","RelatedDescription":"Open issue \"DebugElement Query By.directive returning the wrong directive when a component has same selector\" (#29014)"},{"Id":"415354551","IsPullRequest":false,"CreatedAt":"2019-02-27T22:21:39","Actor":"Rutvik17","Number":"29013","RawContent":null,"Title":"@hostListener does not work with IOS","State":"open","Body":"I have a custom dropdown component and i'm calling that component in a reactive form.

I've configured my app this way intentionally, and I don't want to see these warnings every time I start my application for development.\r\n\r\nHere is my command:\r\n\r\n    ng serve --host 0.0.0.0 --port 8000 --ssl true --ssl-key localhost.key --ssl-cert localhost.cert\r\n\r\nAnd the warnings:\r\n\r\n```\r\nWARNING: This is a simple server for use in testing or debugging Angular applications\r\nlocally. It hasn't been reviewed for security issues.\r\n\r\nBinding this server to an open connection can result in compromising your application or\r\ncomputer. Using a different host than the one passed to the \"--host\" flag might result in\r\nwebsocket connection issues. You might need to use \"--disableHostCheck\" if that's the\r\ncase.\r\n```\r\n\r\nThe top one is useful, but I don't need to be reminded, I'm already not using Angular CLI in production.\r\n\r\nThe second one is of course useful as well, but I'm running this app inside of a Docker container on my dev machine with an port exposed to the host, so that's not an issue in my case either.\r\n\r\n### Describe the solution you'd like\r\nA broad flag (or a number of more specific flags) to disable warnings at start time.  I have found another issue requesting something like this here:\r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/angular/angular-cli/issues/11802\r\n\r\nHowever, the answer given to this is to redirect stderr.  This does have the desired effect, but it _also_ disables all compile-time errors, which I _need_ for the development process.\r\n\r\n### Describe alternatives you've considered\r\nEither find a configuration that Angular complains about less, or simply ignore the warnings.\r\n","Url":"https://github.com/angular/angular-cli/issues/13765","RelatedDescription":"Open issue \"Disable start-up warnings\" (#13765)"},{"Id":"414139127","IsPullRequest":false,"CreatedAt":"2019-02-25T14:44:27","Actor":"mwhitis","Number":"13764","RawContent":null,"Title":"Incorrect scss file name generated","State":"open","Body":"# üêû Bug report\r\n\r\n### Command (mark with an `x`)\r\n<!-- Can you pin-point the command or commands that are effected by this bug? -->\r\n<!-- ‚úçÔ∏èedit: -->\r\n```\r\n- [x] new\r\n- [ ] build\r\n- [ ] serve\r\n- [ ] test\r\n- [ ] e2e\r\n- [ ] generate\r\n- [ ] add\r\n- [ ] update\r\n- [ ] lint\r\n- [ ] xi18n\r\n- [ ] run\r\n- [ ] config\r\n- [ ] help\r\n- [ ] version\r\n- [ ] doc\r\n```\r\n\r\n### Is this a regression?\r\n\r\n<!-- Did this behavior use to work in the previous version? -->\r\n<!-- ‚úçÔ∏è--> Yes, the previous version in which this bug was not present was: ....\r\nHas worked previously, but I don't know how long ago it regressed\r\n\r\n### Description\r\n\r\n<!-- ‚úçÔ∏è--> A clear and concise description of the problem...\r\nUsing cli 7.3.3\r\n\r\nGenerates src/styles.**scss**\r\n\r\nAngular.json looking for src/styles.**sass**\r\n\r\n## üî¨ Minimal Reproduction\r\n\r\nng new foo \r\nY to angular routing\r\nChange Stylesheet to SASS\r\n\r\nng serve\r\n\r\n## üî• Exception or Error\r\n<pre><code>\r\n<!-- If the issue is accompanied by an exception or an error, please share it below: -->\r\n<!-- ‚úçÔ∏è-->\r\nERROR in multi ./src/styles.sass\r\nModule not found: Error: Can't resolve '/Users/mwhitis/git/mwhitis/foo/src/styles.sass' in '/Users/m420498/git/mwhitis/foo'\r\n‚Ñπ ÔΩ¢wdmÔΩ£: Failed to compile.\r\n</code>\r\n</pre>\r\n\r\n\r\n## üåç Your Environment\r\n<pre><code>\r\n<!-- run `ng version` and paste output below -->\r\n<!-- ‚úçÔ∏è-->\r\n     _                      _                 ____ _     ___\r\n    / \\   _ __   __ _ _   _| | __ _ _ __     / ___| |   |_ _|\r\n   / ‚ñ≥ \\ | '_ \\ / _` | | | | |/ _` | '__|   | |   | |    | |\r\n  / ___ \\| | | | (_| | |_| | | (_| | |      | |___| |___ | |\r\n /_/   \\_\\_| |_|\\__, |\\__,_|_|\\__,_|_|       \\____|_____|___|\r\n                |___/\r\n\r\n\r\nAngular CLI: 7.3.3\r\nNode: 11.10.0\r\nOS: darwin x64\r\nAngular: 7.2.6\r\n... animations, common, compiler, compiler-cli, core, forms\r\n... language-service, platform-browser, platform-browser-dynamic\r\n... router\r\n\r\nPackage                           Version\r\n-----------------------------------------------------------\r\n@angular-devkit/architect         0.13.3\r\n@angular-devkit/build-angular     0.13.3\r\n@angular-devkit/build-optimizer   0.13.3\r\n@angular-devkit/build-webpack     0.13.3\r\n@angular-devkit/core              7.3.3\r\n@angular-devkit/schematics        7.3.3\r\n@angular/cli                      7.3.3\r\n@ngtools/webpack                  7.3.3\r\n@schematics/angular               7.3.3\r\n@schematics/update                0.13.3\r\nrxjs                              6.3.3\r\ntypescript                        3.2.4\r\nwebpack                           4.29.0\r\n</code></pre>\r\n\r\n**Anything else relevant?**\r\n<!-- ‚úçÔ∏èIs this a browser specific issue?
