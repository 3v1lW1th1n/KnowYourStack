Code looks bloated and reminds more workaround than a good solution.\r\n\r\nI see at least 2 possible ways to solve this:\r\n\r\n1. Ability to change attribute names of props. Something like:\r\n```javascript\r\nrawProp: { attributeName: \"prop\" }\r\n```\r\n2. Ability to transform prop value before accessing it. Something like:\r\n```javascript\r\nprop: { transform: (val) => { ... } }\r\n```\r\n\r\n### What does the proposed API look like?\r\n1. Changing attribute name of prop:\r\n\r\n```html\r\n<component size=\"md\"> ... </component>\r\n```\r\n```javascript\r\ncomputed: {\r\n  size: {\r\n    switch (this.rawSize) { ... } // returns something in case blocks\r\n  }\r\n},\r\nprops: {\r\n  rawSize: {\r\n    attributeName: \"size\",\r\n    type: String\r\n  }\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\n2. Transforming prop value before accessing it inside component:\r\n\r\n```html\r\n<component size=\"md\"> ... </component>\r\n```\r\n```javascript\r\nprops: {\r\n  size: {\r\n    type: String,\r\n    transform: (val) => {\r\n      switch (val) { ... } // returns something in case blocks\r\n    }\r\n  }\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nThus, using any of proposed solutions above, `this.size` inside component would return transformed value (for example, `h4` or just `4`).\r\n\r\nNaming is up to you, of course. I believe having one of these features (**or even both!**) would be very awesome and help us to write cleaner code!\r\n\r\n<!-- generated by vue-issues.

I'm creating a dashboard dynamically, which only need three views:\r\n\r\n1. List View\r\n2. Create View\r\n3. Edit View\r\n\r\nLet's create three files: `PageList.vue`, `PageCreate.vue`, `PageEdit.vue`, and use them in routes.\r\n\r\n### What does the proposed API look like?\r\n```js\r\nroutes = [\r\n   {path: '/users', component: PageList},\r\n   {path: '/users/create', component: PageCreate},\r\n   {path: '/users/:id', component: PageEdit},\r\n   {path: '/posts', component: PageList},\r\n   {path: '/posts/create', component: PageCreate},\r\n   {path: '/posts/:id', component: PageEdit},\r\n]\r\n```\r\n\r\nCurrently, this won't work properly. Actually, it has a bug, the `poll` function will run infinitely when switching routes.\r\n\r\n\r\n## Current Bug\r\n\r\nIf you have such routes, and using navigation guard, the `poll` function will run infinitely when switching routes.\r\n\r\n```js\r\nroutes = [\r\n   {path: '/users', component: PageList},\r\n   {path: '/posts', component: PageList},\r\n]\r\n```\r\n\r\nIf you add a `console.log` here https://github.com/vuejs/vue-router/blob/dev/src/history/base.js#L315\r\nit will print log infinitely, because `instances[key]` will always be undefined.\r\n\r\nMy current solution:\r\n\r\n```js\r\nroutes = [\r\n   {path: '/users', component: Object.assign({}, PageList)},\r\n   {path: '/posts', component: Object.assign({}, PageList)},\r\n]\r\n```\r\n\r\n<!-- generated by vue-issues.

Again for SEO reasons, I don't want the whole card to be an anchor element since it will also contain `Content` and `More content` as anchor text.\r\n\r\nNow I understand where this behavior is coming from, it's trying to prevent a child anchor from triggering a full page navigation. Without using `router-link` I can get the best of both worlds by making a clickable div whose event does not propagate and trigger the inner anchor while web crawlers still relate `/route/3` to `I am a good link`:\r\n\r\n```\r\n<div class=\"card\" @click.prevent=\"$router.push({ name: 'MyRoute', params: { id: 3 } })\">\r\n  <h2><a href=\"/route/3\">I am a good link</a></h2>\r\n  <p>Content</p>\r\n  <p>More content</p>\r\n</div>\r\n```\r\n\r\nThese lines are responsible for this behavior:\r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/vuejs/vue-router/blob/9880cbda8dd299315a253abaab69da00eecdf635/src/components/link.js#L86-L99\r\n\r\nNote a shortcoming of this implementation: should the user place more than one anchor element inside the `router-link`, only the first one will get enhanced while the other ones will still trigger a full page reload. To me that scenario makes little sense and I have no idea of any real use case, but perhaps it should raise a warning.\r\n\r\nIs there any 'official' stance on my workaround?\r\n\r\n<!-- generated by vue-issues.

This is suboptimal since it doesn't allow users to provide their own store type.\r\n\r\nBy utilizing TS2.8's conditional type, we can write a `PermissiveAny<T>` type which allows users to customize interface with `any` as fall-back. It can provide **opt-in** type safety for store.\r\n\r\nThe store type is parameterized by `State`. By introducing a global `RootState` interface, we can annotate `$store` as `Store<PermissiveAny<RootState>>`. If users don't augment `RootState`, the $store type is equivalent to `Store<any>`. On the other hand, if users do augment `RootState`, the store type will be changed to `Store<RootState>`.\r\n\r\nEffectively, this feature allows users to manual annotate store type, but without breaking existing code.\r\n\r\ncc @blake-newman @ktsn ","Url":"https://github.com/vuejs/vuex/pull/1192","RelatedDescription":"Open PR \"[feat] [WIP] Store augmentation\" (#1192)"},{"Id":"305255470","IsPullRequest":false,"CreatedAt":"2018-03-14T17:24:15","Actor":"corsarioll","Number":"1190","RawContent":null,"Title":"push element in to state ","State":"closed","Body":"I try to add an element to an array but it returns this error\r\n\r\nTypeError: Cannot add property 5, object is not extensible\r\n    at Array.push (<anonymous>)\r\n    at Store.addProjectsMutation (store.js?adc6:67)\r\n    at wrappedMutationHandler (vuex.esm.js?358c:697)\r\n    at commitIterator (vuex.esm.js?358c:389)\r\n    at Array.forEach (<anonymous>)\r\n    at eval (vuex.esm.js?358c:388)\r\n    at Store._withCommit (vuex.esm.js?358c:495)\r\n    at Store.commit (vuex.esm.js?358c:387)\r\n    at Object.boundCommit [as commit] (vuex.esm.js?358c:335)\r\n    at eval (store.js?adc6:120)\r\n\r\neste es mi codigo \r\n\r\n`addProjectsMutation (state,newValue){\r\n            var test = {\r\n                name : \"jeisson\",\r\n                email : \"test@email.com\",\r\n                logoImage : \"https://files.genial.guru/files/news/part_2/20205/1215060-4-1-650-a542d8629a-1501787353.jpg\",\r\n                description : \"test description con espacios y saltos de linea   asd  asd  das  dasd\"\r\n            }\r\n            console.log(state.projects)\r\n            state.projects.push(test)\r\n        },\r\n`","Url":"https://github.com/vuejs/vuex/issues/1190","RelatedDescription":"Closed issue \"push element in to state \" (#1190)"},{"Id":"304734995","IsPullRequest":false,"CreatedAt":"2018-03-13T14:25:14","Actor":"GMounir","Number":"1187","RawContent":null,"Title":"common state namespace","State":"closed","Body":"### Version\r\n3.0.0\r\n\r\nI have state with common objects for example:\r\n\r\n```\r\nexport default {\r\n\tresource: {\r\n\t\tall: [],\r\n\t\tselected: null\r\n\t},\r\n        ....\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\ni import the state to use in components  \r\n\r\n```\r\nimport state from '@common/store/state'\r\n\r\nexport default {\r\n\tnamespaced: true,\r\n\tstate,\r\n\tgetters,\r\n\tactions,\r\n\tmutations\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nafter that i use namespace in every component everything working, but one thing i don't know if is right or not:\r\n\r\ni'm working in namespace **test1**\r\nif i did an action to resource for example fill **resource.all[...]**\r\nthe namespace **test2** also is filled.\r\ni tried _.clone(), _.assign() not working or i did not used right.\r\nPlease someone help me...\r\n\r\n\r\n### What is expected?\r\nexpected: fill only the state that i'm woking in\r\n\r\n### What is actually happening?\r\nhappening: fill all states\r\n\r\n<!-- generated by vue-issues.
