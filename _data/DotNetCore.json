Does the GC only need unwind information for the managed code part? Or do I need to provide information for the C/C++ parts and even the dynamic libs of the OS?

There's a comment in that issue that it would also be nice if the JIT could fold a \"read-then-bswap\" or a \"bswap-then-write\" instruction pair into a single `movbe` instruction on supported platforms. For certain application code which performs such reads and writes with high frequency, it can result in significant codegen savings. See in particular the codegen at https://github.com/dotnet/coreclr/issues/26729#issuecomment-531862356, where each \"mov / bswap\" pair could be a single \"movbe\".\r\n\r\nThere are a few ways to go about this. We could add a `movbe` intrinsic and have callers (like `BinaryPrimitives`) special-case that intrinsic if it is available. Though it'd probably be more convenient to leave all of the call sites unchanged and instead to have the JIT special-case these instruction pairs.\r\n\r\nThis could end up being particularly helpful for writes, as it could end up saving not just codegen size, but also the total number of allocated registers. Consider the following.\r\n\r\n```cs\r\nint i = GetInt();\r\nBinaryPrimitives.WriteBigEndian(theSpan, i);\r\n// keep using 'i' here\r\n```\r\n\r\nSince the `bswap` instruction mutates its register, the JIT currently needs to make a temporary copy of the value if _i_ is intended to be used elsewhere in the method.\r\n\r\n```asm\r\nmov eax, ebx  ; ebx = 'i', eax = copy of 'i'\r\nbswap eax  ; eax = swapped(i)\r\nmov dword ptr [rcx], eax  ; theSpan[0] = swapped(i)\r\n````\r\n\r\nAll three of those instructions could be folded into a single `movbe` with no temporary registers required.\r\n\r\nOne complication is that there's no 16-bit `bswap` (it's instead a 16-bit `rol`), but there _is_ a 16-bit `movbe`, so the JIT would likely need to special-case that particular pattern.","Url":"https://github.com/dotnet/coreclr/issues/26735","RelatedDescription":"Open issue \"JIT should emit \"movbe\" instead of \"mov / bswap\" on compatible hardware\" (#26735)"},{"Id":"494154230","IsPullRequest":false,"CreatedAt":"2019-09-16T16:29:22","Actor":"jashook","Number":"26733","RawContent":null,"Title":"[CI] Git checkout sometimes fails unable to find the PR merge commit","State":"open","Body":"Seems like somehow the checkout sometimes is shallow depth=1, which may not have the correct merge commit. @trylek \r\n\r\nhttps://dev.azure.com/dnceng/public/_build/results?buildId=355295","Url":"https://github.com/dotnet/coreclr/issues/26733","RelatedDescription":"Open issue \"[CI] Git checkout sometimes fails unable to find the PR merge commit\" (#26733)"},{"Id":"494149352","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2019-09-16T16:19:07","Actor":"filipnavara","Number":"26732","RawContent":null,"Title":"Remove silent catch","State":"open","Body":"Dry run of CI for #26730.","Url":"https://github.com/dotnet/coreclr/pull/26732","RelatedDescription":"Open PR \"Remove silent catch\" (#26732)"},{"Id":"494141834","IsPullRequest":false,"CreatedAt":"2019-09-16T16:03:52","Actor":"nxrighthere","Number":"26731","RawContent":null,"Title":"Performance anomalies in comparsion to Mono","State":"open","Body":"Recently I made a bunch of various benchmarks to test Unity's Burst compiler against native compilers.

(original?)\r\n- signed attributes are technically speaking allowed in the counter SignerInfo - I cannot think on how this would reasonably work at the moment though so presumably not support it?\r\n\r\ncc: @bartonjs @heng-liu ","Url":"https://github.com/dotnet/corefx/issues/41158","RelatedDescription":"Open issue \"CMS should support attributes for counter-signers\" (#41158)"},{"Id":"494629855","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2019-09-17T14:28:33","Actor":"dotnet-maestro[bot]","Number":"41157","RawContent":null,"Title":"[master] Update dependencies from dotnet/standard","State":"closed","Body":"This pull request updates the following dependencies\r\n\r\n[marker]: <> (Begin:a2867060-7cad-40ad-7917-08d6937ac7c4)\r\n## From https://github.com/dotnet/standard\r\n- **Build**: 20190916.1\r\n- **Date Produced**: 9/16/2019 12:42 PM\r\n- **Commit**: acafb789d98dca5940e79dd3c56b9e20399116c4\r\n- **Branch**: refs/heads/master\r\n- **Updates**:\r\n  - **NETStandard.Library** -> 2.2.0-prerelease.19466.1\r\n\r\n[marker]: <> (End:a2867060-7cad-40ad-7917-08d6937ac7c4)\r\n\r\n","Url":"https://github.com/dotnet/corefx/pull/41157","RelatedDescription":"Closed or merged PR \"[master] Update dependencies from dotnet/standard\" (#41157)"},{"Id":"494613218","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2019-09-17T14:17:50","Actor":"stephentoub","Number":"41155","RawContent":null,"Title":"Remove unused files from System.Net.Http","State":"closed","Body":"","Url":"https://github.com/dotnet/corefx/pull/41155","RelatedDescription":"Closed or merged PR \"Remove unused files from System.Net.Http\" (#41155)"},{"Id":"494581590","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2019-09-17T13:35:42","Actor":"dotnet-maestro[bot]","Number":"41153","RawContent":null,"Title":"[master] Update dependencies from dotnet/core-setup dotnet/corefx","State":"closed","Body":"This pull request updates the following dependencies\r\n\r\n[marker]: <> (Begin:08549e3e-8f8e-4201-dc38-08d6815d521b)\r\n## From https://github.com/dotnet/core-setup\r\n- **Build**: 20190916.2\r\n- **Date Produced**: 9/16/2019 4:19 PM\r\n- **Commit**: 9042fe6c81aa3b47f58ccd94ff02e42f9f7a4e46\r\n- **Branch**: refs/heads/master\r\n- **Updates**:\r\n  - **Microsoft.NETCore.App** -> 5.0.0-alpha1.19466.2\r\n  - **Microsoft.NETCore.DotNetHost** -> 5.0.0-alpha1.19466.2\r\n  - **Microsoft.NETCore.DotNetHostPolicy** -> 5.0.0-alpha1.19466.2\r\n\r\n[marker]: <> (End:08549e3e-8f8e-4201-dc38-08d6815d521b)\r\n\r\n[marker]: <> (Begin:368e60b9-57f7-48bd-020d-08d6874ba0bd)\r\n## From https://github.com/dotnet/corefx\r\n- **Build**: 20190916.8\r\n- **Date Produced**: 9/17/2019 7:53 AM\r\n- **Commit**: 4aea703673e942756c02b222e6b5babaf8612a25\r\n- **Branch**: refs/heads/master\r\n- **Updates**:\r\n  - **runtime.native.System.IO.Ports** -> 5.0.0-alpha1.19466.8\r\n  - **Microsoft.NETCore.Platforms** -> 5.0.0-alpha1.19466.8\r\n\r\n[marker]: <> (End:368e60b9-57f7-48bd-020d-08d6874ba0bd)\r\n\r\n","Url":"https://github.com/dotnet/corefx/pull/41153","RelatedDescription":"Closed or merged PR \"[master] Update dependencies from dotnet/core-setup dotnet/corefx\" (#41153)"},{"Id":"494583611","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2019-09-17T13:34:49","Actor":"dotnet-maestro[bot]","Number":"41154","RawContent":null,"Title":"[master] Update dependencies from dotnet/coreclr","State":"closed","Body":"This pull request updates the following dependencies\r\n\r\n[marker]: <> (Begin:be1e858a-d56c-4174-7dc0-08d6ba16a224)\r\n## From https://github.com/dotnet/coreclr\r\n- **Build**: 20190916.3\r\n- **Date Produced**: 9/17/2019 1:17 AM\r\n- **Commit**: f5437ac095272f1ab5e8ca79960add974fa96f2d\r\n- **Branch**: refs/heads/master\r\n- **Updates**:\r\n  - **Microsoft.NET.Sdk.IL** -> 5.0.0-alpha1.19466.3\r\n  - **Microsoft.NETCore.ILAsm** -> 5.0.0-alpha1.19466.3\r\n  - **Microsoft.NETCore.Runtime.CoreCLR** -> 5.0.0-alpha1.19466.3\r\n\r\n[marker]: <> (End:be1e858a-d56c-4174-7dc0-08d6ba16a224)\r\n\r\n","Url":"https://github.com/dotnet/corefx/pull/41154","RelatedDescription":"Closed or merged PR \"[master] Update dependencies from dotnet/coreclr\" (#41154)"},{"Id":"494341367","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2019-09-17T13:26:21","Actor":"MattGal","Number":"41149","RawContent":null,"Title":"Fix a typo","State":"closed","Body":"This is here for me to monitor a totally code-change-free PR to ensure Helix is doing OK.","Url":"https://github.com/dotnet/corefx/pull/41149","RelatedDescription":"Closed or merged PR \"Fix a typo\" (#41149)"},{"Id":"494530453","IsPullRequest":false,"CreatedAt":"2019-09-17T10:11:44","Actor":"webczat","Number":"41152","RawContent":null,"Title":"support named shared memory on unixes","State":"open","Body":"I know that shared memory is not supported on unix, as in, the family of MemoryMappedFile.CreateNew methods.\r\nI saw the comment saying why they are not supported.\r\nHowever, what about posix shared memory? shm_open and friends.

`string` to, let's say, `int`\r\n- move struct declaration from Lib to App\r\n\r\nYou can check out a solution that illustrates all these permutations and their effect on the compiler behavior

After fixing some more minor issues and brush up my ARM64 assembler knowledge I was finally able to run a simple hello world on my ARM64 system without crashing. Doing things like writing to the log (the system doesn't have a text based console at all), Thread.Sleep, Environment.TickCount, printing the command line arguments etc works fine. But than I made the \"mistake\" to trigger the GC. \r\n\r\nTo make a long story short after some more debugging I noticed that the unwind of the stack does not work. The reason was pretty obvious. Libunwind doesn't have any information about the function were the stack walk should be started. I am aware that there are some parts missing for ARM64 targets that I need to fill but there is one question I was not able to answer so far.

But it than crashed during the shutdown. After some debugging i figured out that the static constructors are never called. After some more debugging I noticed that ClassConstructorRunner.GetCctor corrupts the stack frame,\r\n\r\nIt happens at the end of the method in an assembler block that i believe is the finally funclet for the using. It looks like this\r\n\r\n  28667c: a9be7bfd stp x29, x30, [sp, #-32]!\r\n  286680: f90013f3 str x19, [sp, #32]\r\n  286684: 9103a3a0 add x0, x29, #0xe8\r\n  286688: 97fc0d42 bl 189b90 <S_P_CoreLib_System_Threading_LockHolder__Dispose>\r\n  28668c: d503201f nop\r\n  286690: d503201f nop\r\n  286694: f94013f3 ldr x19, [sp, #32]\r\n  286698: a8c27bfd ldp x29, x30, [sp], #32\r\n  28669c: d65f03c0 ret\r\n\r\nThe fact that x19 is stored with an offset of 32 looks strange for me and it overwrites the already stored data. Based on other stackframes I would expect an offset of 16 here. Or the new stackframe for the funclet needs to be 16 bytes larger.\r\n\r\nDisclaimer: As the development system for the custom ARM64 system runs on windows I although use a ARM64 jit that is build to run on X64. Very simular to the protonojit but not as alt jit to get all the data needed to write the arm64 elf file that the linker for the custom ARM64 system needs. Unfortunately I don't have an ARM64 windows or linux system to check if a non cross jit generates the same code.\r\n\r\nI assume there is no ready to use jit for my use case and I need to build it anyway. In this case I could properly fix the issue but I would need a hint how the code is expected to look like.

However, this separation has led to a variety of complications for contributors and maintainers alike.  For example:\r\n- **Confusion about where issues should be opened.**  It’s not always clear in which repo an issue should be reported, complicated by the fact that some implementations actually span repositories (e.g. a type might be exposed through a reference assembly and have its tests in corefx but actually be implemented in System.Private.CoreLib in coreclr).\r\n- **Difficulty sharing source.**  System.Private.CoreLib is intricately connected to the rest of the runtime, and thus has lived with the runtime code.  That, however, means that although corefx has been intended as the place to share as much core library code as possible across any underlying runtime, we’ve needed to keep a significant body of code in System.Private.CoreLib, which then has meant it’s needed to be “mirrored” to each runtime repo (coreclr, corert, mono) that needs to consume it as source; similarly, corefx has similarly required access to much of that source, for example to use the same interop DllImports that are employed elsewhere in the runtimes.  The automatic mirror that shares this source needs to be maintained, and even when it has been, it’s often led to lag.  It’s also complicated developer processes, where to validate a change in one repo generally requires manually mirroring the code to other local repos in order to validate the change and ensure merging into one repo won’t break the others.\r\n- **PRs spanning multiple repos.**  Because the runtime, CoreLib, and the core libraries are all intricately linked, changing runtime behaviors, adding new APIs, or changing various build processes (e.g. improving static analysis) often requires multiple PRs carefully staged across time and multiple repos.  For example, to add a new method to a type like Dictionary<>, a developer must first make the source changes in her local coreclr repo and the test and reference assembly changes in her local corefx repo.  When satisfied with the fix, the developer must submit a PR to coreclr as well as a PR to corefx, the latter of which will fail.  Eventually the coreclr PR will be merged, and the changes will mirror to the other runtimes that also require the update.  Eventually those mirror PRs will be merged, and builds will be created containing the fix for each runtime.  At some point later those builds will be consumed into the corefx repo, after which point the original corefx PR can be re-validated and eventually merged.  That’s the best case; things get more complicated in situations where there are bidirectional dependencies.\r\n- **Building an installable runtime.** Self-hosting a custom built .NET requires intricate knowledge of how all the repos work and interact.  A developer can’t just clone a single repo, make a desired change, and easily produce an installer.\r\n- **Consistency.**  One goal we had for more fine-grained repos was to enable isolation and independence for teams working within each repo’s confines, but this has led to non-trivial duplication of effort on things like build systems and CI, and then the resulting lack of consistency as each system ends up diverging from the others.\r\n\r\nThe issues go beyond the runtime.  For example, the ASP.NET maintainers and community did a great job in the past year or so consolidating from ~55 repos down to ~5 repos, but that’s still more repos than is desirable, leading to similar issues as cited above for the runtime.  On top of that, these ASP.NET repositories are in the aspnet GitHub org, which adds an additional set of issues, for example:\r\n- **Complications moving issues between repos.**  If a developer opens an issue in aspnet/aspnetcore and it’s determined that the cause of the issue is actually in dotnet/corefx, there is no GitHub mechanism to enable easily moving that issue across the aspnet to dotnet organizational boundary.\r\n- **Permissions.** Each organization’s permissions end up needing to be managed and maintained separately.\r\n\r\nThe issues extend into tooling as well.  For example, we currently have multiple repositories that all logically make up the dotnet CLI, but actually creating a working installer spans multiple repos.\r\n\r\n### Plan\r\n\r\nTo address these issues, we’re planning to make some changes to our repository structure:\r\n- **dotnet/platform.**  We plan to combine dotnet/coreclr, dotnet/corefx, dotnet/corert, dotnet/core-setup, and the relevant portions of mono/mono into a new dotnet/platform repo.  Everything needed to build and produce the Microsoft.NETCore.App shared framework will be in this repo.  We will no longer suffer from the complications of source mirroring.  Features like changing runtime behavior or adding an API will no longer require a complicated dance across multiple repos.  Etc.\r\n- **dotnet/aspnetcore.**  We plan to move the existing aspnet/aspnetcore repository into the dotnet organization.  Along with that, we aim to combine a variety of the other aspnet repositories into aspnetcore, such as aspnet/blazor.  Whether repos like entityframeworkcore remain separate or combined remains an open question.  A goal is that, just as dotnet/platform will be responsible for the creation of Microsoft.NETCore.App, dotnet/aspnetcore will be responsible for the creation of Microsoft.AspNETCore.App.\r\n- **dotnet/cli.**  We plan to combine dotnet/toolset and dotnet/sdk into the dotnet/cli repo.\r\n\r\n### FAQ\r\n\r\n#### Why are we merging repos?\r\n\r\nWe believe we can significantly improve several aspects of .NET on GitHub by combining repos, benefiting both maintainers and contributors.  These improvements will manifest in a variety of ways, such as in better issue management, much easier models of contribution, and easier and faster ways to build and install the resulting bits.\r\n\r\n####  What will happen to the aspnet org?\r\n\r\nThe aspnet org as a separate entity is legacy and artificial.  In time we hope to absorb it into the dotnet org and sunset the aspnet org.\r\n\r\n#### Will the coreclr and corefx repos go away?\r\n\r\nWith the help of GitHub, we plan to migrate all issues from these repos to the new dotnet/platform repo, and then lock down creation of additional issues, such that the repos will no longer be used for issue management.  We will also inhibit the creation of PRs to the master branch, which will effectively become an archive for read-only review of history.  In this sense, these repos will be archived, and no active development will happen with them.  However, we plan to continue servicing previous .NET Core releases out of these repos, so the various release branches (e.g. release/2.1, release/3.0, etc.) will continue to see (limited) activity.\r\n\r\n#### Will the mono repo go away?\r\n\r\nNo. mono/mono contains the source for the full mono stack and will continue to live on happily.  We will simply be moving the managed source associated with System.Private.CoreLib and copying the relatively small amount of source that makes up the native mono runtime to dotnet/platform.  We may choose to then use some mirroring technology to keep the runtime copy in sync (this will, however, not suffer from the same mirroring issues we currently experience, as we would not be mirroring between two components required to build the same binaries), or we may choose to let them diverge and manually sync only those changes deemed relevant to both implementations.\r\n\r\n#### Will the corert repo go away?\r\n\r\nYes.  We plan to retire/archive the corert repo.  Some of the technology in the corert repo will be migrated to the master branch of dotnet/platform, where it will be productized as part of .NET.  Other portions of the corert repo will be migrated to feature branches of dotnet/platform, where the experimentation can continue.  In this way, we will use feature branches to continue experimenting with the corert technology, while making it easier to share portions with its shipping counterpart and also graduate functionality into master if/when it’s ready.\r\n\r\n#### Does this mean there will be a single repo for all of .NET?\r\n\r\nNo.  We will be reducing the number of repos that contribute to .NET, but currently we do not believe that going all the way down to one is the right answer.\r\n\r\n#### Doesn’t this mean that issue and PR tracking will now be overwhelming?\r\n\r\nIt is already the case that the vast majority of issues in a given repo are not relevant to any individual developer, and with several thousand open issues in each repo and on the order of a hundred open PRs in each, we already need systems (e.g. labels) to successfully manage issues and PRs.  As such, we don’t believe the merging will have a significant impact on this aspect of developer productivity.  If it turns out to have an unexpectedly large negative impact, we will work with the community to find ways to mitigate the problem.  However, there are already a multitude of successful open source projects on GitHub with at least an order of magnitude more issues.\r\n\r\n#### What will happen to existing issues?\r\n\r\nWith the help of GitHub functionality, we plan to migrate all issues from old repos (e.g. dotnet/coreclr, dotnet/corefx) to the new repos (e.g. dotnet/platform).  We may also use this as a forcing function to revisit stale issues and either close those that are no longer relevant or reinvigorate those that are demanding of more immediate attention.\r\n\r\n#### What about git history?\r\n\r\nIn general, we plan to keep history, such that history from each constituent repo will be a part of the new repo.  However, we have made some mistakes in the past (e.g. large binaries, multitudes of automated PRs for flowing bits and source between repos, etc.), and we plan to rewrite history to correct those mistakes wherever possible and impactful.  Some rough calculations suggest this could end up significantly reducing the size of the repos as well as the time it takes to clone, which should not only help developers approaching the project but also CI.  This will end up meaning that SHAs may be different in the new repo than they were in the old repo; as previously mentioned, however, any references to the old SHAs in the old repos will continue to work, as those repos will remain accessible.\r\n\r\n#### Will I still show up in the contributor list due to previous contributions?\r\n\r\nYes.  We plan to merge all such history.\r\n\r\n#### Will this break debugging with SourceLink?\r\n\r\nNo.  The existing repos will continue to be accessible, and commit SHAs there will remain unchanged.\r\n\r\n#### Might plans change?\r\n\r\nSure.  Part of the goal of posting this announcement is to hear from you, hear about additional benefits you're excited about, and hear about additional concerns we may not have considered.  We will include such ideas in our planning and course correct as necessary.\r\n\r\n## Discussion\r\n\r\nTo discuss these plans, please comment on the corresponding issue at https://github.com/dotnet/coreclr/issues/26175.\r\n","Url":"https://github.com/dotnet/announcements/issues/119","RelatedDescription":"Open issue \"Consolidating .NET GitHub repos\" (#119)"},{"Id":"470434872","IsPullRequest":false,"CreatedAt":"2019-07-19T16:54:02","Actor":"richlander","Number":"118","RawContent":null,"Title":".NET Core master branches have switched to \"5.0\"","State":"open","Body":"# .NET Core master branches have switched to \"5.0\"\r\n\r\nVarious .NET Core repos have switched their `master` branches to \"5.0\", and will use 3.x branches for 3.0 and 3.1 projects.

Every person who started a scenario successfully finished it.\r\n    - We feel this validates that we picked the right scope for a 60 minute study of people from various backgrounds\r\n* Overall people liked the new API\r\n    - Key value prop for most people was the fact that \"it's now built in\"\r\n    - Very few mentioned perf and the ones that did thought that it probably wouldn't make a difference in their scenarios.\r\n    - Most people said they would prefer `System.Text.Json` for new APIs, but would stick to JSON.NET in code that already uses it.\r\n    - **[Action]** None, this is in line with what we expected.\r\n* Virtually everyone tried to google for sample code in the documentation\r\n    - Everyone found our blog post and online documentation\r\n    - People new to .NET were confused that JSON.NET and `System.Text.Json` weren't the same thing\r\n    - Everyone complained that the current docs are lacking, especially sample code.\r\n    - **[Action]** Docs are work in progress. We plan on shipping with a fully documented API surface and sample code.\r\n* Virtually everyone found the key type relatively quickly\r\n    - Some people were confused when types were static, rather than something that one can new up\r\n    - **[Action]** None. This is by-design as we try to reduce the number of allocations.\r\n* Virtually everyone had trouble selecting the correct method on\r\n  `JsonSerializer`\r\n    - We chose a very complicated naming convention\r\n    - **[Action]** We simplified it by using names that people in the study told us were looking for.\r\n* Most of our error messages were well received because they told people what\r\n  the problem is & how they can fix them.\r\n    - One error message was unclear because we reported an unexpected character when we could have reported that we didn't expect a comment.\r\n    - **[Action]** We've reworded the error message.\r\n    - We had one error message that was generated by a lower layer and provided an action item that doesn't make sense when people receive it when using the higher layer component.\r\n    - **[Action]** We've reworded the error message to be more generic so it makes sense for both kind of consumers.\r\n* Virtually everyone used the new Roslyn completion feature which will also show\r\n  types from namespaces not imported yet.\r\n    - However, virtually nobody realized that they were doing it.\r\n    - This caused confusion when people found other APIs that happen to include Json in them, specifically the old data contract serialization.\r\n    - **[Action]** Talk to the Roslyn IDE team to see if this something more people will run into. This could prove to be especially problematic for technologies that share type names (e.g. `UserControl` in WinForms and WPF) and both are referenced by the project.\r\n* Optional parameters and `async`/`await` are usability cliffs\r\n    - Many were confused by optional parameters and tried to pass them in, even though they didn't have to.\r\n    - **[Action]** Talk to the Roslyn IDE team to see if we can visualize them better in VS.\r\n    - **[Action]** Try to avoid heavy use of optional parameters for mainline APIs.\r\n    - Async is a very steep cliff. People have no idea what to do in their code to make async work. While IntelliSense shows the usage by prefixing it with await, people didn't notice that.\r\n    - **[Action]** Unclear; this is a broader issue.\r\n* Virtually nobody used F1 to get help for APIs\r\n    - *Surprise*. I expected more people to use <kbd>F1</kbd>.\r\n* Virtually everyone used F12 to explore the API (\"metadata view\")\r\n    - *Surprise*. I expected most people to explore the type via the\r\n      IntelliSense completion\r\n* Nobody used Object Browser to explorer the APIs\r\n    - *Surprise*. I expected at least some people to.\r\n\r\n## Discussion\r\n\r\nFor a discussion, please go to https://github.com/dotnet/corefx/issues/39304.","Url":"https://github.com/dotnet/announcements/issues/117","RelatedDescription":"Open issue \"System.Text.Json usability study results\" (#117)"},{"Id":"465034831","IsPullRequest":false,"CreatedAt":"2019-07-08T03:13:38","Actor":"leecow","Number":"116","RawContent":null,"Title":"Updates to releases.json (.NET Core release metadata)","State":"open","Body":"**The changes described in this issue will be live with the .NET Core July update on 7/9/2019.**\r\n\r\nThe releases.json files (e.g. [2.2 releases.json](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dotnet/core/master/release-notes/2.2/releases.json)) are comprehensive metadata files which capture details of each .NET Core release. These files, along with the top level [releases-index.json](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dotnet/core/master/release-notes/releases-index.json), are becoming increasingly important .NET Core release assets. These files, one for each major.minor channel, are relied upon by many to detect when updates for .NET Core are available, discover security update details and other uses.\r\n\r\nChanges are sometimes necessary, and the growing dependencies require that we treat compatibility of the schema with the utmost care. This announcement describes an addition to the releases.json schema.\r\n\r\n## SDK Versions and Visual Studio\r\n\r\nBecause of current .NET Core SDK product construction dependencies, there is a hard link between the Runtime, SDK, toolset (compilers, MSBuild, NuGet, and other components), and Visual Studio. Simplistically, this means that when anything updates, everything updates. The unfortunate result of this linking is that multiple versions of the SDK are released with each monthly update for each supported versions of Visual Studio. For example, the May Update for .NET Core 2.2 included the 2.2.5 runtime, 2.2.107 SDK for Visual Studio 2017 and 2.2.204 for Visual Studio 2019 and yet another pair of SDK versions for .NET Core 2.1. An example of this is the [2.2.5 Release Notes](https://github.com/dotnet/core/blob/master/release-notes/2.2/2.2.5/2.2.5.md). \r\n\r\nThis is a confusing situation and we are working to mitigate the need to release multiple SDKs with .NET Core 3.0. The need for multiple SDK versions will persist for 2.1 LTS.\r\n\r\n## Adding the SDKS array\r\n\r\nTo appropriately model multiple SDKs per release, we are adding an SDKs array to releases.json, which will contain SDK objects. The top-level SDK object will represent the highest versioned SDK for a given update. Using the previous 2.2.5 update example, SDK 2.2.204 is in the top SDK object as well as duplicated in the SDKS array. All other applicable 2.2* SDK objects are included in the SDKS array. The SDK objects within the array will carry specific Visual Studio compatibility and version inclusion information to provide appropriate context.\r\n\r\nHere is an example of the new array based on the upcoming July update.\r\nAgain, this will be additive and the previous SDK object will include the highest SDK version for the release.\r\n\r\n```json\r\n{\r\n    \"sdk\": {\r\n        \"version\": \"2.2.301\",\r\n        \"version-display\": \"2.2.301\",\r\n        \"runtime-version\": \"2.2.6\",\r\n        \"vs-version\": \"16.1.3\",\r\n        \"vs-support\": \"Visual Studio 2019 (v16.1)\",\r\n        \"csharp-version\": \"7.3\",\r\n        \"fsharp-version\": \"4.5\",\r\n        \"vb-version\": null,\r\n        \"files\": []\r\n    },\r\n    \"sdks\": [\r\n        {\r\n            \"version\": \"2.2.301\",\r\n            \"version-display\": \"2.2.301\",\r\n            \"runtime-version\": \"2.2.6\",\r\n            \"vs-version\": \"16.1.3\",\r\n            \"vs-support\": \"Visual Studio 2019 (v16.1)\",\r\n            \"csharp-version\": \"7.3\",\r\n            \"fsharp-version\": \"4.5\",\r\n            \"vb-version\": null,\r\n            \"files\": []\r\n        },\r\n        {\r\n          \"version\": \"2.2.205\",\r\n          \"version-display\": \"2.2.205\",\r\n          \"runtime-version\": \"2.2.6\",\r\n          \"vs-version\": \"16.0.5\",\r\n          \"vs-support\": \"Visual Studio 2019 (v16.0)\",\r\n          \"csharp-version\": \"7.3\",\r\n          \"fsharp-version\": \"4.5\",\r\n          \"vb-version\": null,\r\n          \"files\": []\r\n        }\r\n    ]\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\n## vs-version and the Runtime\r\n\r\nThe same version of the runtime is included in multiple versions of Visual Studio. To account for this, the vs-version field is being updated to a comma-delimited string. The string will represent all versions of Visual Studio which first include the particular .NET Core update. Again, an example from the upcoming July Update.\r\n\r\n```json\r\n\"runtime\": {\r\n        \"version\": \"2.2.6\",\r\n        \"version-display\": \"2.2.6\",\r\n        \"vs-version\": \"15.9.13, 16.1.3, 16.2.0\",\r\n```\r\n\r\nThe same `vs-versions` changes will be seen in the `aspnetcore-runtime` object.\r\n\r\n## Future Enhancements\r\n\r\nThere are other improvements to the schema which have been suggested by the community which we are evaluating. Generally, theses enhancements are additive and should not represent compatibility compromises for existing parsers and similar announcements will be published ahead of any changes.\r\n\r\n","Url":"https://github.com/dotnet/announcements/issues/116","RelatedDescription":"Open issue \"Updates to releases.json (.NET Core release metadata)\" (#116)"},{"Id":"444065225","IsPullRequest":false,"CreatedAt":"2019-05-14T18:38:23","Actor":"TaraOverfield","Number":"114","RawContent":null,"Title":"May 2019 .NET Updates","State":"open","Body":"# May 2019 .NET Updates\r\n\r\nThe following .NET updates were released in May 2019.

Either target .NET Core 2.1 or lower, or use a version of the .NET SDK that supports .NET Core 2.2.`\r\n\r\nIf you downloaded the .NET Core SDK 2.2 between April 2 and April 12, 2019, the main [.NET downloads page](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/download/) included only 2.2.2nn. Starting April 12th, a new button marked \"Compatible with Visual Studio 2017\" is provided to target 2.2.1nn.

This article explains why this happens and how you can fix your installation.\r\n\r\nWhen Visual Studio can't find an appropriate version of the .NET Core SDK, you'll receive an error message. This may appear in the Error pane as NETSDK1045:\r\n\r\n\"The current .NET SDK does not support targeting .NET Core 2...\"\r\n\r\nYou can check what .NET Core SDKs you have on your machine with the following command:\r\n\r\n```bash\r\ndotnet --list-sdks\r\n```\r\n\r\nUnless you have a global.json file, when you use `dotnet` from the command line, the latest .NET Core SDK is used.\r\n\r\n> [TIP!] \r\n> Open a command prompt and try to build with `dotnet build`. If the command line build works, but Visual Studio doesn't suggestions in this article may help.\r\n\r\nThe last two digits of the .NET Core SDK version numbers are in the format are a patch number, which is represented by `nn` in this article because we will continue to service them to include the latest runtimes. To find out more, vist the [Overview of how .NET Core is versioned page](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/core/versions/).\r\n\r\n## Fixes for Common Problems\r\n\r\n### Visual Studio 2017 can't target .NET Core 2.2\r\n\r\nIf you receive the error message in Visual Studio 2017:\r\n\r\n`The current .NET SDK does not support targeting .NET Core 2.2… Either target .NET Core 2.1 or lower, or use a version of the .NET SDK that supports .NET Core 2.2.`\r\n\r\nUse `dotnet --list-sdks` to ensure you have .NET Core SDK 2.2.1nn. As an example, 2.2.106 would be a valid entry.\r\n\r\nIf you downloaded the .NET Core SDK 2.2 after April 2, 2019, version 2.2.2nn (such as 2.2.203) is listed first and is the highest version available. However, Visual Studio 2017 requires 2.2.1nn (such as 2.2.106). .NET Core SDK 2.2.2nn works with Visual Studio 2019. Visual Studio 2017 and Visual Studio 2019 can be installed side by side, but this requires both .NET Core SDK 2.2.1nn and .NET Core SDK 2.2.2nn to develop .NET Core 2.2 applications.\r\n\r\nTo download .NET Core SDK 2.2.2nn, visit the [.NET downloads page](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/download/dotnet-core/2.2).\r\n\r\n### Visual Studio 2017 can't target .NET Core 2.1\r\n\r\nIf you receive this error message in Visual Studio 2017:\r\n\r\n`The current .NET SDK does not support targeting .NET Core 2.1. Either target .NET Core 2.0 or lower, or use a version of the .NET SDK that supports .NET Core 2.1.`\r\n\r\nUse `dotnet --list-sdks` to ensure you have .NET Core SDK 2.1.5nn. As an example, 2.1.505 would be a valid entry. \r\n\r\nThis problem occurs of you manually uninstall the 2.1.5nn version.\r\n\r\nThe Visual Studio 2019 installation will not remove this file and Visual Studio 2017 will continue to work side by side.\r\n\r\nTo reinstall .NET Core SDK 2.1.5nn, visit the [.NET downloads page](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/download/dotnet-core/2.1).\r\n\r\n### Visual Studio 2019 can't target .NET Core 3.0 Preview\r\n\r\nIf you receive this error message in Visual Studio 2019:\r\n\r\n`The current .NET SDK does not support targeting .NET Core 2.1. Either target .NET Core 2.0 or lower, or use a version of the .NET SDK that supports .NET Core 2.1.`\r\n\r\nUse `dotnet --list-sdks` to ensure you have .NET Core SDK 3.0.100-preview... As an example, SDK 3.0.100-preview3-010431 would be a valid entry.\r\n\r\nTo install .NET Core SDK 3.0.1nn preview, visit the [.NET downloads page](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/download/dotnet-core/3.0).\r\n\r\nIn Visual Studio, go to `Tools\\Options\\Projects and Solutions\\.NET Core` and check the box `Use Previews of the .NET Core SDK`.\r\n\r\n> [NOTE!]\r\n> This option will be moving to `Tools\\Options\\Environment` and renamed `Preview Features` in Visual Studio 2019 version 16.1 Preview 2.\r\n\r\nIf you are targeting .NET Core 3.0 preview, the [C# language version will be C# 8.0 Preview by default](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/visualstudio/releases/2019/release-notes#csharp-defaults) allowing you to use new C# features.\r\n\r\n## Understand the relationship between .NET Core SDKs and Visual Studio build tools\r\n\r\nVisual Studio has its own copies of tools like MSBuild, NuGet and the compilers. If you install the .NET Core workload, it also installs the .NET Core SDK which has versions of these tools and provides tasks and targets. These two versions are built from the same repositories, but target .NET Framework and .NET Core respectively. \r\n\r\nWhen you build a .NET Core project in Visual Studio, it uses Visual Studio's copy of MSBuild, but the tasks and targets are supplied from the selected version of the .NET Core SDK. \r\n\r\nWhen you upgrade the .NET Core SDK, you get new tasks and targets. These new tasks and targets may contain features that are not supported by older versions of MSBuild. Like all of the .NET Core SDK, MSBuild is backwards compatible. It is not forwards compatible.\r\n\r\nThis generally works well, but requires a guarantee that the tasks and targets work with the MSBuild version. To ensure this, each .NET Core SDK indicates an MSBuild version range that is used by Visual Studio to determine compatibility. Versions of the .NET Core SDK that have a higher MSBuild identifier than expected are ignored by Visual Studio. In the normal case, this simply means you use the tasks and targets that were installed with your version of Visual Studio.\r\n\r\nBecause of this, you may have many versions of the .NET Core SDK on your machine and Visual Studio still fail to find one it considers appropriate. This is compounded by a poor error message, which we cannot fully correct because it is from the old version of the .NET Core SDK on your machine. Confusion is also compounded by a complex non-linear release matrix that makes it difficult to predict the right .NET Core SDK to select. We are working to improve all this. \r\n\r\n## The Visual Studio / .NET Core SDK support matrix\r\n\r\nThe last two digits of the .NET Core SDK version number are a patch number, which are represented by a `nn` in this table. You can learn more about .NET Core SDK and .NET Core Runtime versioning at the [Overview of how .NET Core is versioned page](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/core/versions/).\r\n\r\nThe following table shows which Visual Studio versions and .NET Core SDKs are compatible and how they are acquired if you are working with Visual Studio. \r\n\r\n| .NET Core SDK | .NET Core Runtime | Compatible Visual Studio | MSBuild | Notes                                     |\r\n|---------------|-------------------|--------------------------|---------|-------------------------------------------|\r\n| 2.1.5nn       | 2.1               | 2017                     | 15      | Installed as part of VS 2017 version 15.9 |\r\n| 2.1.6nn       | 2.1               | 2019                     | 16      | Installed as part of VS 2019              |\r\n| 2.2.1nn       | 2.2               | 2017                     | 15      | Installed manually                        |\r\n| 2.2.2nn       | 2.2               | 2019                     | 16      | Installed as part of VS 2019              |\r\n| 3.0.1nn       | 3.0 (Preview)     | 2019                     | 16      | Installed manually                        |\r\n\r\nVisual Studio 2017 cannot work with .NET Core SDK 2.1.6nn or 2.2.2nn.\r\n\r\nTo find out more about removing older versions of the .NET Core Runtime and .NET Core SDK, visit the [How to remove the .NET Core Runtime and SDK page](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/core/versions/remove-runtime-sdk-versions?tabs=macos).\r\n\r\nTo download the .NET Core SDK, visit the [.NET downloads page](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/download/dotnet-core).","Url":"https://github.com/dotnet/announcements/issues/108","RelatedDescription":"Open issue \".NET Core SDK 2.2.2nn and 2.1.6nn do not work with Visual Studio 2017\" (#108)"},{"Id":"432081093","IsPullRequest":false,"CreatedAt":"2019-04-11T15:16:43","Actor":"KathleenDollard","Number":"107","RawContent":null,"Title":"Limit DotNetCliToolReference Tools to .NET Core 2.2 and Below","State":"open","Body":"# Limit DotNetCliToolReference Tools to .NET Core 2.2 and Below\r\n\r\n.NET Core 3 takes the next step in the .NET Core tool strategy with local tools.

This issue would occur much more frequently if targeting .NET Core 3.0 was allowed. Restricting tools to target only .NET Core 2.2 and below means existing scenarios to continue to work (as well as they previously did), regardless of the framework version targeted by the project or the current .NET Core SDK. \r\n\r\nThe new .NET Core tool strategy avoids this flaw in restore strategy and offers other benefits, like the ability to author one type of tool and install it in different ways depending on project and user needs.\r\n\r\nWe look forward to your feedback on .NET Core Local Tools, and on challenges you face moving away from DotNetCliToolReference tools. \r\n\r\n[dotnet/sdk #3057](https://github.com/dotnet/sdk/pull/3057)","Url":"https://github.com/dotnet/announcements/issues/107","RelatedDescription":"Open issue \"Limit DotNetCliToolReference Tools to .NET Core 2.2 and Below\" (#107)"},{"Id":"431012407","IsPullRequest":false,"CreatedAt":"2019-04-09T14:51:18","Actor":"MichaelSimons","Number":"106","RawContent":null,"Title":".NET Core SDK container images now contain the Visual Studio 2019 toolset","State":"open","Body":"# .NET Core SDK container images now contain the Visual Studio 2019 toolset\r\n\r\n.NET Core SDK container images now include Visual Studio 2019 tools.

There are two primary reasons for this change:\r\n\r\n* Syndicate Microsoft-provided container images to multiple registries, like Docker Hub and Red Hat.\r\n* Use Microsoft Azure as a global CDN for delivering Microsoft-provided container images.\r\n\r\nYou will use and see MCR as a storage back-end for Microsoft images. The primary way you learn about Microsoft container images and tags will be through a registry, which for most users will continue to be Docker Hub. Most of the experience you've had browsing for .NET Core container images will continue unchanged with this new model. The Docker Hub URLs you've used for Microsoft repos will continue to work, and forward to updated locations on Docker Hub. Existing Docker Hub will images will be maintained as-is.\r\n\r\nSee [.NET Core Container Images now Published to Microsoft Container Registry](https://devblogs.microsoft.com/dotnet/net-core-container-images-now-published-to-microsoft-container-registry/) for the most updated information on our use of MCR.\r\n\r\n## Discussion\r\nPlease share your thoughts on this change and see what others are saying at:\r\n\r\n* [dotnet-docker #935](https://github.com/dotnet/dotnet-docker/issues/935)\r\n\r\n## Starting with .NET Core nightly repo\r\n\r\nOn the .NET team, we started our [transition to MCR](https://github.com/dotnet/dotnet-docker/issues/745) with the .NET Core \"nightly\" repo. [dotnet-nightly](dockerhub.com/r/microsoft/dotnet-nightly) is now hosted on MCR and syndicated to Docker Hub. We started with the nightly repo in order to discover and fix any challenges we found with this new model before we move our higher-traffic primary container repository.\r\n\r\nWe will start publishing [dotnet](dockerhub.com/r/microsoft/dotnet) to MCR a bit later, in either February or March. This issue will be updated when that happens.\r\n\r\n## Repo Split\r\n\r\nThe [.NET Core repo](https://hub.docker.com/r/microsoft/dotnet) currently includes 4 major categories of tags: \r\n\r\n* `sdk`\r\n* `aspnetcore-runtime`\r\n* `runtime` \r\n* `runtime-deps`\r\n\r\nProviding all of the tags in one place has helped with discoverability but made for a repo with an enormous README that can be challenging to navigate and consume. It is large enough that we exceeded Docker Hub README limits and had to artificially make it smaller.\r\n\r\nGoing forward, we will provide a repo for each of the tag categories listed above. We'll also provide a \"product repo\" that will hierarchicaly group all of our repos together. This will satisfy discoverability needs so that it will be easy to find the tags you want.\r\n\r\nYou can already see this experience with [microsoft-dotnet-core-nightly](https://hub.docker.com/_/microsoft-dotnet-core-nightly). There are now multiple repos for our nightly builds:\r\n\r\n* [.NET Core Nightly product repo](https://hub.docker.com/_/microsoft-dotnet-core-nightly)\r\n* [.NET Core SDK Nightly repo](https://hub.docker.com/_/microsoft-dotnet-core-nightly-sdk/)\r\n* [.NET Core ASP.NET Core Nightly repo](https://hub.docker.com/_/microsoft-dotnet-core-nightly-aspnet/)\r\n* [.NET Core Runtime Nightly repo](https://hub.docker.com/_/microsoft-dotnet-core-nightly-runtime/)\r\n* [.NET Core Runtime-deps Nightly repo](https://hub.docker.com/_/microsoft-dotnet-core-nightly-runtime-deps/)\r\n\r\nThe same split will exist for the non-nightly stable repo (currently hosted at  [microsoft/dotnet](https://hub.docker.com/r/microsoft/dotnet)) when we start publishing it to MCR and syndicating it back to DockerHub.\r\n\r\n## Changes to registry URL\r\n\r\nThe biggest change is that your Dockerfiles need to be updated to point to the MCR registry in order get access to new .NET Core container tags. The same change is required for scripts or human operations that pull images via `docker pull`.\r\n\r\nThe following example shows the registry path, repo and tag for the .NET Core 2.2 \"Nightly\" SDK on MCR:\r\n\r\n```console\r\nmcr.microsoft.com/dotnet/core-nightly/sdk:2.2\r\n```\r\n\r\nAs comparison, the following repo and tag have been used to date for the .NET Core 2.2 \"Nightly\" SDK on Docker Hub:\r\n\r\n```console\r\nmicrosoft/dotnet-nightly:2.2-sdk\r\n```\r\n\r\nThe new repo URL is provided at each of the news repos. For example, the new .NET Core SDK \"nightly\" repo provides a box on the right where you can copy and paste the correct MCR-based repo syntax that you can use for `docker pull` or in `FROM` statements in your Dockerfiles.\r\n\r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/2608468/52811702-95c5eb80-304a-11e9-8de8-e6ea1f4b4d75.png)\r\n\r\n## Servicing existing Docker Hub tags\r\n\r\nWe will continue to service existing non-version-specific or floating tags on Docker Hub while the associated .NET Core version is supported. For example the `microsoft/dotnet:2.1-sdk` tag is a floating tag that will continue to be serviced for the lifetime of .NET Core 2.1. You can continue using floating tags without issue.\r\n\r\nIf you use non-floating tags, like `microsoft/dotnet:2.1.504-sdk-alpine`, then you will need to update your Dockerfile to use a new non-floating tag. No new non-floating tags will be published to `microsoft/dotnet` and `microsoft/dotnet-nightly` after we fully transition to MCR.\r\n\r\n.NET Core 3.0 Preview 3 and later will only be made available on MCR.\r\n\r\n## Microsoft is a Verified Publisher\r\n\r\nUntil now, Microsoft-provided container images were considered \"community images\". As part of this change, we are re-classifying Microsoft as a \"verified publisher\" on Docker Hub.

Congratulations, Alpine team! On the .NET team, we are committed to supporting new Alpine versions quickly, and also need to define a policy for older versions. This policy only applies for the container images that we publish.\r\n\r\n## Discussion\r\nPlease share your thoughts on this change and see what others are saying at:\r\n\r\n* [dotnet-docker #933](https://github.com/dotnet/dotnet-docker/issues/933)\r\n\r\n## Policy\r\n\r\nWe intend to establish the following policy for supporting Alpine with .NET Core container images:\r\n\r\n* Support new Alpine versions within 60 days of release (hopefully much less).\r\n* Support n-1 Alpine versions for 3 months after we support a new Alpine version.\r\n\r\nNote: The [.NET Core support policy](https://github.com/dotnet/core/blob/master/os-lifecycle-policy.md) may be broader. This policy is specific to the container images we produce.\r\n\r\n## Plans\r\n\r\nWe're in the process of [fixing issues required to support Alpine 3.9](https://github.com/dotnet/dotnet-docker/issues/921). We expect that these issues will be resolved in February and that we'll be able to provide support for Alpine 3.9 in March.\r\n\r\nWe will produce Alpine 3.9 images for .NET Core 2.1, 2.2 and 3.0. Assuming we publish 3.9 images in March, we'll stop producing and supporting Alpine 3.7 and 3.8 images after June (2019).\r\n\r\n## Using Alpine-based .NET Core images\r\n\r\nWe produce a variety of Alpine-based images. You can either depend on a specific Alpine version, like with `microsoft/dotnet:2.2-sdk-alpine3.8` or opt to use the latest Alpine image we have to offer, like with `microsoft/dotnet:2.2-sdk-alpine`. Either are good choices. It is just a question of whether you want to make a conscious decision to move to later Alpine releases.\r\n\r\n## Support for ARM32?\r\n\r\nWe produce Alpine images for x64 (and ARM64, shortly). The [Alpine 3.9 announcement](https://twitter.com/alpinelinux/status/1090416212822110214) made mention of support for ARM32v7. We would like to enable .NET Core [Alpine-based images on ARM32](https://github.com/gliderlabs/docker-alpine/issues/463#issuecomment-460530395). We are patiently waiting for that to happen.

To check the currently installed runtimes, open a command prompt and run the `dotnet --info` command. If you have a 2.1 or greater runtime installed, you'll see output like the following;\r\n\r\n```text\r\n.NET Core SDK (reflecting any global.json):\r\n Version:   2.2.100\r\n Commit:    b9f2fa0ca8\r\n\r\nRuntime Environment:\r\n OS Name:     Windows\r\n OS Version:  10.0.17134\r\n OS Platform: Windows\r\n RID:         win10-x64\r\n Base Path:   C:\\Program Files\\dotnet\\sdk\\2.2.100\\\r\n\r\nHost (useful for support):\r\n  Version: 2.2.0\r\n  Commit:  1249f08fed\r\n\r\n.NET Core SDKs installed:\r\n  2.1.5 [C:\\Program Files\\dotnet\\sdk]\r\n  2.1.502 [C:\\Program Files\\dotnet\\sdk]\r\n  2.2.100 [C:\\Program Files\\dotnet\\sdk]\r\n\r\n.NET Core runtimes installed:\r\n  Microsoft.AspNetCore.All 2.1.6 [C:\\Program Files\\dotnet\\shared\\Microsoft.AspNetCore.All]\r\n  Microsoft.AspNetCore.App 2.1.6 [C:\\Program Files\\dotnet\\shared\\Microsoft.AspNetCore.App]\r\n  Microsoft.AspNetCore.All 2.2.0 [C:\\Program Files\\dotnet\\shared\\Microsoft.AspNetCore.All]\r\n  Microsoft.AspNetCore.App 2.2.0 [C:\\Program Files\\dotnet\\shared\\Microsoft.AspNetCore.App]\r\n  Microsoft.NETCore.App 2.1.6 [C:\\Program Files\\dotnet\\shared\\Microsoft.NETCore.App]\r\n  Microsoft.NETCore.App 2.2.0 [C:\\Program Files\\dotnet\\shared\\Microsoft.NETCore.App]\r\n\r\nTo install additional .NET Core runtimes or SDKs:\r\n  https://aka.ms/dotnet-download\r\n```\r\n\r\nIf your host version is 2.1.x and the highest `Microsoft.NETCore.App` runtime version is less than 2.1.7, you're vulnerable to this issue.\r\nIf your host version is 2.2.x and the highest 2.1.x `Microsoft.NETCore.App` runtime version is less than 2.2.1, you're vulnerable to this issue.\r\n\r\nYou will not see SDK versions if you have only installed the runtime.\r\n\r\n#### Applications not using Microsoft.NetCore.App\r\n\r\nThe affected assembly is also available separately as a NuGet package. If you are not using Microsoft.NetCore.App, you may still be affected if you are referencing the packages listed above.\r\n\r\n##### Direct dependencies\r\n\r\nDirect dependencies are discoverable by examining your `csproj` file. They can be fixed by [editing the project file](#fixing-direct-dependencies) or using NuGet to update the dependency.\r\n\r\n##### Transitive dependencies\r\n\r\nTransitive dependencies occur when you add a package to your project that in turn relies on another package. For example, if Contoso publishes a package `Contoso.Utility` which, in turn, depends on `Contoso.Internals` and you add the `Contoso.Utility` package to your project now your project has a direct dependency on `Contoso.Utility` and, because `Contoso.Utility` depends 'Contoso.Internals', your application gains a transitive dependency on the `Contoso.Internals` package.\r\n\r\nTransitive dependencies are reviewable in two ways:\r\n\r\n* In the Visual Studio Solution Explorer window, which supports searching.\r\n* By examining the `project.assets.json` file contained in the obj directory of your project for `csproj` based projects\r\n\r\nThe `project.assets.json` files are the authoritative list of all packages used by your project, containing both direct and transitive dependencies.\r\n\r\nThere are two ways to view transitive dependencies. You can either [use Visual Studio’s Solution Explorer](#vs-solution-explorer), or you can review [the `project.assets.json` file](#project-assets-json)).\r\n\r\n##### <a name=\"vs-solution-explorer\"></a>Using Visual Studio Solution Explorer\r\n\r\nTo use Solution Explorer, open the project in Visual Studio, and then press Ctrl+; to activate the search in Solution Explorer. Search for the [vulnerable package](#affected-software) and make a note of the version numbers of any results you find.\r\n\r\nFor example, searching for `Microsoft.AspNetCore.Mvc.Core` in an example project that contains a package that takes a dependency on `Microsoft.AspNetCore.Mvc` shows the following results in Visual Studio 2017:\r\n\r\n![Screenshot of search results in Visual Studio 2017](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/796298/25858816/8ecdc2b4-3491-11e7-9363-746804bb9832.png)\r\n\r\nThe search results appear as a tree. In the previous results, you can see that a reference to `Microsoft.AspNetCore.Mvc.Core` version 1.1.2 is discovered.\r\n\r\nUnder the Dependencies node is a NuGet node. Under the NuGet node is the list of packages you have directly taken a dependency on and their versions.\r\nIn screenshot, the application takes a direct dependency on `Microsoft.AspNetCore.Mvc`. `Microsoft.AspNetCore.Mvc` in turn has leaf nodes that list its dependencies and their versions.\r\nThe `Microsoft.AspNetCore.Mvc` package takes a dependency on a version of `Microsoft.AspNetCore.Mvc.ApiExplorer`, that in turn takes a dependency on a version of `Microsoft.AspNetCore.Mvc.Core`.\r\n\r\n##### <a name=\"project-assets-json\"></a> Manually reviewing project.assets.json\r\n\r\nOpen the *project.assets.json* file from your project’s obj directory in your editor. We suggest you use an editor that understands JSON and allows you to collapse and expand nodes to review this file.\r\nVisual Studio and Visual Studio Code provide JSON friendly editing.\r\n\r\nSearch the *project.assets.json* file for the [vulnerable package](#affected-software), using the format `packagename/` for each of the package names from the preceding table. If you find the assembly name in your search:\r\n\r\n* Examine the line on which they are found, the version number is after the `/`.\r\n* Compare to the [vulnerable versions table](#affected-software).\r\n\r\nFor example, a search result that shows `System.Private.Uri/4.3.0` is a reference to version 4.3.0 of `System.Private.Uri`.\r\n\r\nIf your *project.assets.json* file includes references to the [vulnerable package](#affected-software), then you need to fix the transitive dependencies.\r\n\r\nIf you have not found any reference to any vulnerable packages, this means either\r\n\r\n* None of your direct dependencies depend on any vulnerable packages, or\r\n* You have already fixed the problem by updating the direct dependencies.\r\n\r\n### <a name=\"how-fix\"></a>How do I fix the issue?\r\n\r\n#### Updating the version of Microsoft.NETCore.App\r\n\r\nIf your host version is a 2.1.x host you must install version 2.1.8 or later of the [.NET Core 2.1 runtime](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/download/dotnet-core/2.1), or corresponding [.NET Core 2.1 SDK](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/download/dotnet-core/2.1).\r\n\r\nIf your host version is a 2.2.x you must install version 2.2.2 or later of the [.NET Core 2.2 runtime](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/download/dotnet-core/2.2), or corresponding  [.NET Core 2.2 SDK](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/download/dotnet-core/2.2).\r\n\r\n#### <a name=\"fixing-direct-dependencies\"></a>Fixing direct dependencies\r\n\r\nOpen *projectname.csproj* in your editor. If you're using Visual Studio, right-click the project and choose **Edit projectname.csproj** from the context menu, where projectname is the name of your project. Look for `PackageReference` elements. The following shows an example project file:\r\n\r\n```xml\r\n<Project Sdk=\"Microsoft.NET.Sdk.Web\">\r\n  <PropertyGroup>\r\n    <TargetFramework>netcoreapp2.1</TargetFramework>\r\n  </PropertyGroup>\r\n  <ItemGroup>\r\n    <PackageReference Include=\"System.Private.Uri\" Version=\"4.3.0\" />\r\n  </ItemGroup>\r\n</Project>\r\n```\r\n\r\nThe preceding example has a reference to the [vulnerable package](#affected-software), as seen by the single `PackageReference` element. The name of the package is in the `Include` attribute.\r\nThe package version number is in the `Version` attribute. The previous example shows a single direct dependency on `System.Private.Uri` version 4.3.0\r\n\r\nTo update the version to the secure package, change the version number to the updated package version as listed on the table [previously](#affected-software).\r\nIn this example, update `System.Private.Uri` to the appropriate [fixed package number](#affected-software) for your major version. Save the *csproj* file. The example *csproj* now looks as follows:\r\n\r\n```xml\r\n<Project Sdk=\"Microsoft.NET.Sdk.Web\">\r\n  <PropertyGroup>\r\n    <TargetFramework>netcoreapp2.1</TargetFramework>\r\n  </PropertyGroup>\r\n  <ItemGroup>\r\n    <PackageReference Include=\"System.Private.Uri\" Version=\"4.3.0\" />\r\n  </ItemGroup>\r\n</Project>\r\n```\r\n\r\nIf you're using Visual Studio and you save your updated *csproj* file, Visual Studio will restore the new package version.\r\nYou can see the restore results by opening the **Output** window (Ctrl+Alt+O) and changing the **Show output from** drop-down list to **Package Manager**.\r\n\r\nIf you're not using Visual Studio, open a command line and change to your project directory. Execute the `dotnet restore` command to restore the updated dependencies.\r\n\r\nNow recompile your application. If after recompilation you see a *Dependency conflict warning*, you must update your other direct dependencies to versions that take a dependency on the updated package.\r\n\r\n#### <a name=\"transitive-dependencies\"></a>Fixing transitive dependencies\r\n\r\nIf your transitive dependency review found references to the [vulnerable package](#affected-software), you must add a direct dependency to the updated package to your *csproj* file to override the transitive dependency.\r\n\r\nOpen *projectname.csproj* in your editor. If you're using Visual Studio, right-click the project and choose **Edit projectname.csproj** from the context menu, where projectname is the name of your project.\r\nLook for `PackageReference` nodes, for example:\r\n\r\n```xml\r\n<Project Sdk=\"Microsoft.NET.Sdk.\">\r\n  <PropertyGroup>\r\n    <TargetFramework>net461</TargetFramework>\r\n  </PropertyGroup>\r\n  <ItemGroup>\r\n    <PackageReference Include=\"ThirdParty.NotUpdatedYet\" Version=\"2.0.0\" />\r\n  </ItemGroup>\r\n</Project>\r\n```\r\n\r\nYou must add a direct dependency to the updated version of the [vulnerable package](#affected-software) by adding it to the *csproj* file.\r\nYou do this by adding a new line to the dependencies section, referencing the fixed version.\r\nFor example, if your search showed a transitive reference to a vulnerable `System.ServiceModel.Http` version, you'd add a reference to the [fixed package number](#affected-software).\r\n\r\n```xml\r\n<Project Sdk=\"Microsoft.NET.Sdk.Web\">\r\n  <PropertyGroup>\r\n    <TargetFramework>net461</TargetFramework>\r\n  </PropertyGroup>\r\n  <ItemGroup>\r\n    <PackageReference Include=\"System.Private.Uri\" Version=\"4.3.0\" />\r\n    <PackageReference Include=\"ThirdParty.NotUpdatedYet\" Version=\"2.0.0\" />\r\n  </ItemGroup>\r\n</Project>\r\n```\r\n\r\nAfter you've added the direct dependency reference, save your *csproj* file.\r\n\r\nIf you're using Visual Studio, save your updated *csproj* file and Visual Studio will restore the new package versions.\r\nYou can see the restore results by opening the **Output** window (Ctrl+Alt+O) and changing the **Show output from** drop-down list to **Package Manager**.\r\n\r\nIf you're not using Visual Studio, open a command line and change to your project directory. Execute the `dotnet restore` command to restore the new dependencies.\r\n\r\n##### Rebuilding your application\r\n\r\nFinally, you must rebuild your application, test, and redeploy.\r\n\r\n## Other Information\r\n\r\n### Reporting Security Issues\r\n\r\nIf you have found a potential security issue in .NET Core, please email details to secure@microsoft.com.

To check the currently installed runtimes, open a command prompt and run the `dotnet --info` command. If you have a 2.1 or greater runtime installed, you'll see output like the following;\r\n\r\n```text\r\n.NET Core SDK (reflecting any global.json):\r\n Version:   2.2.100\r\n Commit:    b9f2fa0ca8\r\n\r\nRuntime Environment:\r\n OS Name:     Windows\r\n OS Version:  10.0.17134\r\n OS Platform: Windows\r\n RID:         win10-x64\r\n Base Path:   C:\\Program Files\\dotnet\\sdk\\2.2.100\\\r\n\r\nHost (useful for support):\r\n  Version: 2.2.0\r\n  Commit:  1249f08fed\r\n\r\n.NET Core SDKs installed:\r\n  2.1.5 [C:\\Program Files\\dotnet\\sdk]\r\n  2.1.502 [C:\\Program Files\\dotnet\\sdk]\r\n  2.2.100 [C:\\Program Files\\dotnet\\sdk]\r\n\r\n.NET Core runtimes installed:\r\n  Microsoft.AspNetCore.All 2.1.6 [C:\\Program Files\\dotnet\\shared\\Microsoft.AspNetCore.All]\r\n  Microsoft.AspNetCore.App 2.1.6 [C:\\Program Files\\dotnet\\shared\\Microsoft.AspNetCore.App]\r\n  Microsoft.AspNetCore.All 2.2.0 [C:\\Program Files\\dotnet\\shared\\Microsoft.AspNetCore.All]\r\n  Microsoft.AspNetCore.App 2.2.0 [C:\\Program Files\\dotnet\\shared\\Microsoft.AspNetCore.App]\r\n  Microsoft.NETCore.App 2.1.6 [C:\\Program Files\\dotnet\\shared\\Microsoft.NETCore.App]\r\n  Microsoft.NETCore.App 2.2.0 [C:\\Program Files\\dotnet\\shared\\Microsoft.NETCore.App]\r\n\r\nTo install additional .NET Core runtimes or SDKs:\r\n  https://aka.ms/dotnet-download\r\n```\r\n\r\nIf your host version is 2.1.x and the highest `Microsoft.NETCore.App` runtime version is less than 2.1.7, you're vulnerable to this issue.\r\nIf your host version is 2.2.x and the highest 2.1.x `Microsoft.NETCore.App` runtime version is less than 2.1.7, you're vulnerable to this issue.\r\n\r\nYou will not see SDK versions if you have only installed the runtime.\r\n\r\n#### Applications not using Microsoft.NetCore.App\r\n\r\nThe affected assembly is also available separately as a NuGet package. If you are not using Microsoft.NetCore.App, you may still be affected if you are referencing the packages listed above.\r\n\r\n##### Direct dependencies\r\n\r\nDirect dependencies are discoverable by examining your `csproj` file. They can be fixed by [editing the project file](#fixing-direct-dependencies) or using NuGet to update the dependency.\r\n\r\n##### Transitive dependencies\r\n\r\nTransitive dependencies occur when you add a package to your project that in turn relies on another package. For example, if Contoso publishes a package `Contoso.Utility` which, in turn, depends on `Contoso.Internals` and you add the `Contoso.Utility` package to your project now your project has a direct dependency on `Contoso.Utility` and, because `Contoso.Utility` depends 'Contoso.Internals', your application gains a transitive dependency on the `Contoso.Internals` package.\r\n\r\nTransitive dependencies are reviewable in two ways:\r\n\r\n* In the Visual Studio Solution Explorer window, which supports searching.\r\n* By examining the `project.assets.json` file contained in the obj directory of your project for `csproj` based projects\r\n\r\nThe `project.assets.json` files are the authoritative list of all packages used by your project, containing both direct and transitive dependencies.\r\n\r\nThere are two ways to view transitive dependencies. You can either [use Visual Studio’s Solution Explorer](#vs-solution-explorer), or you can review [the `project.assets.json` file](#project-assets-json)).\r\n\r\n##### <a name=\"vs-solution-explorer\"></a>Using Visual Studio Solution Explorer\r\n\r\nTo use Solution Explorer, open the project in Visual Studio, and then press Ctrl+; to activate the search in Solution Explorer. Search for the [vulnerable package](#affected-software) and make a note of the version numbers of any results you find.\r\n\r\nFor example, searching for `Microsoft.AspNetCore.Mvc.Core` in an example project that contains a package that takes a dependency on `Microsoft.AspNetCore.Mvc` shows the following results in Visual Studio 2017:\r\n\r\n![Screenshot of search results in Visual Studio 2017](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/796298/25858816/8ecdc2b4-3491-11e7-9363-746804bb9832.png)\r\n\r\nThe search results appear as a tree. In the previous results, you can see that a reference to `Microsoft.AspNetCore.Mvc.Core` version 1.1.2 is discovered.\r\n\r\nUnder the Dependencies node is a NuGet node. Under the NuGet node is the list of packages you have directly taken a dependency on and their versions.\r\nIn screenshot, the application takes a direct dependency on `Microsoft.AspNetCore.Mvc`. `Microsoft.AspNetCore.Mvc` in turn has leaf nodes that list its dependencies and their versions.\r\nThe `Microsoft.AspNetCore.Mvc` package takes a dependency on a version of `Microsoft.AspNetCore.Mvc.ApiExplorer`, that in turn takes a dependency on a version of `Microsoft.AspNetCore.Mvc.Core`.\r\n\r\n##### <a name=\"project-assets-json\"></a> Manually reviewing project.assets.json\r\n\r\nOpen the *project.assets.json* file from your project’s obj directory in your editor. We suggest you use an editor that understands JSON and allows you to collapse and expand nodes to review this file.\r\nVisual Studio and Visual Studio Code provide JSON friendly editing.\r\n\r\nSearch the *project.assets.json* file for the [vulnerable package](#affected-software), using the format `packagename/` for each of the package names from the preceding table. If you find the assembly name in your search:\r\n\r\n* Examine the line on which they are found, the version number is after the `/`.\r\n* Compare to the [vulnerable versions table](#affected-software).\r\n\r\nFor example, a search result that shows `SSystem.Net.Http/4.3.0` is a reference to version 4.3.0 of `System.Net.Http`.\r\n\r\nIf your *project.assets.json* file includes references to the [vulnerable package](#affected-software), then you need to fix the transitive dependencies.\r\n\r\nIf you have not found any reference to any vulnerable packages, this means either\r\n\r\n* None of your direct dependencies depend on any vulnerable packages, or\r\n* You have already fixed the problem by updating the direct dependencies.\r\n\r\n### <a name=\"how-fix\"></a>How do I fix the issue?\r\n\r\n#### Updating the version of Microsoft.NETCore.App\r\n\r\nIf your host version is a 2.1.x host you must install version 2.1.7 or later of the [.NET Core 2.1 runtime](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/download/dotnet-core/2.1), or corresponding [.NET Core 2.1 SDK](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/download/dotnet-core/2.1).\r\n\r\nIf your host version is a 2.2.x you must install version 2.2.1 or later of the [.NET Core 2.2 runtime](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/download/dotnet-core/2.2), or corresponding  [.NET Core 2.2 SDK](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/download/dotnet-core/2.2).\r\n\r\n#### <a name=\"fixing-direct-dependencies\"></a>Fixing direct dependencies\r\n\r\nOpen *projectname.csproj* in your editor. If you're using Visual Studio, right-click the project and choose **Edit projectname.csproj** from the context menu, where projectname is the name of your project. Look for `PackageReference` elements. The following shows an example project file:\r\n\r\n```xml\r\n<Project Sdk=\"Microsoft.NET.Sdk.Web\">\r\n  <PropertyGroup>\r\n    <TargetFramework>netcoreapp2.1</TargetFramework>\r\n  </PropertyGroup>\r\n  <ItemGroup>\r\n    <PackageReference Include=\"System.Net.Http\" Version=\"4.3.0\" />\r\n  </ItemGroup>\r\n</Project>\r\n```\r\n\r\nThe preceding example has a reference to the [vulnerable package](#affected-software), as seen by the single `PackageReference` element. The name of the package is in the `Include` attribute.\r\nThe package version number is in the `Version` attribute. The previous example shows a single direct dependency on `System.Net.Http` version 4.3.0\r\n\r\nTo update the version to the secure package, change the version number to the updated package version as listed on the table [previously](#affected-software).\r\nIn this example, update `System.IO.Pipelines` to the appropriate [fixed package number](#affected-software) for your major version. Save the *csproj* file. The example *csproj* now looks as follows:\r\n\r\n```xml\r\n<Project Sdk=\"Microsoft.NET.Sdk.Web\">\r\n  <PropertyGroup>\r\n    <TargetFramework>netcoreapp2.1</TargetFramework>\r\n  </PropertyGroup>\r\n  <ItemGroup>\r\n    <PackageReference Include=\"System.Net.Http\" Version=\"4.3.5\" />\r\n  </ItemGroup>\r\n</Project>\r\n```\r\n\r\nIf you're using Visual Studio and you save your updated *csproj* file, Visual Studio will restore the new package version.\r\nYou can see the restore results by opening the **Output** window (Ctrl+Alt+O) and changing the **Show output from** drop-down list to **Package Manager**.\r\n\r\nIf you're not using Visual Studio, open a command line and change to your project directory. Execute the `dotnet restore` command to restore the updated dependencies.\r\n\r\nNow recompile your application. If after recompilation you see a *Dependency conflict warning*, you must update your other direct dependencies to versions that take a dependency on the updated package.\r\n\r\n#### <a name=\"transitive-dependencies\"></a>Fixing transitive dependencies\r\n\r\nIf your transitive dependency review found references to the [vulnerable package](#affected-software), you must add a direct dependency to the updated package to your *csproj* file to override the transitive dependency.\r\n\r\nOpen *projectname.csproj* in your editor. If you're using Visual Studio, right-click the project and choose **Edit projectname.csproj** from the context menu, where projectname is the name of your project.\r\nLook for `PackageReference` nodes, for example:\r\n\r\n```xml\r\n<Project Sdk=\"Microsoft.NET.Sdk.\">\r\n  <PropertyGroup>\r\n    <TargetFramework>net461</TargetFramework>\r\n  </PropertyGroup>\r\n  <ItemGroup>\r\n    <PackageReference Include=\"ThirdParty.NotUpdatedYet\" Version=\"2.0.0\" />\r\n  </ItemGroup>\r\n</Project>\r\n```\r\n\r\nYou must add a direct dependency to the updated version of the [vulnerable package](#affected-software) by adding it to the *csproj* file.\r\nYou do this by adding a new line to the dependencies section, referencing the fixed version.\r\nFor example, if your search showed a transitive reference to a vulnerable `System.ServiceModel.Http` version, you'd add a reference to the [fixed package number](#affected-software).\r\n\r\n```xml\r\n<Project Sdk=\"Microsoft.NET.Sdk.Web\">\r\n  <PropertyGroup>\r\n    <TargetFramework>net461</TargetFramework>\r\n  </PropertyGroup>\r\n  <ItemGroup>\r\n    <PackageReference Include=\"System.Net.Http\" Version=\"4.3.5\" />\r\n    <PackageReference Include=\"ThirdParty.NotUpdatedYet\" Version=\"2.0.0\" />\r\n  </ItemGroup>\r\n</Project>\r\n```\r\n\r\nAfter you've added the direct dependency reference, save your *csproj* file.\r\n\r\nIf you're using Visual Studio, save your updated *csproj* file and Visual Studio will restore the new package versions.\r\nYou can see the restore results by opening the **Output** window (Ctrl+Alt+O) and changing the **Show output from** drop-down list to **Package Manager**.\r\n\r\nIf you're not using Visual Studio, open a command line and change to your project directory. Execute the `dotnet restore` command to restore the new dependencies.\r\n\r\n##### Rebuilding your application\r\n\r\nFinally, you must rebuild your application, test, and redeploy.\r\n\r\n## Other Information\r\n\r\n### Reporting Security Issues\r\n\r\nIf you have found a potential security issue in .NET Core, please email details to secure@microsoft.com.
