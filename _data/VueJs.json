But in production mode, the result css after processed by `less` is **wrong**, because:\r\n\r\n1. The `/deep/` syntax will be [considered a combinator](https://github.com/less/less.js/blob/master/lib/less/parser/parser.js#L1242-L1253)\r\n\r\n\r\n2. And then when [process a combinator](https://github.com/less/less.js/blob/master/lib/less/tree/combinator.js#L19-L22), when the `compress` flag(**in production it's `true` by default but in development is `false`**) is `true`, the result will be `''   combinator   ''`(i.e. `/deep/`), but it should be `' '  + combinator +  ' '`(i.e. \" /deep/ \"). I.e. there needs a space before and after the combinator. But in production mode it's not, so all deep selectors won't work in production mode. \r\n\r\nIMO, maybe `less.js` is right because combinators usually are '>', '+', '~', '^'...  **These combinators still work even there is no space before and after them.** On the other hand, `/deep/` is a 'feature' used by Vue rather than **pure CSS**, so `less.js` doesn't consider this is passable.\r\n\r\n### What is expected?\r\n`div { /deep/ a { color: red; } }` -> `div a {color: red;}`\r\n\r\n### What is actually happening?\r\n`div { /deep/ a { color: red; } }` -> `div/deep/a {color: red;}`\r\n\r\n### Versions\r\nless: 3.8.1\r\nvue-loader: 15.4.1\r\n\r\n<!-- generated by vue-issues.

If that is the case for SSR as well, I would expect the order to be `app.css -> home.css -> about.css` since the `App.vue` file is loaded statically, and `Home.vue` and `About.vue` are loaded dynamically via routes in that order.\r\n\r\nEither way, I would expect global styles from `App.vue` to always be loaded first, followed by dynamic-route styles, allowing for a proper cascade. \r\n\r\n### What is actually happening?\r\nI think there are two issues at play:\r\n\r\n**Primary Issue**: In development mode, the `app.css` file is incorrectly loaded _after_ the `about.css` file, breaking the cascade for contents of `About.vue`.\r\n\r\n**Secondary Issue**: In production mode, the `app.css` file is properly loaded first, but then `about.css` is loaded prior to `home.css` even though they are imported in the reverse order and even when SSR-ing the home page.\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n### Additional Notes\r\n\r\nI'm trying to determine what feels like the optimal solution, and I think there are a few options, in a loose descending order of \"optimal\", and likely increasing order of feasibility:\r\n\r\n1. Global styles from the root `App.vue` component would always be loaded first, followed by the only the styles for the component matched for the current route.  Additional route-specific styles would be loaded on demand when routing.  I understand this is likely beyond the scope of the bundle renderer and potentially something to be implemented by the application itself.\r\n2. Global styles from the root `App.vue` component would always be loaded first, followed by styles for the current route-component, followed by styles for additional route-components.\r\n3. Global styles from the root `App.vue` component would always be loaded first, followed by styles for route-level components, in import-order (i.e., in route-declaration order)\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIt is also worth noting that my specific scenario in my larger app is slightly different, but I wasn't able to quite reproduce it exactly in this minimal repo, and I'm not quite sure why.  In my specific app case, I have an `App.vue` and 3 dynamic routes defined in the order:\r\n\r\n* Home\r\n* Page 1\r\n* Page 2\r\n\r\nIn development mode, my stylesheets are included in the order:   page1, app, home, page2.\r\n\r\nIn production mode, my stylesheets are included in the order:   home, page1, page2, app\r\n\r\nSo in the demo repo, the production build is correct insofar as it doesn't break the cascade for either route, and the development build is incorrect for only one of the routes.  \r\n\r\nIn my actual app, the development mode only breaks the cascade for the page1 route, while the production build breaks it for all routes.\r\n\r\n<!-- generated by vue-issues.

I am using angular for another website, with nested routes and parameters, and it has no problem reloading the page correctly.\r\n\r\nI have read on another forum, from a Vue developer, that it is just not possible to achieve a reload with nested routes or params properly.\r\n\r\nCould any one let me know if it can be achieved (keep in mind the website is hosted on a bucket on AWS, so no server trick can be involved). If it can be, how would I do that ?\r\n\r\nThank you in advance.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n","Url":"https://github.com/vuejs/vue-router/issues/2398","RelatedDescription":"Closed issue \"Refresh Page not reloading website\" (#2398)"},{"Id":"361509724","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2018-09-18T22:36:40","Actor":"jnields","Number":"2397","RawContent":null,"Title":"Add access to history state","State":"open","Body":"<!--\r\nPlease make sure to read the Pull Request Guidelines:\r\nhttps://github.com/vuejs/vue/blob/dev/.github/CONTRIBUTING.md#pull-request-guidelines\r\n-->\r\n\r\nThis allows developers access to history.state, which you can use for associating extra data to the URL without updating the visible URL, in history mode.

Number should be blank and the type undefined.\r\n\r\nClick the button to switch pages but set the number to 10.

The number will be set and display correctly, but the type will be string. You can confirm this in the Vue devtools.\r\n\r\n### What is expected?\r\nOn a fresh load or reload, the type of the \"number\" param should be the same as it was when it was set by Vue. The type should be number.\r\n\r\n### What is actually happening?\r\nOn reload, the type changes to string.\r\n\r\n---\r\nFrankly I don't care which type vue router gives to me. I would prefer the parsing happens automatically, so I get a number, but if I know I'll get a string, I can always call parseInt myself. The important thing is that there is no difference in types between loading from another page vs loading for the first time from a URL. With many more query params of different types it is a pain (and code bloat) to handle the case where any of them can come in as a string or as the expected type.\r\n\r\n<!-- generated by vue-issues.

It provides a few code snippets and assumes you'll understand. The documentation has been the biggest source of my frustration while using Vue since it never actually explains anything.\r\n\r\nFor example, on the Vuex installation page, sandwiched between CDN/package manager installation and building from source, you've put that Vuex needs to be instantiated in a module set up. You've provided zero context for this. Is this in the store? Is this for every file you need to access the store in? More importantly, it shouldn't be on the installation page, let alone sandwiched in between different installation methods. Vue's documentation is riddled with these issues. Unfortunately, I still don't actually know enough about how Vue actually works to be able to contribute to the documentation in any way. If I didn't have to use Vue for the project I am on, I would be using React, Redux, & RxJs and have access to meaningful, better written documentation that bothers to walk you through the set up. If Vue actually wants to gain any real traction, you're going to need to actually show folks how to use and set up your tools.\r\n\r\n<!-- generated by vue-issues.
