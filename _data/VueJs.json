Its function declaration is `((vm: Vue) => any) | void) => void`, and should it be updated so we could access all members declared in class(or object)?\r\nI wrote three examples to explain my confusion.\r\n1. In .vue file with object literal style, i cant access my own properties.\r\n2. In .vue file with `vue-class-component`, **if i add an type identifier manually, it works. no error.** if not, error.\r\n3. In separate .ts file with `vue-class-component`, whether i add identifier or not, got error. **But if  i roll back to typescript 2.5.3, and add type identifier, it works.**\r\n\r\nI think the declaration should be updated(Generics? `T extends Vue` or ?), but i'm not sure about that. Sorry for my poor english If I dont describe the problem clearly.\r\n\r\n\r\n### What is expected?\r\nall class(object) members should be accessed in vm.\r\n\r\n### What is actually happening?\r\nWe could only access members of Vue.\r\n\r\n<!-- generated by vue-issues.
