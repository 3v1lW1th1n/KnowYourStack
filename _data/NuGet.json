The `NuGet.BuildTools` pacakge is intended to be installed with the Visual Studio Build Tools SKU (no UI, used on CI build machines), while the `NuGet.Core` package is intended to be installed with the Visual Studio IDE. The `NuGet.Core` VS package contains all the same dlls that the `NuGet.BuildTools` VS package contains, plus everything else needed for VS integration.\n\nA recent change to the VS installer now prevents multiple packages writing the same file, so will fail if both NuGet VS packages are selected to install. Note: A VS installer component is something that appears in the installer as something with a checkbox that can be selected or unselected. A component has a list of dependencies of packages or package groups. A VS package is what contains dlls to be installed. A package group is also a list of dependencies, like a component, but is not selectable. Dependencies can have when conditions, for example depend on one package for some skus, depend on a different package for different skus.\n\nTo fix this, we will create a `Microsoft.VisualStudio.PackageGroup.NuGet` package group that will select the correct package to install depending on which VS SKU is installed. Also modify the existing VS components (things selectable in the installer) to use the package group, rather than the packages directly. This allows customers to install either or both NuGet components without issue.\n\n## Note to Visual Studio extension authors\n\nIf you have a dependency on the `Microsoft.VisualStudio.NuGet.BuildTools` or `Microsoft.VisualStudio.NuGet.Core` **package**, you need to change your dependency to `Microsoft.VisualStudio.PackageGroup.NuGet`. However, if your dependency is on the component, it can stay as it is."},{"Id":"9589841587","Type":"IssuesEvent","CreatedAt":"2019-05-08T22:22:05","Actor":"nkolev92","Repository":"NuGet/Home","Organization":"NuGet","RawContent":null,"RelatedAction":"opened","RelatedUrl":"https://github.com/NuGet/Home/issues/8119","RelatedDescription":"Opened issue \"[Bug Bash][Accessibility][Test Failure] Hard to see the cursor in PMC after changing the color theme\" (#8119) at NuGet/Home","RelatedBody":"NuGet Version: NuGet Client 5.0.0.5371\r\n\r\nVS Version: D16.0stg 27930.3001\r\n\r\nOS Version: Windows 10 RS4_Release 17134.1.180410-1804\r\n\r\n2.

Using the latest version of [SignService](https://github.com/dotnet/SignService) and a valid code signing certificate (DigiCert is our root CA in this case), build and sign the following .NET Core global tool: https://github.com/petabridge/Incrementalist - `Incrementalist.Cmd` is the .NET Core global tool produced in this case.\r\n\r\n2. Once you have a SignService setup and have populated your credentials inside [appsettings.json](https://github.com/petabridge/Incrementalist/blob/dev/appsettings.json), run the following build command: `./build.cmd nuget SignClientUser={user} SignClientSecret={secret}`\r\n\r\n3. Run `nuget verify Incrementalist.Cmd.nupkg -All -verbosity detailed`\r\n\r\nYou'll receive the following error message:\r\n\r\n```\r\n'D:\\Downloads\\Incrementalist.Cmd.0.1.0 (1).nupkg' is not a valid package file.\r\nA local file header is corrupt.\r\nSystem.IO.InvalidDataException: A local file header is corrupt.\r\n   at System.IO.Compression.ZipArchiveEntry.ThrowIfNotOpenable(Boolean needToUncompress, Boolean needToLoadIntoMemory)\r\n   at System.IO.Compression.ZipArchiveEntry.OpenInReadMode(Boolean checkOpenable)\r\n   at NuGet.Packaging.PackageArchiveReader.GetStream(String path)\r\n   at NuGet.Packaging.PackageReaderBase.get_NuspecReader()\r\n   at NuGet.Packaging.PackageReaderBase.GetIdentity()\r\n   at NuGet.Commands.VerifyCommandRunner.<VerifySignatureForPackageAsync>d__4.MoveNext()\r\n--- End of stack trace from previous location where exception was thrown ---\r\n   at System.Runtime.ExceptionServices.ExceptionDispatchInfo.Throw()\r\n   at System.Runtime.CompilerServices.TaskAwaiter.HandleNonSuccessAndDebuggerNotification(Task task)\r\n   at NuGet.Commands.VerifyCommandRunner.<ExecuteCommandAsync>d__3.MoveNext()\r\n```\r\n\r\nIt's not clear why this happening - we have other .NET Core tools that we're able to sign no problem. One thing I do notice looking inside the guts of the project after we've signed it with SignService: there's no `.signature` file in the contents of the .nupkg afterwards, whereas there are in our other signed .NET Core global tools

issue \"nuget list & add commands are being deprecated in 5.0\" (#34) at NuGet/Announcements","RelatedBody":"Tracking Issue(s):\r\n* Deprecate ambiguous nuget.exe commands in 5.0 [#7753](https://github.com/NuGet/Home/issues/7753)\r\n  * Deprecate nuget.exe add command [#7923](https://github.com/NuGet/Home/issues/7923)\r\n  * Rename nuget.exe list to nuget.exe search [#7912](https://github.com/NuGet/Home/issues/7912)\r\n\r\nThe following commands are being deprecated because these are cause of confusion due to their nomenclature and/or other related commands that already exist:\r\n* [`nuget list`](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/nuget/tools/cli-ref-list): Currently displays a list of packages from a given source\r\n  * This will be replaced by an equivalent command **`nuget search`** which will be later enhanced with more capabilities as we make progress with or [search improvements](nvmd got it: https://github.com/NuGet/NuGetGallery/issues/6371​​​​​​​).\r\n* [`nuget add`](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/nuget/tools/cli-ref-add): Currently adds a specified package to a non-HTTP package source (a folder or UNC path) in a hierarchical layout, wherein folders are created for the package ID and version number. \r\n  * This will be replaced by overloading **`nuget push`** command.\r\n\r\n> These commands will be deprecated i.e. there will be a warning on usage of these commands in 5.0 so that in future releases these commands can be discontinued."}],"ResultType":"GitHubEvent"},"Twitter":{"ResultType":"TwitterTimeline","Tweets":[{"Id":"1124053944269983745","CreatedAt":"2019-05-02T20:51:58+00:00","UserScreenname":"nuget","Text":"https://t.co/F9kiKfvqkS
