It seems that when lazy loading routes from a library, each route would need to be its own library or secondary entry point in order for the bundling to work correctly which doesn't make sense when using the libraries for feature development as a feature could consist of multiple lazy-routes.\r\n\r\nMinimal repro: https://github.com/RobM-ADP/lazy-load-bug\r\n\r\n## üåç Your Environment\r\n<pre><code>\r\n$ ng version\r\n\r\nAngular CLI: 8.0.3\r\nNode: 10.15.3\r\nOS: darwin x64\r\nAngular: 8.0.1\r\n... animations, common, compiler, compiler-cli, core, forms\r\n... language-service, platform-browser, platform-browser-dynamic\r\n... router\r\n\r\nPackage                            Version\r\n------------------------------------------------------------\r\n@angular-devkit/architect          0.800.3\r\n@angular-devkit/build-angular      0.800.3\r\n@angular-devkit/build-ng-packagr   0.800.3\r\n@angular-devkit/build-optimizer    0.800.3\r\n@angular-devkit/build-webpack      0.800.3\r\n@angular-devkit/core               8.0.3\r\n@angular-devkit/schematics         8.0.3\r\n@angular/cli                       8.0.3\r\n@ngtools/json-schema               1.1.0\r\n@ngtools/webpack                   8.0.3\r\n@schematics/angular                8.0.3\r\n@schematics/update                 0.800.3\r\nng-packagr                         5.3.0\r\nrxjs                               6.5.2\r\ntypescript                         3.4.5\r\nwebpack                            4.30.0\r\n\r\n</code></pre>\r\n\r\n## common.js bundle \r\nNotice that components from both Module AAA and Module BBB are in here.\r\n\r\n<img width=\"1094\" alt=\"common js\" src=\"https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/44685045/59776722-45250000-9281-11e9-9700-2a794ae4df86.png\">\r\n\r\n## aaa-wrapper-module.js bundle\r\nNotice that the only thing in here is the wrapper itself.

It passes in an empty object for the `b` property of `target2`'s options: `{ \"a\": \"bar\", \"b\": {} }`. Thus, `result.b` will be `{}` instead of `{ \"asd\": \"wer\" }`.\r\nThis is done by the Angular's postTransform `addUndefinedDefaults` which is always added to the `CoreSchemaRegistry`. In theory postTransforms can be disabled as seen [here](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli/blob/48e6060e02792cd614a1f80ae8b87109df88c893/packages/angular_devkit/core/src/json/schema/registry.ts#L337L339) using `applyPostTransforms: false`. However, it is not possible to override this value when the builder's schema is compiled and the validator is used, see [here](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli/blob/master/packages/angular_devkit/architect/src/architect.ts#L63) (no second argument is passed to `validation`).\r\n\r\nOf course, I could add some code to my builder that checks for that `{}` and ignores it. But actually, it should be possible to explicitly set `b: {}` to override the inherited value, e.g.:\r\n\r\n    \"target3\": {\r\n        \"builder\": \"mybuilder:f\":\r\n        \"options\": {\r\n            \"targetRef\": \"myproject:target1\",\r\n            \"b\": {}\r\n        }\r\n    },\r\n\r\nSo I really need to distinguish between the `{}` set by the user and the `{}` set by the postTransform.\r\n\r\nNOTE: All of this affects options that are set to type `object` or `array` (in which case `[]` is used as default) in the schema.\r\n\r\n### Describe the solution you'd like\r\nIt would be nice to be able to disable postTransforms for a specific builder, for example in the builder code itself.\r\n\r\nActually I do not know why the `addUndefinedDefaults` transform is used at all, but there is probably a reason for that. Is it? üòõ \r\n\r\n### Describe alternatives you've considered\r\nI cannot imagine any workarounds. Angular modifies the options passed to a builder where it should not, IMHO. In the above case, the user does not specified a `b` property, but Angular passes in an empty object for `b`. And currently there is no way to change that behavior, as far as I can see.\r\n\r\nEDIT:\r\nI did find a workaround, but it is an ugly hack as it relies on the internals of `addUndefinedDefault` and thus could easily break when Angular is updated.\r\n\r\nInstead of this schema:\r\n\r\n    \"b\": {\r\n        \"type\": \"object\",\r\n        \"additionalProperties\": {\r\n            \"type\": \"string\"\r\n        }\r\n    }\r\n\r\nOne can use this schema:\r\n\r\n    \"b\": {\r\n        \"oneOf\": [\r\n            {\r\n                \"type\": \"null\"\r\n            },\r\n            {\r\n                \"type\": \"object\",\r\n                \"additionalProperties\": {\r\n                    \"type\": \"string\"\r\n                }\r\n            }\r\n        ]\r\n    }\r\n\r\nThis works, because Angular detects that two types are possible for `b`: `object`and `null`. This causes Angular to not override the value.\r\nOf course, `null` is now a valid value for `b`, too, but that may not be a problem in some cases.","Url":"https://github.com/angular/angular-cli/issues/14827","RelatedDescription":"Open issue \"applyPostTransforms should not be applied for all builder schemas\" (#14827)"},{"Id":"457860869","IsPullRequest":false,"CreatedAt":"2019-06-19T08:47:43","Actor":"yodi-n","Number":"14826","RawContent":null,"Title":"Update to Angular 8 - web-animations-js","State":"closed","Body":"<!--üîÖüîÖüîÖüîÖüîÖüîÖüîÖüîÖüîÖüîÖüîÖüîÖüîÖüîÖüîÖüîÖüîÖüîÖüîÖüîÖüîÖüîÖüîÖüîÖüîÖüîÖüîÖüîÖüîÖüîÖüîÖ\r\n\r\nOh hi there! üòÑ\r\n\r\nTo expedite issue processing please search open and closed issues before submitting a new one.\r\nExisting issues often contain information about workarounds, resolution, or progress updates.\r\n\r\nüîÖüîÖüîÖüîÖüîÖüîÖüîÖüîÖüîÖüîÖüîÖüîÖüîÖüîÖüîÖüîÖüîÖüîÖüîÖüîÖüîÖüîÖüîÖüîÖüîÖüîÖüîÖüîÖüîÖüîÖüîÖüîÖüîÖ-->\r\n\r\n\r\n# üêû Bug report\r\n\r\nAfter updating our projects form Angular 7 to Angular 8, our Jenkins was not able run npm install due to this line in the package.json file\r\n\"web-animations-js\": \"angular/web-animations-js#release_pr208\"\r\n\r\nThe thing is that our Jenkins is behind a corporate proxy that does not allow calls to github.com\r\n\r\n### Command (mark with an `x`)\r\n<!-- Can you pin-point the command or commands that are effected by this bug? -->\r\n<!-- ‚úçÔ∏èedit: -->\r\n```\r\n- [ ] new\r\n- [ ] build\r\n- [ ] serve\r\n- [ ] test\r\n- [ ] e2e\r\n- [ ] generate\r\n- [ ] add\r\n- [x] update\r\n- [ ] lint\r\n- [ ] xi18n\r\n- [ ] run\r\n- [ ] config\r\n- [ ] help\r\n- [ ] version\r\n- [ ] doc\r\n```\r\n\r\n### Is this a regression?\r\n\r\n<!-- Did this behavior use to work in the previous version? -->\r\nYes, this did not happen with previous versions of Angular\r\n\r\n### Description\r\n\r\nWhen running npm ci, our Jenkins is not able to get the web-animation-js dependency on the angular github for of the original project.\r\n\r\n\r\n## üî¨ Minimal Reproduction\r\n- Create a project using @angular/cli 7\r\n- Install web-animation-js package\r\n- Add the dependency in the polyfill.ts file\r\n- Update to Angular 8 using ng update @ancular/cli @angular/core\r\n\r\n\r\nI don't understand why the Angular team did not uploaded this dependency under @angular/web-animation-js or something instead of just pointing to a PR of a for of the original project.\r\n\r\nI realise this is not really a bug since it is a feature of NPM to be able to fetch dependencies directly on github, but it is the first time since I'm using Angular that this happens.\r\n","Url":"https://github.com/angular/angular-cli/issues/14826","RelatedDescription":"Closed issue \"Update to Angular 8 - web-animations-js\" (#14826)"},{"Id":"457771512","IsPullRequest":false,"CreatedAt":"2019-06-19T05:44:28","Actor":"michael-letcher","Number":"14825","RawContent":null,"Title":"[BUG] Font import urls not being prepended with base-href","State":"closed","Body":"# üêû Bug report\r\n\r\n### Command (mark with an `x`)\r\n<!-- Can you pin-point the command or commands that are effected by this bug? -->\r\n<!-- ‚úçÔ∏èedit: -->\r\n```\r\n- [ ] new\r\n- [X] build\r\n- [X] serve\r\n- [ ] test\r\n- [ ] e2e\r\n- [ ] generate\r\n- [ ] add\r\n- [ ] update\r\n- [ ] lint\r\n- [ ] xi18n\r\n- [ ] run\r\n- [ ] config\r\n- [ ] help\r\n- [ ] version\r\n- [ ] doc\r\n```\r\n\r\n### Is this a regression?\r\nYes, the previous version in which this bug was not present was: v7.x.x\r\n\r\n### Description\r\nIf you have a `@font-face` in your styles and serve/build with a base-href your urls will be incorrect.\r\n\r\nTested with both SCSS and LESS both fail in v8.

This results in having invalid data if the component performs initial functionality on onInit.\r\n\r\nNote that the problem below does not happen if template caching is disabled with ```templateCacheSize: 0```.\r\n\r\nI've replicated the issue on this stackblitz: https://stackblitz.com/edit/virtual-scroll-pointer-bug\r\n\r\nI have the following scenario where I have a component; in the example, ```PersonComponent```; which is repeated for each element of an array within a virtual scroll vieport (see ```app.component.html```). The ```PersonComponent``` takes a ```Person``` object as an input, and onInit retrieves an ```Activity``` object based on some activity ID from an array of Activities that is cached on a service (```ActivityService```). The retrieved object is then assigned on a variable within the ```PersonComponent``` class.\r\n\r\nThe problem relies when the end user scrolls down and up in the virtual scroll container. When the elements are destroyed and recreated, it seems that the pointers of the activity variable on the ```PersonComponent``` is set to point to another incorrect value.\r\n\r\nTo replicate the problem, \r\n\r\n- Open the stack blits above\r\n- Take note of the Names and their associated activity. \r\n- Scroll down on the virtual scroll container (left scroll), and then all the way up\r\n- Note that the activities associated with the names have changed. \r\n\r\nNote that the content of the activity array is not changing, so it's not an issue of some other process changing the content of the object pointed to. Also if you scroll on a normal non virtual scroll container (right scroll), you can note that the data remains the same and does not change.\r\n\r\nSee also the animated gif below.\r\n\r\n![virtual scroll bug](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/7465421/59760081-bff61700-9291-11e9-9cb1-ca9490da171a.gif)\r\n\r\nI don't know what might be causing the problem, but it seems that it's caused by the virtual scroll functionality.\r\n\r\nI've encounted this problem in v7 but it is also present in v8.\r\n\r\nAlso note that the values that are passed as an @Input() are not changed but remain the same.\r\n \r\n#### Expected Behavior\r\n\r\nIt should be expected that the data that was retrieved onInit is maintained and rendered correctly.\r\n\r\n#### Environment\r\n\r\n- Angular: v8.0.1\r\n- CDK/Material: v8.0.1 (also present in v7.3.6)\r\n- Browser: Chrome\r\n- Operating System: Ubuntu \r\n","Url":"https://github.com/angular/components/issues/16330","RelatedDescription":"Open issue \"Virtual Scroll template caching breaking behavior for Components with ngOnInit\" (#16330)"},{"Id":"457902578","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2019-06-19T09:25:23","Actor":"alvaromartmart","Number":"16329","RawContent":null,"Title":"Fix wrong autocomplete-plain-input example (fixes #16327)","State":"open","Body":"Fix for #16327","Url":"https://github.com/angular/components/pull/16329","RelatedDescription":"Open PR \"Fix wrong autocomplete-plain-input example (fixes #16327)\" (#16329)"},{"Id":"457894952","IsPullRequest":false,"CreatedAt":"2019-06-19T09:09:35","Actor":"alvaromartmart","Number":"16327","RawContent":null,"Title":"Missing example in autocomplete documentation","State":"open","Body":"#### Documentation Feedback\r\n\r\nThe autocomplete documentation is missing the \"Autocomplete on a custom input element\" example.\r\n![missing_autocomplete_example](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/18287793/59752527-b2856080-9282-11e9-863f-1897a6a28370.png)\r\n\r\n\r\n**Affected documentation page:** https://material.angular.io/components/autocomplete/overview#autocomplete-on-a-custom-input-element\r\n","Url":"https://github.com/angular/components/issues/16327","RelatedDescription":"Open issue \"Missing example in autocomplete documentation\" (#16327)"},{"Id":"457861927","IsPullRequest":false,"CreatedAt":"2019-06-19T07:56:34","Actor":"swirlsky","Number":"16326","RawContent":null,"Title":"Drag and Drop resets components being moved","State":"open","Body":"#### What are you seeing that does not match your expectations?\r\n\r\nComponents being drag-and-dropped lose their state.\r\n\r\n#### Reproduction\r\n\r\n[StackBlitz](https://stackblitz.com/edit/angular-ljpjhv)\r\n\r\nSteps to reproduce:\r\n\r\nThere are six rectangles you can drag-and-drop between the two drop zones.
