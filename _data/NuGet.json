For local iteration and testing on the package before the real release. \r\n\r\nI'm using these steps:\r\n\r\n1. Build a change to PackageA, without incrementing the version.\r\n2. Re-publish PackageA to a local feed, on my development machine. This works fine (I delete the previous instance first). \r\n3. Force that new package into ConsumerApp to test the change.

I assume it should be removing that folder as part of the reinstall. If the command is trying and failing to do this, it's silent about it.\r\n\r\nOther notes:\r\n- This package only exists at the local feed. Not in any other package source.\r\n- This package is published with symbols (so includes a src folder under the packages\\PackageA folder)\r\n- The local feed is at the top of my package sources in Visual Studio.\r\n- The log below indicates it is retrieving again from the Local feed, but later also says `Package 'PackageA.1.0.0' already exists in folder 'C:\\dev\\ConsumerApp\\code\\packages'`.\r\n- In practice you might increase the version the first time you start iterating, to avoid a clash with the version previously released. But you'll hit the same problem on the iteration after that.\r\n\r\nProducts used:\r\nPackage Manager Console Host Version 3.5.0.1996\r\nNuGet Version: 3.5.0.1938\r\nVisual Studio 2015 Update
