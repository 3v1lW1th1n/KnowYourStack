W.cr)\r\n      {\r\n           return ProcessBreak(element);\r\n      }\r\n\r\nWhich causes the page break to not appear.\r\n\r\nI have changed this so it returns a div style=\"page-break-before:always;\"  in the following function.\r\n\r\n    private static object ProcessPageBreak(XElement element)\r\n        {\r\n            XElement div = new

The page break (docx) is detected in a child element. So i have to set the page break ( html) in it's parent.

I am not sure if this will be frowned upon or not :)\r\n\r\nThis second step is largely based on this post from Eric White;\r\n\r\nhttps://blogs.msdn.microsoft.com/ericwhite/2009/04/21/using-documentbuilder-with-content-controls-for-document-assembly/\r\n\r\n\r\nAlthough in my practical experience (been using this code in production for months) the Word documents generated are valid I had issues with the Unit Tests.  I think this is because we are using Office 365 and it looks like the validator only supports up-to 2013 at the minute?  I could re-author my test files in 2013 but don't have access to a copy.\r\n\r\nAny comments and feedback appreciated, this is my first pull request on an open-source project so be gentle :)"},{"Id":"8996438011","Type":"PullRequestEvent","CreatedAt":"2019-02-02T01:25:37","Actor":"tomjebo","Repository":"OfficeDev/Open-Xml-PowerTools","Organization":"OfficeDev","RawContent":null,"RelatedAction":"closed","RelatedUrl":"https://github.com/OfficeDev/Open-Xml-PowerTools/pull/237","RelatedDescription":"Closed pull request \"Added missing image/bmp type to ImageContentTypes\" (#237) at OfficeDev/Open-Xml-PowerTools","RelatedBody":"Added \"bmp\" format into content types to fix missing images issue after conversion to html."},{"Id":"8996437268","Type":"PullRequestEvent","CreatedAt":"2019-02-02T01:25:19","Actor":"tomjebo","Repository":"OfficeDev/Open-Xml-PowerTools","Organization":"OfficeDev","RawContent":null,"RelatedAction":"closed","RelatedUrl":"https://github.com/OfficeDev/Open-Xml-PowerTools/pull/236","RelatedDescription":"Closed pull request \"DocumentAssembler: Support for Images (#42)\" (#236) at OfficeDev/Open-Xml-PowerTools","RelatedBody":"Implementation of feature request to support templated images in Document Assembler."}],"ResultType":"GitHubEvent"}},"RunOn":"2019-02-16T05:30:54.8282036Z","RunDurationInMilliseconds":835}
