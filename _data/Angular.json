This was done because TypeScript ts.Diagnostics\r\ncannot be produced for files not in the ts.Program, and template type-\r\nchecking diagnostics are naturally produced for external .html template\r\nfiles.\r\n\r\nThis design isn't optimal for several reasons:\r\n\r\n1) Downstream tooling (such as the CLI) must support multiple formats of\r\ndiagnostics, adding to the maintenance burden.\r\n\r\n2) ts.Diagnostics have gotten a lot better in recent releases, with support\r\nfor suggested changes, highlighting of the code in question, etc. None of\r\nthese changes have been of any benefit for api.Diagnostics, which have\r\ncontinued to be reported in a very primitive fashion.\r\n\r\n3) A future plugin model will not support anything but ts.Diagnostics, so\r\ngenerating api.Diagnostics is a blocker for ngtsc-as-a-plugin.\r\n\r\n4) The split complicates both the typings and the testing of ngtsc.\r\n\r\nTo fix this issue, this commit changes template type-checking to produce\r\nts.Diagnostics instead. Instead of reporting a special kind of diagnostic\r\nfor external template files, errors in a template are always reported in\r\na ts.Diagnostic anchored on the template or templateUrl expression. If\r\nnecessary, the position of the error in the template is included in the\r\nmessageText of the ts.Diagnostic.\r\n\r\nA template error can thus be reported in 3 separate ways, depending on how\r\nthe template was configured:\r\n\r\n1) For inline template strings which can be directly mapped to offsets in\r\nthe TS code, ts.Diagnostics point to real ranges in the source.\r\n\r\nThis is the case if an inline template is used with a string literal or a\r\n\"no-substitution\" string. For example:\r\n\r\n```typescript\r\n@Component({..., template: `\r\n<p>Bar: {{baz}}</p>\r\n`})\r\nexport class TestCmp {\r\n  bar: string;\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nThe above template contains an error (no 'baz' property of `TestCmp`). The\r\nerror produced by TS will look like:\r\n\r\n```\r\n<p>Bar: {{baz}}</p>\r\n          ~~~\r\n\r\nProperty 'baz' does not exist on type 'TestCmp'. Did you mean 'bar'?\r\n```\r\n\r\n2) For template strings which cannot be directly mapped to offsets in the\r\nTS code, a logical offset into the template string will be included in\r\nthe error message. For example:\r\n\r\n```typescript\r\nconst SOME_TEMPLATE = '<p>Bar: {{baz}}</p>';\r\n\r\n@Component({..., template: SOME_TEMPLATE})\r\nexport class TestCmp {\r\n  bar: string;\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nBecause the template is a reference to another variable and is not an\r\ninline string constant, the compiler will not be able to use \"absolute\"\r\npositions when parsing the template. As a result, errors will report logical\r\noffsets into the template string:\r\n\r\n```\r\n@Component({..., template: SOME_TEMPLATE})\r\n                           ~~~~~~~~~~~~~\r\n\r\n(1, 11): Property 'baz' does not exist on type 'TestCmp'. Did you mean\r\n'bar'?\r\n```\r\n\r\nThis error message states that the error corresponds to line 1, column 11 of\r\nthe template.\r\n\r\n3) For external templates (templateUrl), the error message is anchored on\r\nthe templateUrl expression and contains the filename as well as the position\r\ninformation. For example, if the above example instead had its template in\r\n./testcmp.html, the error would look like:\r\n\r\n```\r\n@Component({..., templateUrl: './testcmp.html'})\r\n                              ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\r\n\r\n./testcmp.html(1, 11): Property 'baz' does not exist on type 'TestCmp'. Did\r\nyou mean 'bar'?\r\n```","Url":"https://github.com/angular/angular/pull/31952","RelatedDescription":"Open PR \"feat(ivy): convert all ngtsc diagnostics to ts.Diagnostics\" (#31952)"},{"Id":"475897744","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2019-08-01T21:29:48","Actor":"jordan-amman","Number":"31951","RawContent":null,"Title":"Fixed doc class name mismatches with code","State":"open","Body":"## PR Checklist\r\nPlease check if your PR fulfills the following requirements:\r\n\r\n- [ ] The commit message follows our guidelines: https://github.com/angular/angular/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md#commit\r\n- [ ] Tests for the changes have been added (for bug fixes / features)\r\n- [ ] Docs have been added / updated (for bug fixes / features)\r\n\r\n\r\n## PR Type\r\nWhat kind of change does this PR introduce?\r\n\r\n<!-- Please check the one that applies to this PR using \"x\". -->\r\n\r\n- [x ] Bugfix\r\n- [ ] Feature\r\n- [ ] Code style update (formatting, local variables)\r\n- [ ] Refactoring (no functional changes, no api changes)\r\n- [ ] Build related changes\r\n- [ ] CI related changes\r\n- [x ] Documentation content changes\r\n- [ ] angular.io application / infrastructure changes\r\n- [ ] Other...

But this has a side effect (often desired, but not always) by injecting `sourceMappingURL`s into the `css` and `js` files.\r\n\r\nFor the cases when source maps are used to debug prod environment, it is not desired to have `sourceMappingURL`s in the `js` and `css` files. E.g. Google Chrome shows a warning in the console when it tries to download the source map and it can't find it.\r\n\r\n### Describe the solution you'd like\r\n<!-- ✍️--> If you have a solution in mind, please describe it.\r\nAbility to configure, whether `sourceMappingURL`s should be injected when generating source maps.\r\n\r\n### Describe alternatives you've considered\r\n<!-- ✍️--> Have you considered any alternative solutions or workarounds?\r\nThis can be removed by running some post-build script, but seems to be far from ideal.","Url":"https://github.com/angular/angular-cli/issues/15223","RelatedDescription":"Closed issue \"Generate SourceMaps without `sourceMappingURL`s\" (#15223)"},{"Id":"475635884","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2019-08-01T11:45:15","Actor":"alan-agius4","Number":"15222","RawContent":null,"Title":"fix(@angular-devkit/core): add schema defaults when value is undefined","State":"open","Body":"Related to https://github.com/angular/angular-cli/pull/15207#discussion_r309175463","Url":"https://github.com/angular/angular-cli/pull/15222","RelatedDescription":"Open PR \"fix(@angular-devkit/core): add schema defaults when value is undefined\" (#15222)"},{"Id":"475904106","IsPullRequest":false,"CreatedAt":"2019-08-01T10:26:18","Actor":"edocbuhtig","Number":"15228","RawContent":null,"Title":"Ng update to 8.2.0 from 8.1.3 failed with JSON parse error","State":"open","Body":"<!--🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅\r\n\r\nOh hi there! 😄\r\n\r\nTo expedite issue processing please search open and closed issues before submitting a new one.\r\nExisting issues often contain information about workarounds, resolution, or progress updates.\r\n\r\n🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅-->\r\n\r\n\r\n# 🐞 bug report\r\n\r\n### Affected Package\r\n<!-- Can you pin-point one or more @angular/* packages as the source of the bug? -->\r\n<!-- ✍️edit: --> The issue is caused by package typescript 3.5.3 (was 3.4.5)\r\n\r\n\r\n### Is this a regression?\r\n\r\n<!-- Did this behavior use to work in the previous version? -->\r\n<!-- ✍️--> No\r\n\r\n\r\n### Description\r\n\r\n<!-- ✍️--> ng update stops at typescript package update with below error\r\n\r\nUpdating package.json with dependency @angular/cli @ \"8.2.0\" (was \"8.1.3\")...\r\n    Updating package.json with dependency @angular/core @ \"8.2.0\" (was \"8.1.3\")...\r\n    Updating package.json with dependency @angular/language-service @ \"8.2.0\" (was \"8.1.3\")...\r\n    Updating package.json with dependency @angular/compiler-cli @ \"8.2.0\" (was \"8.1.3\")...\r\n    Updating package.json with dependency @angular-devkit/build-angular @ \"0.802.0\" (was \"0.801.3\")...\r\n    Updating package.json with dependency @angular/compiler @ \"8.2.0\" (was \"8.1.3\")...\r\n    Updating package.json with dependency @angular/animations @ \"8.2.0\" (was \"8.1.3\")...\r\n    Updating package.json with dependency @angular/forms @ \"8.2.0\" (was \"8.1.3\")...\r\n    Updating package.json with dependency @angular/platform-browser @ \"8.2.0\" (was \"8.1.3\")...\r\n    Updating package.json with dependency @angular/router @ \"8.2.0\" (was \"8.1.3\")...\r\n    Updating package.json with dependency @angular/platform-browser-dynamic @ \"8.2.0\" (was \"8.1.3\")...\r\n    Updating package.json with dependency @angular/common @ \"8.2.0\" (was \"8.1.3\")...\r\n    Updating package.json with dependency typescript @ \"3.5.3\" (was \"3.4.5\")...\r\nUPDATE package.json (1470 bytes)\r\nnpm ERR!

Digging deeper I noticed that the build pipeline doesn't make `ngInjectorDef` assignments avalable for DCE.\r\n\r\nSnippet from the pre-terser code:\r\n```\r\ncommon_DeprecatedI18NPipesModule.ngInjectorDef = /*@__PURE__*/ ɵɵdefineInjector({\r\n  factory: function DeprecatedI18NPipesModule_Factory(t) {\r\n    return new (t || common_DeprecatedI18NPipesModule)();\r\n  },\r\n  providers: [{ provide: DEPRECATED_PLURAL_FN, useValue: common_0$2 }] });\r\n```\r\n\r\nTerser won't remove this because it's a static property assignment. So while the right handside is marked as pure, the left handside might have a side effect and therefore will be retained.\r\n\r\nI think this is a general problem we have in the pipeline where we generally expect that the static properties will be assigned within the PURE IIFE wrapped around a class, but in this case the assignment happens outside of that IIFE likely because of two other function calls (`ɵɵsetNgModuleScope` and `setClassMetadata`) that are emitted in between the class body and the static assignment:\r\n\r\n```\r\n let common_DeprecatedI18NPipesModule = /*@__PURE__*/ (() => {\r\n                class DeprecatedI18NPipesModule {\r\n                }\r\n                DeprecatedI18NPipesModule.ngModuleDef = ɵɵdefineNgModule({ type: DeprecatedI18NPipesModule });\r\n                return DeprecatedI18NPipesModule;\r\n        })();\r\n\r\n/*@__PURE__*/ /*@__PURE__*/ ɵɵsetNgModuleScope(common_DeprecatedI18NPipesModule, {\r\n                declarations: [common_DeprecatedDecimalPipe,\r\n                        common_DeprecatedPercentPipe,\r\n                        common_DeprecatedCurrencyPipe,\r\n                        common_DeprecatedDatePipe], exports: [common_DeprecatedDecimalPipe,\r\n                                common_DeprecatedPercentPipe,\r\n                                common_DeprecatedCurrencyPipe,\r\n                                common_DeprecatedDatePipe]\r\n        });\r\n\r\n/*@__PURE__*/ /*@__PURE__*/ setClassMetadata(common_DeprecatedI18NPipesModule, [{\r\n                type: NgModule,\r\n                args: [{\r\n                        declarations: [COMMON_DEPRECATED_I18N_PIPES],\r\n                        exports: [COMMON_DEPRECATED_I18N_PIPES],\r\n                        providers: [{ provide: DEPRECATED_PLURAL_FN, useValue: common_0$2 }]\r\n                }]\r\n        }], null, null);\r\n\r\n\r\n       common_DeprecatedI18NPipesModule.ngInjectorDef = /*@__PURE__*/ ɵɵdefineInjector({\r\n                factory: function DeprecatedI18NPipesModule_Factory(t) {\r\n                        return new (t || common_DeprecatedI18NPipesModule)();\r\n                },\r\n                providers:\r\n                [{ provide: DEPRECATED_PLURAL_FN, useValue: common_0$2 }] });\r\n```\r\n\r\nBecause the static property assignment is now outside of the PURE class IIFE, the static property assignment is ineligible for DCE.\r\n\r\n\r\nTo fix this we have two options:\r\n\r\n1. ensure that the static property assignment is located within the class body by changing the order in which these things are emitted by ngtsc\r\n2. wrap the static property assignment in a new PURE IIFE:\r\n\r\n```\r\n/*@__PURE__*/ (function() { common_DeprecatedI18NPipesModule.ngInjectorDef = /*@__PURE__*/ ɵɵdefineInjector({\r\n  factory: function DeprecatedI18NPipesModule_Factory(t) {\r\n    return new (t || common_DeprecatedI18NPipesModule)();\r\n  },\r\n  providers: [{ provide: DEPRECATED_PLURAL_FN, useValue: common_0$2 }] });\r\n})();\r\n```\r\nnote the IIFE around the assignment marked as pure.\r\n\r\nI'm slightly leaning towards the options number two just because it's more generic and could catch other issues.\r\n\r\n\r\n## 🔬 Minimal Reproduction\r\n<!--\r\nSimple steps to reproduce this bug.\r\n\r\nPlease include: commands run (including args), packages added,

We hope someone can guide us in the right direction to make a reproduction example. \r\n \r\n#### Expected Behavior\r\nThe overlays should show up in front of all other elements - even in full-screen mode.\r\n\r\n#### Actual Behavior\r\nThe overlays show up **behind** all other elements, and are invisible. So at first sight it seems that the clicks don't work.\r\n\r\nHere is an example what happens in our app:\r\n![ng_mat_cdk_812](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/20422904/62217083-4b42ec00-b3aa-11e9-822b-f2f2af58cb68.gif)\r\n\r\n* when we first open the app and click on the pager-dropdown the overlay is not shown\r\n* this also happens for other drop-downs (and even for modal dialogs)\r\n* when we switch to full-screen mode (we use [screenfull-js](https://github.com/sindresorhus/screenfull.js/)) the overlays appear\r\n* when we now exit full-screen the drop-downs work correctly\r\n\r\nmore info: \r\n* when we revert the @angular/cdk version from `8.1.2` to `8.1.1` the app works correctly\r\n* even with `8.1.2` we can make the app work (at least in non-fullscreen mode) when we deactivate the `FullscreenOverlayContainer`: \r\n```typescript\r\n@NgModule({\r\n   ...\r\n  // when we deactivate this line, it even works with cdk version 8.1.2\r\n  ,  providers: [{ provide: OverlayContainer, useClass: FullscreenOverlayContainer }]\r\n})\r\n```\r\n* maybe this is related to [pull-request #11940](https://github.com/angular/components/pull/11940)?\r\n\r\nWe hope that someone can give us a

called","State":"open","Body":"#### Feature Description\r\n\r\nProvide a method/property on DialogRef to indicate the dialog is in a closing state (i.e. dialogRef.close() has been called).  For example: dialogRef.isClosing() or dialogRef.state\r\n\r\n#### Use Case\r\n\r\nThere is a small but non-negligible span of time between calling dialogRef.close() and the dialog actually being removed.  It would be nice to be able to prevent certain user actions during this time, in a generic fashion.  Currently, you either have to take another action every time you call close() (which doesn't account for calls coming from within the component, could be missed/isn't generic) or check the _state property of MatDialogContainer (which is an internal property of an internal class, so not something anyone should do).  Having this state indicator would allow a single common component used on many dialogs to handle such a behavior.\r\n","Url":"https://github.com/angular/components/issues/16636","RelatedDescription":"Open issue \"Detect if DialogRef close has been called\" (#16636)"},{"Id":"474050174","IsPullRequest":false,"CreatedAt":"2019-07-29T13:24:56","Actor":"nicholasp","Number":"16635","RawContent":null,"Title":"Outline form field prefix wrong position","State":"open","Body":"#### Reproduction\r\n\r\nStackBlitz: https://stackblitz.com/edit/angular-bn3lcp\r\n\r\nSteps to reproduce:\r\n1.
