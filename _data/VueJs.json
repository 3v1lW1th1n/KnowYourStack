Create a simple component that shows the amount of times it's been rendered:\r\n\r\n    ```js\r\n    Vue.component('times-rendered', {\r\n        created() {\r\n          this.timesRendered = 0\r\n        },\r\n        render(h) {        \r\n          return h('div', `Times rendered: ${++this.timesRendered}`)\r\n        }\r\n    });\r\n    ```\r\n\r\n2. Use this component twice. Once with content in the default slot, once without. After the component is mounted, trigger any update to its data:\r\n\r\n    ```html\r\n    <template>\r\n        <div>\r\n          <div>{{ updateTrigger }}</div>\r\n          <times-rendered></times-rendered>\r\n          <times-rendered>\r\n            Any content in the default slot causes a re-render. Why?\r\n          </times-rendered>\r\n        </div>\r\n    </template>\r\n\r\n    <script>\r\n    export default {\r\n        data: () => ({ updateTrigger: false }),\r\n        \r\n        async mounted() {\r\n          await this.$nextTick()\r\n          \r\n          this.updateTrigger = true\r\n        },\r\n    };\r\n    </script>\r\n    ```\r\n\r\n### What is expected?\r\nI would expect each instance of the component to only render once.\r\n\r\n### What is actually happening?\r\nThe component with content in the slot renders twice.\r\n\r\n---\r\nI'm not actually sure whether this is a bug or a feature request. Maybe this is expected behavior currently. If it is, then I guess this would be better classified as a feature request.\r\n\r\n<!-- generated by vue-issues.

Click on the working checkbox. The v-model value updates and the \"updated\" lifecycle event fires a console log.\r\n2. Click on the \"busted\" checkbox, which is the same markup as the working checkbox, but wrapped within a div inside the DynamicWrap component. \r\n\r\nNotice that the checkbox appears checked, but the v-model doesn't update and the \"updated\" lifecycle event of the checkbox never fires.\r\n\r\n\r\n### What is expected?\r\nThe second checkbox's v-model updates correctly\r\n\r\n### What is actually happening?\r\nNo updated lifecycle event fires, the v-model is not updated.\r\n\r\n---\r\nWhat's happening:\r\nThe DynamicWrapper is rerendered after mount when the UnwrappedCheckbox is created inside of its default slot. UnwrappedCheckbox uses provide/inject to update the DynamicWrap component to wrap it with a 'div' instead of a 'label' element. This clones the content inside, but once the Checkbox is nested a layer deeper, it stops behaving as expected.\r\n\r\nSorry for the monster title and complex replication, let me know if there's anything more I can do to clarify. For context, the purpose of this DynamicWrapper is to act as a type of \"FormItem\" component. It wraps any element placed inside of the component (In this case a Checkbox) with a label element unless it's something like a Checkbox or Radio. We have our own Checkbox and Radio, that we'd like to tell the FormItem to unwrap the label if a Checkbox is placed inside it.\r\n\r\nI've also tested in the beta prerelease and the issue remains.\r\n\r\nPossible related previous issues:\r\nhttps://github.com/vuejs/vue/issues/6372\r\nhttps://github.com/vuejs/vue/issues/6915\r\n\r\n<!-- generated by vue-issues.

Having a way to check if the namespace path is already occupied would allow the code to either, register to a different namespace (ick!), unregister and re-register the existing namespace or avoid registration of the namespace altogether. \r\n\r\nThis condition can be easily reproduced by dynamically registering a namespaced module and issuing a hotreload or attempting to register that module more than once to the same path. \r\n\r\nEnd users would not see errors on hot-load or, if for some reason, the code attempts multiple registrations in the same session.\r\n\r\nThe only workaround at this point is to check the private member _modulesNamespaceMap.

I don't think this line of reasoning holds in the Vue/Vuex world. In almost all other aspects of Vue/Vuex, the API looks straight forward (e.g. just getting and setting properties), but under the hood a lot of additional logic runs (dependency tracking, etc.). So there is really no need to make committing mutations more cumbersome than they need to be.\r\n\r\nIn addition to making the code harder to read, this leads to additional rules about argument passing.\r\n\r\nMoreover, it is very hard to spot typos in the mutation name early on, as the mutation name is just a string - let alone checking that the call to `commit()` received the correct arguments according to the mutation function. These types of errors should be easy to spot at compile time, but with the current syntax, these are all pushed into runtime.\r\n\r\nFinally, this cumbersome syntax might be (correctly) perceived as boilerplate, especially to beginners. Hence, replacing the commit syntax with a more straight forward syntax might improve the adoption of Vuex.\r\n\r\n### What does the proposed API look like?\r\nInstead of:\r\n\r\n    this.$store.commit('someMutation', args...)\r\n\r\none should be allowed to write:\r\n\r\n    this.$store.someMutation(args...)\r\n\r\nMoreover, it would be great if looking at `this.$store` in the developer console all available mutation methods are shown. That is, the methods should be real properties of this.$store, collected once at program start.\r\n\r\nUnder the hood, of course, these methods might all call some central commit() function.\r\n\r\nAlternative syntax: The above syntax might introduce some name collisions. For example, someone might name one of their mutations \"state\", for whatever reason, making \"this.$store.state\" ambiguous. For the sake of simplicity, these names should just be forbidden as mutation names. But if this is not an option for whatever reason, an intermediate object might do the trick as well. This would be less beautiful, but still better than what we have today:\r\n\r\n    this.$store.commit.someMutation(args...)\r\n\r\nor shorter:\r\n\r\n    this.$store.c.someMutation(args...)\r\n\r\nAs an additional proposal, the old `this.$store.commit()` syntax should be marked deprecated.  And removed in future Vuex versions. This generic call is not needed. Any generic commit call might as well be formulated as `this.$store[mutationName](args...)`, which is still easy to understand and even shorter than `this.$store.commit(mutationName, args...)`.\r\n\r\n<!-- generated by vue-issues.
