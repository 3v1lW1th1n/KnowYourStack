after the subitem menu becomes visible - lingers\r\n* In the native menu, clicking on a menu item when the window is unfocused immediately activates that item; MenuStrip requires a second click\r\n* In the native menu, pressing left arrow key when the first menu item is highlighted brings out the \"right-click on window title bar\" menu as if it was another menu item: \r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/3685160/70310763-b432e880-1810-11ea-98f5-f6072ad1f510.png)\r\n* The native menu does not take up any space in `Form.ClientHeight`; when migrating to a `MenuStrip`, you will lose 20 pixels of height\r\n* There is a positioning difference between the native and strip context menu when invoked by a dedicated context menu key instead of a mouse\r\n* Possibly more, this is just what I noticed after a few minutes of testing\r\n\r\n### Test Project\r\n\r\nThe test project targets .NET Core 3.0, and opens 3 windows (native + the 2 strip variations).\r\n\r\n[WindowsFormsStripControlsCore.zip](https://github.com/dotnet/winforms/files/3931357/WindowsFormsStripControlsCore.zip)\r\n","Url":"https://github.com/dotnet/winforms/issues/2476","RelatedDescription":"Open issue \"Make MenuStrip and ContextMenuStrip look more Windows-native\" (#2476)"},{"Id":"533417542","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2019-12-06T01:13:35","Actor":"hughbe","Number":"2470","RawContent":null,"Title":"Cleanup GetDpiForWindow and add tests","State":"closed","Body":"## Proposed Changes\r\n- Cleanup GetDpiForWindow and add tests\n\n###### Microsoft Reviewers: [Open in CodeFlow](http://wpcp.azurewebsites.net/CodeFlowProtocolProxy2.php?pullrequest=https://github.com/dotnet/winforms/pull/2470)","Url":"https://github.com/dotnet/winforms/pull/2470","RelatedDescription":"Closed or merged PR \"Cleanup GetDpiForWindow and add tests\" (#2470)"},{"Id":"533636814","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2019-12-05T22:32:17","Actor":"OliaG","Number":"2474","RawContent":null,"Title":"Updated the link to the latest blogpost","State":"open","Body":"\n\n###### Microsoft Reviewers: [Open in CodeFlow](http://wpcp.azurewebsites.net/CodeFlowProtocolProxy2.php?pullrequest=https://github.com/dotnet/winforms/pull/2474)","Url":"https://github.com/dotnet/winforms/pull/2474","RelatedDescription":"Open PR \"Updated the link to the latest blogpost\" (#2474)"},{"Id":"533580076","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2019-12-05T21:36:38","Actor":"mmitche","Number":"2473","RawContent":null,"Title":"[release/3.1] Move to RTM sdk","State":"closed","Body":"Pull in timestamp fixes\n\n###### Microsoft Reviewers: [Open in CodeFlow](http://wpcp.azurewebsites.net/CodeFlowProtocolProxy2.php?pullrequest=https://github.com/dotnet/winforms/pull/2473)","Url":"https://github.com/dotnet/winforms/pull/2473","RelatedDescription":"Closed or merged PR \"[release/3.1] Move to RTM sdk\" (#2473)"},{"Id":"530983672","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2019-12-05T19:05:11","Actor":"gpetrou","Number":"2456","RawContent":null,"Title":"Move IsThemeBackgroundPartiallyTransparent to Interop UxTheme","State":"closed","Body":"## Proposed changes\r\n\r\n- Move IsThemeBackgroundPartiallyTransparent to Interop UxTheme\n\n###### Microsoft Reviewers: [Open in CodeFlow](http://wpcp.azurewebsites.net/CodeFlowProtocolProxy2.php?pullrequest=https://github.com/dotnet/winforms/pull/2456)","Url":"https://github.com/dotnet/winforms/pull/2456","RelatedDescription":"Closed or merged PR \"Move IsThemeBackgroundPartiallyTransparent to Interop UxTheme\" (#2456)"},{"Id":"533504060","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2019-12-05T17:54:15","Actor":"hughbe","Number":"2472","RawContent":null,"Title":"Add more ScrollableControl tests","State":"open","Body":"## Proposed Changes\r\n- Add more ScrollableControl tests\n\n###### Microsoft Reviewers: [Open in CodeFlow](http://wpcp.azurewebsites.net/CodeFlowProtocolProxy2.php?pullrequest=https://github.com/dotnet/winforms/pull/2472)","Url":"https://github.com/dotnet/winforms/pull/2472","RelatedDescription":"Open PR \"Add more ScrollableControl tests\" (#2472)"},{"Id":"533694143","IsPullRequest":false,"CreatedAt":"2019-12-05T16:11:46","Actor":"coderesx","Number":"2475","RawContent":null,"Title":"Windows.Forms.MonthCalendar control throws NullReferenceException","State":"open","Body":"Windows.Forms.MonthCalendar controls throws NullReferenceException when the user clicks to change the date\r\n\r\n# General\r\n\r\nThis is a new issue in  .NET Core 3.1.

Interop.User32.GetWindowText","State":"open","Body":"Fixes #2424\r\n\r\n\r\n## Proposed changes\r\nFix the following issues that appear to have been overlooked in the review of #923:\r\n- Ensure the buffer passed to `GetWindowTextW()` has at least the length specified in that call, to prevent an out-of-bounds write.\r\n- Fix the condition to detect if the text length has increased, to ensure the returned text is not truncated.\r\n- Avoid an infinite loop (if the control text changes back and forth between a small and long text) by keeping the `actualTextLength` value as minimum text length.\r\n\r\nAdditional improvements:\r\n- Avoid unnecessary loops by specifying the full buffer length as maximum number of characters, rather than the initial text length value.\r\n\r\n<!-- We are in TELL-MODE the following section must be completed -->\r\n\r\n## Customer Impact\r\n\r\nCustomers will not experience invalid memory access, an infinite loop, or truncated text being returned when the window/control text changes while the code in `GetWindowText` is executing, e.g. if the window/control is owned by a different thread or process, or if the `WndProc` alters the text between receiving a `WM_GETTEXTLENGTH` and a `WM_GETTEXT` message.\r\n\r\n## Regression? \r\n\r\nYes (The out-of-bounds write is a regression from #923; the other items are not regressions)\r\n\r\n## Risk\r\n\r\n-\r\n\r\n<!-- end TELL-MODE -->\r\n\r\n\r\n## Test methodology <!-- How did you ensure quality? -->\r\n\r\n- Manual testing as described in https://github.com/dotnet/winforms/issues/2424#issuecomment-559819764\r\n- The text truncation and infinite loop are tested by unit tests.\r\n\r\n\r\n## Test environment(s) <!-- Remove any that don't
