First, I was realy enthusiastic about vue and all its features but I found that something was missing: a way to declare a model/entity to represent a data object.\r\n\r\nI don't know what you are thinking about a such feature but I think it could be a good option to add an other library (like the router, or even the cli) to guide vue developers with data manipulations and in the same way, promote best practices in this field.\r\n\r\nThank you to consider my proposition.\r\n\r\n### What does the proposed API look like?\r\nMy proposition is to integrate a library to bring the M from MVC to the V from Vue of course without dealing with persistence.

I would like to ask why the url parameters deleted during loading or refreshing the page. For example, I have this url http://localhost:8080/#/a/value1/value2 when the page loaded the url will become http://localhost:8080/#/a and deleted the value1 and value2.\r\n\r\nHere's my router code.\r\n    path: '/a/:value1/:value2',\r\n    name: 'a',\r\n    component: resolve => require(['modules/home/A.vue'], resolve),\r\n    meta: {\r\n      tokenRequired: false\r\n    }\r\n\r\nI want to send verification code to user's email address and get that code using the link\r\n<a href=http://localhost:8080/#/a/value1/value2></a>\r\n\r\nAny Idea?

I don't think this line of reasoning holds in the Vue/Vuex world. In almost all other aspects of Vue/Vuex, the API looks straight forward (e.g. just getting and setting properties), but under the hood a lot of additional logic runs (dependency tracking, etc.). So there is really no need to make committing mutations more cumbersome than they need to be.\r\n\r\nIn addition to making the code harder to read, this leads to additional rules about argument passing.\r\n\r\nMoreover, it is very hard to spot typos in the mutation name early on, as the mutation name is just a string - let alone checking that the call to `commit()` received the correct arguments according to the mutation function. These types of errors should be easy to spot at compile time, but with the current syntax, these are all pushed into runtime.\r\n\r\nFinally, this cumbersome syntax might be (correctly) perceived as boilerplate, especially to beginners. Hence, replacing the commit syntax with a more straight forward syntax might improve the adoption of Vuex.\r\n\r\n### What does the proposed API look like?\r\nInstead of:\r\n\r\n    this.$store.commit('someMutation', args...)\r\n\r\none should be allowed to write:\r\n\r\n    this.$store.someMutation(args...)\r\n\r\nMoreover, it would be great if looking at `this.$store` in the developer console all available mutation methods are shown. That is, the methods should be real properties of this.$store, collected once at program start.\r\n\r\nUnder the hood, of course, these methods might all call some central commit() function.\r\n\r\nAlternative syntax: The above syntax might introduce some name collisions. For example, someone might name one of their mutations \"state\", for whatever reason, making \"this.$store.state\" ambiguous. For the sake of simplicity, these names should just be forbidden as mutation names. But if this is not an option for whatever reason, an intermediate object might do the trick as well. This would be less beautiful, but still better than what we have today:\r\n\r\n    this.$store.commit.someMutation(args...)\r\n\r\nor shorter:\r\n\r\n    this.$store.c.someMutation(args...)\r\n\r\nAs an additional proposal, the old `this.$store.commit()` syntax should be marked deprecated.  And removed in future Vuex versions. This generic call is not needed. Any generic commit call might as well be formulated as `this.$store[mutationName](args...)`, which is still easy to understand and even shorter than `this.$store.commit(mutationName, args...)`.\r\n\r\n<!-- generated by vue-issues.

EG\r\n\r\n```javascript\r\nconst createStore = () => new Vuex.Store({\r\n  state: {\r\n    version: null,\r\n  },\r\n  getters: {\r\n    version(state){\r\n        return state.version;\r\n    }\r\n  },\r\n  setters: {\r\n    setVersion(state, version){\r\n      state.version = version;\r\n    }\r\n  }\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nI don't currently understand the life cycle or structure of the store well enough to programmatically add getters and setters.  Naively, I tried implementing a module to automatically generate a `getters` object to inject into the store something like this:\r\n\r\n```javascript\r\nexport default (state) => {\r\n  let result = Object.keys(state)\r\n    .reduce((getters, key) => {\r\n      const getterMethodName = `${key.charAt(0)}${[...key].slice(1,).join('')}`;\r\n      getters[getterMethodName] = function(state){ return state[key]};\r\n      return getters;\r\n    }, {});\r\n};\r\n```\r\n\r\nThis didn't work, and I'm not sure how to proceed, but it seems like providing vanilla getters and setters that are a function of the property name, but could be overridden with an explicit implementation would make Vuex development friendlier and faster.\r\n\r\nThis idea could be extended to actions and mutations.\r\n\r\nPlease feel free to point out problems with this idea or my understanding of the store, or even better, that someone has already implemented it and where!\r\n\r\n### What does the proposed API look like?\r\nNo visible changes to the current store creation API would be required.  Any store key defined in the `state` object on store creation would generate getters and setters on store creation.\r\n\r\n<!-- generated by vue-issues.
