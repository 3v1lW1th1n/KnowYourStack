{"Data":{"Angular-Issues":{"Issues":[{"Id":"527510493","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2019-11-23T04:54:53","Actor":"mhevery","Number":"34004","RawContent":null,"Title":"refactor(ivy): Add style reconciliation algorithm","State":"open","Body":"# refactor(core): Add array modification functions.\r\nThis change introduces several functions for manipulating items in an array in an efficient (binary search) way.\r\n\r\n- `arraySplice` a faster version of `Array.splice()`.\r\n- `arrayInsert` a faster version of `Array.splice(index, 0, value)`.\r\n- `arrayInsertSorted` a way to insert a value into sorted list.\r\n- `arrayRemoveSorted` a way to remove a value from a sorted list.\r\n- `arrayIndexOfSorted` a way to find a value in a sorted list.\r\n\r\n# refactor(ivy): Add style reconciliation algorithm\r\n\r\nThis change introduces class/style reconciliation algorithm for DOM elements.\r\nNOTE: The code is not yet hooked up, it will be used by future style algorithm.\r\n\r\nBackground: \r\nStyling algorithm currently has [two paths](https://hackmd.io/@5zDGNGArSxiHhgvxRGrg-g/rycZk3N5S) \r\nwhen computing how the style should be rendered. \r\n1. A direct path which concatenates styling and uses `elemnent.className`/`element.style.cssText` and\r\n2. A merge path which uses internal data structures and uses `element.classList.add/remove`/`element.style[property]`.\r\n\r\nThe situation is confusing and hard to follow/maintain. So a future PR will remove the merge-path and do everything with \r\ndirect-path. This however breaks when some other code adds class or style to the element without Angular's knowledge.\r\nIf this happens instead of switching from direct-path to merge-path algorithm, this change provides a different mental model\r\nwhereby we always do `direct-path` but the code which writes to the DOM detects the situation and reconciles the out of bound write.\r\n\r\nThe reconciliation process is as follows:\r\n1. Detect that no one has modified `className`/`cssText` and if so just write directly (fast path).\r\n2. If out of bounds write did occur, switch from writing using `className`/`cssText` to `element.classList.add/remove`/`element.style[property]`.\r\n   This does require that the write function computes the difference between the previous Angular expected state and current Angular state. \r\n   (This requires a parser. The advantage of having a parser is that we can support `style=\"width: {{exp}}px\" kind of bindings.`)\r\n   Compute the diff and apply it in non destructive way using `element.classList.add/remove`/`element.style[property]`\r\n\r\nProperties of approach:\r\n- If no out of bounds style modification:\r\n  - Very fast code path: Just concatenate string in right order and write them to DOM.\r\n  - Class list order is preserved\r\n- If out of bounds style modification detected:\r\n  - Penalty for parsing \r\n  - Switch to non destructive modification: `element.classList.add/remove`/`element.style[property]`\r\n  - Switch to alphabetical way of setting classes.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n## PR Checklist\r\nPlease check if your PR fulfills the following requirements:\r\n\r\n- [x] The commit message follows our guidelines: https://github.com/angular/angular/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md#commit\r\n- [x] Tests for the changes have been added (for bug fixes / features)\r\n- [ ] Docs have been added / updated (for bug fixes / features)\r\n\r\n\r\n## PR Type\r\nWhat kind of change does this PR introduce?\r\n\r\n<!-- Please check the one that applies to this PR using \"x\". -->\r\n\r\n- [ ] Bugfix\r\n- [ ] Feature\r\n- [ ] Code style update (formatting, local variables)\r\n- [x] Refactoring (no functional changes, no api changes)\r\n- [ ] Build related changes\r\n- [ ] CI related changes\r\n- [ ] Documentation content changes\r\n- [ ] angular.io application / infrastructure changes\r\n- [ ] Other...

For example, `我的` consists of chinese characters as below;\r\n\r\n```ts\r\n@Component({\r\n  selector: 'my-app',\r\n  template: '<div>{{ 我的 }} </div>',\r\n})\r\nexport class AppComponent  {\r\n  // Chinese character\r\n  我的 = 'Angular';\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nIt throws template parsing error like the below;\r\n\r\n```\r\nTemplate parse errors:\r\nParser Error: Unexpected token Lexer Error: Unexpected character [我] at column 2 in expression [ 我的 ] at column 3 in [{{ 我的 }}] in ng:///AppModule/AppComponent.html@0:5 (\"<div>[ERROR ->]{{ 我的 }}</div>\"): ng:///AppModule/AppComponent.html@0:5\r\n```\r\n\r\nhttps://stackblitz.com/edit/angular-nu81kk?file=src/app/app.component.ts\r\n\r\n#### Causes\r\n\r\nThis is a problem at the scanning phase of the lexer.\r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/angular/angular/blob/8c76e78ec454b0b9c2d1fadb6c3d1d1202772ea5/packages/compiler/src/expression_parser/lexer.ts#L160\r\n\r\nThis line tries to judge that the character is the start of an _idenfiter_. In the above context, an identifier is `我的`. \r\nBut the scanner's `isIdentifierStart` method allows only characters like ASCII.\r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/angular/angular/blob/8c76e78ec454b0b9c2d1fadb6c3d1d1202772ea5/packages/compiler/src/expression_parser/lexer.ts#L334-L337\r\n\r\nAs a result, `我` is not recognized the start of the identifier and at last, the scanner throws an unexpected token error.\r\n\r\n#### Usecase\r\n\r\nIn the JavaScript context, `this.我的` is valid. Sometime non-English developers prefer using their own language in the code for readability.\r\n\r\n### Describe the solution you'd like\r\n\r\nTo solve this, Angular has to change the code around finding identifiers.\r\nFor only expression scope, I guess it is not too difficult.\r\n\r\n### Related issues\r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/angular/angular/issues/517 \r\n\r\nThis is a very old issue. Some issues have been closed due to duplication to that, but we may need to reset the discussion about this problem.\r\n\r\ncc/ @zackarychapple \r\n","Url":"https://github.com/angular/angular/issues/34003","RelatedDescription":"Open issue \"Allow non-ASCII characters in Template Expressions\" (#34003)"},{"Id":"527478264","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2019-11-23T00:32:10","Actor":"IgorMinar","Number":"34002","RawContent":null,"Title":"build: consolidate @angular-devkit/build-angular to the root package.json","State":"open","Body":"This allows us to update the version of the package in a single place for all tests.\r\n\r\nNotable exemption of this is aio which currently doesn't depend on anything installed in the root.\r\n\r\nI also added some additional cleanup changes - please review commit by commit.\r\n","Url":"https://github.com/angular/angular/pull/34002","RelatedDescription":"Open PR \"build: consolidate @angular-devkit/build-angular to the root package.json\" (#34002)"},{"Id":"527472428","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2019-11-23T00:06:02","Actor":"josephperrott","Number":"34001","RawContent":null,"Title":"build: update to bazel 1.1.0","State":"open","Body":"Updates to latest version of bazel, updating the package.json dependency\r\nand bumping the minimum expected version in the workspace.\r\n","Url":"https://github.com/angular/angular/pull/34001","RelatedDescription":"Open PR \"build: update to bazel 1.1.0\" (#34001)"},{"Id":"527402147","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2019-11-22T23:40:45","Actor":"IgorMinar","Number":"33994","RawContent":null,"Title":"ci: add JoostK to @angular/fw-compiler","State":"closed","Body":"also add Kara and AndrewK who are in the GH group but not in the file listing.\r\n","Url":"https://github.com/angular/angular/pull/33994","RelatedDescription":"Closed or merged PR \"ci: add JoostK to @angular/fw-compiler\" (#33994)"},{"Id":"527360175","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2019-11-22T23:31:01","Actor":"josephperrott","Number":"33992","RawContent":null,"Title":"build: make ng_module.bzl is_ivy_enabled function public","State":"closed","Body":"We need to make is_ivy_enabled public to allow the internal i18n\r\nbuild rule to rely on it rather than relying on compile_strategy.\r\nAfter we move the internal i18n rule to rely on is_ivy_enabled,\r\ncompile_strategy can then be removed.","Url":"https://github.com/angular/angular/pull/33992","RelatedDescription":"Closed or merged PR \"build: make ng_module.bzl is_ivy_enabled function public\" (#33992)"},{"Id":"527460999","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2019-11-22T23:23:19","Actor":"matsko","Number":"34000","RawContent":null,"Title":"refactor(ivy): remove merge mode in favor of direct-mode styling","State":"open","Body":"","Url":"https://github.com/angular/angular/pull/34000","RelatedDescription":"Open PR \"refactor(ivy): remove merge mode in favor of direct-mode styling\" (#34000)"},{"Id":"527455791","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2019-11-22T23:04:41","Actor":"josephperrott","Number":"33999","RawContent":null,"Title":"build: remove compile_strategy from ng_module.bzl","State":"open","Body":"With the migration of internal i18n rule to use is_ivy_enabled complete, we\r\ncan remove compile_strategy as it is now unused.","Url":"https://github.com/angular/angular/pull/33999","RelatedDescription":"Open PR \"build: remove compile_strategy from ng_module.bzl\" (#33999)"},{"Id":"527355263","IsPullRequest":false,"CreatedAt":"2019-11-22T22:41:26","Actor":"LurchUSA","Number":"33991","RawContent":null,"Title":"Export of name 'ngForm' not found!","State":"closed","Body":"I am attempting to set up a basic login form.

I'm a developer working on a webpack application that uses core-js to provide polyfills and my application is one that other sites can embed in their application.\r\n\r\nThe core-js polyfill does some checks to determine if the system has a spec compliant Promise and if not, it will use its own setting it in the global scope. The ZoneAwarePromise does not pass the core-js checks and as a result gets overridden by core-js with the result being that the Angular application stops functioning.\r\n\r\nMost of the initial responses to this problem is that you should load the core-js application first but in our case that is not an option since we're an external application that is loaded later as an asynchronous embedding.\r\n\r\nThere was an issue file for exactly this in the zone.js repo: https://github.com/angular/zone.js/issues/783 so I'm basically recreating that issue here. That issue was just closed without any actual resolution and then the whole repo was archived when it was merged here.\r\n\r\nThere was a similar question posed in core-js: https://github.com/zloirock/core-js/issues/319 that offers a suggestion for what seems like a simple change that can be made to ZoneAwarePromise that would make it compliant enough to pass the core-js checks.\r\n\r\nThe project that we were causing trouble for was using Angular 7.2.15.\r\n\r\n### Describe the solution you'd like\r\nhttps://github.com/zloirock/core-js/issues/319#issuecomment-317036136\r\n\r\n### Describe alternatives you've considered\r\nIn our webpack application, the solution was to not import the polyfill as part of the webpack configuration but to only do it conditionally if there is no Promise at all:\r\n\r\n```\r\nif (!window.Promise) {\r\n  require('core-js/modules/es.promise');\r\n}\r\n```","Url":"https://github.com/angular/angular/issues/33989","RelatedDescription":"Open issue \"Make ZoneAwarePromise spec compliant and compatible with core-js\" (#33989)"},{"Id":"527264827","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2019-11-22T15:33:55","Actor":"pkozlowski-opensource","Number":"33988","RawContent":null,"Title":"Get render parent is root view","State":"open","Body":"","Url":"https://github.com/angular/angular/pull/33988","RelatedDescription":"Open PR \"Get render parent is root view\" (#33988)"},{"Id":"527221177","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2019-11-22T14:14:38","Actor":"gkalpak","Number":"33987","RawContent":null,"Title":"ci: fix tracking and checking of payload size data","State":"open","Body":"This PR mainly addresses two issues:\r\n- Ensure that payload size data for angular.io is always uploaded/checked.\r\n- Remove unreliable info (change type) from uploaded payload size data.\r\n\r\nSee individual commits for details.\r\n\r\n##\r\nBTW, if we are concerned about recording lots of irrelevant data, we could still skip uploading/checking for code changes that could not have affected bundle sizes.

I needed to move this to run *after* the build when all the necessary file size information is known. The first commit refactors the size computations without any significant changes to the output.\r\n* Files listed as `lazy: true` or `inject: false` in the app dev's `angular.json` file were included in the `initial` bundle, even though these resources must be loaded asynchronously. The second commit filters out files which were marked asynchronous from the `initial` bundle.\r\n* Differential builds were included in the same size, so the `main` size was including both the ES2015 **and** ES5 sizes together, which isn't what the user would want. The third commit updates the relevant budgets to output two sizes, one for each differential build, rather than including them together.\r\n\r\nI made separate commits performing each of these steps individually to make the logic a little easier to follow and understand.","Url":"https://github.com/angular/angular-cli/pull/16268","RelatedDescription":"Open PR \"fix(@angular-devkit/build-angular): fix budget checks\" (#16268)"},{"Id":"527401200","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2019-11-22T21:36:32","Actor":"gregmagolan","Number":"16267","RawContent":null,"Title":"refactor(@angular-devkit/build-angular): allow @angular/core version 0.0.0","State":"closed","Body":"Allow version \"0.0.0\" for integration testing in the angular/angular repository with the generated development @angular/core npm package which is versioned \"0.0.0\".\r\n\r\nThis is a pre-req for https://github.com/angular/angular/pull/33927 which runs integration tests against the bazel generated npm packages.\r\n\r\nTo green up that PR I have a patch that does the same thing https://github.com/angular/angular/pull/33927/files#diff-817b74474f8a65162b6115d04a6f43c7 which will get removed once this change makes it in to the next release","Url":"https://github.com/angular/angular-cli/pull/16267","RelatedDescription":"Closed or merged PR \"refactor(@angular-devkit/build-angular): allow @angular/core version 0.0.0\" (#16267)"},{"Id":"527388264","IsPullRequest":false,"CreatedAt":"2019-11-22T20:00:19","Actor":"mucbits","Number":"16266","RawContent":null,"Title":"Live Reload not working with --basehref","State":"open","Body":"# 🐞 Bug report\r\n\r\n### Command (mark with an `x`)\r\n\r\n- [ ] new\r\n- [ ] build\r\n- [x] serve\r\n- [ ] test\r\n- [ ] e2e\r\n- [ ] generate\r\n- [ ] add\r\n- [ ] update\r\n- [ ] lint\r\n- [ ] xi18n\r\n- [ ] run\r\n- [ ] config\r\n- [ ] help\r\n- [ ] version\r\n- [ ] doc\r\n\r\n\r\n### Is this a regression?\r\n\r\nYes, the previous version in which this bug was not present was: 0.803.13\r\n\r\n\r\n### Description\r\nLive Reload stopped working after this change:\r\nhttps://github.com/angular/angular-cli/commit/5260bbb9a3d17aefb90bcf1b660e252996cf68df#diff-6c0b312b8bd33db747e50549a66f7ab1\r\n\r\n`https://localhost:xxxx/admin/sockjs-node/info` returns 404\r\n\r\nwhile `https://localhost:xxxx/admin/admin/sockjs-node/info` exists.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n## 🔬 Minimal Reproduction\r\nng serve app --base-href /admin/  --deploy-url /admin/\r\n\r\n## 🔥 Exception or Error\r\n`https://localhost:xxxx/admin/sockjs-node/info` returns 404\r\n\r\n","Url":"https://github.com/angular/angular-cli/issues/16266","RelatedDescription":"Open issue \"Live Reload not working with --basehref\" (#16266)"},{"Id":"527123128","IsPullRequest":false,"CreatedAt":"2019-11-22T11:53:56","Actor":"Dok11","Number":"16265","RawContent":null,"Title":"SessionNotCreatedError: session not created: This version of ChromeDriver only supports Chrome version 76","State":"closed","Body":"<!--🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅\r\n\r\nOh hi there! 😄\r\n\r\nTo expedite issue processing please search open and closed issues before submitting a new one.\r\nExisting issues often contain information about workarounds, resolution, or progress updates.\r\n\r\n🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅-->\r\n\r\n\r\n# 🐞 Bug report\r\n\r\n### Command (mark with an `x`)\r\n<!-- Can you pin-point the command or commands that are effected by this bug? -->\r\n<!-- ✍️edit: -->\r\n\r\n- [x] e2e\r\n\r\n\r\n### Description\r\n\r\nCommand `npm run e2e` doesnt work and throw error into a terminal.\r\nGoogle Chrome showing for a split second and close immediately.

Sorry for the long list this time!\n\n-   `web_package` rule has been renamed to `pkg_web` and is now a public API\n\nUpdate your load statements from\n\n```python\nload(\"@&#8203;build_bazel_rules_nodejs//internal/web_package:web_package.bzl\", \"web_package\")\n```\n\nto\n\n```python\nload(\"@&#8203;build_bazel_rules_nodejs//:index.bzl\", \"pkg_web\")\n```\n\n-   `ts_devserver` and `pkg_web` (previously `web_package`) no longer have an `index_html` attribute.\n\nThey expect an index.html file to be among the assets, and to already\nhave the script and link tags needed for the app to work.\n\nThe feature where those tags were injected into the html dynamically has\nbeen moved to its own rule, inject_html.\n\nWe are in a transition state where the `inject_html` rule is not published, because we want this to be a plain npm package and not Bazel-specific. We will publish this functionality soon. If you depend on it, you may want to delay this upgrade.\n\n-   internal/rollup_bundle rule is removed. see <https://github.com/bazelbuild/rules_nodejs/wiki> for migration instructions\n\n-   Removed the expand_location_into_runfiles helper from //internal:node.bzl\n    Load it from //internal/common:expand_into_runfiles instead\n\n-   npm karma deps for karma_web_test and karma_web_suite are now peer deps so that the versions used can be chosen by the user.\n\nThis PR also removes the built-in  `@io_bazel_rules_webtesting//browsers/sauce:chrome-win10` saucelabs support. It is not very useful as it only tests a single browser and it difficult to use. In the angular repo, saucelabs support was implemented with a custom karma config using karma_web_test. This is the recommended approach.\n\n-   `--define=DEBUG=1` is no longer functional to request debugging outputs. Use `-c dbg` instead (this matches Bazel's behavior for C++).\n\n-   We renamed some of the generated targets in the `@nodejs//` workspace:\n\n`bazel run @&#8203;nodejs//:npm` is replaced with `bazel run @&#8203;nodejs//:npm_node_repositories` and `bazel run @&#8203;nodejs//:yarn` is replaced with `bazel run @&#8203;nodejs//:yarn_node_repositories`. `@nodejs//:yarn` and `@nodejs//:npm` now run yarn & npm in the current working directory instead of on all of the `package.json` files in `node_repositories()`.\n\n`@nodejs//:bin/node` & `@nodejs//:bin/node.cmd` (on Windows) are no longer valid targets. Use `@nodejs//:node` instead on all platforms. You can still call the old targets in their platform specific node repositories such as `@nodejs_darwin_amd64//:bin/node`.\n\n`@nodejs//:bin/yarn` & `@nodejs//:bin/yarn.cmd` (on Windows) are no longer valid targets. Use `@nodejs//:yarn` instead on all platforms. You can still call the old targets in their platform specific node repositories such as `@nodejs_darwin_amd64//:bin/yarn`.\n\n`@nodejs//:bin/npm` & `@nodejs//:bin/npm.cmd` (on Windows) are no longer valid targets. Use `@nodejs//:npm` instead on all platforms. You can still call the old targets in their platform specific node repositories such as `@nodejs_darwin_amd64//:bin/npm`.\n\n##### Bug Fixes\n\n-   **builtin:** allow .tsx entry_point in node binary/test ([313d484](https://togithub.com/bazelbuild/rules_nodejs/commit/313d484)), closes [#&#8203;1351](https://togithub.com/bazelbuild/rules_nodejs/issues/1351)\n-   **terser:** call terser binary instead of uglifyjs ([#&#8203;1360](https://togithub.com/bazelbuild/rules_nodejs/issues/1360)) ([a100420](https://togithub.com/bazelbuild/rules_nodejs/commit/a100420))\n-   **terser:** remove ngDevMode & ngI18nClosureMode global_defs from default terser config ([98c8dbc](https://togithub.com/bazelbuild/rules_nodejs/commit/98c8dbc))\n\n##### chore\n\n-   remove deprecated re-export file ([148bf8a](https://togithub.com/bazelbuild/rules_nodejs/commit/148bf8a))\n-   remove old rollup_bundle ([9a824ac](https://togithub.com/bazelbuild/rules_nodejs/commit/9a824ac)), closes [#&#8203;740](https://togithub.com/bazelbuild/rules_nodejs/issues/740)\n\n##### Code Refactoring\n\n-   move injector feature to own rule ([be06d23](https://togithub.com/bazelbuild/rules_nodejs/commit/be06d23))\n\n##### Features\n\n-   node-patches\\\\filesystem patcher.

compilation time comparable with the previous version\r\nDate: 2019-11-19T20:25:10.213Z - Hash: fbbc4140d56be9279818 - Time: 147941ms\r\n\r\nAlso visually the compilation of the es2015 build finishes, the files as generated in about 2 minutes, then it sits in `Generating ES5 bundles for differential loading...` for about to 40 minutes.\r\nI don't think it's a node memory related problem since the process that takes 40 minutes uses about 100MB of ram\r\n\r\n## 🔬 Minimal Reproduction\r\n<!--\r\nSimple steps to reproduce this bug.\r\n\r\nPlease include: commands run (including args), packages

7\r\n\r\n### Description\r\n\r\nWe are using a custom typescript transformer which is replacing provider tokens in component decorators to enable custom implementations of services depending on the build configuration.\r\n\r\nExample:\r\n```typescript\r\n@Component({\r\n    selector: 'booking-editor',\r\n    template: '...',\r\n    providers: [\r\n        BookingUiService\r\n    ]\r\n})\r\nexport class BookingEditorComponent {\r\n  constrcutor(uiService: BookingUiService){}\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nwhich will be transformed to the following:\r\n```typescript\r\n@Component({\r\n    selector: 'booking-editor',\r\n    template: '...',\r\n    providers: [\r\n      { provide: BookingUiService, useClass: CustomBookingUiService }\r\n    ]\r\n})\r\nexport class BookingEditorComponent {\r\n  constrcutor(uiService: BookingUiService){}\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nThis custom transformer we add to the beginning of `_transformers` array of the `AngularCompilerPlugin`.\r\n\r\nUntil the upgrade from Angular 7 to Angular 8, this worked like a charm but now on runtime, the custom implementation is not present, both JIT and AOT.\r\n\r\nIf i dump the modified `ts.SourceFile`, i can see the applied change as well as another already applied change, the `importFactory` transformer adds `export { ɵ0 };` to the sourceFile, even if i add the custom transformer to the beginning of the `_transformers` list?\r\n\r\n## 🌍 Your Environment\r\n<pre><code>\r\n     _                      _                 ____ _     ___ \r\n    / \\   _ __   __ _ _   _| | __ _ _ __     / ___| |   |_ _|\r\n

I understand right now the recomended way to extend cli is to write schematics to create some custom generate command. Or even override existing ones like some of the cli are doing it.\r\n2. You are also able to use `builder API` to really change behavior or create new for the existing commands (build, serve, test,..)\r\n3. if I want to extends existing build process, then I can extends `browser build` `export default createBuilder` where I can call existinb fn `buildWebpackBrowser as executeBrowserBuilder`, and then do some my own logic\r\n\r\n- But what I am strugling with or I dont see a solution, how do I easily extend and alter building process of existing application that might already be using some builder API. \r\n\r\nCurrent solution does not scale, as you can extend `builder API` and replace application's configuration for your builder, but this would not work if they are already using some custom builder API. So replace is not really an option. \r\n\r\nWhat you need some Injection points, to be able to register your tasks before, after each task. I know ngx-build-plus is trying to do something similar, but again if we use ngx-build-plus and project has already some builder it will not work. \r\n\r\nLike Maven, Gradle,....\r\n\r\nAny pointers ?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n### Describe the solution you'd like\r\n<!-- ✍️--> If you have a solution in mind, please describe it.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Describe alternatives you've considered\r\n<!-- ✍️--> Have you considered any alternative solutions or workarounds?\r\n","Url":"https://github.com/angular/angular-cli/issues/16247","RelatedDescription":"Open issue \"Support for CLI extension\" (#16247)"},{"Id":"526476681","IsPullRequest":false,"CreatedAt":"2019-11-21T09:44:03","Actor":"ssmartin","Number":"16246","RawContent":null,"Title":"File / class deleted during tree shake despite the fact is being used","State":"open","Body":"### Is this a regression?\r\n\r\n<!-- Did this behavior use to work in the previous version? -->\r\n<!-- ✍️--> Yes, the previous version in which this bug was not present was: .Angular 7\r\n\r\n\r\n### Description\r\n\r\n\r\nI have a service / configuration  that we provide dynamically based on decorator. \r\n\r\nLooks like this: \r\n```\r\n@Injectable()\r\n@Configuration({ deps: [] })\r\nexport class VehiclePickerConfiguration extends NewPickerConfiguration {\r\n\r\n    constructor() {\r\n        super(VEHICLE_CONFIG);\r\n    }\r\n}\r\n\r\n```\r\n\r\nBasically we register (add to a static map) this configuration / service metadata (and many others) by using our custom annotation / decorator. Later on, this configuration / service is provided on the fly using the following code: \r\n\r\n```\r\n injectorProviders = injectorProviders.concat({ provide: metaData.constructor, useClass: metaData.constructor, deps: metaData.deps });\r\n        this.createInjector(injectorProviders);\r\n```\r\n\r\nThen this VehicleConfigurationis is requested / used in two other different files / classes like this: \r\n\r\n`let configuration: VehiclePickerConfiguration = this.getPickerConfiguration<VehiclePickerConfiguration>(FieldContainers.RentContract.RentContract_booking_vehiclePriceList_vehicle); \r\n`\r\n\r\nLong story short, we have some generic code to provide these services / configurations on the fly and this worked very well until Angular 8. \r\nBut since Angular 8 the whole file (_vehicle.configuration_) where this configuration is written is basically tree shake (deleted) during compile time and this gives us extra headaches and causing bus in our application. \r\n\r\nIF i provide this _VehicleConfiguration_ manually anywhere in the app then the file is not deleted anymore, but this in our case defeats the purpose of providing and creating the instances of these services ONLY when they are needed.  \r\n\r\n\r\n## 🔥 Exception or Error\r\nThe file is deleted most probably during the tree shake process even if it's used (imported and referenced in two other files / classess) and due to this we will have unexpected results (the vehicle configuration is not created and we get and undefined exception)\r\n\r\n## 🌍 Your Environment\r\n<pre><code>\r\n\r\nAngular CLI: 8.3.17\r\nNode: 10.15.3\r\nOS: win32 x64\r\nAngular: 8.2.13\r\n...
