The problem is that all attributes seem to be deserialized as strings into the property of an Angular Elements. This means that people can't declaratively set a property on an Angular Element if it has any of the following type:\r\n- boolean\r\n- number\r\n- object\r\n- array\r\n\r\nI feel like those attributes should be automatically deserialized to the proper type\r\n\r\n\r\nFurthermore the boolean attributes presence don't follow the HTML specs in the sense that setting a boolean attribute on an angular element like this:\r\n```\r\n<my-comp is-beautiful></my-comp>\r\n```\r\nwill see the `isBeautiful` property be evaluated to false, when it should be true. Setting a value to it (`is-beautiful=\"true\"`) makes it truthy but also a string. This part of the issue is likely related to https://github.com/angular/angular/issues/14761 (but arguably angular elements are talking to the outside world and should follow HTML spec as opposed to angular components)\r\n\r\n## üî¨ Minimal Reproduction\r\n\r\nstackblitz exposing an element with various attributes types and how setting them impact the value/type of the property of the angular component\r\n\r\nhttps://stackblitz.com/edit/angular7-elements-attributes-types?file=src%2Findex.html\r\n\r\n## üåç  Your Environment\r\n\r\n**Angular Version:**\r\n<pre><code>\r\nAngular CLI: 7.3.7\r\nNode: 10.11.0\r\nOS: darwin x64\r\nAngular: 7.2.11\r\n... common, compiler, compiler-cli, core, elements, forms, http\r\n... language-service, platform-browser, platform-browser-dynamic\r\n... router\r\n\r\nPackage                            Version\r\n------------------------------------------------------------\r\n@angular-devkit/architect          0.10.7\r\n@angular-devkit/build-angular      0.10.7\r\n@angular-devkit/build-ng-packagr   0.13.7\r\n@angular-devkit/build-optimizer    0.10.7\r\n@angular-devkit/build-webpack      0.10.7\r\n@angular-devkit/core               7.0.7\r\n@angular-devkit/schematics         7.3.7\r\n@angular/cli                       7.3.7\r\n@ngtools/webpack                   7.0.7\r\n@schematics/angular                7.3.7\r\n@schematics/update                 0.13.7\r\nrxjs                               6.4.0\r\ntypescript                         3.1.6\r\nwebpack                            4.29.6\r\n</code></pre>\r\n\r\n**Anything else relevant?**\r\n\r\nI can see the object and array (complex) types being controversial and arguably not allowing to auto deserialize those, even though it would be a nice feature.

Should angular at least try to cast \"primitive\" types (number/boolean)?\r\n","Url":"https://github.com/angular/angular/issues/29716","RelatedDescription":"Open issue \"Angular Elements attributes always deserialize to strings\" (#29716)"},{"Id":"429421953","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2019-04-04T18:29:13","Actor":"jenniferfell","Number":"29714","RawContent":null,"Title":"docs: update release info to be current today wrto release schedule and examples","State":"open","Body":"## PR Checklist\r\nPlease check if your PR fulfills the following requirements:\r\n\r\n- [x] The commit message follows our guidelines: https://github.com/angular/angular/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md#commit\r\n- [ ] Tests for the changes have been added (for bug fixes / features)\r\n- [X] Docs have been added / updated (for bug fixes / features)\r\n\r\n\r\n## PR Type\r\nWhat kind of change does this PR introduce?\r\n\r\n<!-- Please check the one that applies to this PR using \"x\". -->\r\n\r\n- [ ] Bugfix\r\n- [ ] Feature\r\n- [ ] Code style update (formatting, local variables)\r\n- [ ] Refactoring (no functional changes, no api changes)\r\n- [ ] Build related changes\r\n- [ ] CI related changes\r\n- [X] Documentation content changes\r\n- [ ] angular.io application / infrastructure changes\r\n- [ ] Other...

This in and of itself, is not the concern. The issue is that, in this particular context, AOT and JIT behave similarly but differ without compiler warnings or errors in one particular case.\r\n\r\nIf I define a function on a route's `data` field, it will appear with JIT on `ActivatedRoute.snapshot.firstChild.data`. However, with AOT, it silently drops this field. No compiler error, no compiler warning. This seems to go against the precedent that has been set, wherein both AOT and JIT give compiler errors if you attempt to build with lambda expressions or non exported functions.\r\n\r\nSee example code below.\r\n\r\n## üî¨ Minimal Reproduction\r\n<!--\r\nSimple steps to reproduce this bug.\r\n\r\nPlease include: commands run (including args), packages added, related code changes.\r\n\r\nIf reproduction steps are not enough for reproduction of your issue, please create a minimal GitHub repository with the reproduction of the issue. \r\nA good way to make a minimal reproduction is to create a new app via `ng new repro-app` and add the minimum possible code to show the problem. \r\nShare the link to the repo below along with step-by-step instructions to reproduce the problem, as well as expected and actual behavior.\r\n\r\nIssues that don't have enough info and can't be reproduced will be closed.\r\n\r\nYou can read more about issue submission guidelines here: https://github.com/angular/angular-cli/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md#-submitting-an-issue\r\n-->\r\n\r\nServe commands with arguments I used.\r\n \r\n```\r\nng serve -c=debug\r\nng serve -c=debug --aot\r\n```\r\n\r\nExample Route\r\n\r\n```\r\n  {\r\n    path: 'someroute',\r\n    component: SomeComponent,\r\n    pathMatch: 'full',\r\n    data: {\r\n      pageTitle: 'Some | Title',\r\n      doesShowUpWithAOT: doesShowUpWithAOT,\r\n      // throwsCompileErrorWithAndWithoutAOT: throwsCompileErrorWithAndWithoutAOT, this behaves as expected\r\n      doesNotShowUpWithAOTAndDoesNotThrowCompilerError() { // behaves inconsistently between JIT and AOT\r\n        console.log('foo');\r\n      },\r\n      // alsoThrowsCompilerErrorWithAndWithoutAOT: () => console.log('foo') this behaves as expected\r\n    }\r\n```\r\n\r\n```\r\n// code from within some class\r\nconstructor(private _route: ActivatedRoute, private _router: Router) {\r\n   this._router.events\r\n      .subcribe(event => {\r\n         if(event instanceof NavigationEnd) {\r\n               const data = this._route.snapshot.firstChild.data;\r\n               const functionMember = data['doesNotShowUpWithAOTAndDoesNotThrowCompilerError']; // is null with AOT, properly defined with JIT\r\n         }\r\n      })\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nI would argue, for the sake of consistency and explicitness, that both AOT and JIT should throw compiler errors, instead of the function making it through in JIT, and dropping away silently in AOT. I believe this would save development time by cutting down on debugging.\r\n\r\nOf course, I am always open to an explanation.\r\n\r\nThanks!\r\n\r\n## üî• Exception or Error\r\n<pre><code>\r\n<!-- If the issue is accompanied by an exception or an error, please share it below: -->\r\n<!-- ‚úçÔ∏è-->\r\nIn this particular case, there is none, which what I contend the bad behavior (bug) is.\r\n</code></pre>\r\n\r\n\r\n## üåç Your Environment\r\nOS: Windows 10 Enterprise, 64-bit\r\n<pre><code>\r\n<!-- run `ng version` and paste output below -->\r\n<!-- ‚úçÔ∏è-->\r\n@angular-devkit/architect         0.12.1\r\n@angular-devkit/build-angular     0.12.1\r\n@angular-devkit/build-optimizer   0.12.1\r\n@angular-devkit/build-webpack     0.12.1\r\n@angular-devkit/core              7.2.1\r\n@angular-devkit/schematics        7.2.1\r\n@angular/cli                      7.2.1\r\n@ngtools/webpack                  7.2.1\r\n@schematics/angular               7.2.1\r\n@schematics/update                0.12.1\r\nrxjs                              6.3.3\r\ntypescript                        3.2.2\r\nwebpack                           4.23.1\r\n</code></pre>\r\n\r\n**Anything else relevant?**\r\n<!-- ‚úçÔ∏èIs this a browser specific issue?

After the initial load finished, I took the snapshots.\r\n\r\nComparing the two heap sizes, the heap size difference between v6 and v7 is always the difference of (string) constants in memory.\r\n\r\nDid anyone notice the same behavior already? Is it something renderer or compiler specific? I don't know, how to isolate the problem.\r\n\r\n## üî¨ Minimal Reproduction\r\n<!--\r\nPlease create and share minimal reproduction of the issue starting with this template: https://stackblitz.com/fork/angular-issue-repro2\r\n-->\r\n<!-- ‚úçÔ∏è https://stackblitz.com/...-->\r\n\r\n<!--\r\nIf StackBlitz is not suitable for reproduction of your issue, please create a minimal GitHub repository with the reproduction of the issue.

Removing this import makes lazy loading implemented correctly, but the error which is being thrown during the import is not correct at all. Similar topics:\r\n\r\n- [#9488](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli/issues/9488) (it's [answer](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli/issues/9488#issuecomment-374037802) helps, but [comment just from 27 days ago](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli/issues/9488#issuecomment-470359455) clearly shows current error message is still confusing);\r\n- [#9825](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli/issues/9825) (not really address the problem, just the error message is the same);\r\n- [#23412](https://github.com/angular/angular/issues/23412) (it's [answer](https://github.com/angular/angular/issues/23412#issuecomment-422682849) helps);\r\n\r\n\r\n## üî¨ Minimal Reproduction\r\n\r\nStep 1. Generate a new component to lazy load, here it's `ng g c about-us`.\r\nStep 2. Create its module, here it's `about-us.module.ts`.\r\nStep 3. Add **RouterModule.forChild** in **about-us.module.ts**, sample code below:\r\n\r\n```\r\nimport { NgModule } from '@angular/core';\r\nimport { RouterModule } from '@angular/router';\r\nimport { AboutUsComponent } from './about-us/about-us.component';\r\n\r\n@NgModule({\r\n  declarations: [AboutUsComponent],\r\n  imports: [RouterModule.forChild([{ path: '', component: AboutUsComponent }])]\r\n})\r\nexport class AboutUsModule {}\r\n```\r\n\r\nStep 4. Add **AboutUsModule** (FeatureModule) to **AppModule**,  **AboutUsModule** we want to lazy load, like that (code for **app.module.ts**):\r\n\r\n**AboutUsModule**.\r\n```\r\nimport { AppComponent } from './app.component';\r\nimport { BrowserModule } from '@angular/platform-browser';\r\nimport { BrowserAnimationsModule } from '@angular/platform-browser/animations';\r\nimport { NgModule } from '@angular/core';\r\nimport { AboutUsModule } from '@app/about-us';\r\n\r\n@NgModule({\r\n  declarations: [AppComponent],\r\n  imports: [\r\n    BrowserModule,\r\n    BrowserAnimationsModule,\r\n    AboutUsModule\r\n  ],\r\n  bootstrap: [AppComponent]\r\n})\r\nexport class AppModule {}\r\n```\r\n\r\nStep 5. Create **app-routing.module.ts** to define paths, for **about-us** it would be like that:\r\n\r\n```\r\nimport { NgModule } from '@angular/core';\r\nimport { Routes, RouterModule } from '@angular/router';\r\n\r\nconst routes: Routes = [\r\n  {\r\n    path: 'about-us',\r\n    loadChildren: '@ditectrev-libs/about-us/src/lib/about-us.module#AboutUsModule'\r\n  }\r\n];\r\n\r\n@NgModule({\r\n  imports: [RouterModule.forRoot(routes)],\r\n  exports: [RouterModule]\r\n})\r\nexport class RoutingModule {}\r\n```\r\n\r\nStep 6. Add **<router-outlet>** to **app.component.html**, below:\r\n\r\n`<router-outlet></router-outlet>`\r\n\r\nStep 7. Run **ng serve**, and navigate to **localhost:4200/about-us**, you should see an error like in **Exception or Error** section below.\r\n\r\n## üî• Exception or Error\r\n\r\n```\r\ncore.js:15713 ERROR Error: Uncaught (in promise): TypeError: undefined is not a function\r\nTypeError: undefined is not a function\r\n```\r\n\r\n\r\n## üåç Your Environment\r\n<pre><code>\r\nAngular CLI: 7.2.4\r\nNode: 10.15.0\r\nOS: win32 x64\r\nAngular: 7.2.4\r\n... animations, cli, common, compiler, compiler-cli, core, forms\r\n... language-service, platform-browser, platform-browser-dynamic\r\n... router\r\n\r\nPackage                           Version\r\n-----------------------------------------------------------\r\n@angular-devkit/architect         0.13.1\r\n@angular-devkit/build-angular     0.13.1\r\n@angular-devkit/build-optimizer   0.13.1\r\n@angular-devkit/build-webpack     0.13.1\r\n@angular-devkit/core              7.3.1\r\n@angular-devkit/schematics        7.2.4\r\n@angular/cdk                      7.3.2\r\n@angular/flex-layout              7.0.0-beta.23\r\n@angular/material                 7.3.2\r\n@ngtools/webpack                  7.3.1\r\n@schematics/angular               7.2.4\r\n@schematics/update                0.12.4\r\nrxjs                              6.3.3\r\ntypescript                        3.2.4\r\nwebpack                           4.29.0\r\n</code></pre>\r\n\r\n## Describe the solution you'd like to have\r\n\r\nThrow an error something like \"AboutUsModule is incorrectly imported into AppModule, because it supposed to be lazy loaded.\"\r\n","Url":"https://github.com/angular/angular-cli/issues/14065","RelatedDescription":"Open issue \"Improve semantics of error message for incorrectly imported lazy loaded FeatureModule in AppModule\" (#14065)"}],"ResultType":"GitHubIssue"},"material2-Issues":{"Issues":[{"Id":"429952806","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2019-04-05T22:09:56","Actor":"jelbourn","Number":"15740","RawContent":null,"Title":"chore: add release name for 8.0.0-beta.0","State":"closed","Body":"","Url":"https://github.com/angular/material2/pull/15740","RelatedDescription":"Closed or merged PR \"chore: add release name for 8.0.0-beta.0\" (#15740)"},{"Id":"429943250","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2019-04-05T21:57:07","Actor":"jelbourn","Number":"15739","RawContent":null,"Title":"chore: bump version to 8.0.0-beta.0 w/ changelog","State":"closed","Body":"","Url":"https://github.com/angular/material2/pull/15739","RelatedDescription":"Closed or merged PR \"chore: bump version to 8.0.0-beta.0 w/ changelog\" (#15739)"},{"Id":"429103294","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2019-04-05T21:03:28","Actor":"RudarDaman","Number":"15711","RawContent":null,"Title":"fix: missing tag in footer-row of material table","State":"closed","Body":"Add the closing tag in footer row of the material table.

So what I'm asking is can I do inter component drag and drop.\r\n\r\n#### What is the current behavior?\r\n\r\n\r\n#### What are the steps to reproduce?\r\n\r\n\r\n#### What is the use-case or motivation for changing an existing behavior?\r\n\r\n\r\n#### Which versions of Angular, Material, OS, TypeScript, browsers are affected?\r\nAngular 7.2\r\nMaterial 7.2\r\nTypeScript 3.3\r\n\r\n#### Is there anything else we should know?\r\n","Url":"https://github.com/angular/material2/issues/15717","RelatedDescription":"Open issue \"Drag and Drop. multiple dynamic lists\" (#15717)"},{"Id":"429206039","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2019-04-04T10:39:05","Actor":"vadjs","Number":"15716","RawContent":null,"Title":"feat(mat-sort): add exact sorting function","State":"open","Body":"Allows to sort by exact value.\r\n\r\ncloses #15714","Url":"https://github.com/angular/material2/pull/15716","RelatedDescription":"Open PR \"feat(mat-sort): add exact sorting function\" (#15716)"},{"Id":"429172768","IsPullRequest":false,"CreatedAt":"2019-04-04T09:26:17","Actor":"vadjs","Number":"15715","RawContent":null,"Title":"[MatSort] sort function doesn't render sorting arrow","State":"open","Body":"#### What is the expected behavior?\r\n`sort` function in `MatSort` should update sorting arrow rendering state.\r\n\r\n#### What is the current behavior?\r\nCurrently `sort` function in `MatSort` not updating sorting arrow rendering state.\r\n\r\n#### What are the steps to reproduce?\r\nhttps://stackblitz.com/edit/angular-cfcugl-17fxat\r\nIf you click \"sort by name\" button you will see this bug.\r\n\"Sort with fix\" button shows the easiest way to fix this bug.\r\n\r\n#### Which versions of Angular, Material, OS, TypeScript, browsers are affected?\r\nAll\r\n\r\n#### Is there anything else we should know?\r\n","Url":"https://github.com/angular/material2/issues/15715","RelatedDescription":"Open issue \"[MatSort] sort function doesn't render sorting arrow\" (#15715)"},{"Id":"429154766","IsPullRequest":false,"CreatedAt":"2019-04-04T08:47:19","Actor":"vadjs","Number":"15714","RawContent":null,"Title":"[MatSort] sort function bug","State":"open","Body":"#### What is the expected behavior?\r\nSorting by `sort` function with same value as argument must have same result every time.\r\n\r\n#### What is the current behavior?\r\nIf you will call `sort function several times with same value you will get different results.\r\n\r\n#### What are the steps to reproduce?\r\nExample: `.sort({id: 'name', start: 'asc', disableClear: undefined})` first time you will get `'asc'` sorting, second time will be `'desc'`, third time will be `''`.\r\nLive example: https://stackblitz.com/edit/angular-cfcugl\r\n\r\n#### Which versions of Angular, Material, OS, TypeScript, browsers are affected?\r\nAll\r\n\r\n#### Is there anything else we should know?\r\nEdit: looks lie it's not a bug, it's expected behavior.\r\nCurrent `sort` function code contains these conditions:\r\n```\r\nif (this.active != sortable.id) {\r\n  this.active = sortable.id;\r\n  this.direction = sortable.start ? sortable.start : this.start;\r\n} else {\r\n  this.direction = this.getNextSortDirection(sortable);\r\n}\r\n```\r\nThe problem of this behavior that here are no way to set sort value to exactly needed value.","Url":"https://github.com/angular/material2/issues/15714","RelatedDescription":"Open issue \"[MatSort] sort function bug\" (#15714)"},{"Id":"429144703","IsPullRequest":false,"CreatedAt":"2019-04-04T08:24:06","Actor":"bennyboer","Number":"15713","RawContent":null,"Title":"Progress bar/spinner animations with NoopAnimationsModule","State":"open","Body":"#### What is the expected behavior?\r\nI expect progress bar and spinner animations to still work even when the `NoopAnimationsModule` is imported.\r\n\r\n#### What is the current behavior?\r\nAnimations are commonly disabled using the `NoopAnimationsModule` in order to gain additional performance especially on mobile devices.
