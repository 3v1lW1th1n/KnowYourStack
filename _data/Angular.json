I'll explain with an example. \r\n \r\nLet's say I have an Tab Component which contains a basic **\"two tab\"** **mat-tab-nav-bar**.\r\nAlso,  I have two other components which contain my real page contents.\r\n\r\nIn this case, my router configuration would be something like so\r\n```typescript\r\n      {\r\n        path: 'identity',\r\n        component: TabsComponent\r\n        children: [\r\n          {\r\n            path: 'tab1',\r\n            component: Tab1Component\r\n          },\r\n          {\r\n            path: 'tab2',\r\n            component: Tab2Component\r\n          }\r\n        ]\r\n      }\r\n```\r\n\r\nMy TabsComponent has an **@ContentChildren** query with descendants option true.\r\n\r\nTabsComponents template looks like this.\r\n```html\r\n<mat-toolbar>\r\n <!--- actions varible has @ContentChildren('toolbar') decorator -->\r\n  <ng-container *ngTemplateOutlet=\"actions\"></ng-container>\r\n  <mat-toolbar-row>\r\n    <nav mat-tab-nav-bar color=\"accent\">\r\n      <a mat-tab-link routerLink=\"tab1\">Tab1</a>\r\n      <a mat-tab-link routerLink=\"tab2\">Tab2</a>\r\n    </nav>\r\n  </mat-toolbar-row>\r\n</mat-toolbar>\r\n<router-outlet></router-outlet>\r\n```\r\nSo each tab component has an ng-template something like so\r\n```html\r\n<ng-template #toolbar>\r\n  <mat-toolbar-row>\r\n   Content will be projected to anchestor component\r\n  </mat-toolbar-row>\r\n</ng-template>\r\n```\r\n\r\n### Describe the solution you'd like\r\n\r\nContent projection should work as the current content projection works with descendant components.\r\n\r\n### Describe alternatives you've considered\r\n\r\nMy workaround.\r\n\r\nEach tab has an variable named as toolbar which has a @ViewChild('toolbar') decorator. So all tab pages takes their ng-template reference by theirselves.\r\n\r\nSo TabsComponents template looks like this.\r\n\r\n```html\r\n <ng-container *ngTemplateOutlet=\"outlet?.component?.toolbar\"></ng-container>\r\n...\r\n<router-outlet #outlet=\"outlet\"></router-outlet>\r\n```\r\n\r\n\r\nHint: Don't know whether this already solved by ivy.

In the `foo` project I'm importing things from `shared`, but these imports doesn't work when I run `npm run build:ssr && npm run serve:ssr`. All I get is:\r\n\r\n```\r\nprojects/foo/src/app/app.component.ts(3,34): error TS2307: Cannot find module 'shared'.\r\n```\r\n\r\nThis is strange to me since the library works great when just serving the `foo` project normally.\r\n\r\n## 🔬 Minimal Reproduction\r\n\r\nRepo found here: https://github.com/chrillewoodz/universal-library-repro\r\n\r\n```\r\n$ ng new workspace\r\n$ cd workspace\r\n$ ng generate application foo\r\n$ ng add @nguniversal/express-engine --clientProject foo\r\n$ ng generate library shared\r\n$ ng build shared\r\n```\r\n\r\nAdd `import {SharedService} from 'shared';` to `projects/foo/src/app/app.component.ts`.\r\n\r\nChange `package.json` line 14 to:\r\n\r\n`\"build:client-and-server-bundles\": \"ng build foo --prod && ng run foo:server:production\"`\r\n\r\nRun `npm run build:ssr && npm run serve:ssr`.\r\n\r\n## 🔥 Exception or Error\r\n<pre><code>\r\nERROR in projects/foo/src/app/app.component.ts(3,29): error TS2307: Cannot find module 'shared'.\r\n</code></pre>\r\n\r\n\r\n## 🌍 Your Environment\r\n<pre><code>\r\nAngular CLI: 7.0.7\r\nNode: 8.12.0\r\nOS: darwin x64\r\nAngular: 7.0.4\r\n... animations, common, compiler, compiler-cli, core, forms\r\n... http, language-service, platform-browser\r\n... platform-browser-dynamic, platform-server, router\r\n\r\nPackage                            Version\r\n------------------------------------------------------------\r\n@angular-devkit/architect          0.10.7\r\n@angular-devkit/build-angular      0.10.7\r\n@angular-devkit/build-ng-packagr   0.10.7\r\n@angular-devkit/build-optimizer    0.10.7\r\n@angular-devkit/build-webpack      0.10.7\r\n@angular-devkit/core               7.0.7\r\n@angular-devkit/schematics         7.0.7\r\n@angular/cli                       7.0.7\r\n@ngtools/json-schema               1.1.0\r\n@ngtools/webpack                   7.0.7\r\n@schematics/angular                7.0.7\r\n@schematics/update                 0.10.7\r\nng-packagr                         4.7.1\r\nrxjs                               6.3.3\r\ntypescript                         3.1.6\r\nwebpack                            4.19.1\r\n</code></pre>\r\n","Url":"https://github.com/angular/angular-cli/issues/14208","RelatedDescription":"Closed issue \"Cannot find module 'shared' when building a nested project that imports a shared library\" (#14208)"},{"Id":"434556071","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2019-04-18T01:54:19","Actor":"mgechev","Number":"14206","RawContent":null,"Title":"feat(@angular-devkit/build-angular): warn when target greater es2015","State":"open","Body":"When using differential loading with targets ES5 and ES2016+, the\r\nbrowser with ESM support will pick `script[type=\"module\"]` scripts even\r\nwithout supporting ES2016+ syntax.\r\n\r\nWe want to warn users in this case.","Url":"https://github.com/angular/angular-cli/pull/14206","RelatedDescription":"Open PR \"feat(@angular-devkit/build-angular): warn when target greater es2015\" (#14206)"},{"Id":"434175320","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2019-04-17T22:47:41","Actor":"cexbrayat","Number":"14201","RawContent":null,"Title":"docs(@schematics/angular): mention npx browserslist in browserslist","State":"closed","Body":"Running `npx browserslist` allows to see what browsers are actually selected with the configuration,\r\nwhich is very handy and not very known.","Url":"https://github.com/angular/angular-cli/pull/14201","RelatedDescription":"Closed or merged PR \"docs(@schematics/angular): mention npx browserslist in browserslist\" (#14201)"},{"Id":"434398136","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2019-04-17T20:40:59","Actor":"alexeagle","Number":"14205","RawContent":null,"Title":"build: Resolve ng generate aliases before logging analytics","State":"closed","Body":"","Url":"https://github.com/angular/angular-cli/pull/14205","RelatedDescription":"Closed or merged PR \"build: Resolve ng generate aliases before logging analytics\" (#14205)"},{"Id":"434394324","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2019-04-17T17:53:47","Actor":"alan-agius4","Number":"14203","RawContent":null,"Title":"refactor(@schematics/angular): create `relativePathToWorkspaceRoot` h…","State":"closed","Body":"…elper and replace usages","Url":"https://github.com/angular/angular-cli/pull/14203","RelatedDescription":"Closed or merged PR \"refactor(@schematics/angular): create `relativePathToWorkspaceRoot` h…\" (#14203)"},{"Id":"434397346","IsPullRequest":false,"CreatedAt":"2019-04-17T17:20:07","Actor":"FrozenPandaz","Number":"14204","RawContent":null,"Title":"feat: Rename angular.json to workspace.json","State":"open","Body":"# Rename angular.json to workspace.json\r\n\r\n## Description\r\n\r\nThe Angular CLI/ Angular Devkit is a generic tool which is extensible to do almost anything. Having the workspace information stored in `angular.json` is a misnomer as it is possible to have non-Angular projects and builders defined there. \r\n\r\n## Describe the solution you'd like\r\n\r\nWith the new Workspace API, storage of the workspace configuration is abstracted. It would be great to support a more agnostic config file such as `workspace.json` or `projects.json`. \r\n\r\nCurrently, folks can already build node apps or web-components apps in an Angular CLI workspace, but the naming of the configuration file deters folks from doing it.\r\n\r\nOne of the best things about the Angular community is how well we collaborate with other communities. Having the CLI to be more generic and used in those communities will reinforce this.\r\n\r\nThe `angular.json` file could be supported for backward compatibility. This would improve the experience for doing things outside of Angular within a workspace.\r\n\r\n## Describe alternatives you've considered\r\n\r\nAn alternative could be creating a separate CLI altogether such as the NestJS CLI but it would be great to have 1 agnostic CLI since the Angular CLI is capable of doing both.","Url":"https://github.com/angular/angular-cli/issues/14204","RelatedDescription":"Open issue \"feat: Rename angular.json to workspace.json\" (#14204)"},{"Id":"434154672","IsPullRequest":false,"CreatedAt":"2019-04-17T08:25:34","Actor":"DmitriyIvanko","Number":"14200","RawContent":null,"Title":"Simple bug: Can't resolve '\\app-test\\src\\styles.sass' in '\\app-test'","State":"open","Body":"<!--🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅\r\n\r\nOh hi there! 😄\r\n\r\nTo expedite issue processing please search open and closed issues before submitting a new one.\r\nExisting issues often contain information about workarounds, resolution, or progress updates.\r\n\r\n🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅-->\r\n\r\n\r\n# 🐞 Bug report\r\n\r\n### Command (mark with an `x`)\r\n<!-- Can you pin-point the command or commands that are effected by this bug? -->\r\n<!-- ✍️edit: -->\r\n```\r\n- [ x ] new\r\n```\r\n\r\n### Description\r\n\r\n<!-- ✍️--> \r\nWhen creating a new project, select the option \"Sass [http://sass-lang.com]\".
