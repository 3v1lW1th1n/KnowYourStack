Looking at the IE11 performance timeline shows that this is caused by extremely expensive styling operations:\r\n\r\n<img width=\"1024\" alt=\"_Screen Shot 2019-06-12 at 19 50 41\" src=\"https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/2169585/59414262-76a15580-8dc1-11e9-8c50-58db7f966f0c.png\">\r\n\r\nDigging into the problem, it appears that attributes selectors are a huge performance bottleneck in IE11, as pointed out in https://medium.com/@aantipov/ie11-performance-bottleneck-de304569361d. This is apparently a well-known issue, as Angular Material had the exact same issue back in 2015, which was fixed by refactoring the layout directives as class names instead of attributes (https://github.com/angular/material/issues/1771#issuecomment-133521445). The Ionic team came up with the same conclusion as well, and [stopped using attribute selectors for their shadow dom polyfill](https://github.com/ionic-team/ionic/issues/14876#issuecomment-408877240), and CSSLint [even has a lint rule for it](https://github.com/CSSLint/csslint/wiki/Disallow-unqualified-attribute-selectors).\r\n\r\nHowever, Angular's emulated view encapsulation, which is the default view encapsulation mode (i.e. what most people are using), is based on the `_nghost-${COMPONENT_VARIABLE}` and `_ngcontent-${COMPONENT_VARIABLE}` attributes to emulate the styles encapsulation. This effectively adds unqualified attribute selectors as the key part (far-right) of all host & component styles selectors.\r\n\r\nTo test that theory, I've patched the emulated view encapsulation implementation locally to use CSS classes instead of attributes for `_nghost` & `_ngcontent`, and I can confirm this indeed solves the issue (a.k.a. the app becomes usable in IE11 again), i.e. it pretty much removes all the time spent in layout operations:\r\n\r\n<img width=\"1024\" alt=\"Screen Shot 2019-06-12 at 19 53 46\" src=\"https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/2169585/59418143-cdf6f400-8dc8-11e9-999c-3fd10df52dc0.png\">\r\n\r\nThe exact (completely hacky) code change I've made to the compiler/renderer to obtain that result is in https://github.com/laurentgoudet/angular-ie11-bug/commit/13896b53fc61c424ff5c6f98c58cc9ccc0f7d502.\r\n\r\n## üî¨ Minimal Reproduction\r\n\r\nI'm working on a minimal reproduction but it's a bit tricky as one apparently needs both a high number of DOM nodes and a high number a attribute-based styles rules (although the rules don't need to be match any element?), a.k.a. some real-world UI complexity.\r\n\r\nA [codepen was reproducing the issue](https://codepen.io/david-gang/pen/RRJjxG) for Angular Material (i.e. AngularJS), which I roughly ported to Angular v8 (https://embed.plnkr.co/e9vp65), but I'm not very happy with it as I can't see the same dramatic performance difference as I can see how with our app (when using my fork) - I suspect there might not be enough depth or different selectors (since the same component - `_ngcontent` - is duplicated over & over).\r\n\r\n## üåç  Your Environment\r\n\r\n**Angular Version:**\r\nv7, but the shadow DOM emulation code doesn't seem to have changed in `master` (and I don't think enabling Ivy changes anything as the style compiler seems independant).\r\n","Url":"https://github.com/angular/angular/issues/31033","RelatedDescription":"Open issue \"Emulated view encapsulation attribute selectors are extremely slow in IE11\" (#31033)"},{"Id":"455710996","IsPullRequest":false,"CreatedAt":"2019-06-13T12:25:34","Actor":"anisabboud","Number":"31032","RawContent":null,"Title":"[Ivy] (8.1.0-next.1) ng build ERRORs for @covalent, ngx-bootstrap, ngx-pipes","State":"open","Body":"# üêû bug report\r\n\r\n### Affected Packages\r\n\r\n`@covalent`: https://github.com/Teradata/covalent\r\n`ngx-bootstrap`: https://github.com/valor-software/ngx-bootstrap\r\n`ngx-pipes`: https://github.com/danrevah/ngx-pipes\r\n\r\n### Description\r\n\r\nI'm trying to upgrade to Ivy following the [blog post](https://blog.angular.io/its-time-for-the-compatibility-opt-in-preview-of-ivy-38f3542a282f).\r\nBut `ng build` produces 3 **different** errors for 3 different packages (dependencies).\r\n\r\n## üî¨ Minimal Reproduction\r\n\r\n- Install the packages above.\r\n- `ng update @angular/core --next` + https://angular.io/guide/ivy#using-ivy-in-an-existing-project\r\n- `ng build`\r\n\r\n## üî• Exception or Errors\r\n<pre><code>1.

It could publish web apps directly to Firebase; publish Android apps to the PlayStore; export iOS, IPadOS and MacOS code for Xcode; export Windows apps, and/or save IMG files for local use. It would also provide complete version control for the designs, all the apps, and their data -- all within the app builder. UI/UX design could be done directly in the app builder, and/or designs could be imported from and synced with programs like Adobe XD or Sketch., or they could imported from other codebases like React, ReactNative, Vue, etc. The builder could also enable developers to build plugins to extend its functionality. For example, InVision or Figma could build a plugin to export their designs to the app builder. Or, if the NativeScript team thinks they can make a better iPadOS app than the default Flutter app, let them build a plugin that disables the Flutter code for that device and generates the necessary NativeScript code. Additionally, developers behind, say, Chartjs or ThreeJS could build their own plugins that give the app builder new interfaces to support the functionalities of those libraries. Designers and devs could also build templates and themes for some sort of marketplace...idk...spitballin... I know this all sounds like wishful thinking, but it's already happening with tools like React Studio, Supernova Studio, Ionic Studio, etc. IMO, this is the future of app creation. The best apps will always be built by the developers, but good apps should be able to be built for all platforms by designers and by complete noobs wanting to learn. Let's face it, that's exactly who's forgoing Angular for the gentler learning curves of React and Vue. Using the React Studio makes learning React so much easier. It won't matter how good Ivy is at reducing bundle sizes, Angular is just going to keep losing ground until it fades into obscurity if so few of us can figure out how to use it properly. Please help us with better learning tools -- preferably in the form of an all-encompassing visual design-to-code building tool so that we can learn while also being productive. \r\n\r\nNote: as a side bonus, a tool like this would be a good way to help Angular users learn how to use other Google products with Angular. For example, Google Charts, reCaptcha, Google Analytics, Google Ads, Google Apps (Docs, Sheets, etc.), Google Photos -- heck, we could get crazy and build an importer for YouTube and Stadia.

We are using angular 7, tomcat 9, jdk 11, and the eclipse ide. What is happening is we are making an angular maven webapp and serving it on a tomcat server. It is going well (now), but there is a major snag. We are using a separate library that references the assets/ folder with img src and css url() tags etc. when We Maven build the app using ng build --base-href=/web-vis-angular/ and it deploys well. However when we start the server all the urls are still pointing to assets instead of web-vis-angular/assets. If I pull up the images separately using web-vis-angular/assets/.. I am able to load the images. When I build using a base-href it should be able to replace all the /assets with <your base-href>/assets.\r\n\r\n\r\n## üî¨ Minimal Reproduction\r\n\r\nhttps://stackoverflow.com/questions/38532210/how-to-integrate-angular-2-java-maven-web-application\r\nFollow top answer's setup and make a simple hello world that uses a simple css background image url(assets/..). \r\nYou will notice the image doesn't load.\r\n\r\nIf I go into the main.___.js and replace all the /assets with ./assets or my base-href I defined and reload the page on the server it works perfectly. \r\n\r\nI'm looking for a fix or a workaround that doesn't mean having to change all the src tags, because we are using other companies code and need to maintain it for the future.\r\n\r\nmaybe a simple build command like: ng build --prod --base-href=/web-vis-angular/ --replaceAssetTag\r\n\r\n\r\n## üî• Exception or Error\r\nGET http://localhost:8060/assets/img/login-background.jpg 404\r\n\r\nshould be looking for: http://localhost:8060/web-vis-angular/assets/img/login-background.jpg\r\n\r\n## üåç  Your Environment\r\n\r\n**Angular Version:**\r\n<pre><code>\r\n\r\n     _                      _                 ____ _     ___\r\n    / \\   _ __   __ _ _   _| | __ _ _ __     / ___| |   |_ _|\r\n   / ‚ñ≥ \\ | '_ \\ / _` | | | | |/ _` | '__|   | |   | |    | |\r\n  / ___ \\| | | | (_| | |_| | | (_| | |      | |___| |___ | |\r\n /_/   \\_\\_| |_|\\__, |\\__,_|_|\\__,_|_|       \\____|_____|___|\r\n                |___/\r\n\r\n\r\nAngular CLI: 7.1.3\r\nNode: 8.12.0\r\nOS: win32 x64\r\nAngular:\r\n...\r\n\r\nPackage                      Version\r\n------------------------------------------------------\r\n@angular-devkit/architect    0.11.3\r\n@angular-devkit/core         7.1.3\r\n@angular-devkit/schematics   7.1.3\r\n@schematics/angular          7.1.3\r\n@schematics/update           0.11.3\r\nrxjs                         6.3.3\r\ntypescript                   3.1.6\r\n\r\n","Url":"https://github.com/angular/angular-cli/issues/14767","RelatedDescription":"Closed issue \"css paths created after build with base-href not updated\" (#14767)"},{"Id":"456011071","IsPullRequest":false,"CreatedAt":"2019-06-14T00:39:31","Actor":"kawamoto","Number":"14769","RawContent":null,"Title":"production build failed \"Module parse failed\" with \"export default class\" syntax","State":"open","Body":"<!--üîÖüîÖüîÖüîÖüîÖüîÖüîÖüîÖüîÖüîÖüîÖüîÖüîÖüîÖüîÖüîÖüîÖüîÖüîÖüîÖüîÖüîÖüîÖüîÖüîÖüîÖüîÖüîÖüîÖüîÖüîÖ\r\n\r\nOh hi there! üòÑ\r\n\r\nTo expedite issue processing please search open and closed issues before submitting a new one.\r\nExisting issues often contain information about workarounds, resolution, or progress updates.\r\n\r\nüîÖüîÖüîÖüîÖüîÖüîÖüîÖüîÖüîÖüîÖüîÖüîÖüîÖüîÖüîÖüîÖüîÖüîÖüîÖüîÖüîÖüîÖüîÖüîÖüîÖüîÖüîÖüîÖüîÖüîÖüîÖüîÖüîÖ-->\r\n\r\n\r\n# üêû Bug report\r\n\r\n### Command (mark with an `x`)\r\n<!-- Can you pin-point the command or commands that are effected by this bug?

We ship the fonts for internal projects within our library. \r\n\r\n\r\n## üî¨ Minimal Reproduction\r\n<!--\r\nSimple steps to reproduce this bug.\r\n\r\nPlease include: commands run (including args), packages added, related code changes.\r\n\r\nIf reproduction steps are not enough for reproduction of your issue, please create a minimal GitHub repository with the reproduction of the issue. \r\nA good way to make a minimal reproduction is to create a new app via `ng new repro-app` and add the minimum possible code to show the problem. \r\nShare the link to the repo below along with step-by-step instructions to reproduce the problem, as well as expected and actual behavior.\r\n\r\nIssues that don't have enough info and can't be reproduced will be closed.\r\n\r\nYou can read more about issue submission guidelines here: https://github.com/angular/angular-cli/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md#-submitting-an-issue\r\n-->\r\n\r\nIn the angular.js we copy the fonts to a project by using the following config:\r\n```\r\n  \"projects\": {\r\n    \"our-project\": {\r\n       ...\r\n      \"architect\": {\r\n        \"build\": {\r\n          ...\r\n          \"options\": {\r\n            ...\r\n            \"assets\": [{\r\n                \"glob\": \"**/*\",\r\n                \"input\": \"./projects/our-lib/assets/fonts/\",\r\n                \"output\": \"./assets/fonts/\"\r\n              },\r\n```\r\n\r\nIn our fonts.scss we refer to the fonts by:\r\n```\r\n@font-face {\r\n  font-family: 'OurFont';\r\n  src: url('/assets/fonts/OurFont_W_Rg.eot');\r\n  src: url('/assets/fonts/OurFont_W_Rg.eot?#iefix') format('embedded-opentype'),\r\n      url('/assets/fonts/OurFont_W_Rg.woff2') format('woff2'),\r\n      url('/assets/fonts/OurFont_W_Rg.woff') format('woff');\r\n  font-weight: normal;\r\n  font-style: normal;\r\n}\r\n...\r\n```\r\n\r\nThis works well on ng-serve because the fonts will linked into the root/assets folder correctly. When we add a baseHref in version 7, it was added through  `src: url('/assets/fonts/OurFont_W_Rg.eot');` and as result by using a baseHref of \"/our-app/\"  we get the correct result ` src:

I believe, you will have to download the StackBlitz project locally in order to check this.\r\n\r\n#### Environment\r\n\r\n- Angular: 8.0.0\r\n- CDK/Material: 8.0.0\r\n- Browser(s): Google Chrome | 74.0.3729.169¬†(Official Build)¬†(64-bit)\r\n- Operating System: Windows 10","Url":"https://github.com/angular/components/issues/16273","RelatedDescription":"Open issue \"[Table] Mat cell definitions do not ensure correct typing\" (#16273)"},{"Id":"454928557","IsPullRequest":false,"CreatedAt":"2019-06-11T22:19:22","Actor":"mmalerba","Number":"16271","RawContent":null,"Title":"Consider changing axe tests to run separate from e2e tests","State":"open","Body":"We should run axe tests on CI so we catch accessibility issues before running g3 presubmits\r\n","Url":"https://github.com/angular/components/issues/16271","RelatedDescription":"Open issue \"Consider changing axe tests to run separate from e2e tests\" (#16271)"},{"Id":"454883123","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2019-06-11T21:55:30","Actor":"crisbeto","Number":"16270","RawContent":null,"Title":"chore: add scaffolding for mdc-based tabs","State":"closed","Body":"Adds all of the scaffolding for the MDC-based tabs implementation.\r\n\r\nRelates to #16250.","Url":"https://github.com/angular/components/pull/16270","RelatedDescription":"Closed or merged PR \"chore: add scaffolding for mdc-based tabs\" (#16270)"},{"Id":"454786166","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2019-06-11T16:22:12","Actor":"mmalerba","Number":"16269","RawContent":null,"Title":"wip: try using width/height for virtual scroll spacer sizing","State":"open","Body":"","Url":"https://github.com/angular/components/pull/16269","RelatedDescription":"Open PR \"wip: try using width/height for virtual scroll spacer sizing\" (#16269)"},{"Id":"454527962","IsPullRequest":false,"CreatedAt":"2019-06-11T16:21:07","Actor":"MaBbKhawaja","Number":"16264","RawContent":null,"Title":"Disable all the mat-steps and do not let user to open them by clicking","State":"closed","Body":"","Url":"https://github.com/angular/components/issues/16264","RelatedDescription":"Closed issue \"Disable all the mat-steps and do not let user to open them by clicking\" (#16264)"},{"Id":"454707025","IsPullRequest":false,"CreatedAt":"2019-06-11T15:59:37","Actor":"nischal-km","Number":"16267","RawContent":null,"Title":"Broken link on Table with sorting (Edit in stackblitz mode)","State":"closed","Body":"#### Reproduction\r\n\r\nUse StackBlitz to reproduce your issue: https://stackblitz.com/fork/components-issue\r\n\r\nSteps to reproduce:\r\n1. open https://material.angular.io/components/table/overview\r\n2.choose material version 8.0.1\r\n3.
