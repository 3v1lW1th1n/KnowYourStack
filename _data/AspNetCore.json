So i am going to put it here in hopes of getting an answer.\r\n\r\nThe issue is the understanding of how remember me is supposed to work.    My problem is that its not doing what we would expect it to do.   \r\n\r\nManagement expects when a user logs in and clicks remember me that they will then not be required to type their login and password again for a month.  Whether or not they will still have to type in the 2fa code is up for debate.\r\n\r\nWhat is actually happening is that i can close the browser reboot and come back for about an hour and 15 minutes and then i will be forced to type my password again.    This still happens even with a valid `.AspNetCore.Identity.Application` cookie set that is not due to expire for another month.\r\n\r\nAfter digging around in the code i found that Remember me is actually isPersistent and it is defined as.\r\n\r\n>Flag indicating whether the sign-in cookie should persist after the browser is closed.\r\n\r\nWhich brings you to:\r\n\r\nThere are two different types of Cookies:\r\n\r\n- session cookies, held in memory, and which expire once the browser exits\r\n- persistent cookies, which have a time-to-live, are persisted on disk, and are sent by the browser until their time-to-live has elapsed.\r\n\r\nAll this being said remember machine 2fa works as expected i am not prompted again for the 2fa and i have a cookie on my machine `Identity.TwoFactorRememberMe`.\r\n\r\nSo I guess my question is why are we not getting a `Identity.FactorRememberMe` or why isn't sign in respecting a long life time of the `AspNetCore.Identity.Application` cookie?\r\n\r\nHow is this supposed to work exactly?

VS 2019 is about to be released in around early 2019\r\n2. ASP.NET Core 1.0/1.1 is not going to be supported anymore, based on [this page](https://github.com/dotnet/core/blob/master/microsoft-support.md).\r\n3. Creating new ASP.NET Core 1.0/1.1 will always install the .NET Core 1.0/1.1 web tooling, and this is not necessary when previous reason has reached the unsupported period and it's quite near or might be the same time of VS 2019 release.\r\n4. Based on the problem mentioned above, VS 2017 has no \"built in\" tooling when creating new ASP.NET Core 1.0/1.1 project, but the external tooling may help. Therefore for those that still need to maintain ASP.NET Core 1.0/1.1 projects, we could use VS 2017 as long as the VS 2017 is still in support lifecycle or in mainstream support lifecycle.\r\n\r\nI

As part of that we marked `UseSignalR`, `UseConnections` and some related methods (full list below) as obsolete. In ASP.NET Core 5.0 we will remove those methods entirely.\r\n\r\n### Version introduced\r\n\r\n5.0.0-preview3\r\n\r\n### Old behavior\r\n\r\nSignalR Hubs and Connection Handlers could be registered in the middleware pipeline using the `UseSignalR` or `UseConnections` methods.\r\n\r\n### New behavior\r\n\r\nSignalR Hubs and Connection Handlers should be registered within `UseEndpoints` using the `MapHub` and `MapConnectionHandler` extension methods on `IEndpointRouteBuilder`.\r\n\r\n### Reason for change\r\n\r\nThe old methods had custom routing logic that didn't interact with other routing components in ASP.NET Core. In 3.0 we introduced a new general-purpose routing system (Endpoint Routing) and enabled SignalR to work with that. Switching to this model allows users to get the full benefits of endpoint routing.\r\n\r\n### Recommended action\r\n\r\nRemove code that called `UseSignalR` or `UseConnections` from your `Startup.Configure` method. Replace it with calls to `MapHub` and `MapConnectionHandler` within the body of a call to `UseEndpoints`. In general, your previous `MapHub`/`MapConnectionHandler` calls can be transferred directly from the body of `UseSignalR`/`UseConnections` over to `UseEndpoints` with no change needed.\r\n\r\n### Category\r\n\r\nASP.NET\r\n\r\n### Affected APIs\r\n\r\n* [SignalRAppBuilderExtensions](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/api/microsoft.aspnetcore.builder.signalrappbuilderextensions) class\r\n\t* [UseSignalR](https://docs.microsoft.com/dotnet/api/microsoft.aspnetcore.builder.signalrappbuilderextensions.usesignalr) method\r\n* [ConnectionsAppBuilderExtensions](https://docs.microsoft.com/dotnet/api/microsoft.aspnetcore.builder.connectionsappbuilderextensions) class\r\n\t* [UseConnections](https://docs.microsoft.com/dotnet/api/microsoft.aspnetcore.builder.connectionsappbuilderextensions.useconnections) method\r\n* [ConnectionsRouteBuilder](https://docs.microsoft.com/dotnet/api/microsoft.aspnetcore.http.connections.connectionsroutebuilder) class\r\n\t* [MapConnectionHandler](https://docs.microsoft.com/dotnet/api/microsoft.aspnetcore.http.connections.connectionsroutebuilder.mapconnectionhandler) method\r\n\t* [MapConnections](https://docs.microsoft.com/dotnet/api/microsoft.aspnetcore.http.connections.connectionsroutebuilder.mapconnections) method\r\n* [HubRouteBuilder](https://docs.microsoft.com/dotnet/api/microsoft.aspnetcore.signalr.hubroutebuilder) class\r\n\t* [MapHub](https://docs.microsoft.com/dotnet/api/microsoft.aspnetcore.signalr.hubroutebuilder.maphub) method\r\n\r\n<!-- Do not modify anything below this line -->\r\n\r\n---\r\n#### Issue metadata\r\n\r\n* Issue type: breaking-change\r\n","Url":"https://github.com/aspnet/Announcements/issues/412","RelatedDescription":"Open issue \"Removed `UseSignalR`, `UseConnections` and related methods\" (#412)"},{"Id":"580166413","IsPullRequest":false,"CreatedAt":"2020-03-12T19:20:48","Actor":"anurse","Number":"411","RawContent":null,"Title":"Migrating dotnet/extensions content to dotnet/runtime and dotnet/aspnetcore","State":"open","Body":"*Please use https://github.com/dotnet/aspnetcore/issues/19806 for discussions on this topic*\r\n\r\nAs part of the [ongoing repository consolidation effort](https://github.com/dotnet/announcements/issues/119) in .NET 5, we are working to move most of the content from dotnet/extensions into other repositories. Most of these packages were developed by and are currently maintained by the ASP.NET team. However, moving forward we want to enable more scenarios with these packages, outside of ASP.NET.\r\n\r\nThe packages which we believe are usable in various application models (Configuration, DI, Hosting, etc.) are being moved to the **dotnet/runtime repository**. Packages which are primarily used in ASP.NET Core applications (Web Encoders, etc.) are moving to the **dotnet/aspnetcore repository**. Finally, in order to avoid introducing third-party dependencies into dotnet/runtime and dotnet/aspnetcore, some packages are remaining in the **dotnet/extensions repository** as they have dependencies on third-party packages (such as integrations with StackExchange.Redis and other components).\r\n\r\nThe full list of packages that are moving can be found at the end of this announcement. In general, tests and samples will be moving to the relevant repo based on where the main package moved. Issue tracking for the relevant packages will also move to that repository.\r\n\r\n## PR/Issue migrations\r\n\r\nThere are 400+ open issues and ~50 open PRs (at time of writing) in dotnet/extensions.\r\n\r\nSince we are actively working on migrating the packages now, we recommend waiting to open new PRs until we update this announcement indicating the migration is complete. Some packages are building in two repositories and we want to make sure your changes land in the right place. Over the migration process, we'll be closing most of the active PRs that target packages which have been moved and asking the author to migrate the PR to the relevant repository.\r\n\r\nFor issues, feel free to continue opening them and we'll respond to them as best we can during the migration. If the package your issue relates to has been moved, we'll handle transferring the issue. We'll be doing some triaging of the incoming issues and the backlog and will attempt to migrate as many issues as possible. As part of this process, we'll also close issues that are no longer relevant, duplicates of other issues, or enhancements we don't plan to support.\r\n\r\n## Q&A\r\n\r\nIf your question isn't answered here, use the [Discussion Issue](https://github.com/dotnet/aspnetcore/issues/19806) linked at the top of this announcement to ask it!\r\n\r\n#### Are these packages moving in to the Base Class Library (\"BCL\"), or Microsoft.NETCore.App?**\r\n\r\nWe do not plan to change how these components ship as part of this migration. Packages that currently ship on NuGet.org will continue to do so. Libraries that are currently included in ASP.NET Core will continue to be included. We are not adding any of these components to the BCL at this time.\r\n\r\n#### If package `Microsoft.Extensions.X` is moving to the runtime repo, why not rename it to `System.X`?\r\n\r\nWhile it is possible to rename assemblies and redirect type references, it is **not** possible to change package identities, namespaces or type names in a non-breaking way. Renaming these types would be extremely disruptive and provide very little benefit. All of these components are *already* covered by the [.NET Core Support Policy](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/platform/support/policy) and will continue to be in the future, just like the `System.*` assemblies.\r\n\r\n#### Will these packages still support .NET Standard 2.0?\r\n\r\nWe do not plan to reduce the set of frameworks these packages can be used on as part of this migration. If they currently support .NET Standard, we have no plans to change that.\r\n\r\n\r\n#### Why are some packages staying in dotnet/extensions?\r\n\r\nAs a general rule, we want to avoid third-party dependencies in the dotnet/runtime and dotnet/aspnetcore repositories. The packages that depend on third-party dependencies are remaining in dotnet/extensions to help preserve this.\r\n\r\n#### Where should I file issues related to these packages?\r\n\r\nIn general, file issues in the repo that contains the package. Some feature areas are split between multiple repos. If you're not sure, feel free to file issues in any of the three repos (dotnet/runtime, dotnet/extensions or dotnet/aspnetcore) and the team can transfer the issue as needed.\r\n\r\n#### Why did you move package `X` to repo `Y`?\r\n\r\nFeel free to use the [Discussion Issue](https://github.com/dotnet/aspnetcore/issues/19806) linked at the top of this announcement to ask questions about specific packages.\r\n\r\n## Package List\r\n\r\nThe following list identifies all the packages we currently ship from [dotnet/extensions](https://github.com/dotnet/extensions) and which repo they are moving

Since ASP.NET Core SignalR users may be using this package, we want to bring this issue to the attention of all ASP.NET Core users.*\r\n\r\nMicrosoft is releasing this security advisory to provide information about a vulnerability that affects ASP.NET Core. This advisory also provides guidance on what developers can do to update their applications to remove this vulnerability.\r\n\r\nA denial of service vulnerability exists when using the [`MessagePack`](https://www.nuget.org/packages/MessagePack/) NuGet package. An attacker who successfully exploited this vulnerability could cause a denial of service against an ASP.NET Core application. The vulnerability can be exploited remotely, without authentication.\r\n\r\nA remote unauthenticated attacker could exploit this vulnerability by issuing specially crafted requests to the ASP.NET Core application.\r\n\r\nThe update addresses the vulnerability by correcting how MessagePack handles deserialization.\r\n\r\n## Discussion\r\n\r\nDiscussion for this issue can be found at https://github.com/dotnet/aspnetcore/issues/18716\r\n\r\n## <a name=\"mitigation-factors\"></a>Mitigation factors\r\n\r\nMicrosoft has not identified any mitigating factors for this vulnerability.\r\n\r\n## <a name=\"how-affected\"></a>How do I know if I am affected?\r\n\r\nIf you have a runtime or SDK with a version listed in [affected software](#affected-runtime) or your application has a dependency on any of the packages listed in [affected packages](#affected-packages), you are exposed to the vulnerability.\r\n\r\n### <a name=\"affected-runtime\"></a>Affected software\r\n\r\nAny .NET Core 2.1, 3.0 or 3.1 application using SignalR with the MessagePack Hub Protocol.\r\n\r\n### <a name=\"affected-packages\"></a>Affected packages\r\n\r\nAny ASP.NET Core-based application that uses any of the vulnerable packages shown below, or any ASP.NET Core application running on .NET Core 2.1.x, 3.0.0, 3.0.1 or 3.1.0.\r\n\r\nPackage name | Vulnerable versions | Secure versions\r\n------------ | ------------------- | -------------------------\r\nMessagePack | 1.0.0 - 1.8.x | 1.9.3 *With code change described below*\r\nMicrosoft.AspNetCore.SignalR.Protocols.MessagePack | 1.0.0 - 3.1.1 | *Update transitive reference to `MessagePack`*\r\n\r\n**NOTE:** MessagePack 2.x is *not compatible* with ASP.NET Core SignalR.\r\n\r\n### <a name=\"how-fix\"></a>How do I fix the issue?\r\n\r\nFirst examine the packages you have installed. If you have a vulnerable version of `MessagePack` in your package graph, you must update it. If you have a reference to `Microsoft.AspNetCore.SignalR.Protocols.MessagePack` in your project, you likely have a vulnerable version of `MessagePack` and should fix it by [directly referencing a secure version](#fixing-transitive-dependencies).\r\n\r\n**In addition to updating** you must set the `MessagePackSecurity.Active` static property to enable the `UntrustedData` mode for the MessagePack serializer, to ensure you are protected. See [the MessagePack advisory](https://github.com/neuecc/MessagePack-CSharp/security/advisories/GHSA-7q36-4xx7-xcxf) for details. Add the following code to the top of your app's entry point:\r\n\r\n```csharp\r\npublic static void Main(string[] args)\r\n{\r\n  // Add the following lines\r\n  // Enable additional security in MessagePack to handle untrusted data.\r\n  MessagePackSecurity.Active = MessagePackSecurity.UntrustedData;\r\n\r\n  // Continue with program initialization...\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nIf your application provides any custom `IMessagePackFormatter<T>` implementations, you should also update them to include the relevant security measures by ensuring reads of variable-length values (such as strings) are done within a `using (MessagePackSecurity.DepthStep())` block. See [the MessagePack advisory](https://github.com/neuecc/MessagePack-CSharp/security/advisories/GHSA-7q36-4xx7-xcxf) for more details.\r\n\r\n##### Direct dependencies\r\n\r\nDirect dependencies are discoverable by examining your `csproj` file. They can be fixed by [editing the project file](#fixing-direct-dependencies) or using NuGet to update the dependency.\r\n\r\n##### Transitive dependencies\r\n\r\nTransitive dependencies occur when you add a package to your project that in turn relies on another package. For example, if Contoso publishes a package `Contoso.Utility` that, in turn, depends on `Contoso.Internals` and you add the `Contoso.Utility` package to your project now your project has a direct dependency on `Contoso.Utility` and, because `Contoso.Utility` depends 'Contoso.Internals', your application gains a transitive dependency on the `Contoso.Internals` package.\r\n\r\nTransitive dependencies are reviewable in two ways:\r\n\r\n* In the Visual Studio Solution Explorer window, which supports searching.\r\n* By examining the `project.assets.json` file contained in the obj directory of your project for `csproj` based projects\r\n\r\nThe `project.assets.json` files are the authoritative list of all packages used by your project, containing both direct and transitive dependencies.\r\n\r\nThere are two ways to view transitive dependencies. You can either [use Visual Studio’s Solution Explorer](#vs-solution-explorer), or you can review [the `project.assets.json` file](#project-assets-json)).\r\n\r\n###### <a name=\"vs-solution-explorer\"></a>Using Visual Studio Solution Explorer\r\n\r\nTo use Solution Explorer, open the project in Visual Studio, and then press Ctrl+; to activate the search in Solution Explorer. Search for the [vulnerable package](#affected-software) and make a note of the version numbers of any results you find.\r\n\r\nFor example, searching for `Microsoft.AspNetCore.Mvc.Core` in an example project that contains a package that takes a dependency on `Microsoft.AspNetCore.Mvc` shows the following results in Visual Studio 2017:\r\n\r\n![Screenshot of search results in Visual Studio 2017](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/796298/25858816/8ecdc2b4-3491-11e7-9363-746804bb9832.png)\r\n\r\nThe search results appear as a tree. In the previous results, you can see that a reference to `Microsoft.AspNetCore.Mvc.Core` version 1.1.2 is discovered.\r\n\r\nUnder the Dependencies node is a NuGet node. Under the NuGet node is the list of packages you have directly taken a dependency on and their versions.\r\nIn screenshot, the application takes a direct dependency on `Microsoft.AspNetCore.Mvc`. `Microsoft.AspNetCore.Mvc` in turn has leaf nodes that list its dependencies and their versions.\r\nThe `Microsoft.AspNetCore.Mvc` package takes a dependency on a version of `Microsoft.AspNetCore.Mvc.ApiExplorer`, that in turn takes a dependency on a version of `Microsoft.AspNetCore.Mvc.Core`.\r\n\r\n###### <a name=\"project-assets-json\"></a> Manually reviewing project.assets.json\r\n\r\nOpen the *project.assets.json* file from your project’s obj directory in your editor. We suggest you use an editor that understands JSON and allows you to collapse and expand nodes to review this file.\r\nVisual Studio and Visual Studio Code provide JSON-friendly editing.\r\n\r\nSearch the *project.assets.json* file for the [vulnerable package](#affected-software), using the format `packagename/` for each of the package names from the preceding table. If you find the assembly name in your search:\r\nv\r\n* Examine the line on which they are found, the version number is after the `/`.\r\n* Compare to the [vulnerable versions table](#affected-software).\r\n\r\nFor example, a search result that shows `System.IO.Pipelines/4.5.0` is a reference to version 4.5.0 of `System.IO.Pipelines`.\r\n\r\nIf your *project.assets.json* file includes references to the [vulnerable package](#affected-software), then you need to fix the transitive dependencies.\r\n\r\nIf you have not found any reference to any vulnerable packages, this means either\r\n\r\n* None of your direct dependencies depend on any vulnerable packages, or\r\n* You have already fixed the problem by updating the direct dependencies.\r\n\r\n##### <a name=\"how-fix-framework\"></a>Fixing Dependencies\r\n\r\n######  <a name=\"fixing-direct-dependencies\"></a>Fixing direct dependencies\r\n\r\nOpen *projectname.csproj* in your editor. If you're using Visual Studio, right-click the project and choose **Edit projectname.csproj** from the context menu, where projectname is the name of your project. Look for `PackageReference` elements. The following shows an example project file:\r\n\r\n```xml\r\n<Project Sdk=\"Microsoft.NET.Sdk.Web\">\r\n  <PropertyGroup>\r\n    <TargetFramework>netcoreapp2.1</TargetFramework>\r\n  </PropertyGroup>\r\n  <ItemGroup>\r\n    <PackageReference Include=\"MessagePack\" Version=\"1.8.80\" />\r\n  </ItemGroup>\r\n</Project>\r\n```\r\n\r\nThe preceding example has a reference to the [vulnerable package](#affected-software), as seen by the single `PackageReference` element. The name of the package is in the `Include` attribute.\r\nThe package version number is in the `Version` attribute. The previous example shows a single direct dependency on `MessagePack` version 1.8.80\r\n\r\nTo update the version to the secure package, change the version number to the updated package version as listed on the table [previously](#affected-software).\r\nIn this example, update `MessagePack` to the appropriate [fixed package number](#affected-software) for your major version. Save the *csproj* file. The example *csproj* now looks as follows:\r\n\r\n```xml\r\n<Project Sdk=\"Microsoft.NET.Sdk.Web\">\r\n  <PropertyGroup>\r\n    <TargetFramework>netcoreapp2.1</TargetFramework>\r\n  </PropertyGroup>\r\n  <ItemGroup>\r\n    <PackageReference Include=\"MessagePack\" Version=\"1.9.3\" />\r\n  </ItemGroup>\r\n</Project>\r\n```\r\n\r\nIf you're using Visual Studio and you save your updated *csproj* file, Visual Studio will restore the new package version.\r\nYou can see the restore results by opening the **Output** window (Ctrl+Alt+O) and changing the **Show output from** drop-down list to **Package Manager**.\r\n\r\nIf you're not using Visual Studio, open a command line and change to your project directory. Execute the `dotnet restore` command to restore the updated dependencies.\r\n\r\nNow recompile your application. If after recompilation you see a *Dependency conflict warning*, you must update your other direct dependencies to versions that take a dependency on the updated package.\r\n\r\n######  <a name=\"fixing-transitive-dependencies\"></a>Fixing transitive dependencies\r\n\r\nIf your transitive dependency review found references to the [vulnerable package](#affected-software), you must add a direct dependency to the updated package to your *csproj* file to override the transitive dependency.\r\n\r\nOpen *projectname.csproj* in your editor. If you're using Visual Studio, right-click the project and choose **Edit projectname.csproj** from the context menu, where projectname is the name of your project.\r\nLook for `PackageReference` nodes, for example:\r\n\r\n```xml\r\n<Project Sdk=\"Microsoft.NET.Sdk.Web\">\r\n  <PropertyGroup>\r\n    <TargetFramework>netcoreapp3.1</TargetFramework>\r\n  </PropertyGroup>\r\n  <ItemGroup>\r\n    <PackageReference Include=\"Microsoft.AspNetCore.SignalR.Protocols.MessagePack\" Version=\"3.1.0\" />\r\n  </ItemGroup>\r\n</Project>\r\n```\r\n\r\nYou must add a direct dependency to the updated version of the [vulnerable package](#affected-software) by adding it to the *csproj* file.\r\nYou do this by adding a new line to the dependencies section, referencing the fixed version.\r\nFor example, if your search showed a transitive reference to a vulnerable `MessagePack` version, you'd add a reference to the [fixed package number](#affected-software).\r\n\r\n```xml\r\n<Project Sdk=\"Microsoft.NET.Sdk.Web\">\r\n  <PropertyGroup>\r\n    <TargetFramework>netcoreapp3.1</TargetFramework>\r\n  </PropertyGroup>\r\n  <ItemGroup>\r\n    <PackageReference Include=\"Microsoft.AspNetCore.SignalR.Protocols.MessagePack\" Version=\"3.1.0\" />\r\n    <PackageReference Include=\"MessagePack\" Version=\"1.9.3\" />\r\n  </ItemGroup>\r\n</Project>\r\n```\r\n\r\nAfter you've added the direct dependency reference, save your *csproj* file.\r\n\r\nIf you're using Visual Studio, save your updated *csproj* file and Visual Studio will restore the new package versions.\r\nYou can see the restore results by opening the **Output** window (Ctrl+Alt+O) and changing the **Show output from** drop-down list to **Package Manager**.\r\n\r\nIf you're not using Visual Studio, open a command line and change to your project directory. Execute the `dotnet restore` command to restore the new dependencies.\r\n\r\nFinally, you must rebuild your application, test, and redeploy.\r\n\r\n## Other Information\r\n\r\n### Reporting Security Issues\r\n\r\nIf you have found a potential security issue in .NET Core, please email details to secure@microsoft.com.

In ASP.NET Core 5.0, we will move from the 1.x version to the latest 2.x version. This is a breaking change for:\r\n\r\n* Anyone who is setting/configuring values on [`MessagePackHubProtocolOptions`](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/api/microsoft.aspnetcore.signalr.messagepackhubprotocoloptions)\r\n* Anyone who was using the MessagePack APIs directly **and** using the ASP.NET Core SignalR MessagePack Hub Protocol in the same application, as the newer version will be loaded instead of the previous version.\r\n\r\n### Version introduced\r\n\r\n5.0-preview1\r\n\r\n### Old behavior\r\n\r\nPreviously, ASP.NET Core SignalR used the MessagePack 1.x package to serialize/deserialize MessagePack messages.\r\n\r\n### New behavior\r\n\r\nNow, ASP.NET Core SignalR will use the MessagePack 2.x package to serialize/deserialize MessagePack messages.\r\n\r\nThe new behavior will impact some aspects of message serialization and deserialization. See the [guidance for migrating from 1.x to 2.x](https://github.com/neuecc/MessagePack-CSharp/blob/master/doc/migration.md) published by the MessagePack package authors. Specifically, there are [behavioral changes to how DateTime values are serialized](https://github.com/neuecc/MessagePack-CSharp/blob/master/doc/migration.md#behavioral-changes).\r\n\r\n### Reason for change\r\n\r\nWe believe updating to MessagePack v2.x will add useful new functionality and allow us to stay current with the latest improvements in that package.\r\n\r\n### Recommended action\r\n\r\nIf you are using MessagePack directly in your application **and** using the SignalR MessagePack Hub Protocol, update your usage to adapt to any breaking changes in the 2.x release of MessagePack.

As targeting .NET Framework adds dependencies for various packages you must update the dependencies your application uses, recompile and redeploy your application.\r\n\r\n##### Direct dependencies\r\n\r\nDirect dependencies are discoverable by examining your `csproj` file. They can be fixed by [editing the project file](#fixing-direct-dependencies) or using NuGet to update the dependency.\r\n\r\n##### Transitive dependencies\r\n\r\nTransitive dependencies occur when you add a package to your project that in turn relies on another package. For example, if Contoso publishes a package `Contoso.Utility` that, in turn, depends on `Contoso.Internals` and you add the `Contoso.Utility` package to your project now your project has a direct dependency on `Contoso.Utility` and, because `Contoso.Utility` depends 'Contoso.Internals', your application gains a transitive dependency on the `Contoso.Internals` package.\r\n\r\nTransitive dependencies are reviewable in two ways:\r\n\r\n* In the Visual Studio Solution Explorer window, which supports searching.\r\n* By examining the `project.assets.json` file contained in the obj directory of your project for `csproj` based projects\r\n\r\nThe `project.assets.json` files are the authoritative list of all packages used by your project, containing both direct and transitive dependencies.\r\n\r\nThere are two ways to view transitive dependencies. You can either [use Visual Studio’s Solution Explorer](#vs-solution-explorer), or you can review [the `project.assets.json` file](#project-assets-json)).\r\n\r\n###### <a name=\"vs-solution-explorer\"></a>Using Visual Studio Solution Explorer\r\n\r\nTo use Solution Explorer, open the project in Visual Studio, and then press Ctrl+; to activate the search in Solution Explorer. Search for the [vulnerable package](#affected-software) and make a note of the version numbers of any results you find.\r\n\r\nFor example, searching for `Microsoft.AspNetCore.Mvc.Core` in an example project that contains a package that takes a dependency on `Microsoft.AspNetCore.Mvc` shows the following results in Visual Studio 2017:\r\n\r\n![Screenshot of search results in Visual Studio 2017](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/796298/25858816/8ecdc2b4-3491-11e7-9363-746804bb9832.png)\r\n\r\nThe search results appear as a tree. In the previous results, you can see that a reference to `Microsoft.AspNetCore.Mvc.Core` version 1.1.2 is discovered.\r\n\r\nUnder the Dependencies node is a NuGet node. Under the NuGet node is the list of packages you have directly taken a dependency on and their versions.\r\nIn screenshot, the application takes a direct dependency on `Microsoft.AspNetCore.Mvc`. `Microsoft.AspNetCore.Mvc` in turn has leaf nodes that list its dependencies and their versions.\r\nThe `Microsoft.AspNetCore.Mvc` package takes a dependency on a version of `Microsoft.AspNetCore.Mvc.ApiExplorer`, that in turn takes a dependency on a version of `Microsoft.AspNetCore.Mvc.Core`.\r\n\r\n###### <a name=\"project-assets-json\"></a> Manually reviewing project.assets.json\r\n\r\nOpen the *project.assets.json* file from your project’s obj directory in your editor. We suggest you use an editor that understands JSON and allows you to collapse and expand nodes to review this file.\r\nVisual Studio and Visual Studio Code provide JSON-friendly editing.\r\n\r\nSearch the *project.assets.json* file for the [vulnerable package](#affected-software), using the format `packagename/` for each of the package names from the preceding table. If you find the assembly name in your search:\r\nv\r\n* Examine the line on which they are found, the version number is after the `/`.\r\n* Compare to the [vulnerable versions table](#affected-software).\r\n\r\nFor example, a search result that shows `System.IO.Pipelines/4.5.0` is a reference to version 4.5.0 of `System.IO.Pipelines`.\r\n\r\nIf your *project.assets.json* file includes references to the [vulnerable package](#affected-software), then you need to fix the transitive dependencies.\r\n\r\nIf you have not found any reference to any vulnerable packages, this means either\r\n\r\n* None of your direct dependencies depend on any vulnerable packages, or\r\n* You have already fixed the problem by updating the direct dependencies.\r\n\r\n##### <a name=\"how-fix-framework\"></a>Fixing Dependencies\r\n\r\n######  <a name=\"fixing-direct-dependencies\"></a>Fixing direct dependencies\r\n\r\nOpen *projectname.csproj* in your editor. If you're using Visual Studio, right-click the project and choose **Edit projectname.csproj** from the context menu, where projectname is the name of your project. Look for `PackageReference` elements. The following shows an example project file:\r\n\r\n```xml\r\n<Project Sdk=\"Microsoft.NET.Sdk.Web\">\r\n  <PropertyGroup>\r\n    <TargetFramework>netcoreapp2.1</TargetFramework>\r\n  </PropertyGroup>\r\n  <ItemGroup>\r\n    <PackageReference Include=\"Microsoft.AspNetCore.Http.Connections\" Version=\"1.0.0\" />\r\n  </ItemGroup>\r\n</Project>\r\n```\r\n\r\nThe preceding example has a reference to the [vulnerable package](#affected-software), as seen by the single `PackageReference` element. The name of the package is in the `Include` attribute.\r\nThe package version number is in the `Version` attribute. The previous example shows a single direct dependency on `System.IO.Pipelines` version 4.5.0\r\n\r\nTo update the version to the secure package, change the version number to the updated package version as listed on the table [previously](#affected-software).\r\nIn this example, update `System.IO.Pipelines` to the appropriate [fixed package number](#affected-software) for your major version. Save the *csproj* file. The example *csproj* now looks as follows:\r\n\r\n```xml\r\n<Project Sdk=\"Microsoft.NET.Sdk.Web\">\r\n  <PropertyGroup>\r\n    <TargetFramework>netcoreapp2.1</TargetFramework>\r\n  </PropertyGroup>\r\n  <ItemGroup>\r\n    <PackageReference Include=\"Microsoft.AspNetCore.Http.Connections \" Version=\"1.0.15\" />\r\n  </ItemGroup>\r\n</Project>\r\n```\r\n\r\nIf you're using Visual Studio and you save your updated *csproj* file, Visual Studio will restore the new package version.\r\nYou can see the restore results by opening the **Output** window (Ctrl+Alt+O) and changing the **Show output from** drop-down list to **Package Manager**.\r\n\r\nIf you're not using Visual Studio, open a command line and change to your project directory. Execute the `dotnet restore` command to restore the updated dependencies.\r\n\r\nNow recompile your application. If after recompilation you see a *Dependency conflict warning*, you must update your other direct dependencies to versions that take a dependency on the updated package.\r\n\r\n######  <a name=\"transitive-dependencies\"></a>Fixing transitive dependencies\r\n\r\nIf your transitive dependency review found references to the [vulnerable package](#affected-software), you must add a direct dependency to the updated package to your *csproj* file to override the transitive dependency.\r\n\r\nOpen *projectname.csproj* in your editor. If you're using Visual Studio, right-click the project and choose **Edit projectname.csproj** from the context menu, where projectname is the name of your project.\r\nLook for `PackageReference` nodes, for example:\r\n\r\n```xml\r\n<Project Sdk=\"Microsoft.NET.Sdk.\">\r\n  <PropertyGroup>\r\n    <TargetFramework>net461</TargetFramework>\r\n  </PropertyGroup>\r\n  <ItemGroup>\r\n    <PackageReference Include=\"ThirdParty.NotUpdatedYet\" Version=\"2.0.0\" />\r\n  </ItemGroup>\r\n</Project>\r\n```\r\n\r\nYou must add a direct dependency to the updated version of the [vulnerable package](#affected-software) by adding it to the *csproj* file.\r\nYou do this by adding a new line to the dependencies section, referencing the fixed version.\r\nFor example, if your search showed a transitive reference to a vulnerable `System.ServiceModel.Http` version, you'd add a reference to the [fixed package number](#affected-software).\r\n\r\n```xml\r\n<Project Sdk=\"Microsoft.NET.Sdk.Web\">\r\n  <PropertyGroup>\r\n    <TargetFramework>net461</TargetFramework>\r\n  </PropertyGroup>\r\n  <ItemGroup>\r\n    <PackageReference Include=\"Microsoft.AspNetCore.Http.Connections\" Version=\"1.0.15\" />\r\n    <PackageReference Include=\"ThirdParty.NotUpdatedYet\" Version=\"2.0.0\" />\r\n  </ItemGroup>\r\n</Project>\r\n```\r\n\r\nAfter you've added the direct dependency reference, save your *csproj* file.\r\n\r\nIf you're using Visual Studio, save your updated *csproj* file and Visual Studio will restore the new package versions.\r\nYou can see the restore results by opening the **Output** window (Ctrl+Alt+O) and changing the **Show output from** drop-down list to **Package Manager**.\r\n\r\nIf you're not using Visual Studio, open a command line and change to your project directory. Execute the `dotnet restore` command to restore the new dependencies.\r\n\r\nFinally, you must rebuild your application, test, and redeploy.\r\n\r\n## Other Information\r\n\r\n### Reporting Security Issues\r\n\r\nIf you have found a potential security issue in .NET Core, please email details to secure@microsoft.com.

If you find the assembly name in your search:\r\n\r\n* Examine the line on which they are found, the version number is after the `/`.\r\n* Compare to the [vulnerable versions table](#affected-software).\r\n\r\nFor example, a search result that shows `System.IO.Pipelines/4.5.0` is a reference to version 4.5.0 of `System.IO.Pipelines`.\r\n\r\nIf your *project.assets.json* file includes references to the [vulnerable package](#affected-software), then you need to fix the transitive dependencies.\r\n\r\nIf you haven't found any reference to any vulnerable packages, this means one of the following:\r\n\r\n* None of your direct dependencies depend on any vulnerable packages.\r\n* You have already fixed the problem by updating the direct dependencies.\r\n\r\n##### <a name=\"how-fix-framework\"></a>Fixing Dependencies\r\n\r\n######  <a name=\"fixing-direct-dependencies\"></a>Fixing direct dependencies\r\n\r\nOpen *projectname.csproj* in your editor. If you're using Visual Studio, right-click the project and choose **Edit projectname.csproj** from the context menu, where projectname is the name of your project. Look for `PackageReference` elements. The following shows an example project file:\r\n\r\n```xml\r\n<Project Sdk=\"Microsoft.NET.Sdk.Web\">\r\n  <PropertyGroup>\r\n    <TargetFramework>netcoreapp2.1</TargetFramework>\r\n  </PropertyGroup>\r\n  <ItemGroup>\r\n    <PackageReference Include=\"Microsoft.AspNetCore.Http.Connections\" Version=\"1.0.0\" />\r\n  </ItemGroup>\r\n</Project>\r\n```\r\n\r\nThe preceding example has a reference to the [vulnerable package](#affected-software), as seen by the single `PackageReference` element. The name of the package is in the `Include` attribute.\r\nThe package version number is in the `Version` attribute. The previous example shows a single direct dependency on `System.IO.Pipelines` version 4.5.0\r\n\r\nTo update the version to the secure package, change the version number to the updated package version as listed on the table [previously](#affected-software).\r\nIn this example, update `System.IO.Pipelines` to the appropriate [fixed package number](#affected-software) for your major version. Save the *csproj* file. The example *csproj* now looks as follows:\r\n\r\n```xml\r\n<Project Sdk=\"Microsoft.NET.Sdk.Web\">\r\n  <PropertyGroup>\r\n    <TargetFramework>netcoreapp2.1</TargetFramework>\r\n  </PropertyGroup>\r\n  <ItemGroup>\r\n    <PackageReference Include=\"Microsoft.AspNetCore.Http.Connections \" Version=\"1.0.15\" />\r\n  </ItemGroup>\r\n</Project>\r\n```\r\n\r\nIf you're using Visual Studio and you save your updated *csproj* file, Visual Studio will restore the new package version.\r\nYou can see the restore results by opening the **Output** window (Ctrl+Alt+O) and changing the **Show output from** drop-down list to **Package Manager**.\r\n\r\nIf you're not using Visual Studio, open a command line and change to your project directory. Execute the `dotnet restore` command to restore the updated dependencies.\r\n\r\nNow recompile your application. If after recompilation you see a *Dependency conflict warning*, you must update your other direct dependencies to versions that take a dependency on the updated package.\r\n\r\n###### <a name=\"transitive-dependencies\"></a>Fixing transitive dependencies\r\n\r\nIf your transitive dependency review found references to the [vulnerable package](#affected-software), you must add a direct dependency to the updated package to your *csproj* file to override the transitive dependency.\r\n\r\nOpen *projectname.csproj* in your editor. If you're using Visual Studio, right-click the project and choose **Edit projectname.csproj** from the context menu, where projectname is the name of your project.\r\nLook for `PackageReference` nodes, for example:\r\n\r\n```xml\r\n<Project Sdk=\"Microsoft.NET.Sdk.\">\r\n  <PropertyGroup>\r\n    <TargetFramework>net461</TargetFramework>\r\n  </PropertyGroup>\r\n  <ItemGroup>\r\n    <PackageReference Include=\"ThirdParty.NotUpdatedYet\" Version=\"2.0.0\" />\r\n  </ItemGroup>\r\n</Project>\r\n```\r\n\r\nYou must add a direct dependency to the updated version of the [vulnerable package](#affected-software) by adding it to the *csproj* file.\r\nYou do this by adding a new line to the dependencies section, referencing the fixed version.\r\nFor example, if your search showed a transitive reference to a vulnerable `System.ServiceModel.Http` version, you'd add a reference to the [fixed package number](#affected-software).\r\n\r\n```xml\r\n<Project Sdk=\"Microsoft.NET.Sdk.Web\">\r\n  <PropertyGroup>\r\n    <TargetFramework>net461</TargetFramework>\r\n  </PropertyGroup>\r\n  <ItemGroup>\r\n    <PackageReference Include=\"Microsoft.AspNetCore.Http.Connections\" Version=\"1.0.15\" />\r\n    <PackageReference Include=\"ThirdParty.NotUpdatedYet\" Version=\"2.0.0\" />\r\n  </ItemGroup>\r\n</Project>\r\n```\r\n\r\nAfter you've added the direct dependency reference, save your *csproj* file.\r\n\r\nIf you're using Visual Studio, save your updated *csproj* file and Visual Studio will restore the new package versions.\r\nYou can see the restore results by opening the **Output** window (Ctrl+Alt+O) and changing the **Show output from** drop-down list to **Package Manager**.\r\n\r\nIf you're not using Visual Studio, open a command line and change to your project directory. Execute the `dotnet restore` command to restore the new dependencies.\r\n\r\nFinally, you must rebuild your application, test, and redeploy.\r\n\r\n## Other Information\r\n\r\n### Reporting Security Issues\r\n\r\nIf you have found a potential security issue in .NET Core, please email details to secure@microsoft.com.

The `FrameworkReference` includes all the libraries that make up ASP.NET Core. See https://github.com/aspnet/Announcements/issues/325 for the motivation and reason behind this change. For all libraries that are referenced in the `Microsoft.AspNetCore.App` framework, we ignore references in your project of a lower version. For example, if a 2.2 version of `Microsoft.AspNetCore.Server.Kestrel` (one of the libraries in the framework) is also separately referenced by the application, we ignore the 2.2 version when building. These update rules are defined by the `PlatformManifest.txt` file is part of the SDK. Any library in that list has this behavior, earlier references to those libraries are ignored. \r\n\r\nHowever, in 3.0.1 and 3.1.0, we introduced a regression which removed a few select references from the `PlatformManifest.txt` file by mistake.\r\n\r\nLibraries that were _removed_ from the `PlatformManifest.txt` between 3.0.0 and 3.0.1:\r\n\r\n* aspnetcorev2_inprocess.dll (previously part of the Microsoft.AspNetCore.Server.IIS package)\r\n* System.Drawing.Common.dll\r\n* Microsoft.Win32.SystemEvents.dll\r\n* System.Security.Cryptography.Pkcs.dll\r\n\r\nLibraries that were _added_ to the PlatformManifest.txt between 3.0.0 and 3.0.1:\r\n\r\n* Microsoft.Win32.Registry.dll\r\n* System.Security.AccessControl.dll\r\n* System.Security.Cryptography.Cng.dll\r\n* System.Security.Principal.Windows.dll\r\n\r\nThe libraries that were added to the `PlatformManifest.txt` shouldn't adversely affect applications. However, the dependencies _removed_ do affect applications. In particular, the `aspnetcorev2_inprocess.dll` native library is critical to IIS in-process hosting. Issues with this have been reported in a few places (for example https://github.com/aspnet/AspNetCore/issues/17662). We've now identified this is a broader regression.\r\n\r\nIf an application references (directly or transitively) a previous version of the `Microsoft.AspNetCore.Server.IIS`, `System.Drawing.Common`, `Microsoft.Win32.SystemEvents`, or `System.Security.Cryptography.Pkcs` package, it might deploy the older dependency rather than the 3.0/3.1 dependency. This can cause assembly load failures.\r\n\r\n## Workarounds\r\n\r\nUsers may work around this issue by doing one of the following:\r\n\r\n### Remove all direct and indirect references to the affected packages.\r\n\r\nThe following packages include the `aspnetcorev2_inprocess.dll` native library:\r\n\r\n* Microsoft.AspNetCore\r\n* Microsoft.AspNetCore.Server.IIS\r\n\r\nOther affected libraries are contained in packages with the same name. See the above lists.\r\n\r\nThe resolution is to remove these package references from your application. Be aware that they may be transitive dependencies (dependencies of other packages you depend upon).\r\n\r\n### Avoid publishing incorrect package content\r\n\r\nIf you cannot remove earlier versions of the pacakges, you can explicitly suppress those packages from publishing using `ExcludeAssets`:\r\n\r\n```xml\r\n<Project Sdk=\"Microsoft.NET.Sdk.Web\">\r\n\r\n  <PropertyGroup>\r\n    <TargetFramework>netcoreapp3.1</TargetFramework>\r\n  </PropertyGroup>\r\n\r\n  <ItemGroup>\r\n     <PackageReference Include=\"Microsoft.AspNetCore.Server.IIS\" Version=\"2.2.6\" ExcludeAssets=\"All\" /> \r\n  </ItemGroup>\r\n\r\n</Project>\r\n\r\n```\r\n\r\nWe recommend clearing out bin/obj folders before building with the above fix.\r\n","Url":"https://github.com/aspnet/Announcements/issues/398","RelatedDescription":"Open issue \"SDK regression in 3.0.101 and 3.1.100 for ASP.NET Core workloads\" (#398)"},{"Id":"528976515","IsPullRequest":false,"CreatedAt":"2019-11-26T21:16:55","Actor":"rynowak","Number":"396","RawContent":null,"Title":"HttpClient instances created by IHttpClientFactory will now log HTTP status codes as integers instead of with status code names","State":"open","Body":"## HttpClient logging\r\n\r\nHttpClient instances created by IHttpClientFactory will now log HTTP status codes as integers instead of with status code names.\r\n\r\n### Version introduced\r\n\r\n5.0 preview 1\r\n\r\n### Old behavior\r\n\r\nLogging would use the textual descriptions of HTTP status codes:\r\n\r\n```txt\r\nReceived HTTP response after 56.0044ms - OK\r\nEnd processing HTTP request after 70.0862ms - OK\r\n```\r\n\r\n### New behavior\r\n\r\nLogging will use the integer values of HTTP status codes:\r\n\r\n```txt\r\nReceived HTTP response after 56.0044ms - 200\r\nEnd processing HTTP request after 70.0862ms - 200\r\n```\r\n\r\n### Reason for change\r\n\r\nThe original behavior of this logging is inconsistent with other parts of ASP.NET Core that have always used integer values. This inconsistency makes logs hard to query via structured logging systems such as ElasticSearch. See aspnet/Extensions#1549\r\n\r\nUsing integer values is ultimately more flexible than text because it allows queries on ranges of values. \r\n\r\nWe considered adding an additional log value to capture the integer status code, but that would introduce another inconsistency with the rest of ASP.NET Core. HttpClient logging and HTTP server/hosting logging use the same key name (`StatusCode`) already.\r\n\r\n### Recommended action\r\n\r\nThe best option is update logging queries to use the integer values of status codes. While this may cause some difficulty writing queries across multiple ASP.NET Core versions right now, we believe that using integers for this purpose is much more flexible for querying logs. \r\n\r\nIf for some reason you need to force compatibility with the old behavior, and use textual status codes, you can do this by replacing `IHttpClientFactory`'s logging with your own.\r\n\r\n1. Copy the 3.1 versions of [LoggingHttpMessageHandlerBuilderFilter](https://github.com/aspnet/Extensions/blob/release/3.1/src/HttpClientFactory/Http/src/Logging/LoggingHttpMessageHandlerBuilderFilter.cs) [LoggingHttpMessageHandler](https://github.com/aspnet/Extensions/blob/release/3.1/src/HttpClientFactory/Http/src/Logging/LoggingHttpMessageHandler.cs) [LoggingScopeHttpMessageHandler](https://github.com/aspnet/Extensions/blob/master/src/HttpClientFactory/Http/src/Logging/LoggingScopeHttpMessageHandler.cs) and [HttpHeadersLogValue](https://github.com/aspnet/Extensions/blob/master/src/HttpClientFactory/Http/src/Logging/HttpHeadersLogValue.cs) into your project.\r\n\r\n2. Rename these types to avoid conflicts with public types in the `Microsoft.Extensions.Http` package\r\n\r\n3. Replace the built-in implementation of `LoggingHttpMessageHandlerBuilderFilter` with your own inside `Startup.Configure(IServiceProvider services)`\r\n\r\n```cs\r\n        public void ConfigureServices(IServiceCollection services)\r\n        {\r\n            // other service registrations go first\r\n            ....\r\n\r\n            // place after all AddHttpClient registrations\r\n            var descriptors = services.Where(s => s.ServiceType == typeof(IHttpMessageHandlerBuilderFilter));\r\n            foreach (var descriptor in descriptors)\r\n            {\r\n                services.Remove(descriptor);\r\n            }\r\n\r\n            services.AddSingleton<IHttpMessageHandlerBuilderFilter, MyLoggingHttpMessageHandlerBuilderFilter>();\r\n        }\r\n\r\n```\r\n\r\n### Category\r\n\r\nASP.NET\r\n\r\n### Affected APIs\r\n\r\nNot detectable via API analysis\r\n\r\n<!-- Do not modify anything below this line -->\r\n\r\n---\r\n#### Issue metadata\r\n\r\n* Issue type: breaking-change\r\n","Url":"https://github.com/aspnet/Announcements/issues/396","RelatedDescription":"Open issue \"HttpClient instances created by IHttpClientFactory will now log HTTP status codes as integers instead of with status code names\" (#396)"},{"Id":"528274635","IsPullRequest":false,"CreatedAt":"2019-11-25T18:56:51","Actor":"Tratcher","Number":"395","RawContent":null,"Title":"Static File CSV Content-Type Changed to \"text/csv\"","State":"open","Body":"## Static File CSV Content-Type Changed to \"text/csv\"\r\n\r\nThe default Content-Type that StaticFiles uses for `.csv` files is being changed to be the standards compliant value `text/csv`.\r\n\r\nSee https://github.com/aspnet/AspNetCore/issues/17385 for questions and discussion.\r\n\r\n### Version introduced\r\n\r\n5.0\r\n\r\n### Old behavior\r\n\r\nThe Content-Type `application/octet-stream` was used.\r\n\r\n### New behavior\r\n\r\nThe Content-Type `text/csv` is used.\r\n\r\n### Reason for change\r\n\r\nThis complies with [RFC 7111](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc7111#section-5.1).\r\n\r\n### Recommended action\r\n\r\nIf this change impacts your application then the Content-Type mapping can be customized as documented [here](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/aspnet/core/fundamentals/static-files?view=aspnetcore-3.0#fileextensioncontenttypeprovider).\r\n\r\n### Category\r\n\r\nASP.NET\r\n\r\n### Affected APIs\r\n\r\n[FileExtensionContentTypeProvider](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/api/microsoft.aspnetcore.staticfiles.fileextensioncontenttypeprovider?view=aspnetcore-3.0)\r\n\r\n<!-- Do not modify anything below this line -->\r\n\r\n---\r\n#### Issue metadata\r\n\r\n* Issue type: breaking-change\r\n","Url":"https://github.com/aspnet/Announcements/issues/395","RelatedDescription":"Open issue \"Static File CSV Content-Type Changed to \"text/csv\"\" (#395)"},{"Id":"522353373","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2019-11-18T22:17:32","Actor":"timheuer","Number":"394","RawContent":null,"Title":"Adding BC notification workflow","State":"closed","Body":"This adds a simple workflow for the .NET team to better monitor breaking change notifications.\r\n\r\n# Summary\r\nAs a part of the triage and communication process for our partners working on .NET-related products we are automating some breaking-change notification.

InProcess did this via the IServerAddresses feature, which only affects 3.0 applications because the InProcess library is versioned with the framework. OutOfProcess changed to automatically add the ASPNETCORE_HTTPS_PORT environment variable which affected both 2.2 and 3.0 applications because the OutOfProcess component is shared globally. 2.1 apps are not affected because they use a prior version of AspNetCoreModule by default.\r\n\r\nThe 3.0 version of AspNetCoreModule was recently deployed to Azure Web Sites and some users noticed the that this did affect their 2.2 applications as described above.\r\n\r\n### Reason for change\r\n\r\nImproved 3.0 functionality.\r\n\r\n### Recommended action\r\n\r\nIf you want all clients to use HTTPS then no action is required.

These changes impact remote authentication scenarios like OpenIdConnect and WsFederation which must now opt out by sending SameSite=None. However, SameSite=None breaks on iOS 12 and some older versions of other browsers. The application will need to sniff these versions and omit SameSite.\r\n\r\nFor discussion on this issue see https://github.com/aspnet/AspNetCore/issues/14996.\r\n\r\n### Version introduced\r\n\r\n3.1.0-preview1\r\n\r\n### Old behavior\r\n\r\nSameSite is a [2016 draft standard](https://tools.ietf.org/html/draft-west-first-party-cookies-07#section-4.1) extension to HTTP cookies intended to mitigate cross site request forgery (CSRF). This was originally designed as a feature the servers would opt into by adding the new parameters. ASP.NET Core 2.0 added initial support for SameSite.\r\n\r\n### New behavior\r\n\r\nGoogle is now pushing [a new draft standard](https://tools.ietf.org/html/draft-west-cookie-incrementalism-00) that is not backwards compatible. It changes the default mode to Lax and adds a new entry None to opt out. Lax is OK for most application cookies but breaks cross site scenarios like OpenIdConnect and WsFederation login. Most OAuth logins are not affected due to differences in how the request flows. The new None parameter causes compatibility problems with clients that implemented the prior draft standard (e.g. iOS 12). Chrome plans to go live with their changes in Chrome 80 in February 2020.\r\n\r\nASP.NET Core 3.1 has been [updated](https://github.com/aspnet/AspNetCore/pull/13776/files) to implement the new SameSite behavior. This includes redefining the behavior of SameSiteMode.None to emit “SameSite=None” and adding a new value SameSiteMode.Unspecified to omit the SameSite attribute. All cookies APIs now default to Unspecified, though some components that use cookies set values more specific to their scenarios such as the OpenIdConnect correlation and nonce cookies.\r\n\r\nFor other recent changes in this area see the [3.0 announcement](https://github.com/aspnet/Announcements/issues/348) where most defaults were changed from Lax to None (but still using the prior standard).\r\n\r\n### Reason for change\r\n\r\nBrowser and spec changes as outlined above.\r\n\r\n### Recommended action\r\n\r\nApplications that interact with remote sites such as through 3rd party login will need to test those scenarios on multiple browsers, as well as apply the CookiePolicy browser sniffing mitigation discussed below. See below for testing and browser sniffing instructions.\r\nHow to test if you’re affected \r\nTest your web application using a client version that can opt-in to the new behavior. Chrome, Firefox, and Chromium Edge all have new opt-in feature flags that can be used for testing. \r\nYou’ll also want to do compatibility testing with older client versions after you’ve applied the patches, especially Safari. See “Supporting older browsers” below. \r\n \r\nChrome:\r\nChrome 78+ will give you misleading test results as it has a temporary mitigation in place, allowing cookies less than two minutes old. Chrome 76 or 77 with the appropriate test flags turned on will give you more accurate results. To test the new behavior toggle chrome://flags/#same-site-by-default-cookies to enabled. Older versions of Chrome (75 and below) are reported to fail with the new None setting. See “Supporting older browsers” below. \r\nWhilst Google does not make older chrome versions available you can download older versions of Chromium which will suffice for testing. Follow the instructions at https://www.chromium.org/getting-involved/download-chromium, don’t go downloading random assed installers from the internet that say they’re for older versions.  \r\n[Chromium 76 Win64 ](https://commondatastorage.googleapis.com/chromium-browser-snapshots/index.html?prefix=Win_x64/664998/)\r\n[Chromium 74 Win64](https://commondatastorage.googleapis.com/chromium-browser-snapshots/index.html?prefix=Win_x64/638880/)\r\n\r\nSafari:\r\nSafari 12 strictly implemented the prior draft and will fail if it sees the new None value in cookies. This must be avoided via the browser sniffing code shown below. Ensure you test Safari 12 and Safari 13 as well as WebKit based OS style logins using MSAL, ADAL or whatever library you are using. Note that the problem is dependent on the underlying OS version, OSX Mojave (10.14) and iOS 12 are known to have compatibility problems with the new behavior. Upgrading the OS to OSX Catalina (10.15) or iOS 13 fixes the problem. Safari does not currently have an opt-in flag for testing the new spec behavior. \r\n\r\nFirefox:\r\nFirefox support for the new standard can be tested on version 68+ by opting in on the “about:config” page with the feature flag “network.cookie.sameSite.laxByDefault”. There have not been reports of compatibility issues with older versions of Firefox. \r\n\r\nEdge:\r\nWhile Edge supports the old SameSite standard, as of version 44 it did not have any compatibility problems with the new standard. \r\n\r\nEdge (Chromium):\r\nThe feature flag is edge://flags/#same-site-by-default-cookies. No compatibility issues were observed when testing with Edge Chromium 78. \r\n\r\nElectron:\r\nVersions of electron will include older versions of Chromium, for example the version of Electron used by Teams is Chromium 66 which exhibits the older behavior. You must perform your own compatibility testing with the version of Electron your product uses. See “Supporting older browsers” below. \r\n\r\nSupporting older browsers:\r\nThe 2016 SameSite standard mandated that unknown values must be treated as SameSite=Strict values, so any older browsers which support the original standard may break when they see a SameSite property with a value of None. Web applications must implement browser sniffing if they intend to support these old browsers. AspNetCore as a rule does not implement browser sniffing for you because User-Agents values are highly unstable and change on a weekly basis. What is available is an extension point in CookiePolicy allowing you to plug in User-Agent specific logic. \r\n\r\nIn Startup.cs add the following\r\n```\r\nprivate void CheckSameSite(HttpContext httpContext, CookieOptions options) \r\n{ \r\n    if (options.SameSite == SameSiteMode.None) \r\n    { \r\n        var userAgent = httpContext.Request.Headers[\"User-Agent\"].ToString(); \r\n        // TODO: Use your User Agent library of choice here. \r\n        if (/* UserAgent doesn’t support new behavior */) \r\n        { \r\n               options.SameSite = SameSiteMode.Unspecified; \r\n        } \r\n    } \r\n}\r\n\r\npublic void ConfigureServices(IServiceCollection services) \r\n{ \r\n    services.Configure<CookiePolicyOptions>(options => \r\n    { \r\n        options.MinimumSameSitePolicy = SameSiteMode.Unspecified; \r\n        options.OnAppendCookie = cookieContext =>  \r\n            CheckSameSite(cookieContext.Context, cookieContext.CookieOptions); \r\n        options.OnDeleteCookie = cookieContext =>  \r\n            CheckSameSite(cookieContext.Context, cookieContext.CookieOptions); \r\n    }); \r\n} \r\n \r\npublic void Configure(IApplicationBuilder app) \r\n{ \r\n    app.UseCookiePolicy(); // Before UseAuthentication or anything else that writes cookies. \r\n    app.UseAuthentication(); \r\n    // … \r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nOpt-out switches:\r\nThere is a compat switch which enables you to temporarily opt-out of the new ASP.NET Core cookie behavior. Add a runtimeconfig.template.json file to your project containing: \r\n```\r\n{ \r\n  \"configProperties\": { \r\n    \"Microsoft.AspNetCore.SuppressSameSiteNone\": \"true\" \r\n  } \r\n} \r\n```\r\nThis switch will be removed in the next major version.\r\n\r\nOther Versions:\r\nRelated SameSite patches are forthcoming for ASP.NET Core 2.1, 2.2, 3.0, Microsoft.Owin 4.1, and System.Web (.NET 4.7.2+).\r\n\r\n### Category\r\n\r\nASP.NET\r\n\r\n### Affected APIs\r\n\r\n[SameSiteMode](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/api/microsoft.aspnetcore.http.samesitemode)\r\n[CookieOptions.SameSite](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/api/microsoft.aspnetcore.http.cookieoptions.samesite)\r\n[CookieBuilder.SameSite](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/api/microsoft.aspnetcore.http.cookiebuilder.samesite)\r\n[CookiePolicyOptions.MinimumSameSitePolicy](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/api/microsoft.aspnetcore.builder.cookiepolicyoptions.minimumsamesitepolicy) \r\n\r\nMicrosoft.Net.Http.Headers:\r\n[SameSiteMode](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/api/microsoft.net.http.headers.samesitemode)\r\n[SetCookieHeaderValue.SameSite](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/api/microsoft.net.http.headers.setcookieheadervalue.samesite)\r\n\r\n<!-- Do not modify anything below this line -->\r\n\r\n---\r\n#### Issue metadata\r\n\r\n* Issue type: breaking-change\r\n","Url":"https://github.com/aspnet/Announcements/issues/390","RelatedDescription":"Open issue \"Reacting to browser SameSite changes in 3.1.0-preview1, impacts OpenIdConnect\" (#390)"},{"Id":"496088190","IsPullRequest":false,"CreatedAt":"2019-09-20T00:47:11","Actor":"rynowak","Number":"389","RawContent":null,"Title":"JsonResult has moved to the Microsoft.AspNetCore.Mvc.Core assembly","State":"open","Body":"## JsonResult has moved to the Microsoft.AspNetCore.Mvc.Core assembly\r\n\r\nJsonResult has moved to the `Microsoft.AspNetCore.Mvc.Core` assembly.

A remote unauthenticated attacker could exploit this vulnerability by issuing specially crafted requests to the OData application.\r\n\r\nThe update addresses the vulnerability by updating the version of OData ASP.NET Core uses.\r\n\r\n## Discussion\r\n\r\nDiscussion for this issue can be found at https://github.com/aspnet/AspNetCore/issues/13860\r\n\r\n## <a name=\"mitigation-factors\"></a>Mitigation factors\r\n\r\n* If your application does not use ASP.NET Core's OData implementation or your application does not use Azure Storage to store data protect keys you are not affected.\r\n\r\n## <a name=\"affected-software\"></a>Affected software\r\n\r\nAny ASP.NET Core based application that uses `Microsoft.Data.OData.dll` or `Microsoft.AspNetCore.DataProtection.AzureStorage.dll` with a vulnerable version listed below.\r\nAny ASP.NET Core based application that uses the `Microsoft.AspNetCore.All` shared framework with a vulnerable version listed below.\r\n\r\nPackage name | Vulnerable versions | Secure versions\r\n------------ | ---------------- | -------------------------\r\nMicrosoft.AspNetCore.DataProtection.AzureStorage | 2.1.1 <br /> 2.2.0 | 2.1.2 <br /> 2.2.1\r\nMicrosoft.Data.OData | < 5.8.4 | 5.8.4\r\nMicrosoft.AspNetCore.All | 2.1.0 - 2.1.12 <br /> 2.2.0 - 2.2.6 | 2.1.13 <br /> 2.2.7\r\n\r\n### <a name=\"how-affected\"></a>How do I know if I am affected?\r\n\r\n.NET Core has two types of dependencies: direct and transitive. Direct dependencies are dependencies where you specifically add a package to your project, transitive dependencies occur when you add a package to your project that in turn relies on another package.\r\n\r\nFor example, the `Microsoft.AspNetCore.Mvc` package depends on the `Microsoft.AspNetCore.Mvc.Core` package. When you add a dependency on `Microsoft.AspNetCore.Mvc` in your project, you're taking a transitive dependency on `Microsoft.AspNetCore.Mvc.Core`.\r\n\r\nAny application that has a direct or transitive dependency on the [affected package](#affected-software) can be exposed to the vulnerability if it does not meet any of the [mitigation factors](#mitigation-factors).\r\n\r\n### <a name=\"how-fix\"></a>How do I fix the issue?\r\n\r\nTo fix the issue please install the latest version of .NET Core. If you have multiple versions of .NET Core installed you will need to install multiple runtimes, or SDKs depending on what you have installed.\r\n\r\nIf you have .NET Core 2.0 or greater installed, you can list the versions you have installed by running the `dotnet --info` command. You will see output like the following;\r\n\r\n```\r\n.NET Core SDK (reflecting any global.json):\r\n Version:   3.0.100-preview3-010431\r\n Commit:    d72abce213\r\n\r\nRuntime Environment:\r\n OS Name:     Windows\r\n OS Version:  10.0.18362\r\n OS Platform: Windows\r\n RID:         win10-x64\r\n Base Path:   C:\\Program Files\\dotnet\\sdk\\3.0.100-preview3-010431\\\r\n\r\nHost (useful for support):\r\n  Version: 3.0.0-preview3-27503-5\r\n  Commit:  3844df9537\r\n\r\n.NET Core SDKs installed:\r\n  2.1.604 [C:\\Program Files\\dotnet\\sdk]\r\n  2.2.202 [C:\\Program Files\\dotnet\\sdk]\r\n  3.0.100-preview3-010431 [C:\\Program Files\\dotnet\\sdk]\r\n\r\n.NET Core runtimes installed:\r\n  Microsoft.AspNetCore.All 2.1.11 [C:\\Program Files\\dotnet\\shared\\Microsoft.AspNetCore.All]\\\r\n  Microsoft.AspNetCore.All 2.2.3 [C:\\Program Files\\dotnet\\shared\\Microsoft.AspNetCore.All]\r\n  Microsoft.AspNetCore.App 2.1.11 [C:\\Program Files\\dotnet\\shared\\Microsoft.AspNetCore.App]\r\n  Microsoft.AspNetCore.App 2.2.3 [C:\\Program Files\\dotnet\\shared\\Microsoft.AspNetCore.App]\r\n  Microsoft.AspNetCore.App 3.0.0-preview3-19153-02 [C:\\Program Files\\dotnet\\shared\\Microsoft.AspNetCore.App]\r\n  Microsoft.NETCore.App 2.1.11 [C:\\Program Files\\dotnet\\shared\\Microsoft.NETCore.App]\r\n  Microsoft.NETCore.App 2.2.3 [C:\\Program Files\\dotnet\\shared\\Microsoft.NETCore.App]\r\n  Microsoft.NETCore.App 3.0.0-preview3-27503-5 [C:\\Program Files\\dotnet\\shared\\Microsoft.NETCore.App]\r\n  Microsoft.WindowsDesktop.App 3.0.0-preview3-27504-2 [C:\\Program Files\\dotnet\\shared\\Microsoft.WindowsDesktop.App]\r\n\r\nTo install additional .NET Core runtimes or SDKs:\r\n  https://aka.ms/dotnet-download\r\n```\r\n\r\n* For machines running .NET Core 2.1, you should download Runtime 2.1.13 or SDK 2.1.509 for Visual Studio 2017 or SDK 2.1.606 for Visual Studio 2019 (v16.0) or SDK 2.1.802 for Visual Studio 2019 (v16.2) from https://dotnet.microsoft.com/download/dotnet-core/2.1.\r\n* For machines running .NET Core 2.2, you should download Runtime 2.2.7 or SDK 2.2.109 for Visual Studio 2017 or SDK 2.2.206 for Visual Studio 2019 (v16.0) or SDK 2.2.402 for Visual Studio 2019 (v16.2) from https://dotnet.microsoft.com/download/dotnet-core/2.2.\r\n\r\nIf you have both 2.1 and 2.2, you need to install updates for both versions.\r\n\r\nOnce you have installed the updated runtime or SDK, restart your apps for the update to take effect.\r\n\r\nIf you have [pinned your application](https://docs.microsoft.com/dotnet/core/versions/selection) to a specific version of the runtime, you must update your app, recompile and redeploy it for the update to take effect.\r\n\r\nThe affected assemblies are also available separately as a NuGet package. Even if you are not using `Microsoft.AspNetCore.DataProtection.AzureStorage.dll` or `Microsoft.Data.OData` directly you may still be affected if either package is a transitive dependency.\r\n\r\n#### Direct dependencies\r\n\r\nDirect dependencies are discoverable by examining your `csproj` file. They can be fixed by [editing the project file](#fixing-direct-dependencies) or using NuGet to update the dependency.\r\n\r\n#### Transitive dependencies\r\n\r\nTransitive dependencies occur when you add a package to your project that in turn relies on another package. For example, if Contoso publishes a package `Contoso.Utility` which, in turn, depends on `Contoso.Internals` and you add the `Contoso.Utility` package to your project now your project has a direct dependency on `Contoso.Utility` and, because `Contoso.Utility` depends on `Contoso.Internals`, your application gains a transitive dependency on the `Contoso.Internals` package.\r\n\r\nTransitive dependencies are reviewable in two ways:\r\n\r\n* In the Visual Studio Solution Explorer window, which supports searching.\r\n* By examining the `project.assets.json` file contained in the obj directory of your project for `csproj` based projects\r\n\r\nThe `project.assets.json` files are the authoritative list of all packages used by your project, containing both direct and transitive dependencies.\r\n\r\nThere are two ways to view transitive dependencies. You can either [use Visual Studio’s Solution Explorer](#vs-solution-explorer), or you can review [the `project.assets.json` file](#project-assets-json)).\r\n\r\n##### <a name=\"vs-solution-explorer\"></a>Using Visual Studio Solution Explorer\r\n\r\nTo use Solution Explorer, open the project in Visual Studio, and then press Ctrl+; to activate the search in Solution Explorer. Search for the [vulnerable package](#affected-software) and make a note of the version numbers of any results you find.\r\n\r\nFor example, searching for `Microsoft.AspNetCore.Mvc.Core` in an example project that contains a package that takes a dependency on `Microsoft.AspNetCore.Mvc` shows the following results in Visual Studio 2017:\r\n\r\n![Screenshot of search results in Visual Studio 2017](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/796298/25858816/8ecdc2b4-3491-11e7-9363-746804bb9832.png)\r\n\r\nThe search results appear as a tree. In the previous results, you can see that a reference to `Microsoft.AspNetCore.Mvc.Core` version 1.1.2 is discovered.\r\n\r\nUnder the Dependencies node is a NuGet node. Under the NuGet node is the list of packages you have directly taken a dependency on and their versions.\r\nIn screenshot, the application takes a direct dependency on `Microsoft.AspNetCore.Mvc`. `Microsoft.AspNetCore.Mvc` in turn has leaf nodes that list its dependencies and their versions.\r\nThe `Microsoft.AspNetCore.Mvc` package takes a dependency on a version of `Microsoft.AspNetCore.Mvc.ApiExplorer`, that in turn takes a dependency on a version of `Microsoft.AspNetCore.Mvc.Core`.\r\n\r\n##### <a name=\"project-assets-json\"></a> Manually reviewing project.assets.json\r\n\r\nOpen the *project.assets.json* file from your project’s obj directory in your editor. We suggest you use an editor that understands JSON and allows you to collapse and expand nodes to review this file.\r\nVisual Studio and Visual Studio Code provide JSON friendly editing.\r\n\r\nSearch the *project.assets.json* file for the [vulnerable package](#affected-software), using the format `packagename/` for each of the package names from the preceding table. If you find the assembly name in your search:\r\n\r\n* Examine the line on which they are found, the version number is after the `/`.\r\n* Compare to the [vulnerable versions table](#affected-software).\r\n\r\nFor example, a search result that shows `Microsoft.AspNetCore.DataProtection.AzureStorage.dll/2.1.1` is a reference to version 2.1.1 of `Microsoft.AspNetCore.DataProtection.AzureStorage.dll`.\r\n\r\nIf your *project.assets.json* file includes references to the [vulnerable package](#affected-software), then you need to fix the transitive dependencies.\r\n\r\nIf you have not found any reference to any vulnerable packages, this means either\r\n\r\n* None of your direct dependencies depend on any vulnerable packages, or\r\n* You have already fixed the problem by updating the direct dependencies.\r\n\r\n### <a name=\"how-fix\"></a>How do I fix the issue?\r\n\r\n#### <a name=\"fixing-direct-dependencies\"></a>Fixing direct dependencies\r\n\r\nOpen *projectname.csproj* in your editor. If you're using Visual Studio, right-click the project and choose **Edit projectname.csproj** from the context menu, where projectname is the name of your project. Look for `PackageReference` elements. The following shows an example project file:\r\n\r\n```xml\r\n<Project Sdk=\"Microsoft.NET.Sdk.Web\">\r\n  <PropertyGroup>\r\n    <TargetFramework>netcoreapp2.1</TargetFramework>\r\n  </PropertyGroup>\r\n  <ItemGroup>\r\n    <PackageReference Include=\"Microsoft.AspNetCore.DataProtection.AzureStorage.dll\" Version=\"2.1.1 />\r\n  </ItemGroup>\r\n</Project>\r\n```\r\n\r\nThe preceding example has a reference to the [vulnerable package](#affected-software), as seen by the single `PackageReference` element. The name of the package is in the `Include` attribute.\r\nThe package version number is in the `Version` attribute. The previous example shows a single direct dependency on `Microsoft.AspNetCore.DataProtection.AzureStorage.dll` version 2.1.1\r\n\r\nTo update the version to the secure package, change the version number to the updated package version as listed on the table [previously](#affected-software).\r\nIn this example, update `Microsoft.AspNetCore.DataProtection.AzureStorage.dll` to the appropriate [fixed package number](#affected-software) for your major version. Save the *csproj* file. The example *csproj* now looks as follows:\r\n\r\n```xml\r\n<Project Sdk=\"Microsoft.NET.Sdk.Web\">\r\n  <PropertyGroup>\r\n    <TargetFramework>netcoreapp2.1</TargetFramework>\r\n  </PropertyGroup>\r\n  <ItemGroup>\r\n    <PackageReference Include=\"Microsoft.AspNetCore.DataProtection.AzureStorage.dll\" Version=\"2.1.2\" />\r\n  </ItemGroup>\r\n</Project>\r\n```\r\n\r\nIf you're using Visual Studio and you save your updated *csproj* file, Visual Studio will restore the new package version.\r\nYou can see the restore results by opening the **Output** window (Ctrl+Alt+O) and changing the **Show output from** drop-down list to **Package Manager**.\r\n\r\nIf you're not using Visual Studio, open a command line and change to your project directory. Execute the `dotnet restore` command to restore the updated dependencies.\r\n\r\nNow recompile your application. If after recompilation you see a *Dependency conflict warning*, you must update your other direct dependencies to versions that take a dependency on the updated package.\r\n\r\n#### <a name=\"transitive-dependencies\"></a>Fixing transitive dependencies\r\n\r\nIf your transitive dependency review found references to the [vulnerable package](#affected-software), you must add a direct dependency to the updated package to your *csproj* file to override the transitive dependency.\r\n\r\nOpen *projectname.csproj* in your editor. If you're using Visual Studio, right-click the project and choose **Edit projectname.csproj** from the context menu, where projectname is the name of your project.\r\nLook for `PackageReference` nodes, for example:\r\n\r\n```xml\r\n<Project Sdk=\"Microsoft.NET.Sdk.\">\r\n  <PropertyGroup>\r\n    <TargetFramework>net461</TargetFramework>\r\n  </PropertyGroup>\r\n  <ItemGroup>\r\n    <PackageReference Include=\"ThirdParty.NotUpdatedYet\" Version=\"2.0.0\" />\r\n  </ItemGroup>\r\n</Project>\r\n```\r\n\r\nYou must add a direct dependency to the updated version of the [vulnerable package](#affected-software) by adding it to the *csproj* file.\r\nYou do this by adding a new line to the dependencies section, referencing the fixed version.\r\nFor example, if your search showed a transitive reference to a vulnerable `Microsoft.AspNetCore.DataProtection.AzureStorage.dll` version, you'd add a reference to the [fixed package number](#affected-software).\r\n\r\n```xml\r\n<Project Sdk=\"Microsoft.NET.Sdk.Web\">\r\n  <PropertyGroup>\r\n    <TargetFramework>net461</TargetFramework>\r\n  </PropertyGroup>\r\n  <ItemGroup>\r\n    <PackageReference Include=\"Microsoft.AspNetCore.DataProtection.AzureStorage.dll\" Version=\"2.1.2\" />\r\n    <PackageReference Include=\"ThirdParty.NotUpdatedYet\" Version=\"2.0.0\" />\r\n  </ItemGroup>\r\n</Project>\r\n```\r\n\r\nAfter you've added the direct dependency reference, save your *csproj* file.\r\n\r\nIf you're using Visual Studio, save your updated *csproj* file and Visual Studio will restore the new package versions.\r\nYou can see the restore results by opening the **Output** window (Ctrl+Alt+O) and changing the **Show output from** drop-down list to **Package Manager**.\r\n\r\nIf you're not using Visual Studio, open a command line and change to your project directory. Execute the `dotnet restore` command to restore the new dependencies.\r\n\r\n##### Rebuilding your application\r\n\r\nFinally, you must rebuild your application, test, and redeploy.\r\n\r\n# Other Information\r\n\r\n### Reporting Security Issues\r\n\r\nIf you have found a potential security issue in .NET Core, please email details to secure@microsoft.com.

This advisory also provides guidance on what developers can do to update their applications to remove this vulnerability.\r\n\r\nMicrosoft is aware of an elevation of privilege vulnerability exists when a ASP.NET Core web application, created using vulnerable project templates, fails to properly sanitize web requests. An attacker who successfully exploited this vulnerability could perform content injection attacks and run script in the security context of the logged-on user.\r\n\r\nTo exploit the vulnerability, an attacker could send a specially crafted email, containing a malicious link, to a user. Alternatively, an attacker could use a chat client to social engineer a user into clicking the malicious link. However, in all cases to exploit this vulnerability a user must click a maliciously crafted link from an attacker.\r\n\r\nThe update addresses the vulnerability by correcting how the .NET Core web application handles content encoding and updates the application templates to depend on the corrected code libraries.\r\n\r\n## Discussion\r\n\r\nDiscussion for this issue can be found at https://github.com/aspnet/AspNetCore/issues/13859\r\n\r\n## <a name=\"mitigation-factors\"></a>Mitigation factors\r\n\r\nIf your application does not ASP.NET SPA services your application is not vulnerable.\r\n\r\n## <a name=\"affected-software\"></a>Affected software\r\n\r\nAny .NET Core based application running on ASP.NET Core 2.1.0-2.1.1, or ASP.NET Core 2.2.0 or any preview of ASP.NET Core 3.0.\r\n\r\n## <a name=\"affected-software\"></a>Affected software\r\n\r\nAny ASP.NET Core based application that uses `Microsoft.AspNetCore.SpaServices` with a vulnerable version listed below.\r\n\r\nPackage name | Vulnerable versions | Secure versions\r\n------------ | ---------------- | -------------------------\r\nMicrosoft.AspNetCore.SpaServices | 2.1.0-2.1.1 <br /> 2.2.0 | 2.1.2 <br /> 2.2.1\r\n\r\nASP.NET Core v3 will be updated with its RTM release.\r\n\r\n### <a name=\"how-affected\"></a>How do I know if I am affected?\r\n\r\n.NET Core has two types of dependencies: direct and transitive. Direct dependencies are dependencies where you specifically add a package to your project, transitive dependencies occur when you add a package to your project that in turn relies on another package.\r\n\r\nFor example, the `Microsoft.AspNetCore.Mvc` package depends on the `Microsoft.AspNetCore.Mvc.Core` package. When you add a dependency on `Microsoft.AspNetCore.Mvc` in your project, you're taking a transitive dependency on `Microsoft.AspNetCore.Mvc.Core`.\r\n\r\nAny application that has a direct or transitive dependency on the [affected package](#affected-software) can be exposed to the vulnerability if it does not meet any of the [mitigation factors](#mitigation-factors).\r\n\r\n### <a name=\"how-fix\"></a>How do I fix the issue?\r\n\r\nTo fix the issue please install the latest version of .NET Core. If you have multiple versions of .NET Core installed you will need to install multiple runtimes, or SDKs depending on what you have installed.\r\n\r\nIf you have .NET Core 2.0 or greater installed, you can list the versions you have installed by running the `dotnet --info` command.

They can be fixed by [editing the project file](#fixing-direct-dependencies) or using NuGet to update the dependency.\r\n\r\n#### Transitive dependencies\r\n\r\nTransitive dependencies occur when you add a package to your project that in turn relies on another package. For example, if Contoso publishes a package `Contoso.Utility` which, in turn, depends on `Contoso.Internals` and you add the `Contoso.Utility` package to your project now your project has a direct dependency on `Contoso.Utility` and, because `Contoso.Utility` depends 'Contoso.Internals', your application gains a transitive dependency on the `Contoso.Internals` package.\r\n\r\nTransitive dependencies are reviewable in two ways:\r\n\r\n* In the Visual Studio Solution Explorer window, which supports searching.\r\n* By examining the `project.assets.json` file contained in the obj directory of your project for `csproj` based projects\r\n\r\nThe `project.assets.json` files are the authoritative list of all packages used by your project, containing both direct and transitive dependencies.\r\n\r\nThere are two ways to view transitive dependencies. You can either [use Visual Studio’s Solution Explorer](#vs-solution-explorer), or you can review [the `project.assets.json` file](#project-assets-json)).\r\n\r\n##### <a name=\"vs-solution-explorer\"></a>Using Visual Studio Solution Explorer\r\n\r\nTo use Solution Explorer, open the project in Visual Studio, and then press Ctrl+; to activate the search in Solution Explorer. Search for the [vulnerable package](#affected-software) and make a note of the version numbers of any results you find.\r\n\r\nFor example, searching for `Microsoft.AspNetCore.Mvc.Core` in an example project that contains a package that takes a dependency on `Microsoft.AspNetCore.Mvc` shows the following results in Visual Studio 2017:\r\n\r\n![Screenshot of search results in Visual Studio 2017](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/796298/25858816/8ecdc2b4-3491-11e7-9363-746804bb9832.png)\r\n\r\nThe search results appear as a tree. In the previous results, you can see that a reference to `Microsoft.AspNetCore.Mvc.Core` version 1.1.2 is discovered.\r\n\r\nUnder the Dependencies node is a NuGet node. Under the NuGet node is the list of packages you have directly taken a dependency on and their versions.\r\nIn screenshot, the application takes a direct dependency on `Microsoft.AspNetCore.Mvc`. `Microsoft.AspNetCore.Mvc` in turn has leaf nodes that list its dependencies and their versions.\r\nThe `Microsoft.AspNetCore.Mvc` package takes a dependency on a version of `Microsoft.AspNetCore.Mvc.ApiExplorer`, that in turn takes a dependency on a version of `Microsoft.AspNetCore.Mvc.Core`.\r\n\r\n##### <a name=\"project-assets-json\"></a> Manually reviewing project.assets.json\r\n\r\nOpen the *project.assets.json* file from your project’s obj directory in your editor. We suggest you use an editor that understands JSON and allows you to collapse and expand nodes to review this file.\r\nVisual Studio and Visual Studio Code provide JSON friendly editing.\r\n\r\nSearch the *project.assets.json* file for the [vulnerable package](#affected-software), using the format `packagename/` for each of the package names from the preceding table. If you find the assembly name in your search:\r\n\r\n* Examine the line on which they are found, the version number is after the `/`.\r\n* Compare to the [vulnerable versions table](#affected-software).\r\n\r\nFor example, a search result that shows `Microsoft.AspNetCore.SpaServices/2.1.0` is a reference to version 2.1.1 of `Microsoft.AspNetCore.SpaServices`.\r\n\r\nIf your *project.assets.json* file includes references to the [vulnerable package](#affected-software), then you need to fix the transitive dependencies.\r\n\r\nIf you have not found any reference to any vulnerable packages, this means either\r\n\r\n* None of your direct dependencies depend on any vulnerable packages, or\r\n* You have already fixed the problem by updating the direct dependencies.\r\n\r\n### <a name=\"how-fix\"></a>How do I fix the issue?\r\n\r\n#### <a name=\"fixing-direct-dependencies\"></a>Fixing direct dependencies\r\n\r\nOpen *projectname.csproj* in your editor. If you're using Visual Studio, right-click the project and choose **Edit projectname.csproj** from the context menu, where projectname is the name of your project. Look for `PackageReference` elements. The following shows an example project file:\r\n\r\n```xml\r\n<Project Sdk=\"Microsoft.NET.Sdk.Web\">\r\n  <PropertyGroup>\r\n    <TargetFramework>netcoreapp2.1</TargetFramework>\r\n  </PropertyGroup>\r\n  <ItemGroup>\r\n    <PackageReference Include=\"Microsoft.AspNetCore.SpaServices\" Version=\"2.1.1 />\r\n  </ItemGroup>\r\n</Project>\r\n```\r\n\r\nThe preceding example has a reference to the [vulnerable package](#affected-software), as seen by the single `PackageReference` element. The name of the package is in the `Include` attribute.\r\nThe package version number is in the `Version` attribute. The previous example shows a single direct dependency on `Microsoft.AspNetCore.DataProtection.AzureStorage.dll` version 2.1.1\r\n\r\nTo update the version to the secure package, change the version number to the updated package version as listed on the table [previously](#affected-software).\r\nIn this example, update `Microsoft.AspNetCore.SpaServices` to the appropriate [fixed package number](#affected-software) for your major version. Save the *csproj* file. The example *csproj* now looks as follows:\r\n\r\n```xml\r\n<Project Sdk=\"Microsoft.NET.Sdk.Web\">\r\n  <PropertyGroup>\r\n    <TargetFramework>netcoreapp2.1</TargetFramework>\r\n  </PropertyGroup>\r\n  <ItemGroup>\r\n    <PackageReference Include=\"Microsoft.AspNetCore.SpaServices\" Version=\"2.1.2\" />\r\n  </ItemGroup>\r\n</Project>\r\n```\r\n\r\nIf you're using Visual Studio and you save your updated *csproj* file, Visual Studio will restore the new package version.\r\nYou can see the restore results by opening the **Output** window (Ctrl+Alt+O) and changing the **Show output from** drop-down list to **Package Manager**.\r\n\r\nIf you're not using Visual Studio, open a command line and change to your project directory. Execute the `dotnet restore` command to restore the updated dependencies.\r\n\r\nNow recompile your application. If after recompilation you see a *Dependency conflict warning*, you must update your other direct dependencies to versions that take a dependency on the updated package.\r\n\r\n#### <a name=\"transitive-dependencies\"></a>Fixing transitive dependencies\r\n\r\nIf your transitive dependency review found references to the [vulnerable package](#affected-software), you must add a direct dependency to the updated package to your *csproj* file to override the transitive dependency.\r\n\r\nOpen *projectname.csproj* in your editor. If you're using Visual Studio, right-click the project and choose **Edit projectname.csproj** from the context menu, where projectname is the name of your project.\r\nLook for `PackageReference` nodes, for example:\r\n\r\n```xml\r\n<Project Sdk=\"Microsoft.NET.Sdk.\">\r\n  <PropertyGroup>\r\n    <TargetFramework>net461</TargetFramework>\r\n  </PropertyGroup>\r\n  <ItemGroup>\r\n    <PackageReference Include=\"ThirdParty.NotUpdatedYet\" Version=\"2.0.0\" />\r\n  </ItemGroup>\r\n</Project>\r\n```\r\n\r\nYou must add a direct dependency to the updated version of the [vulnerable package](#affected-software) by adding it to the *csproj* file.\r\nYou do this by adding a new line to the dependencies section, referencing the fixed version.\r\nFor example, if your search showed a transitive reference to a vulnerable `Microsoft.AspNetCore.SpaServices` version, you'd add a reference to the [fixed package number](#affected-software).\r\n\r\n```xml\r\n<Project Sdk=\"Microsoft.NET.Sdk.Web\">\r\n  <PropertyGroup>\r\n    <TargetFramework>net461</TargetFramework>\r\n  </PropertyGroup>\r\n  <ItemGroup>\r\n    <PackageReference Include=\"Microsoft.AspNetCore.SpaServices\" Version=\"2.1.2\" />\r\n    <PackageReference Include=\"ThirdParty.NotUpdatedYet\" Version=\"2.0.0\" />\r\n  </ItemGroup>\r\n</Project>\r\n```\r\n\r\nAfter you've added the direct dependency reference, save your *csproj* file.\r\n\r\nIf you're using Visual Studio, save your updated *csproj* file and Visual Studio will restore the new package versions.\r\nYou can see the restore results by opening the **Output** window (Ctrl+Alt+O) and changing the **Show output from** drop-down list to **Package Manager**.\r\n\r\nIf you're not using Visual Studio, open a command line and change to your project directory. Execute the `dotnet restore` command to restore the new dependencies.\r\n\r\n##### Rebuilding your application\r\n\r\nFinally, you must rebuild your application, test, and redeploy.\r\n\r\n# Other Information\r\n\r\n### Reporting Security Issues\r\n\r\nIf you have found a potential security issue in .NET Core, please email details to secure@microsoft.com.

Unfortunately, we missed a critical design flaw which prevents this from working end-to-end.\r\n\r\nTrying to invoke build on a project with a `Counter` component that looked like the following would result in a build error:\r\n```Razor\r\n<Counter @ref=\"myCounter\" />\r\n\r\n@code {\r\n    // This will not compile because there will be no backing field for myCounter\r\n    private readonly int _incrementingBy = myCounter.IncrementAmount;\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nGiven that we're so close to a 3.0 release, we are going to cut this feature from 3.0. We will think about viable solutions to this in future releases, if we can find one, we may consider it then.\r\n\r\n### The problem deep dive\r\nTo summarize the problem effectively, I need to describe how the Razor compilation process works. It's a two-phase process:\r\n\r\n1. Discovery: All the components and directive attributes are discovered. Razor does this by generating a skeleton of each component file and then introspecting on their structure, we call these files declarations. Basically, any content in your Razor file that isn't a directive or inside of a directive block `@code` is thrown out to avoid compilation errors during this phase.\r\n2. Compiling: The actual Razor file compilation where it uses the inputs resolved in phase 1. This phase utilizes all of discovered components to properly parse HTML elements that look like components and uses all of the discovered directive attributes to properly parse those elements corresponding attributes that look like directive attributes.\r\n\r\nThe process is broken into two phases to enable Components to be written in Razor yet also impact other Razor files in the project. This is why you can write a `Counter.razor` file and still recursively use it in the same `Counter.razor` file.\r\n\r\nThe core problem is that during the `discovery` phase the Razor compiler has no awareness of the available components or directive attributes (it hasn't discovered them yet). This means, the `@ref` attribute and other component's existence is not available in this phase. This introduces a problem because a user may have written code in their `@code` block that references the supposed backing field generated from `@ref`; however, during discovery we didn't know about `@ref` so no backing field was generated. This results in Razor skeleton file that can't be compiled or introspected on (C# errors). We considered working around this limitation by hard coding `@ref` to not require the first phase but quickly found that would not work either because if a user writes `<Counter @ref=\"myCounter\" />` We need to generate a proper type name for the auto-generated backing field (`private Counter myCounter;`) which isn't reliably available because during the discovery phase we haven't yet discovered anything (it's not till phase 2 that we know of `Counter`).\r\n\r\n### Workaround\r\nIn 3.0.0-preview8 in order to utilize the `@ref` attribute you must do:\r\n\r\n```razor\r\n<button @ref=\"myButton\" @ref:suppressField />\r\n@code {\r\n    ElementReference myButton;\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nOnce 3.0.0-preview9 and up ships you will be able to use the older syntax such as:\r\n\r\n```razor\r\n<button @ref=\"myButton\" />\r\n@code {\r\n    ElementReference myButton;\r\n}\r\n```","Url":"https://github.com/aspnet/Announcements/issues/381","RelatedDescription":"Open issue \"[Blazor] Removing automatic backing field support for @ref in 3.0.0-preview9\" (#381)"}],"ResultType":"GitHubIssue"},"Twitter":{"ResultType":"TwitterTimeline","Tweets":[{"Id":"1243239505353560065","CreatedAt":"2020-03-26T18:12:51+00:00","UserScreenname":"aspnet","Text":"Blazor WebAssembly 3.2.0 Preview 3 release now available\n\n🔥Debugging in Visual Studio and Visual Studio Code\n🔥Auto-… https://t.co/I4yqgl2Omi","Source":"<a href=\"https://about.twitter.com/products/tweetdeck\" rel=\"nofollow\">TweetDeck</a>","RetweetCount":196,"FavoriteCount":103,"RawContent":null},{"Id":"1242602096756551681","CreatedAt":"2020-03-25T00:00:00+00:00","UserScreenname":"aspnet","Text":"#ASPNET Community Links for this week: https://t.co/JQVWDnn5qR","Source":"<a href=\"https://about.twitter.com/products/tweetdeck\" rel=\"nofollow\">TweetDeck</a>","RetweetCount":13,"FavoriteCount":7,"RawContent":null},{"Id":"1242582293530603520","CreatedAt":"2020-03-24T22:41:19+00:00","UserScreenname":"aspnet","Text":"Starting in a few minutes!
