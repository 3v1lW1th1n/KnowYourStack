This would allow mixed version use of Vue in a complex system. For example, a CMS could use Vue for part of it's gui using an ES6 module, and the website owner could include Vue.js as a direct <script> include without conflicts.\r\n\r\nThis would allow the integration of Vue into larger more complex systems without having constantly battle edge use cases where code would conflict, or micro-manage version differences in a single shared Vue.js instance.\r\n \r\nAlso, a specific use for us is we'd like to implement Vue a piece at a time, where we have many multiple SPA's in administration areas, but don't want the overhead of compiling Vue for each SPA, where an ES6 module could be cached, and loaded on each SPA individually.\r\n\r\n### What does the proposed API look like?\r\n```javascript\r\nimport esvue from './vue.esm.browser.js';\r\nconsole.log(esvue);\r\n```\r\nAdd add an official browser based ES6 build. I found this file in the NPM repo:\r\nhttps://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/vue@2.5.17/dist/vue.esm.browser.js\r\n\r\nFrom here: https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/vue/dist/ \r\n\r\nThis is the official link to the repo from the Vuejs.org installation page:\r\nhttps://vuejs.org/v2/guide/installation.html#Explanation-of-Different-Builds\r\n\r\nAnd it looks like this idea was attempted, or possibly in development. I want to add my support and request this become a standard version of Vue available with the latest updates.\r\n\r\nThanks!\r\n\r\nEdit: We would start implementation tests today if we had a build of the latest version of Vue.js in  vue.esm.browser.js\r\n\r\nNote: Browser version support is not an issue for our administration tools, so using ES6 modules is ideal as it supports our future development needs as well as future proofing our development environment at the same time as allow us to integrate changes slowly in a complex system.\r\n<!-- generated by vue-issues.

Unlike the other issue I found (https://github.com/vuejs/vue-router/issues/954) where it appeared the user wanted to destroy and create a new router in the same application, the issue I am having is completely separate. \r\n\r\nI have a massive application that essentially uses pjax methodologies to be able to run several SPAs (vue being one) that create the full site. When we navigate away from one SPA to another, the SPA needs to destroy itself so it's code does not interfere with the other SPAs. However, because the vue router cannot be destroyed; it's attempting to execute logic for routing even when the SPA that created it is destroyed. The issue compounds when we have more than 1 vue application running, as there are now 2 instances of vue-router (or more) running at a time. \r\n\r\nSpecifically, we are using the hash version of routing. It looks like the router just attaches an event to the window and listens for popstates, but things get weird when more than one event does something with popstate (an understandably oddball behavior).  I would appreciate reconsideration for allowing vue-router to destroy itself when appropriate. Thanks!\r\n\r\n[edited for spelling/grammar]\r\n\r\n<!-- generated by vue-issues.
