It's potentially possible to mitigate this by using some combination of `ArrayPool` and `RecyclableMemoryStream`, but that solution adds complexity and dependencies on further external libraries.\r\n\r\nFortunately it turns out we can bypass all of that, eliminate all the temporary buffers, and stream directly to the underlying MessagePack output buffer. All that's really needed is:\r\n\r\n 1. To understand [how binary blobs are represented in the MessagePack spec](https://github.com/msgpack/msgpack/blob/master/spec.md#bin-format-family) (it's straightforwards: it's a length-prefixed array)\r\n 2. To encapsulate that knowledge in a `Stream` subclass so that `RenderBatchWriter` can pipe its output into it.\r\n\r\nStep 2 is equivalent to piping to a `MemoryStream`, then calling `MessagePackBinary.WriteBytes(ref buffer, offset, memoryStream.GetBuffer(), memoryStream.Length)`, but without needing the temporary

traffic","State":"closed","Body":"Fixes #1219, and if we include the RecyclableMemoryStreamManager part, also #1132\r\n\r\nThis PR is a response to #1219. The goal is to make server-rendered Blazor send less data over the wire. In #1219 we found that changing the stock FetchData page to return 500 forecasts caused it to send about 240KB over the websocket connection on its initial render, which is far more than the equivalent HTML.\r\n\r\nThis PR implements two optimisations:\r\n\r\n1. When `RenderBatchWriter` builds its string table, it now de-duplicates the strings. This reduces the 500-forecasts size from 243504 bytes to 137569 bytes (56% of original).\r\n2. The serialized render batch data is now gzip-compressed. This further reduces the 500-forecasts size from 137569 bytes to 7705 bytes (3% of original).\r\n\r\nSo in summary, **this PR reduces the bandwidth requirement in the large-table scenario by 97%**.\r\n\r\nFor smaller payloads the percentage reduction would be less but really it's the bigger payloads that need optimisation most anyway.\r\n\r\n**CR notes:** I'm a bit on the fence about whether to include the `Microsoft.IO.RecyclableMemoryStream` part. [It claims to make a big difference in eliminating large-object-heap bottlenecks](http://www.philosophicalgeek.com/2015/02/06/announcing-microsoft-io-recycablememorystream/), but I haven't got any measurements of that in our case. There's probably nothing harmful about using it, since it's been around for a while and pretty well battle-tested in some critical scenarios such as Bing.

After consultation with security specialists, we've decided not to rely on gzip by default. Instead we intend to shrink the traffic by using more compact but fixed representations so as to avoid any potential issues.\r\n\r\nStrategies:\r\n\r\n1. Represent numbers as LEB128 instead of 4-byte ints. Also remove padding from edit frames and render tree frames.\r\n    * This reduces the 500-item weather forecast test case from ~246500 bytes to ~135000 bytes\r\n2. Deduplicate *only* HTML element names, attribute names, and pure whitespace\r\n    * This reduces it further to ~40200 bytes\r\n3. Stop writing out lists of array indices. These simplified things for the deserializer, but we can just make the deserializer do more work.\r\n    * This reduces it further to ~34000 bytes\r\n\r\nSo in total, without relying on compression, we can reduce the traffic to about 14% of the original. This is also a good amount more compact that the equivalent HTML representation (about a third smaller).\r\n\r\nThe proposal is to do only point (2) in 0.6.0, because it's very cheap to implement.
