This will be collected at runtime. This change is part of a few changes, and as such doesn't actually remove the files yet as they are needed for some mapping into another part of the validation system. A subsequent change will update that part of the validation system."},{"Id":"9558922920","Type":"PullRequestEvent","CreatedAt":"2019-05-03T15:20:38","Actor":"twsouthwick","Repository":"OfficeDev/Open-XML-SDK","Organization":"OfficeDev","RawContent":null,"RelatedAction":"merged","RelatedUrl":"https://github.com/OfficeDev/Open-XML-SDK/pull/589","RelatedDescription":"Merged pull request \"Clean up some validation tests and add tests for ReadOnlyArray\" (#589) at OfficeDev/Open-XML-SDK","RelatedBody":""},{"Id":"9555657901","Type":"PullRequestEvent","CreatedAt":"2019-05-03T04:45:40","Actor":"twsouthwick","Repository":"OfficeDev/Open-XML-SDK","Organization":"OfficeDev","RawContent":null,"RelatedAction":"opened","RelatedUrl":"https://github.com/OfficeDev/Open-XML-SDK/pull/589","RelatedDescription":"Opened pull request \"Clean up some validation tests and add tests for ReadOnlyArray\" (#589) at OfficeDev/Open-XML-SDK","RelatedBody":""}],"ResultType":"GitHubEvent"},"PowerTools":{"Events":[],"ResultType":"GitHubEvent"}},"RunOn":"2019-05-08T05:30:46.0624848Z","RunDurationInMilliseconds":758}
