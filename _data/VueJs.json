Update the time property as part of an animation, but don't touch the other data. The animation will be janky due to garbage collection, even though the majority of the data is untouched.\r\n\r\n### What is expected?\r\nSmoother animation since only a single numeric property is being updated.\r\n\r\n### What is actually happening?\r\nAs far as I can tell, the updating of reactive components is clogged up by the rest of the data, and even though a single number is being updated, the browser doesn't know to release the memory each time that property is updated. This leads to large garbage collections which cause jank in the animation.\r\n\r\n---\r\nI realize that the minimal reproduction i've linked to is a bit questionable. But i arrived at this problem with a more realistic scenario, where i was using a webworker to generate a lot of data, and storing it in a vuex instance. This data was not being updated at all during the animation, but was used to determine what the animation state was. However even without reading the bulky data, a simple update of a \"time\" property i was using to set the time of the animation was causing a huge amount of memory allocation. I will send screenshots of the _actual_ app I am developing so you can see.\r\n\r\n<!-- generated by vue-issues.

Toggle the top button several times.\r\n2. Note that the \"Actual localStorage value” line in both the top and bottom sections toggles in response to `localStorage.is_dark` switching between `true` and `false`. Alternatively, open the browser dev tools and directly observe `localStorage.is_dark` changing.\r\n3. Note that the “Vue isDark prop value” line also toggles, but this is simply the data option `isDark` property itself toggling.\r\n4. Toggle the bottom button several times.\r\n5. Note that the \"Actual localStorage value” line in **neither** the top nor bottom sections toggles in response, though both should.\r\n6. Note that the “Vue isDarkMixin prop value” line does toggle, as this is simply the data option `isDarkMixin` property itself toggling.\r\n\r\n### What is expected?\r\nWhether placed in a component, a mixin, or the root of the Vue instance, the functionality of the `isDark` and `isDarkMixin` properties should be the same in terms of toggling `localStorage.is_dark`, but it isn't. It works in a component or in the root, but doesn't work in a mixin.\r\n\r\n### What is actually happening?\r\nIdentical getter/setter data property code placed in a mixin does not have the same effect on a localStorage variable as it does elsewhere. It actually has no effect at all.\r\n\r\n---\r\nI can't help but wonder why mixin behavior in this use case differs from component behavior.

Clicking on the home tab (router link) destroys the about component and resets lingeringObj to null- this causes the LingeringObject to get removed by the garbage collector- this is all fine, and can be tested by taking a heap snapshots in chrome. Now, the memory leak that I've noticed happens when you use the 'Go Home' button on the about tab. This uses router.push() instead of a \\<router-link\\>. After clicking the Go Home button, if you take a snapshot, you'll notice the LingeringObject is still in memory. What's even weirder is when you inspect the object to see what is still holding onto a reference of it- it's showing HTMLButtonElement, which is the Go Home button. Very peculiar. According to the [vue router documentation](https://router.vuejs.org/guide/essentials/navigation.html#router-push-location-oncomplete-onabort): \"...clicking \\<router-link :to=\"...\"\\> is the equivalent of calling router.push(...).\"\r\n\r\nHere is the source code for the reproduction link:\r\nhttps://github.com/ChuckFields/VueRouterLingeringObject\r\n\r\n### What is expected?\r\nThe LingeringObject to get removed from memory when using router.push()\r\n\r\n### What is actually happening?\r\nIt's staying in memory\r\n\r\n<!-- generated by vue-issues.

But if I decide to create an additional route afterwards, this would not be available as the catch-all route would take priority.\r\n\r\nFor example, I want to allow administrator users to press an \"Add content to this URL\" button when they land on a URL that doesn't exist in the route list. In order to achieve this, I would need to create a new route for the non-existent URL *before* the catch-all route. The only alternative I can currently see is to completely refresh the page using a POST request to add the URL or to dismantle and recreate the Vue.$router object.\r\n\r\n### What does the proposed API look like?\r\nFor my specific use-case, I expect the desired behaviour could be achieved by adding an optional \"before\" parameter to the addRoutes function e.g. `router.addRoutes([ { path:\"/new-page\" } ], catchAllRoute)`.
