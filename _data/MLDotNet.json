That key-valued column can be either a scalar, vector, or unknown size vector. Much of the logic in this method did not seem to conform to my understanding of what the transformer is doing (and, in one case, *should* be doing but isn't). It may be that we need some more test coverage for this, in addition to fixing the bugs, if I am right about any of these.\r\n\r\n## Bug 1: The Type Test\r\n\r\nLet's review the type test:\r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/dotnet/machinelearning/blob/bb92c06f7207546377f63d969ffe063780ee4922/src/Microsoft.ML.Data/Transforms/KeyToVector.cs#L770\r\n\r\nI see some problems here:\r\n\r\n* This is the \"key to vector\" transform, yet, there is no test to see if it is a key?\r\n\r\n* Instead first we see that it fails if it's of an unknown `DataKind` (which seems totally besides the point).\r\n\r\n* We also see that we have this totally unnecessary `ItemType.GetItemType()`, which considering the description is not necessary.\r\n\r\n* Related: later on we see `col.ItemType is VectorType`, which according to the documentation here could never be the case anyway:\r\n\r\n \r\n https://github.com/dotnet/machinelearning/blob/bb92c06f7207546377f63d969ffe063780ee4922/src/Microsoft.ML.Core/Data/IEstimator.cs#L46-L49\r\n\r\n* `col.ItemType is PrimitiveType` is totally redundant given that we already had the much stronger test that it was one of the \"known\" datakinds. (Which, again, is still completely wrong.)\r\n\r\nSo, I think practically, we might have a much stronger test if we dropped practically all this matter and just tested `col.IsKey`. *Maybe* also verify that the raw type is not `ulong` or something. But, the rest of this doesn't make a lot of sense to me.\r\n\r\n## Bug 2: Error message\r\n\r\nNow what does that test lead to... it leads to this exception being thrown:\r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/dotnet/machinelearning/blob/bb92c06f7207546377f63d969ffe063780ee4922/src/Microsoft.ML.Data/Transforms/KeyToVector.cs#L771\r\n\r\nIf you trace through to what becomes the exception message, it becomes this:\r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/dotnet/machinelearning/blob/bb92c06f7207546377f63d969ffe063780ee4922/src/Microsoft.ML.Core/Utilities/Contracts.cs#L463\r\n\r\nWhich is of course not right. \"Luckily,\" the test above was so screwed up that the only conceivable way a user could run into it is if they fed in an image type, if I interpret it correctly.\r\n\r\n## Bug 3: The metadata tests.\r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/dotnet/machinelearning/blob/bb92c06f7207546377f63d969ffe063780ee4922/src/Microsoft.ML.Data/Transforms/KeyToVector.cs#L774-L780\r\n\r\nThe first batch of metadata should verify that the type is of `col.Kind == SchemaShape.Column.VectorKind.Vector`. Instead, it only verifies it's not a *variable* vector. but apparently scalar values are just fine. :)\r\n\r\nFor the second metadata, this is sort of a bug more on the transformer itself than the estimator: given that the behavior of bagging is only relevant on *vectors* of keys, `CategoricalSlotRanges` should be added as metadata on a scalar source column only (or, I guess, ideally on a vector of length 1); if it's not a scalar (or vector of length 1), then it could not be a one-hot vector anyway, and so could not be encoding a categorical value. Might be more a @codemzs problem.\r\n\r\nThe third metadata looks actually reasonable, at least at first glance.\r\n\r\n## Bug 4: The column type.\r\n\r\nIf bagging is off, *and* the input is a variable sized vector, then the output will be a variable sized vector as well. Yet we see the result is unconditionally a `.Vector`, which does not cover that case:\r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/dotnet/machinelearning/blob/bb92c06f7207546377f63d969ffe063780ee4922/src/Microsoft.ML.Data/Transforms/KeyToVector.cs#L782\r\n\r\n/cc @Ivanidzo4ka ","Url":"https://github.com/dotnet/machinelearning/issues/2185","RelatedDescription":"Open issue \"Tests in KeyToVectorMappingEstimator.GetOutputSchema seem wrong\" (#2185)"},{"Id":"400549736","IsPullRequest":false,"CreatedAt":"2019-01-18T02:47:11","Actor":"Dandjinh","Number":"2184","RawContent":null,"Title":"failed when adding ML.NET package","State":"open","Body":"### System information\r\nD:\\Works\\Codes\\CSharpPrjs\\dotNetPrjs\\myApp>dotnet --info\r\n.NET Core SDK（反映任何 global.json）:\r\n Version:   2.2.103\r\n Commit:    8edbc2570a\r\n\r\n运行时环境:\r\n OS Name:     Windows\r\n OS Version:  10.0.17134\r\n OS Platform: Windows\r\n RID:         win10-x64\r\n Base Path:   C:\\Program Files\\dotnet\\sdk\\2.2.103\\\r\n\r\nHost (useful for support):\r\n  Version: 2.2.1\r\n  Commit:  878dd11e62\r\n\r\n.NET Core SDKs installed:\r\n  2.2.103 [C:\\Program Files\\dotnet\\sdk]\r\n\r\n.NET Core runtimes installed:\r\n  Microsoft.AspNetCore.All 2.2.1 [C:\\Program Files\\dotnet\\shared\\Microsoft.AspNetCore.All]\r\n  Microsoft.AspNetCore.App 2.2.1 [C:\\Program Files\\dotnet\\shared\\Microsoft.AspNetCore.App]\r\n  Microsoft.NETCore.App 2.2.1 [C:\\Program Files\\dotnet\\shared\\Microsoft.NETCore.App]\r\n\r\nTo install additional .NET Core runtimes or SDKs:\r\n  https://aka.ms/dotnet-download\r\n\r\n### Issue\r\n\r\nI just followed [ML.NET Tutorial](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/learn/machinelearning-ai/ml-dotnet-get-started-tutorial) but failed when adding ML.NET package.\r\n\r\n### Source code / logs\r\n\r\nD:\\Works\\Codes\\CSharpPrjs\\dotNetPrjs\\myApp>dotnet add package Microsoft.ML --version 0.9.0\r\n  Writing C:\\Users\\34460\\AppData\\Local\\Temp\\tmp40CD.tmp\r\ninfo : 正在将包“Microsoft.ML”的 PackageReference 添加到项目“D:\\Works\\Codes\\CSharpPrjs\\dotNetPrjs\\myApp\\myApp.csproj”。\r\nlog  : 正在还原 D:\\Works\\Codes\\CSharpPrjs\\dotNetPrjs\\myApp\\myApp.csproj 的包...\r\nerror: 无法解析 .NETCoreApp,Version=v2.2 的“Microsoft.ML (>= 0.9.0)”。\r\nerror: 包“Microsoft.ML”与项目“D:\\Works\\Codes\\CSharpPrjs\\dotNetPrjs\\myApp\\myApp.csproj”中的“all”框架不兼容。\r\n","Url":"https://github.com/dotnet/machinelearning/issues/2184","RelatedDescription":"Open issue \"failed when adding ML.NET package\" (#2184)"},{"Id":"400516192","IsPullRequest":false,"CreatedAt":"2019-01-18T00:33:37","Actor":"CESARDELATORRE","Number":"2181","RawContent":null,"Title":"Load Http","State":"closed","Body":"### System information\r\n\r\n- **OS version/distro**:\r\n- **.NET Version (eg., dotnet --info)**: \r\n\r\n### Issue\r\n\r\n- **What did you do?**\r\n- **What happened?**\r\n- **What did you expect?**\r\n\r\n### Source code / logs\r\n\r\nPlease paste or attach the code or logs or traces that would be helpful to diagnose the issue you are reporting.\r\n","Url":"https://github.com/dotnet/machinelearning/issues/2181","RelatedDescription":"Closed issue \"Load Http\" (#2181)"},{"Id":"400518940","IsPullRequest":false,"CreatedAt":"2019-01-18T00:16:27","Actor":"CESARDELATORRE","Number":"2183","RawContent":null,"Title":"Support in TextReader/TextLoader.Read() for loading dataset files through HTTP (such as from Azure Blobs) in addition to files on the local drive ","State":"open","Body":"This can be a very common scenario if the data is not available locally.\r\n\r\nWe could ready it from Azure Storage Blobs by allowing the TextReader/TextLoader.Read() method to load files through HTTP (such as from Azure Blobs) in addition to files on the local drive that it does today.\r\n\r\nWith an overriden .Read() method providing additional parameters like:\r\n\r\nurl:\"http://any-azure-blob-url/sales.csv\"\r\nsecretKey:\"AgJQV/hHBVymD735hFOzveX4qz54YrO6q8WsM6nyb345l67 \r\n\r\nAnd any other Azure credentials needed.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n","Url":"https://github.com/dotnet/machinelearning/issues/2183","RelatedDescription":"Open issue \"Support in TextReader/TextLoader.Read() for loading dataset files through HTTP (such as from Azure Blobs) in addition to files on the local drive \" (#2183)"},{"Id":"400509207","IsPullRequest":false,"CreatedAt":"2019-01-17T23:33:37","Actor":"wschin","Number":"2179","RawContent":null,"Title":"Number of feature columns","State":"open","Body":"It has been a while that ML.NET assumes only one feature column can exist in a training pipeline.

Or we can introduce another API which accepts multiple feature (even label) columns. @TomFinley, @eerhardt, any comments please?","Url":"https://github.com/dotnet/machinelearning/issues/2179","RelatedDescription":"Open issue \"Number of feature columns\" (#2179)"},{"Id":"400497571","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2019-01-17T23:17:35","Actor":"najeeb-kazmi","Number":"2178","RawContent":null,"Title":"Fix broken build","State":"closed","Body":"Fixes build broken in #2125 \r\n","Url":"https://github.com/dotnet/machinelearning/pull/2178","RelatedDescription":"Closed or merged PR \"Fix broken build\" (#2178)"},{"Id":"400482464","IsPullRequest":false,"CreatedAt":"2019-01-17T22:02:44","Actor":"sfilipi","Number":"2177","RawContent":null,"Title":"The parameter descriptions should distinguish between columns and column names.
