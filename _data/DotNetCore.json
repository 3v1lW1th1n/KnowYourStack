However, this separation has led to a variety of complications for contributors and maintainers alike.  For example:\r\n- **Confusion about where issues should be opened.**  It’s not always clear in which repo an issue should be reported, complicated by the fact that some implementations actually span repositories (e.g. a type might be exposed through a reference assembly and have its tests in corefx but actually be implemented in System.Private.CoreLib in coreclr).\r\n- **Difficulty sharing source.**  System.Private.CoreLib is intricately connected to the rest of the runtime, and thus has lived with the runtime code.  That, however, means that although corefx has been intended as the place to share as much core library code as possible across any underlying runtime, we’ve needed to keep a significant body of code in System.Private.CoreLib, which then has meant it’s needed to be “mirrored” to each runtime repo (coreclr, corert, mono) that needs to consume it as source; similarly, corefx has similarly required access to much of that source, for example to use the same interop DllImports that are employed elsewhere in the runtimes.  The automatic mirror that shares this source needs to be maintained, and even when it has been, it’s often led to lag.  It’s also complicated developer processes, where to validate a change in one repo generally requires manually mirroring the code to other local repos in order to validate the change and ensure merging into one repo won’t break the others.\r\n- **PRs spanning multiple repos.**  Because the runtime, CoreLib, and the core libraries are all intricately linked, changing runtime behaviors, adding new APIs, or changing various build processes (e.g. improving static analysis) often requires multiple PRs carefully staged across time and multiple repos.  For example, to add a new method to a type like Dictionary<>, a developer must first make the source changes in her local coreclr repo and the test and reference assembly changes in her local corefx repo.  When satisfied with the fix, the developer must submit a PR to coreclr as well as a PR to corefx, the latter of which will fail.  Eventually the coreclr PR will be merged, and the changes will mirror to the other runtimes that also require the update.  Eventually those mirror PRs will be merged, and builds will be created containing the fix for each runtime.  At some point later those builds will be consumed into the corefx repo, after which point the original corefx PR can be re-validated and eventually merged.  That’s the best case; things get more complicated in situations where there are bidirectional dependencies.\r\n- **Building an installable runtime.** Self-hosting a custom built .NET requires intricate knowledge of how all the repos work and interact.  A developer can’t just clone a single repo, make a desired change, and easily produce an installer.\r\n- **Consistency.**  One goal we had for more fine-grained repos was to enable isolation and independence for teams working within each repo’s confines, but this has led to non-trivial duplication of effort on things like build systems and CI, and then the resulting lack of consistency as each system ends up diverging from the others.\r\n\r\nThe issues go beyond the runtime.  For example, the ASP.NET maintainers and community did a great job in the past year or so consolidating from ~55 repos down to ~5 repos, but that’s still more repos than is desirable, leading to similar issues as cited above for the runtime.  On top of that, these ASP.NET repositories are in the aspnet GitHub org, which adds an additional set of issues, for example:\r\n- **Complications moving issues between repos.**  If a developer opens an issue in aspnet/aspnetcore and it’s determined that the cause of the issue is actually in dotnet/corefx, there is no GitHub mechanism to enable easily moving that issue across the aspnet to dotnet organizational boundary.\r\n- **Permissions.** Each organization’s permissions end up needing to be managed and maintained separately.\r\n\r\nThe issues extend into tooling as well.  For example, we currently have multiple repositories that all logically make up the dotnet CLI, but actually creating a working installer spans multiple repos.\r\n\r\n### Plan\r\n\r\nTo address these issues, we’re planning to make some changes to our repository structure:\r\n- **dotnet/platform.**  We plan to combine dotnet/coreclr, dotnet/corefx, dotnet/corert, dotnet/core-setup, and the relevant portions of mono/mono into a new dotnet/platform repo.  Everything needed to build and produce the Microsoft.NETCore.App shared framework will be in this repo.  We will no longer suffer from the complications of source mirroring.  Features like changing runtime behavior or adding an API will no longer require a complicated dance across multiple repos.  Etc.\r\n- **dotnet/aspnetcore.**  We plan to move the existing aspnet/aspnetcore repository into the dotnet organization.  Along with that, we aim to combine a variety of the other aspnet repositories into aspnetcore, such as aspnet/blazor.  Whether repos like entityframeworkcore remain separate or combined remains an open question.  A goal is that, just as dotnet/platform will be responsible for the creation of Microsoft.NETCore.App, dotnet/aspnetcore will be responsible for the creation of Microsoft.AspNETCore.App.\r\n- **dotnet/cli.**  We plan to combine dotnet/toolset and dotnet/sdk into the dotnet/cli repo.\r\n\r\n## To discuss these plans, please comment on the corresponding issue at https://github.com/dotnet/coreclr/issues/26175.\r\n\r\n### FAQ\r\n\r\n#### Why are we merging repos?\r\n\r\nWe believe we can significantly improve several aspects of .NET on GitHub by combining repos, benefiting both maintainers and contributors.  These improvements will manifest in a variety of ways, such as in better issue management, much easier models of contribution, and easier and faster ways to build and install the resulting bits.\r\n\r\n####  What will happen to the aspnet org?\r\n\r\nThe aspnet org as a separate entity is legacy and artificial.  In time we hope to absorb it into the dotnet org and sunset the aspnet org.\r\n\r\n#### Will the coreclr and corefx repos go away?\r\n\r\nWith the help of GitHub, we plan to migrate all issues from these repos to the new dotnet/platform repo, and then lock down creation of additional issues, such that the repos will no longer be used for issue management.  We will also inhibit the creation of PRs to the master branch, which will effectively become an archive for read-only review of history.  In this sense, these repos will be archived, and no active development will happen with them.  However, we plan to continue servicing previous .NET Core releases out of these repos, so the various release branches (e.g. release/2.1, release/3.0, etc.) will continue to see (limited) activity.\r\n\r\n#### Will the mono repo go away?\r\n\r\nNo. mono/mono contains the source for the full mono stack and will continue to live on happily.  We will simply be moving the managed source associated with System.Private.CoreLib and copying the relatively small amount of source that makes up the native mono runtime to dotnet/platform.  We may choose to then use some mirroring technology to keep the runtime copy in sync (this will, however, not suffer from the same mirroring issues we currently experience, as we would not be mirroring between two components required to build the same binaries), or we may choose to let them diverge and manually sync only those changes deemed relevant to both implementations.\r\n\r\n#### Will the corert repo go away?\r\n\r\nYes.  We plan to retire/archive the corert repo.  Some of the technology in the corert repo will be migrated to the master branch of dotnet/platform, where it will be productized as part of .NET.  Other portions of the corert repo will be migrated to feature branches of dotnet/platform, where the experimentation can continue.  In this way, we will use feature branches to continue experimenting with the corert technology, while making it easier to share portions with its shipping counterpart and also graduate functionality into master if/when it’s ready.\r\n\r\n#### Does this mean there will be a single repo for all of .NET?\r\n\r\nNo.  We will be reducing the number of repos that contribute to .NET, but currently we do not believe that going all the way down to one is the right answer.\r\n\r\n#### Doesn’t this mean that issue and PR tracking will now be overwhelming?\r\n\r\nIt is already the case that the vast majority of issues in a given repo are not relevant to any individual developer, and with several thousand open issues in each repo and on the order of a hundred open PRs in each, we already need systems (e.g. labels) to successfully manage issues and PRs.  As such, we don’t believe the merging will have a significant impact on this aspect of developer productivity.  If it turns out to have an unexpectedly large negative impact, we will work with the community to find ways to mitigate the problem.  However, there are already a multitude of successful open source projects on GitHub with at least an order of magnitude more issues.\r\n\r\n#### What will happen to existing issues?\r\n\r\nWith the help of GitHub functionality, we plan to migrate all issues from old repos (e.g. dotnet/coreclr, dotnet/corefx) to the new repos (e.g. dotnet/platform).  We may also use this as a forcing function to revisit stale issues and either close those that are no longer relevant or reinvigorate those that are demanding of more immediate attention.\r\n\r\n#### What about git history?\r\n\r\nIn general, we plan to keep history, such that history from each constituent repo will be a part of the new repo.  However, we have made some mistakes in the past (e.g. large binaries, multitudes of automated PRs for flowing bits and source between repos, etc.), and we plan to rewrite history to correct those mistakes wherever possible and impactful.  Some rough calculations suggest this could end up significantly reducing the size of the repos as well as the time it takes to clone, which should not only help developers approaching the project but also CI.  This will end up meaning that SHAs may be different in the new repo than they were in the old repo; as previously mentioned, however, any references to the old SHAs in the old repos will continue to work, as those repos will remain accessible.\r\n\r\n#### Will I still show up in the contributor list due to previous contributions?\r\n\r\nYes.  We plan to merge all such history.\r\n\r\n#### Will this break debugging with SourceLink?\r\n\r\nNo.  The existing repos will continue to be accessible, and commit SHAs there will remain unchanged.\r\n\r\n#### Might plans change?\r\n\r\nSure.  Part of the goal of posting this announcement is to hear from you, hear about additional benefits you're excited about, and hear about additional concerns we may not have considered.  We will include such ideas in our planning and course correct as necessary."},{"Id":"10047192673","Type":"IssuesEvent","CreatedAt":"2019-07-19T16:54:03","Actor":"richlander","Repository":"dotnet/announcements","Organization":"dotnet","RawContent":null,"RelatedAction":"opened","RelatedUrl":"https://github.com/dotnet/announcements/issues/118","RelatedDescription":"Opened issue \".NET Core master branches have switched to \"5.0\"\" (#118) at dotnet/announcements","RelatedBody":"# .NET Core master branches have switched to \"5.0\"\r\n\r\nVarious .NET Core repos have switched their `master` branches to \"5.0\", and will use 3.x branches for 3.0 and 3.1 projects.

That is why there are distinct knobs.\r\n\r\nExample: on a machine with 4 cores, it is conceivable to have 8 containers limited to 1/8 of total CPU time for fairness/over-committing, but  \r\n1)  each limited to using 1 CPU at a time. This would favor compute-intensive scenarios. \r\nOR\r\n2)  each having access to all 4 CPUs.

Some effort was on the MONO and some was in CoreRT. But this proposal is not that. This is about running WASM on CLR or on .net. Then WASM modules can be treated as .net assemblies and .net assemblies can reference WASM modules. And this should not be like P/Invoke, where the calling interface has to be defined again in the .net side. Some supporting points-\r\n\r\n- WASM is kind of the ultimate assembly language, every other languages is trying to compile it to WASM.\r\n- WASM modules are like libraries and not executable programs, which makes it platform agnostic.\r\n- WASM is designed to run on (JS) runtimes. So it can made to run a runtime like CLR.\r\n- WASM is still low level.\r\n- WASM v1 is minimal, but still manages to cover a lot.\r\n- Also it may help development of Blazor.\r\n\r\nSo, I think CLR can look into running WASM itself.","Url":"https://github.com/dotnet/coreclr/issues/26319","RelatedDescription":"Open issue \"Proposal: Run WASM on CLR\" (#26319)"},{"Id":"483729581","IsPullRequest":false,"CreatedAt":"2019-08-22T16:33:59","Actor":"VincentBu","Number":"26312","RawContent":null,"Title":"Assert failure: object->HasEmptySyncBlockInfo","State":"closed","Body":"**Detail:**\r\nhttps://helix.dot.net/api/2019-06-17/jobs/9eff63f8-1806-4564-bc99-dd40a64bef2e/workitems/System.Drawing.Common.Tests/console\r\n\r\n**Log:**\r\n```\r\nAssert failure(PID 22 [0x00000016], Thread: 38 [0x0026]): object->HasEmptySyncBlockInfo()\r\n    File: /__w/10/s/src/vm/jithelpers.cpp Line: 2690\r\n    Image: /root/helix/work/correlation/dotnet\r\n\r\n./RunTests.sh: line 161:    22 Aborted                 \"$RUNTIME_PATH/dotnet\" exec --runtimeconfig System.Drawing.Common.Tests.runtimeconfig.json xunit.console.dll System.Drawing.Common.Tests.dll -xml testResults.xml -nologo -nocolor -notrait category=nonnetcoreapptests -notrait category=nonlinuxtests -notrait category=IgnoreForCI -notrait category=OuterLoop -notrait category=failing $RSP_FILE\r\n/root/helix/work/workitem\r\n exit code 134\r\n```","Url":"https://github.com/dotnet/coreclr/issues/26312","RelatedDescription":"Closed issue \"Assert failure: object->HasEmptySyncBlockInfo\" (#26312)"},{"Id":"483957080","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2019-08-22T12:12:30","Actor":"dotnet-maestro[bot]","Number":"26316","RawContent":null,"Title":"[master] Update dependencies from dotnet/arcade","State":"open","Body":"This pull request updates the following dependencies\r\n\r\n[marker]: <> (Begin:1cc0f2b0-7abd-45f0-cee6-08d67668456c)\r\n## From https://github.com/dotnet/arcade\r\n- **Build**: 20190821.4\r\n- **Date Produced**: 8/21/2019 6:40 PM\r\n- **Commit**: 27a6926f6b1d4b36d86a236d2b05cdee3669589e\r\n- **Branch**: refs/heads/master\r\n- **Updates**:\r\n  - **Microsoft.DotNet.Arcade.Sdk** -> 1.0.0-beta.19421.4\r\n  - **Microsoft.DotNet.Build.Tasks.Feed** -> 2.2.0-beta.19421.4\r\n  - **Microsoft.DotNet.Build.Tasks.Packaging** -> 1.0.0-beta.19421.4\r\n  - **Microsoft.DotNet.Helix.Sdk** -> 2.0.0-beta.19421.4\r\n\r\n[marker]: <> (End:1cc0f2b0-7abd-45f0-cee6-08d67668456c)\r\n\r\n","Url":"https://github.com/dotnet/coreclr/pull/26316","RelatedDescription":"Open PR \"[master] Update dependencies from dotnet/arcade\" (#26316)"},{"Id":"483852280","IsPullRequest":false,"CreatedAt":"2019-08-22T08:43:58","Actor":"savornicesei","Number":"26315","RawContent":null,"Title":"Documentation: Install on CentOS 6","State":"open","Body":"Hi all,\r\n\r\nThis is related to issue #6792 and [this](https://github.com/dotnet/core/blob/master/Documentation/build-and-install-rhel6-prerequisites.md) documentation page.\r\n\r\nOn a fresh CentOS 6.10, updating curl library breaks yum (it complains about not beeing able to read /etc/yum.conf file).\r\nSetting LD_LIBRARY_PATH back to /usr/lib fixes yum.\r\nBut still, yum install fails because of the openssl-libs dependency that is not available on CentOS 6.\r\nThe only solution to bypass the yum dependencies check is to install the dotnet packages using rpm.\r\n\r\nI have tried the following dotnet repositories:\r\n* https://packages.microsoft.com/config/rhel/7/packages-microsoft-prod.rpm\r\n* https://packages.microsoft.com/config/rhel/6/packages-microsoft-prod.rpm\r\n* https://packages.microsoft.com/config/centos/6/packages-microsoft-prod.rpm\r\nbut all the dotnet packages require the openssl-libs.\r\n\r\nIf it's possible to install dotnet from source on CentOS 6 then the documentation needs to be updated.

methods ammortized allocation-free","State":"open","Body":"Today `async ValueTask/ValueTask<T>` methods use builders that special-case the synchronously completing case (to just return a `default(ValueTask)` or `new ValueTask<T>(result)`) but defer to the equivalent of `async Task/Task<T>` for when the operation completes asynchronously.  This, however, doesn't take advantage of the fact that value tasks can wrap arbitrary `IValueTaskSource/IValueTaskSource<T>` implementations.\r\n\r\nI've had this sitting on the shelf for a while, but finally cleaned it up.  The first three commits here are just moving around existing code.  The last two commits are the meat of this change.  This changes `AsyncValueTaskMethodBuilder` and `AsyncValueTaskMethodBuilder<T>` to use pooled `IValueTaskSource/IValueTaskSource<T>` instances, such that calls to an `async ValueTask/ValueTask<T>` method incur 0 allocations as long as there's a cached object available.\r\n\r\nI've marked this as a draft and work-in-progress for a few reasons:\r\n1. There's a breaking change here, in that while we say/document that `ValueTask/ValueTask<T>`s are more limited in what they can be used for, nothing in the implementation actually stops a `ValueTask` that was wrapping a `Task` from being used as permissively as `Task`, e.g. if you were to await such a `ValueTask` multiple times, it would happen to work, even though we say \"never do that\".  This change means that anyone who was relying on such undocumented behaviors will now be broken.  I think this is a reasonable thing to do in a major release, but I also want feedback and a lot of runway on it.  There's the potential to make it opt-in (or opt-out) as well, but that will also non-trivially complicate the implementation.\r\n2. Policy around pooling.  This is always a difficult thing to tune.  Right now I've chosen a policy that limits the number of pooled objects per state machine type to an arbitrary multiple of the processor count, and that tries to strike a balance between contention and garbage by using a spin lock and if there's any contention while trying to get or return a pooled object, the cache is ignored.  We will need to think hard about what policy to use here.  It's also possible it could be tuned per state machine, e.g. by having an attribute that's looked up via reflection when creating the cache for a state machine, but that'll add a lot of first-access overhead to any `async ValueTask/ValueTask<T>` method.\r\n3. There are probably still some corner cases that need to be addressed. There are a few tweaks needed to the corefx tests in order to change them to stop validating some undocumented implementation details, but once I do that, this passes our corefx threading test suites.\r\n4. Perf validation.\r\n\r\ncc: @kouvel, @tarekgh, @benaadams ","Url":"https://github.com/dotnet/coreclr/pull/26310","RelatedDescription":"Open PR \"[WIP] Make \"async ValueTask/ValueTask<T>\" methods ammortized allocation-free\" (#26310)"},{"Id":"483726055","IsPullRequest":false,"CreatedAt":"2019-08-22T01:44:26","Actor":"VincentBu","Number":"26309","RawContent":null,"Title":"Test Failed: Process terminated.

The `AllocateUninitializedArray` method uses `RuntimeHelpers.IsReferenceOrContainsReferences` as an implementation detail when determining whether to return a zeroed array or an uninitialized array back to the caller.\r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/dotnet/coreclr/blob/af9edac7acd4735eebd7a293b27b1c509989dae8/src/System.Private.CoreLib/src/System/GC.cs#L665-L668\r\n\r\nThis logic is a little too relaxed. It appears that the `AllocateUninitializedArray` method is trying to ask the question \"Is any arbitrary bit pattern valid for type _T_?\", but the `IsReferenceOrContainsReferences` method answers the separate question \"Is type _T_ 'interesting' to the GC?\"\r\n\r\nThere are several value types where `IsReferenceOrContainsReferences` returns _false_ but which cannot store arbitrary bit patterns without causing problems. Among them:\r\n\r\n* System.Boolean (most consumers expect it to contain only `0` or `1`)\r\n* System.Decimal (see https://github.com/dotnet/coreclr/issues/16336)\r\n* System.DateTime / System.DateTimeOffset\r\n* System.Runtime.InteropServices.GCHandle\r\n* System.Buffers.StandardFormat\r\n* System.Text.Rune\r\n\r\nThe behaviors of calling instance methods on these types or of consuming these types when they've been initialized with arbitrary bit patterns is undefined, and it could result in anything from nonsensical answers being generated to crashing the runtime.\r\n\r\nNormally we'd tell developers not to look at the elements of arrays returned by `GC.AllocateUninitializedArray` or `ArrayPool<T>.Rent`, but there are some situations where they might not be able to control it. For example, if I'm under the VS debugger and I step past a call to `AllocateUninitializedArray` or `Rent`, the debugger could start listing the array's elements automatically even though my own code wouldn't have done such a thing.\r\n\r\nIf we do not want to change `GC.AllocateUninitializedArray` (perhaps because we consider it an \"unsafe\" API), we should at least consider putting the stronger checks into the `ArrayPool<T>`-derived classes.","Url":"https://github.com/dotnet/coreclr/issues/26304","RelatedDescription":"Open issue \"GC.AllocateUninitializedArray should tighten its logic around when to return zeroed arrays\" (#26304)"},{"Id":"483618514","IsPullRequest":false,"CreatedAt":"2019-08-21T19:49:00","Actor":"mthalman","Number":"26303","RawContent":null,"Title":"Define master list of native dependencies","State":"open","Body":"There's a need to have a definitive list of the product's native package dependencies provided in a machine-readable format.

For example, the Docker images are tested with a basic set of smoke tests.\r\n\r\nHaving a machine-readable format would allow for automation to validate that these downstream assets are including the correct dependencies.","Url":"https://github.com/dotnet/coreclr/issues/26303","RelatedDescription":"Open issue \"Define master list of native dependencies\" (#26303)"},{"Id":"483599877","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2019-08-21T19:05:05","Actor":"fadimounir","Number":"26302","RawContent":null,"Title":"Replace Ubuntu 1404 platforms with 1604","State":"open","Body":"","Url":"https://github.com/dotnet/coreclr/pull/26302","RelatedDescription":"Open PR \"Replace Ubuntu 1404 platforms with 1604\" (#26302)"},{"Id":"483552569","IsPullRequest":false,"CreatedAt":"2019-08-21T17:29:55","Actor":"EgorBo","Number":"26301","RawContent":null,"Title":"IntPtr.Equals() is slower than IntPtr==","State":"open","Body":"I was implementing IntPtr/UIntPtr intrinsics for mono and noticed that `IntPtr.Equals()` could be improved (other members are intrinsics)\r\n```csharp\r\n    static bool IntPtrEq1(IntPtr x, IntPtr y) => x == y;    \r\n    static bool IntPtrEq2(IntPtr x, IntPtr y) => x.Equals(y);\r\n    static bool LongEq(long x, long y) => x.Equals(y);\r\n```\r\ngenerates (tier1):\r\n```asm\r\n; Method FF:IntPtrEq1(long,long):bool\r\nG_M18580_IG01:\r\nG_M18580_IG02:\r\n       cmp      rcx, rdx\r\n       sete     al\r\n       movzx    rax, al\r\nG_M18580_IG03:\r\n       ret      \r\n; Total bytes of code: 10\r\n\r\n\r\n; Method FF:IntPtrEq2(long,long):bool\r\nG_M18577_IG01:\r\n       push     rdi\r\n       push     rsi\r\n       sub      rsp, 40\r\n       mov      rsi, rcx\r\n       mov      rdi, rdx\r\nG_M18577_IG02:\r\n       mov      rcx, 0xD1FFAB1E\r\n       call     CORINFO_HELP_NEWSFAST\r\n       mov      qword ptr [rax+8], rdi\r\n       mov      rax, qword ptr [rax+8]\r\n       cmp      rsi, rax\r\n       sete     al\r\n       movzx    rax, al\r\nG_M18577_IG03:\r\n       add      rsp, 40\r\n       pop      rsi\r\n       pop      rdi\r\n       ret      \r\n; Total bytes of code: 51\r\n\r\n\r\n; Method FF:LongEq(long,long):bool\r\nG_M24494_IG01:\r\nG_M24494_IG02:\r\n       cmp      rcx, rdx\r\n       sete     al\r\n       movzx    rax, al\r\nG_M24494_IG03:\r\n       ret      \r\n; Total bytes of code: 10\r\n```\r\n\r\nPerhaps, a non-boxing `bool Equals(IntPtr)` API should be added?","Url":"https://github.com/dotnet/coreclr/issues/26301","RelatedDescription":"Open issue \"IntPtr.Equals() is slower than IntPtr==\" (#26301)"},{"Id":"483550314","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2019-08-21T17:24:47","Actor":"BruceForstall","Number":"26300","RawContent":null,"Title":"Add makeSmOpcodeDef.pl script","State":"open","Body":"Fixes #26038","Url":"https://github.com/dotnet/coreclr/pull/26300","RelatedDescription":"Open PR \"Add makeSmOpcodeDef.pl script\" (#26300)"},{"Id":"483541735","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2019-08-21T17:04:56","Actor":"janvorli","Number":"26299","RawContent":null,"Title":"Unify Unix arm compiler optimization options","State":"open","Body":"Long time ago, we were using clang 3.8 for building for Unix arm.

When I add the `MetaDataReferences` the assemblies are loaded into memory, the assembly is compiled, written to the file system and the allocated memory  freed by the GC.\r\n\r\nIf I run the same code on a Unix system though (Debian, Ubuntu 18.04, Alpine - doesn't matter) the memory allocated by the `MetaDataReferences` is only freed if I do not invoke `collection.Emit`. When I call the method the process is leaking huge amounts of memory and I do not know why. I searched the roslyn source and couldn't find a clue as to why this is happening, thus I do not know if this is a Roslyn or dotnet GC related issue (if it is any and not me not realizing my mistakes)\r\n\r\nFor reference, in our production environment each call to our generation method is leaking up to 250mb of ram. Since I cannot share that source here, I provide a sample code that on my Ubuntu machine is left with over 200mb while at the same time it is consuming only 50 mb on windows (just every referenced assembly loaded)\r\n\r\n```C#\r\nnamespace NetCoreRazor\r\n{\r\n    using Microsoft.CodeAnalysis;\r\n    using Microsoft.CodeAnalysis.CSharp;\r\n    using System;\r\n    using System.IO;\r\n    using System.Linq;\r\n\r\n    class Program\r\n    {\r\n        static void Main(string[] args)\r\n        {\r\n            for (int i = 0; i < 100; i++)\r\n            {\r\n                DynCompile();\r\n            }\r\n\r\n            GC.Collect();\r\n\r\n            Console.WriteLine(\"Done\");\r\n            Console.ReadLine();\r\n        }\r\n\r\n        private static void DynCompile()\r\n        {\r\n            string myProgram = @\"using System;\r\n            namespace DynProgram\r\n            {\r\n                public class DynClass\r\n                {\r\n                    public static void WriteToConsole() { Console.WriteLine(\"\"Hello from Dyn\"\"); }\r\n                }\r\n            }\";\r\n\r\n            var assemblies = AppDomain.CurrentDomain.GetAssemblies()\r\n                   .Where(a => !a.IsDynamic && File.Exists(a.Location))\r\n                   .GroupBy(a => a.GetName().Name)\r\n                   .Select(grp => \r\n                        grp.First(y => y.GetName().Version == grp.Max(x => x.GetName().Version)))\r\n                   .Select(a => MetadataReference.CreateFromFile(a.Location));\r\n\r\n            var syntaxTree = CSharpSyntaxTree.ParseText(myProgram);\r\n            var compile = CSharpCompilation.Create(\"dyn_compile\");\r\n\r\n            compile = compile.AddSyntaxTrees(syntaxTree)\r\n                .AddReferences(assemblies)\r\n                .WithOptions(\r\n                    new CSharpCompilationOptions(OutputKind.DynamicallyLinkedLibrary)\r\n                    .WithPlatform(Platform.AnyCpu));\r\n\r\n            using (var myAssembly = File.Open(Path.GetTempFileName(), FileMode.Create, FileAccess.ReadWrite))\r\n            {\r\n                compile.Emit(myAssembly);\r\n            }\r\n        }\r\n    }\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nNET Core 2.2.6\r\n\r\nIt took me so long to nail it down because the memory dumps weren't really helpfull.

That is the sice of DumpHeap and EEHeap combined.. so there are 3.2 GB seemingly nothing.\r\n\r\nKing regards\r\n","Url":"https://github.com/dotnet/coreclr/issues/26320","RelatedDescription":"Open

All APIs are already implemented in .NET Core 3.0.","Url":"https://github.com/dotnet/standard/pull/1458","RelatedDescription":"Closed or merged PR \"Ask Mode: Add support for typed-datasets\" (#1458)"},{"Id":"483567659","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2019-08-21T18:33:20","Actor":"Anipik","Number":"1457","RawContent":null,"Title":"Enabling yaml stages for preview 9","State":"closed","Body":"We require this change in order to propagate the dependecies updates for preview 9 branch.\r\nrelated 3.0 change https://github.com/dotnet/standard/pull/1453\r\n\r\ncc @mmitche ","Url":"https://github.com/dotnet/standard/pull/1457","RelatedDescription":"Closed or merged PR \"Enabling yaml stages for preview 9\" (#1457)"},{"Id":"483116364","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2019-08-21T17:37:37","Actor":"Anipik","Number":"1453","RawContent":null,"Title":"Adding YAML stages","State":"closed","Body":"Closes: https://github.com/dotnet/arcade/issues/3726\r\n\r\ncherrypicking #1373 #1379 ","Url":"https://github.com/dotnet/standard/pull/1453","RelatedDescription":"Closed or merged PR \"Adding YAML stages\" (#1453)"},{"Id":"482581923","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2019-08-21T17:18:19","Actor":"terrajobst","Number":"1446","RawContent":null,"Title":"Add support for typed-datasets","State":"closed","Body":"This completes the support for typed datasets which also enables the dataset designer in VS.\r\n\r\nSee https://github.com/dotnet/corefx/pull/36528.","Url":"https://github.com/dotnet/standard/pull/1446","RelatedDescription":"Closed or merged PR \"Add support for typed-datasets\" (#1446)"},{"Id":"481880992","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2019-08-21T16:03:22","Actor":"dotnet-maestro[bot]","Number":"1444","RawContent":null,"Title":"[master] Update dependencies from dotnet/corefx","State":"closed","Body":"This pull request updates the following dependencies\r\n\r\n[marker]: <> (Begin:2a9b120a-74e9-4ac8-c08c-08d6da235811)\r\n## From https://github.com/dotnet/corefx\r\n- **Build**: 20190820.11\r\n- **Date Produced**: 8/21/2019 2:09 AM\r\n- **Commit**: 37f316e1de562bc31acab2496540a865189da918\r\n- **Branch**: refs/heads/master\r\n- **Updates**:\r\n  -

Today there's no benefit and a small downside to making them `async ValueTask` methods, so we've kept them as `async Task`.  However, if we end up changing the implementation of `async ValueTask` to pool underlying objects, there becomes a potential benefit to using `async ValueTask` for these instead of `async Task`.

Fixes a weird deserialization inconsistency with write-only properties. Consider this class...\r\n```\r\n        public class ClassWithNoGetter\r\n        {\r\n            string _myString = \"\";\r\n            int[] _myIntArray = new int[] { };\r\n            List<int> _myIntList = new List<int> { };\r\n\r\n            public string MyString\r\n            {\r\n                set\r\n                {\r\n                    _myString = value;\r\n                }\r\n            }\r\n\r\n            public int[] MyIntArray\r\n            {\r\n                set\r\n                {\r\n                    _myIntArray = value;\r\n                }\r\n            }\r\n\r\n            public List<int> MyList\r\n            {\r\n                set\r\n                {\r\n                    _myIntList = value;\r\n                }\r\n            }\r\n```\r\n...and this json...\r\n```\r\n{\"MyString\":\"Hello\",\"MyIntArray\":[0],\"MyIntList\":[0]}\r\n```\r\nIn this case MyString will deserialize but MyIntArray & MyIntList will not. This is because Enumerable, Dictionary, & IDictionaryConstructible will only deserialize if a public getter is present. This inconsistency is likely to confuse people and lead to bugs.\r\n\r\n2. Adds a new attribute JsonDeserializeAttribute which turns on a new feature to deserialize into read-only properties. Consider this class...\r\n```\r\n        public class SimpleTestClassUsingJsonDeserialize\r\n        {\r\n            [JsonDeserialize]\r\n            public SimpleTestClass MyClass { get; } = new SimpleTestClass();\r\n        }\r\n```\r\n...and this json...\r\n```\r\n{\"MyClass\":{\"MyInt32\":18}}\r\n```\r\nPreviously the MyClass property would be ignored during deserialization because it does not have a public setter. What [JsonDeserialize] does is direct the (de)serializer to use the getter to access the instance and then deserialize on to that.\r\n\r\nWhy do this? Primarily to allow people to use patterns that satisfy [CA2227](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/visualstudio/code-quality/ca2227-collection-properties-should-be-read-only?view=vs-2019). It also helps people using C#8 nullable reference.\r\n\r\nExample of a class expressed precisely:\r\n```\r\npublic class Document\r\n{\r\n        public ChildDoc? Parent { get; set; }\r\n\r\n        [JsonDeserialize]\r\n        public IEnumerable<ChildDoc> Children { get; } = new List<ChildDoc>();\r\n}\r\n```\r\nWe can access Children without fear of null.\r\n\r\nSame class with trade-offs to make existing API happy:\r\n```\r\n\tpublic class Document\r\n\t{\r\n\t\tpublic ChildDoc? Parent { get; set; }\r\n\r\n#pragma warning disable CA2227 // Collection properties should be read only\r\n\t\tpublic List<ChildDoc>? Children { get; set; }\r\n#pragma warning restore CA2227 // Collection properties should be read only\r\n\t}\r\n```\r\nAccess to Children now needs to have null checking. If we define like this...\r\n```\r\npublic List<ChildDoc> Children { get; set; } = new List<ChildDoc>();\r\n```\r\nWe're newing up an instance that will be thrown away during deserialization, and someone could come along and replace the value leading to inconsistent state.\r\n\r\nI went with the attribute primarily for backwards compatibility. People can opt-in to this if they want it.","Url":"https://github.com/dotnet/corefx/pull/40517","RelatedDescription":"Open PR \"JsonDeserializeAttribute to flag read-only properties for deserialization.\" (#40517)"},{"Id":"484195759","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2019-08-22T20:26:24","Actor":"bartonjs","Number":"40516","RawContent":null,"Title":"[release/3.0] Fix UAF when removing trusted certs on OSX","State":"open","Body":"CheckTrustSettings called CFRelease on cert, which downref'd it to zero\r\nbefore IsCertInKeychain ran.\r\n\r\nNow CheckTrustSettings leaves cert alive, and it's the caller's responsibility to CFRelease.\r\n\r\nFixes #40491.","Url":"https://github.com/dotnet/corefx/pull/40516","RelatedDescription":"Open PR \"[release/3.0] Fix UAF when removing trusted certs on OSX\" (#40516)"},{"Id":"484149898","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2019-08-22T20:05:14","Actor":"stephentoub","Number":"40511","RawContent":null,"Title":"Fix unnecessary reliance on ValueTask being backed by a Task","State":"closed","Body":"Arbitrary ValueTasks musn't be consumed twice.

`IReadOnlyCollection<T>` and `IReadOnlyList<T>` interfaces as some of the read-only methods on `ICollection<T>` and `IList<T>` were not included in the read-only interfaces because that would prevent the generic type argument from being declared covariant. `ICollection<T>` and `IList<T>` would then inherit these new interfaces and use default interface implementation to forward their calls to their own versions.\r\n\r\nThis would address many people's request for an `IReadOnlySet<T>` in #1973 as many would just like a `Contains` method which would then allow `IReadOnlySet<T>` be dedicated

This complicates creation of tools which are supposed to run across major versions. Typically applies to .NET global tools.\r\n\r\nCurrently SDK explicitly blocks usage of `RollForward` msbuild property in projects targeting .NET Core `2.*`. Such a limitation makes sense for restrictive settings of this property (like `Disable` or `LatestPatch`) as usage of those could lead to unexpected behavioral changes when .NET 3.0 is installed on the machine. But there's no good reason to block the more relaxing values `Major` and `LatestMajor`. The fix is to change the explicit block to allow `Major` and `LatestMajor` settings even in `2.*` projects, while keep on failing for the more restrictive values (everything else).\r\nThe `RollForward` property has no effect on machines with `2.*` only runtimes. It works for all apps (regardless of version) once .NET Core 3.0 is installed on the machine.\r\n\r\n#### Customer Impact\r\n.NET Core Tools are a feature enabled as part of .NET Core 2.1. They are similar to libraries in that they are delivered by NuGet but differ in that they are bound to a specific runtime version. If a compatible runtime version is not found, the tools fail to run, with an appropriate error message. \r\n \r\nWe initially gave guidance to multi-target tools to enable running 2.x tools on 3.0 only machine. After some discussion, we decided that this guidance wasn’t acceptable as the singular answer and funded the runtime binding feature (AKA Roll Forward). The goal was to enable 2.x apps to participate in major version roll-forward but not any of the other policies that are 3.x only. The SDK currently prevents this.\r\n \r\nWe need to enable the major version roll-forward scenario for 2.x apps and tools by making the error state more surgical. Otherwise, we’ll need to go back to the initial multi-targeting guidance or tell tools writers to use a `.runtimeconfig.template`. The template idea would work, but is a very unfortunate workaround for what was intended to be a mainline scenario.\r\n\r\n#### Regression?\r\nNo - the roll forward feature is new in 3.0.\r\n\t\t\r\n#### Risk\r\nVery small - the `RollForward` msbuild property is new in 3.0 SDK, so its usage is almost certainly intentional. Affected scenarios were failing early (during build), after the fix they are going to work.","Url":"https://github.com/dotnet/sdk/pull/3542","RelatedDescription":"Closed or merged PR \"Allow specifying RollForward with Major/LatestMajor on all apps\" (#3542)"},{"Id":"482818597","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2019-08-20T13:33:07","Actor":"dotnet-maestro[bot]","Number":"3550","RawContent":null,"Title":"[master] Update dependencies from dotnet/arcade","State":"closed","Body":"This pull request updates the following dependencies\r\n\r\n[marker]: <> (Begin:daa187e0-7e60-4c7a-c1ac-08d6354da8a8)\r\n## From https://github.com/dotnet/arcade\r\n- **Build**: 20190819.12\r\n- **Date Produced**: 8/19/2019 5:30 PM\r\n- **Commit**: 10b2260aeed5f07582bf8d8dcd4221a447b171c5\r\n- **Branch**: refs/heads/master\r\n- **Updates**:\r\n  - **Microsoft.DotNet.Arcade.Sdk** -> 1.0.0-beta.19419.12\r\n  - **Microsoft.DotNet.SignTool** -> 1.0.0-beta.19419.12\r\n\r\n[marker]: <> (End:daa187e0-7e60-4c7a-c1ac-08d6354da8a8)\r\n\r\n","Url":"https://github.com/dotnet/sdk/pull/3550","RelatedDescription":"Closed or merged PR \"[master] Update dependencies from dotnet/arcade\" (#3550)"},{"Id":"483046802","IsPullRequest":false,"CreatedAt":"2019-08-20T00:50:06","Actor":"Varorbc","Number":"3553","RawContent":null,"Title":"build and generate package fail","State":"open","Body":"**Version Used**: 3.0.100-preview8-013656\r\n\r\n###  Question 1\r\n\r\n**Steps to Reproduce**:\r\n\r\n1.

In specific cases, the PlatformTarget would be set to x86, where it would have previously been set to AnyCPU.  This is because previously you had to have a (transitive) dependency on the Microsoft.NETCore.Platforms package to get the RuntimeIdentifier graph, and without it, you wouldn't get assets that didn't exactly match the default RuntimeIdentifier (win7-x86).  Since no native assets were found, the PlatformTarget defaulted to AnyCPU, even though if the RuntimeGraph had been available there would have been native assets.\r\n\r\nRoslyn ran into this, their apps switched to x86 unintentionally.

For framework dependent apps this is trivial as the host knows which frameworks it resolved for the app. For self-contained apps though, there's no information about frameworks.\r\n\r\nCurrently framework dependent console app has `.runtimeconfig.json` like this:\r\n```json\r\n{\r\n  \"runtimeOptions\": {\r\n    \"tfm\": \"netcoreapp3.0\",\r\n    \"frameworks\":\r\n    [\r\n      {\r\n        \"name\": \"Microsoft.NETCore.App\",\r\n        \"version\": \"3.0.0\"\r\n      }\r\n    ]\r\n  }\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nA self-contained app on the other hand has `.runtimeconfig.json` like this:\r\n```json\r\n{\r\n  \"runtimeOptions\": {}\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\n### Proposal\r\nWrite the same information even for self-contained apps. The caveat is that framework references should not be written the exact same way otherwise host will think it's a framework dependent application (self-contained apps are recognized through the fact that they have no framework references).\r\n\r\n#### Write the `tfm` property\r\nThis would make self-contained apps behave consistently with framework dependent apps. The TFM is not used widely by the host, but it does come into play in specific cases around additional probe paths and `DOTNET_SHARED_STORE` functionality.\r\n\r\n*Compatibility note: It's not really a breaking change if we start writing the `tfm` property. It does change the behavior of the app slightly, but in order for it to take effect the app has to be rebuilt, so there's an explicit action by the developer.* \r\n\r\n#### Write a new `includedFrameworks` property\r\nFramework references in self-contained apps would be written to a new property `includedFrameworks` which would use the same syntax. It's an array of objects, where each object represents a framework reference. The framework reference must specify its `name` and `version`. Other properties like `rollForward` which are allowed on normal framework references will not be allowed here.\r\n\r\n*Compatibility note: Combined with the changes in the host to consume this property, it will change behavior of apps when trying to load dynamic components. But the change requires a rebuild of the app in question, so it's not a breaking change.*\r\n\r\nThe final `.runtimeconfig.json` would look like this:\r\n```json\r\n{\r\n  \"runtimeOptions\": {\r\n    \"tfm\": \"netcoreapp3.0\",\r\n    \"includedFrameworks\":\r\n    [\r\n      {\r\n        \"name\": \"Microsoft.NETCore.App\",\r\n        \"version\": \"3.0.0\"\r\n      }\r\n    ]\r\n  }\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nNaming is always an interesting question, so `includedFrameworks` is just one option. It could be called `embeddedFrameworks`, `containedFrameworks`, ... other suggestions are very welcome. The name should be somewhat clear about the fact that the framework is part of the app.\r\n\r\n### Impact\r\nThe proposed change makes the `.runtimeconfig.json` bigger for self-contained apps, but the change is tiny (100s of bytes).\r\n\r\nPerformance wise there is some cost to write it in the SDK, but that it very small compared to the rest of the work SDK does. The host has to parse the new information as well, so there's some cost to that, but it doesn't have to process it (just remember) during startup, so the perf impact on startup should be very small.","Url":"https://github.com/dotnet/sdk/issues/3541","RelatedDescription":"Open issue \"Write framework references for self-contained apps\" (#3541)"},{"Id":"480939380","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2019-08-15T00:05:41","Actor":"dotnet-bot","Number":"3540","RawContent":null,"Title":"Merge release/3.0.1xx to master","State":"open","Body":"\nThis is an automatically generated pull request from release/3.0.1xx into master.\n\n``` bash\ngit fetch --all\ngit checkout merges/release/3.0.1xx-to-master\ngit reset --hard upstream/master\ngit merge upstream/release/3.0.1xx\n# Fix merge conflicts\ngit commit\ngit push upstream merges/release/3.0.1xx-to-master --force\n```\n\nOnce all conflicts are resolved and all the tests pass, you are free to merge the pull request.","Url":"https://github.com/dotnet/sdk/pull/3540","RelatedDescription":"Open PR \"Merge release/3.0.1xx to master\" (#3540)"},{"Id":"480932346","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2019-08-14T23:32:31","Actor":"nguerrera","Number":"3539","RawContent":null,"Title":"Pass well-defined set of managed assemblies to linker and crossgen","State":"open","Body":"### Description\r\n\r\nBoth the linker and crossgen features currently scan the entire set of published files, looking for managed assemblies. This was meant to be temporary and the design was to pass them the set of managed assemblies designated in .deps.json. This was not trivial due to ordering issues so we have been living with the temporary design. This change implements the planned design of passing the true set of managed assemblies.\r\n\r\nThe temporary design is inefficient, there's a first chance exception for every non-dll in the publish set, and can be incorrect in the edge case where there are dlls that are not part of the applications runtime dependencies included as content.\r\n\r\nWhile working on this, bugs related to identifying the correct set of assemblies in the .deps file were fixed. It is difficult to split up the bug fixes as they were done on the foundation of the better design.\r\n\r\nIn total, 4 bugs are fixed.\r\n\r\n1. Fix #3109 -  tracked the correct design that is implemented here\r\n2. Fix #3547 - COMReference with PIA do not show up in .deps file, and therefore do not load. EmbedInteropTypes must be used.\r\n3. Fix #2660 - Project references that are not copy local are incorrectly recorded in .deps file\r\n4. Fix #3548 - linker cannot remove project references or direct file references from deps file\r\n\r\nRelates to a fifth bug, https://github.com/aspnet/AspNetCore/issues/12064 (failure to account for views assembly in linker and crossgen), but a fix for that has been made that does not depend on this one. It includes a future proofing so that it can work with both the existing design and the design implemented here.\r\n\r\n### Customer impact\r\n\r\nThis is primarily about having the planned correct design in place for the long term so that we do not have to support the temporary design indefinitely. It would be rare for an application to publish incorrectly with the temporary design.\r\n\r\nThe second bug has a simple workaround of using No-PIA, but the failure is not obvious.\r\n\r\nThe third bug has been worked around by the runtime. It now tolerates missing assemblies in .deps by default. That was also intended to be temporary so the longer we leave the SDK producing the incorrect .deps file, the longer the runtime will have to support this by default.\r\n\r\nThe fourth bug is benign for now as the linker only removes framework assemblies in this release, but this is expected to change in future releases, and it demonstrates the problem of having the poorer design in place as the foundation for these features evolving.\r\n\r\n### Regression\r\n\r\nNo\r\n\r\n\r\n### Risk\r\n\r\nMedium. The code delta is not too large, but the change is in a tricky part of the code and it took 3 tries to come up with the right approach. More regression testing is still needed, which may take until tomorrow to finish authoring.\r\n","Url":"https://github.com/dotnet/sdk/pull/3539","RelatedDescription":"Open PR \"Pass well-defined set of managed assemblies to linker and crossgen\" (#3539)"},{"Id":"480813850","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2019-08-14T18:05:25","Actor":"wli3","Number":"3538","RawContent":null,"Title":"[DRAFT] Revived classic project experiment for C++/CLI ","State":"open","Body":"","Url":"https://github.com/dotnet/sdk/pull/3538","RelatedDescription":"Open PR \"[DRAFT] Revived classic project experiment for C++/CLI \" (#3538)"}],"ResultType":"GitHubIssue"},"Announcements-Issues":{"Issues":[{"Id":"480859726","IsPullRequest":false,"CreatedAt":"2019-08-14T19:54:26","Actor":"stephentoub","Number":"119","RawContent":null,"Title":"Consolidating .NET GitHub repos","State":"open","Body":"*To discuss these plans, please comment on the corresponding issue at https://github.com/dotnet/coreclr/issues/26175.*\r\n\r\nOver the next few months, we plan to consolidate several of the foundational repositories of .NET Core, including dotnet/coreclr and dotnet/corefx.\r\n\r\n.NET’s repository structure on GitHub was initially created in a fairly fine-grained manner, with the aim of enabling runtime agility and increased developer productivity.  However, this separation has led to a variety of complications for contributors and maintainers alike.  For example:\r\n- **Confusion about where issues should be opened.**  It’s not always clear in which repo an issue should be reported, complicated by the fact that some implementations actually span repositories (e.g. a type might be exposed through a reference assembly and have its tests in corefx but actually be implemented in System.Private.CoreLib in coreclr).\r\n- **Difficulty sharing source.**  System.Private.CoreLib is intricately connected to the rest of the runtime, and thus has lived with the runtime code.  That, however, means that although corefx has been intended as the place to share as much core library code as possible across any underlying runtime, we’ve needed to keep a significant body of code in System.Private.CoreLib, which then has meant it’s needed to be “mirrored” to each runtime repo (coreclr, corert, mono) that needs to consume it as source; similarly, corefx has similarly required access to much of that source, for example to use the same interop DllImports that are employed elsewhere in the runtimes.  The automatic mirror that shares this source needs to be maintained, and even when it has been, it’s often led to lag.  It’s also complicated developer processes, where to validate a change in one repo generally requires manually mirroring the code to other local repos in order to validate the change and ensure merging into one repo won’t break the others.\r\n- **PRs spanning multiple repos.**  Because the runtime, CoreLib, and the core libraries are all intricately linked, changing runtime behaviors, adding new APIs, or changing various build processes (e.g. improving static analysis) often requires multiple PRs carefully staged across time and multiple repos.  For example, to add a new method to a type like Dictionary<>, a developer must first make the source changes in her local coreclr repo and the test and reference assembly changes in her local corefx repo.  When satisfied with the fix, the developer must submit a PR to coreclr as well as a PR to corefx, the latter of which will fail.  Eventually the coreclr PR will be merged, and the changes will mirror to the other runtimes that also require the update.  Eventually those mirror PRs will be merged, and builds will be created containing the fix for each runtime.  At some point later those builds will be consumed into the corefx repo, after which point the original corefx PR can be re-validated and eventually merged.  That’s the best case; things get more complicated in situations where there are bidirectional dependencies.\r\n- **Building an installable runtime.** Self-hosting a custom built .NET requires intricate knowledge of how all the repos work and interact.  A developer can’t just clone a single repo, make a desired change, and easily produce an installer.\r\n- **Consistency.**  One goal we had for more fine-grained repos was to enable isolation and independence for teams working within each repo’s confines, but this has led to non-trivial duplication of effort on things like build systems and CI, and then the resulting lack of consistency as each system ends up diverging from the others.\r\n\r\nThe issues go beyond the runtime.  For example, the ASP.NET maintainers and community did a great job in the past year or so consolidating from ~55 repos down to ~5 repos, but that’s still more repos than is desirable, leading to similar issues as cited above for the runtime.  On top of that, these ASP.NET repositories are in the aspnet GitHub org, which adds an additional set of issues, for example:\r\n- **Complications moving issues between repos.**  If a developer opens an issue in aspnet/aspnetcore and it’s determined that the cause of the issue is actually in dotnet/corefx, there is no GitHub mechanism to enable easily moving that issue across the aspnet to dotnet organizational boundary.\r\n- **Permissions.** Each organization’s permissions end up needing to be managed and maintained separately.\r\n\r\nThe issues extend into tooling as well.  For example, we currently have multiple repositories that all logically make up the dotnet CLI, but actually creating a working installer spans multiple repos.\r\n\r\n### Plan\r\n\r\nTo address these issues, we’re planning to make some changes to our repository structure:\r\n- **dotnet/platform.**  We plan to combine dotnet/coreclr, dotnet/corefx, dotnet/corert, dotnet/core-setup, and the relevant portions of mono/mono into a new dotnet/platform repo.  Everything needed to build and produce the Microsoft.NETCore.App shared framework will be in this repo.  We will no longer suffer from the complications of source mirroring.  Features like changing runtime behavior or adding an API will no longer require a complicated dance across multiple repos.  Etc.\r\n- **dotnet/aspnetcore.**  We plan to move the existing aspnet/aspnetcore repository into the dotnet organization.  Along with that, we aim to combine a variety of the other aspnet repositories into aspnetcore, such as aspnet/blazor.  Whether repos like entityframeworkcore remain separate or combined remains an open question.  A goal is that, just as dotnet/platform will be responsible for the creation of Microsoft.NETCore.App, dotnet/aspnetcore will be responsible for the creation of Microsoft.AspNETCore.App.\r\n- **dotnet/cli.**  We plan to combine dotnet/toolset and dotnet/sdk into the dotnet/cli repo.\r\n\r\n### FAQ\r\n\r\n#### Why are we merging repos?\r\n\r\nWe believe we can significantly improve several aspects of .NET on GitHub by combining repos, benefiting both maintainers and contributors.  These improvements will manifest in a variety of ways, such as in better issue management, much easier models of contribution, and easier and faster ways to build and install the resulting bits.\r\n\r\n####  What will happen to the aspnet org?\r\n\r\nThe aspnet org as a separate entity is legacy and artificial.  In time we hope to absorb it into the dotnet org and sunset the aspnet org.\r\n\r\n#### Will the coreclr and corefx repos go away?\r\n\r\nWith the help of GitHub, we plan to migrate all issues from these repos to the new dotnet/platform repo, and then lock down creation of additional issues, such that the repos will no longer be used for issue management.  We will also inhibit the creation of PRs to the master branch, which will effectively become an archive for read-only review of history.  In this sense, these repos will be archived, and no active development will happen with them.  However, we plan to continue servicing previous .NET Core releases out of these repos, so the various release branches (e.g. release/2.1, release/3.0, etc.) will continue to see (limited) activity.\r\n\r\n#### Will the mono repo go away?\r\n\r\nNo. mono/mono contains the source for the full mono stack and will continue to live on happily.  We will simply be moving the managed source associated with System.Private.CoreLib and copying the relatively small amount of source that makes up the native mono runtime to dotnet/platform.  We may choose to then use some mirroring technology to keep the runtime copy in sync (this will, however, not suffer from the same mirroring issues we currently experience, as we would not be mirroring between two components required to build the same binaries), or we may choose to let them diverge and manually sync only those changes deemed relevant to both implementations.\r\n\r\n#### Will the corert repo go away?\r\n\r\nYes.  We plan to retire/archive the corert repo.  Some of the technology in the corert repo will be migrated to the master branch of dotnet/platform, where it will be productized as part of .NET.  Other portions of the corert repo will be migrated to feature branches of dotnet/platform, where the experimentation can continue.  In this way, we will use feature branches to continue experimenting with the corert technology, while making it easier to share portions with its shipping counterpart and also graduate functionality into master if/when it’s ready.\r\n\r\n#### Does this mean there will be a single repo for all of .NET?\r\n\r\nNo.  We will be reducing the number of repos that contribute to .NET, but currently we do not believe that going all the way down to one is the right answer.\r\n\r\n#### Doesn’t this mean that issue and PR tracking will now be overwhelming?\r\n\r\nIt is already the case that the vast majority of issues in a given repo are not relevant to any individual developer, and with several thousand open issues in each repo and on the order of a hundred open PRs in each, we already need systems (e.g. labels) to successfully manage issues and PRs.  As such, we don’t believe the merging will have a significant impact on this aspect of developer productivity.  If it turns out to have an unexpectedly large negative impact, we will work with the community to find ways to mitigate the problem.  However, there are already a multitude of successful open source projects on GitHub with at least an order of magnitude more issues.\r\n\r\n#### What will happen to existing issues?\r\n\r\nWith the help of GitHub functionality, we plan to migrate all issues from old repos (e.g. dotnet/coreclr, dotnet/corefx) to the new repos (e.g. dotnet/platform).  We may also use this as a forcing function to revisit stale issues and either close those that are no longer relevant or reinvigorate those that are demanding of more immediate attention.\r\n\r\n#### What about git history?\r\n\r\nIn general, we plan to keep history, such that history from each constituent repo will be a part of the new repo.  However, we have made some mistakes in the past (e.g. large binaries, multitudes of automated PRs for flowing bits and source between repos, etc.), and we plan to rewrite history to correct those mistakes wherever possible and impactful.  Some rough calculations suggest this could end up significantly reducing the size of the repos as well as the time it takes to clone, which should not only help developers approaching the project but also CI.  This will end up meaning that SHAs may be different in the new repo than they were in the old repo; as previously mentioned, however, any references to the old SHAs in the old repos will continue to work, as those repos will remain accessible.\r\n\r\n#### Will I still show up in the contributor list due to previous contributions?\r\n\r\nYes.  We plan to merge all such history.\r\n\r\n#### Will this break debugging with SourceLink?\r\n\r\nNo.  The existing repos will continue to be accessible, and commit SHAs there will remain unchanged.\r\n\r\n#### Might plans change?\r\n\r\nSure.  Part of the goal of posting this announcement is to hear from you, hear about additional benefits you're excited about, and hear about additional concerns we may not have considered.  We will include such ideas in our planning and course correct as necessary.\r\n\r\n## Discussion\r\n\r\nTo discuss these plans, please comment on the corresponding issue at https://github.com/dotnet/coreclr/issues/26175.\r\n","Url":"https://github.com/dotnet/announcements/issues/119","RelatedDescription":"Open issue \"Consolidating .NET GitHub repos\" (#119)"},{"Id":"470434872","IsPullRequest":false,"CreatedAt":"2019-07-19T16:54:02","Actor":"richlander","Number":"118","RawContent":null,"Title":".NET Core master branches have switched to \"5.0\"","State":"open","Body":"# .NET Core master branches have switched to \"5.0\"\r\n\r\nVarious .NET Core repos have switched their `master` branches to \"5.0\", and will use 3.x branches for 3.0 and 3.1 projects.

Every person who started a scenario successfully finished it.\r\n    - We feel this validates that we picked the right scope for a 60 minute study of people from various backgrounds\r\n* Overall people liked the new API\r\n    - Key value prop for most people was the fact that \"it's now built in\"\r\n    - Very few mentioned perf and the ones that did thought that it probably wouldn't make a difference in their scenarios.\r\n    - Most people said they would prefer `System.Text.Json` for new APIs, but would stick to JSON.NET in code that already uses it.\r\n    - **[Action]** None, this is in line with what we expected.\r\n* Virtually everyone tried to google for sample code in the documentation\r\n    - Everyone found our blog post and online documentation\r\n    - People new to .NET were confused that JSON.NET and `System.Text.Json` weren't the same thing\r\n    - Everyone complained that the current docs are lacking, especially sample code.\r\n    - **[Action]** Docs are work in progress. We plan on shipping with a fully documented API surface and sample code.\r\n* Virtually everyone found the key type relatively quickly\r\n    - Some people were confused when types were static, rather than something that one can new up\r\n    - **[Action]** None. This is by-design as we try to reduce the number of allocations.\r\n* Virtually everyone had trouble selecting the correct method on\r\n  `JsonSerializer`\r\n    - We chose a very complicated naming convention\r\n    - **[Action]** We simplified it by using names that people in the study told us were looking for.\r\n* Most of our error messages were well received because they told people what\r\n  the problem is & how they can fix them.\r\n    - One error message was unclear because we reported an unexpected character when we could have reported that we didn't expect a comment.\r\n    - **[Action]** We've reworded the error message.\r\n    - We had one error message that was generated by a lower layer and provided an action item that doesn't make sense when people receive it when using the higher layer component.\r\n    - **[Action]** We've reworded the error message to be more generic so it makes sense for both kind of consumers.\r\n* Virtually everyone used the new Roslyn completion feature which will also show\r\n  types from namespaces not imported yet.\r\n    - However, virtually nobody realized that they were doing it.\r\n    - This caused confusion when people found other APIs that happen to include Json in them, specifically the old data contract serialization.\r\n    - **[Action]** Talk to the Roslyn IDE team to see if this something more people will run into. This could prove to be especially problematic for technologies that share type names (e.g. `UserControl` in WinForms and WPF) and both are referenced by the project.\r\n* Optional parameters and `async`/`await` are usability cliffs\r\n    - Many were confused by optional parameters and tried to pass them in, even though they didn't have to.\r\n    - **[Action]** Talk to the Roslyn IDE team to see if we can visualize them better in VS.\r\n    - **[Action]** Try to avoid heavy use of optional parameters for mainline APIs.\r\n    - Async is a very steep cliff. People have no idea what to do in their code to make async work. While IntelliSense shows the usage by prefixing it with await, people didn't notice that.\r\n    - **[Action]** Unclear; this is a broader issue.\r\n* Virtually nobody used F1 to get help for APIs\r\n    - *Surprise*. I expected more people to use <kbd>F1</kbd>.\r\n* Virtually everyone used F12 to explore the API (\"metadata view\")\r\n    - *Surprise*. I expected most people to explore the type via the\r\n      IntelliSense completion\r\n* Nobody used Object Browser to explorer the APIs\r\n    - *Surprise*. I expected at least some people to.\r\n\r\n## Discussion\r\n\r\nFor a discussion, please go to https://github.com/dotnet/corefx/issues/39304.","Url":"https://github.com/dotnet/announcements/issues/117","RelatedDescription":"Open issue \"System.Text.Json usability study results\" (#117)"},{"Id":"465034831","IsPullRequest":false,"CreatedAt":"2019-07-08T03:13:38","Actor":"leecow","Number":"116","RawContent":null,"Title":"Updates to releases.json (.NET Core release metadata)","State":"open","Body":"**The changes described in this issue will be live with the .NET Core July update on 7/9/2019.**\r\n\r\nThe releases.json files (e.g. [2.2 releases.json](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dotnet/core/master/release-notes/2.2/releases.json)) are comprehensive metadata files which capture details of each .NET Core release. These files, along with the top level [releases-index.json](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dotnet/core/master/release-notes/releases-index.json), are becoming increasingly important .NET Core release assets. These files, one for each major.minor channel, are relied upon by many to detect when updates for .NET Core are available, discover security update details and other uses.\r\n\r\nChanges are sometimes necessary, and the growing dependencies require that we treat compatibility of the schema with the utmost care. This announcement describes an addition to the releases.json schema.\r\n\r\n## SDK Versions and Visual Studio\r\n\r\nBecause of current .NET Core SDK product construction dependencies, there is a hard link between the Runtime, SDK, toolset (compilers, MSBuild, NuGet, and other components), and Visual Studio. Simplistically, this means that when anything updates, everything updates. The unfortunate result of this linking is that multiple versions of the SDK are released with each monthly update for each supported versions of Visual Studio. For example, the May Update for .NET Core 2.2 included the 2.2.5 runtime, 2.2.107 SDK for Visual Studio 2017 and 2.2.204 for Visual Studio 2019 and yet another pair of SDK versions for .NET Core 2.1. An example of this is the [2.2.5 Release Notes](https://github.com/dotnet/core/blob/master/release-notes/2.2/2.2.5/2.2.5.md). \r\n\r\nThis is a confusing situation and we are working to mitigate the need to release multiple SDKs with .NET Core 3.0. The need for multiple SDK versions will persist for 2.1 LTS.\r\n\r\n## Adding the SDKS array\r\n\r\nTo appropriately model multiple SDKs per release, we are adding an SDKs array to releases.json, which will contain SDK objects. The top-level SDK object will represent the highest versioned SDK for a given update. Using the previous 2.2.5 update example, SDK 2.2.204 is in the top SDK object as well as duplicated in the SDKS array. All other applicable 2.2* SDK objects are included in the SDKS array. The SDK objects within the array will carry specific Visual Studio compatibility and version inclusion information to provide appropriate context.\r\n\r\nHere is an example of the new array based on the upcoming July update.\r\nAgain, this will be additive and the previous SDK object will include the highest SDK version for the release.\r\n\r\n```json\r\n{\r\n    \"sdk\": {\r\n        \"version\": \"2.2.301\",\r\n        \"version-display\": \"2.2.301\",\r\n        \"runtime-version\": \"2.2.6\",\r\n        \"vs-version\": \"16.1.3\",\r\n        \"vs-support\": \"Visual Studio 2019 (v16.1)\",\r\n        \"csharp-version\": \"7.3\",\r\n        \"fsharp-version\": \"4.5\",\r\n        \"vb-version\": null,\r\n        \"files\": []\r\n    },\r\n    \"sdks\": [\r\n        {\r\n            \"version\": \"2.2.301\",\r\n            \"version-display\": \"2.2.301\",\r\n            \"runtime-version\": \"2.2.6\",\r\n            \"vs-version\": \"16.1.3\",\r\n            \"vs-support\": \"Visual Studio 2019 (v16.1)\",\r\n            \"csharp-version\": \"7.3\",\r\n            \"fsharp-version\": \"4.5\",\r\n            \"vb-version\": null,\r\n            \"files\": []\r\n        },\r\n        {\r\n          \"version\": \"2.2.205\",\r\n          \"version-display\": \"2.2.205\",\r\n          \"runtime-version\": \"2.2.6\",\r\n          \"vs-version\": \"16.0.5\",\r\n          \"vs-support\": \"Visual Studio 2019 (v16.0)\",\r\n          \"csharp-version\": \"7.3\",\r\n          \"fsharp-version\": \"4.5\",\r\n          \"vb-version\": null,\r\n          \"files\": []\r\n        }\r\n    ]\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\n## vs-version and the Runtime\r\n\r\nThe same version of the runtime is included in multiple versions of Visual Studio. To account for this, the vs-version field is being updated to a comma-delimited string. The string will represent all versions of Visual Studio which first include the particular .NET Core update. Again, an example from the upcoming July Update.\r\n\r\n```json\r\n\"runtime\": {\r\n        \"version\": \"2.2.6\",\r\n        \"version-display\": \"2.2.6\",\r\n        \"vs-version\": \"15.9.13, 16.1.3, 16.2.0\",\r\n```\r\n\r\nThe same `vs-versions` changes will be seen in the `aspnetcore-runtime` object.\r\n\r\n## Future Enhancements\r\n\r\nThere are other improvements to the schema which have been suggested by the community which we are evaluating. Generally, theses enhancements are additive and should not represent compatibility compromises for existing parsers and similar announcements will be published ahead of any changes.\r\n\r\n","Url":"https://github.com/dotnet/announcements/issues/116","RelatedDescription":"Open issue \"Updates to releases.json (.NET Core release metadata)\" (#116)"},{"Id":"444065225","IsPullRequest":false,"CreatedAt":"2019-05-14T18:38:23","Actor":"TaraOverfield","Number":"114","RawContent":null,"Title":"May 2019 .NET Updates","State":"open","Body":"# May 2019 .NET Updates\r\n\r\nThe following .NET updates were released in May 2019.

Either target .NET Core 2.1 or lower, or use a version of the .NET SDK that supports .NET Core 2.2.`\r\n\r\nIf you downloaded the .NET Core SDK 2.2 between April 2 and April 12, 2019, the main [.NET downloads page](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/download/) included only 2.2.2nn. Starting April 12th, a new button marked \"Compatible with Visual Studio 2017\" is provided to target 2.2.1nn.

This article explains why this happens and how you can fix your installation.\r\n\r\nWhen Visual Studio can't find an appropriate version of the .NET Core SDK, you'll receive an error message. This may appear in the Error pane as NETSDK1045:\r\n\r\n\"The current .NET SDK does not support targeting .NET Core 2...\"\r\n\r\nYou can check what .NET Core SDKs you have on your machine with the following command:\r\n\r\n```bash\r\ndotnet --list-sdks\r\n```\r\n\r\nUnless you have a global.json file, when you use `dotnet` from the command line, the latest .NET Core SDK is used.\r\n\r\n> [TIP!] \r\n> Open a command prompt and try to build with `dotnet build`. If the command line build works, but Visual Studio doesn't suggestions in this article may help.\r\n\r\nThe last two digits of the .NET Core SDK version numbers are in the format are a patch number, which is represented by `nn` in this article because we will continue to service them to include the latest runtimes. To find out more, vist the [Overview of how .NET Core is versioned page](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/core/versions/).\r\n\r\n## Fixes for Common Problems\r\n\r\n### Visual Studio 2017 can't target .NET Core 2.2\r\n\r\nIf you receive the error message in Visual Studio 2017:\r\n\r\n`The current .NET SDK does not support targeting .NET Core 2.2… Either target .NET Core 2.1 or lower, or use a version of the .NET SDK that supports .NET Core 2.2.`\r\n\r\nUse `dotnet --list-sdks` to ensure you have .NET Core SDK 2.2.1nn. As an example, 2.2.106 would be a valid entry.\r\n\r\nIf you downloaded the .NET Core SDK 2.2 after April 2, 2019, version 2.2.2nn (such as 2.2.203) is listed first and is the highest version available. However, Visual Studio 2017 requires 2.2.1nn (such as 2.2.106). .NET Core SDK 2.2.2nn works with Visual Studio 2019. Visual Studio 2017 and Visual Studio 2019 can be installed side by side, but this requires both .NET Core SDK 2.2.1nn and .NET Core SDK 2.2.2nn to develop .NET Core 2.2 applications.\r\n\r\nTo download .NET Core SDK 2.2.2nn, visit the [.NET downloads page](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/download/dotnet-core/2.2).\r\n\r\n### Visual Studio 2017 can't target .NET Core 2.1\r\n\r\nIf you receive this error message in Visual Studio 2017:\r\n\r\n`The current .NET SDK does not support targeting .NET Core 2.1. Either target .NET Core 2.0 or lower, or use a version of the .NET SDK that supports .NET Core 2.1.`\r\n\r\nUse `dotnet --list-sdks` to ensure you have .NET Core SDK 2.1.5nn. As an example, 2.1.505 would be a valid entry. \r\n\r\nThis problem occurs of you manually uninstall the 2.1.5nn version.\r\n\r\nThe Visual Studio 2019 installation will not remove this file and Visual Studio 2017 will continue to work side by side.\r\n\r\nTo reinstall .NET Core SDK 2.1.5nn, visit the [.NET downloads page](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/download/dotnet-core/2.1).\r\n\r\n### Visual Studio 2019 can't target .NET Core 3.0 Preview\r\n\r\nIf you receive this error message in Visual Studio 2019:\r\n\r\n`The current .NET SDK does not support targeting .NET Core 2.1. Either target .NET Core 2.0 or lower, or use a version of the .NET SDK that supports .NET Core 2.1.`\r\n\r\nUse `dotnet --list-sdks` to ensure you have .NET Core SDK 3.0.100-preview... As an example, SDK 3.0.100-preview3-010431 would be a valid entry.\r\n\r\nTo install .NET Core SDK 3.0.1nn preview, visit the [.NET downloads page](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/download/dotnet-core/3.0).\r\n\r\nIn Visual Studio, go to `Tools\\Options\\Projects and Solutions\\.NET Core` and check the box `Use Previews of the .NET Core SDK`.\r\n\r\n> [NOTE!]\r\n> This option will be moving to `Tools\\Options\\Environment` and renamed `Preview Features` in Visual Studio 2019 version 16.1 Preview 2.\r\n\r\nIf you are targeting .NET Core 3.0 preview, the [C# language version will be C# 8.0 Preview by default](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/visualstudio/releases/2019/release-notes#csharp-defaults) allowing you to use new C# features.\r\n\r\n## Understand the relationship between .NET Core SDKs and Visual Studio build tools\r\n\r\nVisual Studio has its own copies of tools like MSBuild, NuGet and the compilers. If you install the .NET Core workload, it also installs the .NET Core SDK which has versions of these tools and provides tasks and targets. These two versions are built from the same repositories, but target .NET Framework and .NET Core respectively. \r\n\r\nWhen you build a .NET Core project in Visual Studio, it uses Visual Studio's copy of MSBuild, but the tasks and targets are supplied from the selected version of the .NET Core SDK. \r\n\r\nWhen you upgrade the .NET Core SDK, you get new tasks and targets. These new tasks and targets may contain features that are not supported by older versions of MSBuild. Like all of the .NET Core SDK, MSBuild is backwards compatible. It is not forwards compatible.\r\n\r\nThis generally works well, but requires a guarantee that the tasks and targets work with the MSBuild version. To ensure this, each .NET Core SDK indicates an MSBuild version range that is used by Visual Studio to determine compatibility. Versions of the .NET Core SDK that have a higher MSBuild identifier than expected are ignored by Visual Studio. In the normal case, this simply means you use the tasks and targets that were installed with your version of Visual Studio.\r\n\r\nBecause of this, you may have many versions of the .NET Core SDK on your machine and Visual Studio still fail to find one it considers appropriate. This is compounded by a poor error message, which we cannot fully correct because it is from the old version of the .NET Core SDK on your machine. Confusion is also compounded by a complex non-linear release matrix that makes it difficult to predict the right .NET Core SDK to select. We are working to improve all this. \r\n\r\n## The Visual Studio / .NET Core SDK support matrix\r\n\r\nThe last two digits of the .NET Core SDK version number are a patch number, which are represented by a `nn` in this table. You can learn more about .NET Core SDK and .NET Core Runtime versioning at the [Overview of how .NET Core is versioned page](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/core/versions/).\r\n\r\nThe following table shows which Visual Studio versions and .NET Core SDKs are compatible and how they are acquired if you are working with Visual Studio. \r\n\r\n| .NET Core SDK | .NET Core Runtime | Compatible Visual Studio | MSBuild | Notes                                     |\r\n|---------------|-------------------|--------------------------|---------|-------------------------------------------|\r\n| 2.1.5nn       | 2.1               | 2017                     | 15      | Installed as part of VS 2017 version 15.9 |\r\n| 2.1.6nn       | 2.1               | 2019                     | 16      | Installed as part of VS 2019              |\r\n| 2.2.1nn       | 2.2               | 2017                     | 15      | Installed manually                        |\r\n| 2.2.2nn       | 2.2               | 2019                     | 16      | Installed as part of VS 2019              |\r\n| 3.0.1nn       | 3.0 (Preview)     | 2019                     | 16      | Installed manually                        |\r\n\r\nVisual Studio 2017 cannot work with .NET Core SDK 2.1.6nn or 2.2.2nn.\r\n\r\nTo find out more about removing older versions of the .NET Core Runtime and .NET Core SDK, visit the [How to remove the .NET Core Runtime and SDK page](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/core/versions/remove-runtime-sdk-versions?tabs=macos).\r\n\r\nTo download the .NET Core SDK, visit the [.NET downloads page](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/download/dotnet-core).","Url":"https://github.com/dotnet/announcements/issues/108","RelatedDescription":"Open issue \".NET Core SDK 2.2.2nn and 2.1.6nn do not work with Visual Studio 2017\" (#108)"},{"Id":"432081093","IsPullRequest":false,"CreatedAt":"2019-04-11T15:16:43","Actor":"KathleenDollard","Number":"107","RawContent":null,"Title":"Limit DotNetCliToolReference Tools to .NET Core 2.2 and Below","State":"open","Body":"# Limit DotNetCliToolReference Tools to .NET Core 2.2 and Below\r\n\r\n.NET Core 3 takes the next step in the .NET Core tool strategy with local tools.

This issue would occur much more frequently if targeting .NET Core 3.0 was allowed. Restricting tools to target only .NET Core 2.2 and below means existing scenarios to continue to work (as well as they previously did), regardless of the framework version targeted by the project or the current .NET Core SDK. \r\n\r\nThe new .NET Core tool strategy avoids this flaw in restore strategy and offers other benefits, like the ability to author one type of tool and install it in different ways depending on project and user needs.\r\n\r\nWe look forward to your feedback on .NET Core Local Tools, and on challenges you face moving away from DotNetCliToolReference tools. \r\n\r\n[dotnet/sdk #3057](https://github.com/dotnet/sdk/pull/3057)","Url":"https://github.com/dotnet/announcements/issues/107","RelatedDescription":"Open issue \"Limit DotNetCliToolReference Tools to .NET Core 2.2 and Below\" (#107)"},{"Id":"431012407","IsPullRequest":false,"CreatedAt":"2019-04-09T14:51:18","Actor":"MichaelSimons","Number":"106","RawContent":null,"Title":".NET Core SDK container images now contain the Visual Studio 2019 toolset","State":"open","Body":"# .NET Core SDK container images now contain the Visual Studio 2019 toolset\r\n\r\n.NET Core SDK container images now include Visual Studio 2019 tools.

There are two primary reasons for this change:\r\n\r\n* Syndicate Microsoft-provided container images to multiple registries, like Docker Hub and Red Hat.\r\n* Use Microsoft Azure as a global CDN for delivering Microsoft-provided container images.\r\n\r\nYou will use and see MCR as a storage back-end for Microsoft images. The primary way you learn about Microsoft container images and tags will be through a registry, which for most users will continue to be Docker Hub. Most of the experience you've had browsing for .NET Core container images will continue unchanged with this new model. The Docker Hub URLs you've used for Microsoft repos will continue to work, and forward to updated locations on Docker Hub. Existing Docker Hub will images will be maintained as-is.\r\n\r\nSee [.NET Core Container Images now Published to Microsoft Container Registry](https://devblogs.microsoft.com/dotnet/net-core-container-images-now-published-to-microsoft-container-registry/) for the most updated information on our use of MCR.\r\n\r\n## Discussion\r\nPlease share your thoughts on this change and see what others are saying at:\r\n\r\n* [dotnet-docker #935](https://github.com/dotnet/dotnet-docker/issues/935)\r\n\r\n## Starting with .NET Core nightly repo\r\n\r\nOn the .NET team, we started our [transition to MCR](https://github.com/dotnet/dotnet-docker/issues/745) with the .NET Core \"nightly\" repo. [dotnet-nightly](dockerhub.com/r/microsoft/dotnet-nightly) is now hosted on MCR and syndicated to Docker Hub. We started with the nightly repo in order to discover and fix any challenges we found with this new model before we move our higher-traffic primary container repository.\r\n\r\nWe will start publishing [dotnet](dockerhub.com/r/microsoft/dotnet) to MCR a bit later, in either February or March. This issue will be updated when that happens.\r\n\r\n## Repo Split\r\n\r\nThe [.NET Core repo](https://hub.docker.com/r/microsoft/dotnet) currently includes 4 major categories of tags: \r\n\r\n* `sdk`\r\n* `aspnetcore-runtime`\r\n* `runtime` \r\n* `runtime-deps`\r\n\r\nProviding all of the tags in one place has helped with discoverability but made for a repo with an enormous README that can be challenging to navigate and consume. It is large enough that we exceeded Docker Hub README limits and had to artificially make it smaller.\r\n\r\nGoing forward, we will provide a repo for each of the tag categories listed above. We'll also provide a \"product repo\" that will hierarchicaly group all of our repos together. This will satisfy discoverability needs so that it will be easy to find the tags you want.\r\n\r\nYou can already see this experience with [microsoft-dotnet-core-nightly](https://hub.docker.com/_/microsoft-dotnet-core-nightly). There are now multiple repos for our nightly builds:\r\n\r\n* [.NET Core Nightly product repo](https://hub.docker.com/_/microsoft-dotnet-core-nightly)\r\n* [.NET Core SDK Nightly repo](https://hub.docker.com/_/microsoft-dotnet-core-nightly-sdk/)\r\n* [.NET Core ASP.NET Core Nightly repo](https://hub.docker.com/_/microsoft-dotnet-core-nightly-aspnet/)\r\n* [.NET Core Runtime Nightly repo](https://hub.docker.com/_/microsoft-dotnet-core-nightly-runtime/)\r\n* [.NET Core Runtime-deps Nightly repo](https://hub.docker.com/_/microsoft-dotnet-core-nightly-runtime-deps/)\r\n\r\nThe same split will exist for the non-nightly stable repo (currently hosted at  [microsoft/dotnet](https://hub.docker.com/r/microsoft/dotnet)) when we start publishing it to MCR and syndicating it back to DockerHub.\r\n\r\n## Changes to registry URL\r\n\r\nThe biggest change is that your Dockerfiles need to be updated to point to the MCR registry in order get access to new .NET Core container tags. The same change is required for scripts or human operations that pull images via `docker pull`.\r\n\r\nThe following example shows the registry path, repo and tag for the .NET Core 2.2 \"Nightly\" SDK on MCR:\r\n\r\n```console\r\nmcr.microsoft.com/dotnet/core-nightly/sdk:2.2\r\n```\r\n\r\nAs comparison, the following repo and tag have been used to date for the .NET Core 2.2 \"Nightly\" SDK on Docker Hub:\r\n\r\n```console\r\nmicrosoft/dotnet-nightly:2.2-sdk\r\n```\r\n\r\nThe new repo URL is provided at each of the news repos. For example, the new .NET Core SDK \"nightly\" repo provides a box on the right where you can copy and paste the correct MCR-based repo syntax that you can use for `docker pull` or in `FROM` statements in your Dockerfiles.\r\n\r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/2608468/52811702-95c5eb80-304a-11e9-8de8-e6ea1f4b4d75.png)\r\n\r\n## Servicing existing Docker Hub tags\r\n\r\nWe will continue to service existing non-version-specific or floating tags on Docker Hub while the associated .NET Core version is supported. For example the `microsoft/dotnet:2.1-sdk` tag is a floating tag that will continue to be serviced for the lifetime of .NET Core 2.1. You can continue using floating tags without issue.\r\n\r\nIf you use non-floating tags, like `microsoft/dotnet:2.1.504-sdk-alpine`, then you will need to update your Dockerfile to use a new non-floating tag. No new non-floating tags will be published to `microsoft/dotnet` and `microsoft/dotnet-nightly` after we fully transition to MCR.\r\n\r\n.NET Core 3.0 Preview 3 and later will only be made available on MCR.\r\n\r\n## Microsoft is a Verified Publisher\r\n\r\nUntil now, Microsoft-provided container images were considered \"community images\". As part of this change, we are re-classifying Microsoft as a \"verified publisher\" on Docker Hub.

Congratulations, Alpine team! On the .NET team, we are committed to supporting new Alpine versions quickly, and also need to define a policy for older versions. This policy only applies for the container images that we publish.\r\n\r\n## Discussion\r\nPlease share your thoughts on this change and see what others are saying at:\r\n\r\n* [dotnet-docker #933](https://github.com/dotnet/dotnet-docker/issues/933)\r\n\r\n## Policy\r\n\r\nWe intend to establish the following policy for supporting Alpine with .NET Core container images:\r\n\r\n* Support new Alpine versions within 60 days of release (hopefully much less).\r\n* Support n-1 Alpine versions for 3 months after we support a new Alpine version.\r\n\r\nNote: The [.NET Core support policy](https://github.com/dotnet/core/blob/master/os-lifecycle-policy.md) may be broader. This policy is specific to the container images we produce.\r\n\r\n## Plans\r\n\r\nWe're in the process of [fixing issues required to support Alpine 3.9](https://github.com/dotnet/dotnet-docker/issues/921). We expect that these issues will be resolved in February and that we'll be able to provide support for Alpine 3.9 in March.\r\n\r\nWe will produce Alpine 3.9 images for .NET Core 2.1, 2.2 and 3.0. Assuming we publish 3.9 images in March, we'll stop producing and supporting Alpine 3.7 and 3.8 images after June (2019).\r\n\r\n## Using Alpine-based .NET Core images\r\n\r\nWe produce a variety of Alpine-based images. You can either depend on a specific Alpine version, like with `microsoft/dotnet:2.2-sdk-alpine3.8` or opt to use the latest Alpine image we have to offer, like with `microsoft/dotnet:2.2-sdk-alpine`. Either are good choices. It is just a question of whether you want to make a conscious decision to move to later Alpine releases.\r\n\r\n## Support for ARM32?\r\n\r\nWe produce Alpine images for x64 (and ARM64, shortly). The [Alpine 3.9 announcement](https://twitter.com/alpinelinux/status/1090416212822110214) made mention of support for ARM32v7. We would like to enable .NET Core [Alpine-based images on ARM32](https://github.com/gliderlabs/docker-alpine/issues/463#issuecomment-460530395). We are patiently waiting for that to happen.

To check the currently installed runtimes, open a command prompt and run the `dotnet --info` command. If you have a 2.1 or greater runtime installed, you'll see output like the following;\r\n\r\n```text\r\n.NET Core SDK (reflecting any global.json):\r\n Version:   2.2.100\r\n Commit:    b9f2fa0ca8\r\n\r\nRuntime Environment:\r\n OS Name:     Windows\r\n OS Version:  10.0.17134\r\n OS Platform: Windows\r\n RID:         win10-x64\r\n Base Path:   C:\\Program Files\\dotnet\\sdk\\2.2.100\\\r\n\r\nHost (useful for support):\r\n  Version: 2.2.0\r\n  Commit:  1249f08fed\r\n\r\n.NET Core SDKs installed:\r\n  2.1.5 [C:\\Program Files\\dotnet\\sdk]\r\n  2.1.502 [C:\\Program Files\\dotnet\\sdk]\r\n  2.2.100 [C:\\Program Files\\dotnet\\sdk]\r\n\r\n.NET Core runtimes installed:\r\n  Microsoft.AspNetCore.All 2.1.6 [C:\\Program Files\\dotnet\\shared\\Microsoft.AspNetCore.All]\r\n  Microsoft.AspNetCore.App 2.1.6 [C:\\Program Files\\dotnet\\shared\\Microsoft.AspNetCore.App]\r\n  Microsoft.AspNetCore.All 2.2.0 [C:\\Program Files\\dotnet\\shared\\Microsoft.AspNetCore.All]\r\n  Microsoft.AspNetCore.App 2.2.0 [C:\\Program Files\\dotnet\\shared\\Microsoft.AspNetCore.App]\r\n  Microsoft.NETCore.App 2.1.6 [C:\\Program Files\\dotnet\\shared\\Microsoft.NETCore.App]\r\n  Microsoft.NETCore.App 2.2.0 [C:\\Program Files\\dotnet\\shared\\Microsoft.NETCore.App]\r\n\r\nTo install additional .NET Core runtimes or SDKs:\r\n  https://aka.ms/dotnet-download\r\n```\r\n\r\nIf your host version is 2.1.x and the highest `Microsoft.NETCore.App` runtime version is less than 2.1.7, you're vulnerable to this issue.\r\nIf your host version is 2.2.x and the highest 2.1.x `Microsoft.NETCore.App` runtime version is less than 2.2.1, you're vulnerable to this issue.\r\n\r\nYou will not see SDK versions if you have only installed the runtime.\r\n\r\n#### Applications not using Microsoft.NetCore.App\r\n\r\nThe affected assembly is also available separately as a NuGet package. If you are not using Microsoft.NetCore.App, you may still be affected if you are referencing the packages listed above.\r\n\r\n##### Direct dependencies\r\n\r\nDirect dependencies are discoverable by examining your `csproj` file. They can be fixed by [editing the project file](#fixing-direct-dependencies) or using NuGet to update the dependency.\r\n\r\n##### Transitive dependencies\r\n\r\nTransitive dependencies occur when you add a package to your project that in turn relies on another package. For example, if Contoso publishes a package `Contoso.Utility` which, in turn, depends on `Contoso.Internals` and you add the `Contoso.Utility` package to your project now your project has a direct dependency on `Contoso.Utility` and, because `Contoso.Utility` depends 'Contoso.Internals', your application gains a transitive dependency on the `Contoso.Internals` package.\r\n\r\nTransitive dependencies are reviewable in two ways:\r\n\r\n* In the Visual Studio Solution Explorer window, which supports searching.\r\n* By examining the `project.assets.json` file contained in the obj directory of your project for `csproj` based projects\r\n\r\nThe `project.assets.json` files are the authoritative list of all packages used by your project, containing both direct and transitive dependencies.\r\n\r\nThere are two ways to view transitive dependencies. You can either [use Visual Studio’s Solution Explorer](#vs-solution-explorer), or you can review [the `project.assets.json` file](#project-assets-json)).\r\n\r\n##### <a name=\"vs-solution-explorer\"></a>Using Visual Studio Solution Explorer\r\n\r\nTo use Solution Explorer, open the project in Visual Studio, and then press Ctrl+; to activate the search in Solution Explorer. Search for the [vulnerable package](#affected-software) and make a note of the version numbers of any results you find.\r\n\r\nFor example, searching for `Microsoft.AspNetCore.Mvc.Core` in an example project that contains a package that takes a dependency on `Microsoft.AspNetCore.Mvc` shows the following results in Visual Studio 2017:\r\n\r\n![Screenshot of search results in Visual Studio 2017](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/796298/25858816/8ecdc2b4-3491-11e7-9363-746804bb9832.png)\r\n\r\nThe search results appear as a tree. In the previous results, you can see that a reference to `Microsoft.AspNetCore.Mvc.Core` version 1.1.2 is discovered.\r\n\r\nUnder the Dependencies node is a NuGet node. Under the NuGet node is the list of packages you have directly taken a dependency on and their versions.\r\nIn screenshot, the application takes a direct dependency on `Microsoft.AspNetCore.Mvc`. `Microsoft.AspNetCore.Mvc` in turn has leaf nodes that list its dependencies and their versions.\r\nThe `Microsoft.AspNetCore.Mvc` package takes a dependency on a version of `Microsoft.AspNetCore.Mvc.ApiExplorer`, that in turn takes a dependency on a version of `Microsoft.AspNetCore.Mvc.Core`.\r\n\r\n##### <a name=\"project-assets-json\"></a> Manually reviewing project.assets.json\r\n\r\nOpen the *project.assets.json* file from your project’s obj directory in your editor. We suggest you use an editor that understands JSON and allows you to collapse and expand nodes to review this file.\r\nVisual Studio and Visual Studio Code provide JSON friendly editing.\r\n\r\nSearch the *project.assets.json* file for the [vulnerable package](#affected-software), using the format `packagename/` for each of the package names from the preceding table. If you find the assembly name in your search:\r\n\r\n* Examine the line on which they are found, the version number is after the `/`.\r\n* Compare to the [vulnerable versions table](#affected-software).\r\n\r\nFor example, a search result that shows `System.Private.Uri/4.3.0` is a reference to version 4.3.0 of `System.Private.Uri`.\r\n\r\nIf your *project.assets.json* file includes references to the [vulnerable package](#affected-software), then you need to fix the transitive dependencies.\r\n\r\nIf you have not found any reference to any vulnerable packages, this means either\r\n\r\n* None of your direct dependencies depend on any vulnerable packages, or\r\n* You have already fixed the problem by updating the direct dependencies.\r\n\r\n### <a name=\"how-fix\"></a>How do I fix the issue?\r\n\r\n#### Updating the version of Microsoft.NETCore.App\r\n\r\nIf your host version is a 2.1.x host you must install version 2.1.8 or later of the [.NET Core 2.1 runtime](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/download/dotnet-core/2.1), or corresponding [.NET Core 2.1 SDK](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/download/dotnet-core/2.1).\r\n\r\nIf your host version is a 2.2.x you must install version 2.2.2 or later of the [.NET Core 2.2 runtime](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/download/dotnet-core/2.2), or corresponding  [.NET Core 2.2 SDK](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/download/dotnet-core/2.2).\r\n\r\n#### <a name=\"fixing-direct-dependencies\"></a>Fixing direct dependencies\r\n\r\nOpen *projectname.csproj* in your editor. If you're using Visual Studio, right-click the project and choose **Edit projectname.csproj** from the context menu, where projectname is the name of your project. Look for `PackageReference` elements. The following shows an example project file:\r\n\r\n```xml\r\n<Project Sdk=\"Microsoft.NET.Sdk.Web\">\r\n  <PropertyGroup>\r\n    <TargetFramework>netcoreapp2.1</TargetFramework>\r\n  </PropertyGroup>\r\n  <ItemGroup>\r\n    <PackageReference Include=\"System.Private.Uri\" Version=\"4.3.0\" />\r\n  </ItemGroup>\r\n</Project>\r\n```\r\n\r\nThe preceding example has a reference to the [vulnerable package](#affected-software), as seen by the single `PackageReference` element. The name of the package is in the `Include` attribute.\r\nThe package version number is in the `Version` attribute. The previous example shows a single direct dependency on `System.Private.Uri` version 4.3.0\r\n\r\nTo update the version to the secure package, change the version number to the updated package version as listed on the table [previously](#affected-software).\r\nIn this example, update `System.Private.Uri` to the appropriate [fixed package number](#affected-software) for your major version. Save the *csproj* file. The example *csproj* now looks as follows:\r\n\r\n```xml\r\n<Project Sdk=\"Microsoft.NET.Sdk.Web\">\r\n  <PropertyGroup>\r\n    <TargetFramework>netcoreapp2.1</TargetFramework>\r\n  </PropertyGroup>\r\n  <ItemGroup>\r\n    <PackageReference Include=\"System.Private.Uri\" Version=\"4.3.0\" />\r\n  </ItemGroup>\r\n</Project>\r\n```\r\n\r\nIf you're using Visual Studio and you save your updated *csproj* file, Visual Studio will restore the new package version.\r\nYou can see the restore results by opening the **Output** window (Ctrl+Alt+O) and changing the **Show output from** drop-down list to **Package Manager**.\r\n\r\nIf you're not using Visual Studio, open a command line and change to your project directory. Execute the `dotnet restore` command to restore the updated dependencies.\r\n\r\nNow recompile your application. If after recompilation you see a *Dependency conflict warning*, you must update your other direct dependencies to versions that take a dependency on the updated package.\r\n\r\n#### <a name=\"transitive-dependencies\"></a>Fixing transitive dependencies\r\n\r\nIf your transitive dependency review found references to the [vulnerable package](#affected-software), you must add a direct dependency to the updated package to your *csproj* file to override the transitive dependency.\r\n\r\nOpen *projectname.csproj* in your editor. If you're using Visual Studio, right-click the project and choose **Edit projectname.csproj** from the context menu, where projectname is the name of your project.\r\nLook for `PackageReference` nodes, for example:\r\n\r\n```xml\r\n<Project Sdk=\"Microsoft.NET.Sdk.\">\r\n  <PropertyGroup>\r\n    <TargetFramework>net461</TargetFramework>\r\n  </PropertyGroup>\r\n  <ItemGroup>\r\n    <PackageReference Include=\"ThirdParty.NotUpdatedYet\" Version=\"2.0.0\" />\r\n  </ItemGroup>\r\n</Project>\r\n```\r\n\r\nYou must add a direct dependency to the updated version of the [vulnerable package](#affected-software) by adding it to the *csproj* file.\r\nYou do this by adding a new line to the dependencies section, referencing the fixed version.\r\nFor example, if your search showed a transitive reference to a vulnerable `System.ServiceModel.Http` version, you'd add a reference to the [fixed package number](#affected-software).\r\n\r\n```xml\r\n<Project Sdk=\"Microsoft.NET.Sdk.Web\">\r\n  <PropertyGroup>\r\n    <TargetFramework>net461</TargetFramework>\r\n  </PropertyGroup>\r\n  <ItemGroup>\r\n    <PackageReference Include=\"System.Private.Uri\" Version=\"4.3.0\" />\r\n    <PackageReference Include=\"ThirdParty.NotUpdatedYet\" Version=\"2.0.0\" />\r\n  </ItemGroup>\r\n</Project>\r\n```\r\n\r\nAfter you've added the direct dependency reference, save your *csproj* file.\r\n\r\nIf you're using Visual Studio, save your updated *csproj* file and Visual Studio will restore the new package versions.\r\nYou can see the restore results by opening the **Output** window (Ctrl+Alt+O) and changing the **Show output from** drop-down list to **Package Manager**.\r\n\r\nIf you're not using Visual Studio, open a command line and change to your project directory. Execute the `dotnet restore` command to restore the new dependencies.\r\n\r\n##### Rebuilding your application\r\n\r\nFinally, you must rebuild your application, test, and redeploy.\r\n\r\n## Other Information\r\n\r\n### Reporting Security Issues\r\n\r\nIf you have found a potential security issue in .NET Core, please email details to secure@microsoft.com.

To check the currently installed runtimes, open a command prompt and run the `dotnet --info` command. If you have a 2.1 or greater runtime installed, you'll see output like the following;\r\n\r\n```text\r\n.NET Core SDK (reflecting any global.json):\r\n Version:   2.2.100\r\n Commit:    b9f2fa0ca8\r\n\r\nRuntime Environment:\r\n OS Name:     Windows\r\n OS Version:  10.0.17134\r\n OS Platform: Windows\r\n RID:         win10-x64\r\n Base Path:   C:\\Program Files\\dotnet\\sdk\\2.2.100\\\r\n\r\nHost (useful for support):\r\n  Version: 2.2.0\r\n  Commit:  1249f08fed\r\n\r\n.NET Core SDKs installed:\r\n  2.1.5 [C:\\Program Files\\dotnet\\sdk]\r\n  2.1.502 [C:\\Program Files\\dotnet\\sdk]\r\n  2.2.100 [C:\\Program Files\\dotnet\\sdk]\r\n\r\n.NET Core runtimes installed:\r\n  Microsoft.AspNetCore.All 2.1.6 [C:\\Program Files\\dotnet\\shared\\Microsoft.AspNetCore.All]\r\n  Microsoft.AspNetCore.App 2.1.6 [C:\\Program Files\\dotnet\\shared\\Microsoft.AspNetCore.App]\r\n  Microsoft.AspNetCore.All 2.2.0 [C:\\Program Files\\dotnet\\shared\\Microsoft.AspNetCore.All]\r\n  Microsoft.AspNetCore.App 2.2.0 [C:\\Program Files\\dotnet\\shared\\Microsoft.AspNetCore.App]\r\n  Microsoft.NETCore.App 2.1.6 [C:\\Program Files\\dotnet\\shared\\Microsoft.NETCore.App]\r\n  Microsoft.NETCore.App 2.2.0 [C:\\Program Files\\dotnet\\shared\\Microsoft.NETCore.App]\r\n\r\nTo install additional .NET Core runtimes or SDKs:\r\n  https://aka.ms/dotnet-download\r\n```\r\n\r\nIf your host version is 2.1.x and the highest `Microsoft.NETCore.App` runtime version is less than 2.1.7, you're vulnerable to this issue.\r\nIf your host version is 2.2.x and the highest 2.1.x `Microsoft.NETCore.App` runtime version is less than 2.1.7, you're vulnerable to this issue.\r\n\r\nYou will not see SDK versions if you have only installed the runtime.\r\n\r\n#### Applications not using Microsoft.NetCore.App\r\n\r\nThe affected assembly is also available separately as a NuGet package. If you are not using Microsoft.NetCore.App, you may still be affected if you are referencing the packages listed above.\r\n\r\n##### Direct dependencies\r\n\r\nDirect dependencies are discoverable by examining your `csproj` file. They can be fixed by [editing the project file](#fixing-direct-dependencies) or using NuGet to update the dependency.\r\n\r\n##### Transitive dependencies\r\n\r\nTransitive dependencies occur when you add a package to your project that in turn relies on another package. For example, if Contoso publishes a package `Contoso.Utility` which, in turn, depends on `Contoso.Internals` and you add the `Contoso.Utility` package to your project now your project has a direct dependency on `Contoso.Utility` and, because `Contoso.Utility` depends 'Contoso.Internals', your application gains a transitive dependency on the `Contoso.Internals` package.\r\n\r\nTransitive dependencies are reviewable in two ways:\r\n\r\n* In the Visual Studio Solution Explorer window, which supports searching.\r\n* By examining the `project.assets.json` file contained in the obj directory of your project for `csproj` based projects\r\n\r\nThe `project.assets.json` files are the authoritative list of all packages used by your project, containing both direct and transitive dependencies.\r\n\r\nThere are two ways to view transitive dependencies. You can either [use Visual Studio’s Solution Explorer](#vs-solution-explorer), or you can review [the `project.assets.json` file](#project-assets-json)).\r\n\r\n##### <a name=\"vs-solution-explorer\"></a>Using Visual Studio Solution Explorer\r\n\r\nTo use Solution Explorer, open the project in Visual Studio, and then press Ctrl+; to activate the search in Solution Explorer. Search for the [vulnerable package](#affected-software) and make a note of the version numbers of any results you find.\r\n\r\nFor example, searching for `Microsoft.AspNetCore.Mvc.Core` in an example project that contains a package that takes a dependency on `Microsoft.AspNetCore.Mvc` shows the following results in Visual Studio 2017:\r\n\r\n![Screenshot of search results in Visual Studio 2017](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/796298/25858816/8ecdc2b4-3491-11e7-9363-746804bb9832.png)\r\n\r\nThe search results appear as a tree. In the previous results, you can see that a reference to `Microsoft.AspNetCore.Mvc.Core` version 1.1.2 is discovered.\r\n\r\nUnder the Dependencies node is a NuGet node. Under the NuGet node is the list of packages you have directly taken a dependency on and their versions.\r\nIn screenshot, the application takes a direct dependency on `Microsoft.AspNetCore.Mvc`. `Microsoft.AspNetCore.Mvc` in turn has leaf nodes that list its dependencies and their versions.\r\nThe `Microsoft.AspNetCore.Mvc` package takes a dependency on a version of `Microsoft.AspNetCore.Mvc.ApiExplorer`, that in turn takes a dependency on a version of `Microsoft.AspNetCore.Mvc.Core`.\r\n\r\n##### <a name=\"project-assets-json\"></a> Manually reviewing project.assets.json\r\n\r\nOpen the *project.assets.json* file from your project’s obj directory in your editor. We suggest you use an editor that understands JSON and allows you to collapse and expand nodes to review this file.\r\nVisual Studio and Visual Studio Code provide JSON friendly editing.\r\n\r\nSearch the *project.assets.json* file for the [vulnerable package](#affected-software), using the format `packagename/` for each of the package names from the preceding table. If you find the assembly name in your search:\r\n\r\n* Examine the line on which they are found, the version number is after the `/`.\r\n* Compare to the [vulnerable versions table](#affected-software).\r\n\r\nFor example, a search result that shows `SSystem.Net.Http/4.3.0` is a reference to version 4.3.0 of `System.Net.Http`.\r\n\r\nIf your *project.assets.json* file includes references to the [vulnerable package](#affected-software), then you need to fix the transitive dependencies.\r\n\r\nIf you have not found any reference to any vulnerable packages, this means either\r\n\r\n* None of your direct dependencies depend on any vulnerable packages, or\r\n* You have already fixed the problem by updating the direct dependencies.\r\n\r\n### <a name=\"how-fix\"></a>How do I fix the issue?\r\n\r\n#### Updating the version of Microsoft.NETCore.App\r\n\r\nIf your host version is a 2.1.x host you must install version 2.1.7 or later of the [.NET Core 2.1 runtime](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/download/dotnet-core/2.1), or corresponding [.NET Core 2.1 SDK](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/download/dotnet-core/2.1).\r\n\r\nIf your host version is a 2.2.x you must install version 2.2.1 or later of the [.NET Core 2.2 runtime](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/download/dotnet-core/2.2), or corresponding  [.NET Core 2.2 SDK](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/download/dotnet-core/2.2).\r\n\r\n#### <a name=\"fixing-direct-dependencies\"></a>Fixing direct dependencies\r\n\r\nOpen *projectname.csproj* in your editor. If you're using Visual Studio, right-click the project and choose **Edit projectname.csproj** from the context menu, where projectname is the name of your project. Look for `PackageReference` elements. The following shows an example project file:\r\n\r\n```xml\r\n<Project Sdk=\"Microsoft.NET.Sdk.Web\">\r\n  <PropertyGroup>\r\n    <TargetFramework>netcoreapp2.1</TargetFramework>\r\n  </PropertyGroup>\r\n  <ItemGroup>\r\n    <PackageReference Include=\"System.Net.Http\" Version=\"4.3.0\" />\r\n  </ItemGroup>\r\n</Project>\r\n```\r\n\r\nThe preceding example has a reference to the [vulnerable package](#affected-software), as seen by the single `PackageReference` element. The name of the package is in the `Include` attribute.\r\nThe package version number is in the `Version` attribute. The previous example shows a single direct dependency on `System.Net.Http` version 4.3.0\r\n\r\nTo update the version to the secure package, change the version number to the updated package version as listed on the table [previously](#affected-software).\r\nIn this example, update `System.IO.Pipelines` to the appropriate [fixed package number](#affected-software) for your major version. Save the *csproj* file. The example *csproj* now looks as follows:\r\n\r\n```xml\r\n<Project Sdk=\"Microsoft.NET.Sdk.Web\">\r\n  <PropertyGroup>\r\n    <TargetFramework>netcoreapp2.1</TargetFramework>\r\n  </PropertyGroup>\r\n  <ItemGroup>\r\n    <PackageReference Include=\"System.Net.Http\" Version=\"4.3.5\" />\r\n  </ItemGroup>\r\n</Project>\r\n```\r\n\r\nIf you're using Visual Studio and you save your updated *csproj* file, Visual Studio will restore the new package version.\r\nYou can see the restore results by opening the **Output** window (Ctrl+Alt+O) and changing the **Show output from** drop-down list to **Package Manager**.\r\n\r\nIf you're not using Visual Studio, open a command line and change to your project directory. Execute the `dotnet restore` command to restore the updated dependencies.\r\n\r\nNow recompile your application. If after recompilation you see a *Dependency conflict warning*, you must update your other direct dependencies to versions that take a dependency on the updated package.\r\n\r\n#### <a name=\"transitive-dependencies\"></a>Fixing transitive dependencies\r\n\r\nIf your transitive dependency review found references to the [vulnerable package](#affected-software), you must add a direct dependency to the updated package to your *csproj* file to override the transitive dependency.\r\n\r\nOpen *projectname.csproj* in your editor. If you're using Visual Studio, right-click the project and choose **Edit projectname.csproj** from the context menu, where projectname is the name of your project.\r\nLook for `PackageReference` nodes, for example:\r\n\r\n```xml\r\n<Project Sdk=\"Microsoft.NET.Sdk.\">\r\n  <PropertyGroup>\r\n    <TargetFramework>net461</TargetFramework>\r\n  </PropertyGroup>\r\n  <ItemGroup>\r\n    <PackageReference Include=\"ThirdParty.NotUpdatedYet\" Version=\"2.0.0\" />\r\n  </ItemGroup>\r\n</Project>\r\n```\r\n\r\nYou must add a direct dependency to the updated version of the [vulnerable package](#affected-software) by adding it to the *csproj* file.\r\nYou do this by adding a new line to the dependencies section, referencing the fixed version.\r\nFor example, if your search showed a transitive reference to a vulnerable `System.ServiceModel.Http` version, you'd add a reference to the [fixed package number](#affected-software).\r\n\r\n```xml\r\n<Project Sdk=\"Microsoft.NET.Sdk.Web\">\r\n  <PropertyGroup>\r\n    <TargetFramework>net461</TargetFramework>\r\n  </PropertyGroup>\r\n  <ItemGroup>\r\n    <PackageReference Include=\"System.Net.Http\" Version=\"4.3.5\" />\r\n    <PackageReference Include=\"ThirdParty.NotUpdatedYet\" Version=\"2.0.0\" />\r\n  </ItemGroup>\r\n</Project>\r\n```\r\n\r\nAfter you've added the direct dependency reference, save your *csproj* file.\r\n\r\nIf you're using Visual Studio, save your updated *csproj* file and Visual Studio will restore the new package versions.\r\nYou can see the restore results by opening the **Output** window (Ctrl+Alt+O) and changing the **Show output from** drop-down list to **Package Manager**.\r\n\r\nIf you're not using Visual Studio, open a command line and change to your project directory. Execute the `dotnet restore` command to restore the new dependencies.\r\n\r\n##### Rebuilding your application\r\n\r\nFinally, you must rebuild your application, test, and redeploy.\r\n\r\n## Other Information\r\n\r\n### Reporting Security Issues\r\n\r\nIf you have found a potential security issue in .NET Core, please email details to secure@microsoft.com.

However, .NET hasn't had a (great) built-in way to deal with JSON. Instead we've relied on [Json.NET] which continues to serve the .NET ecosystem well.\r\n\r\n[Json.NET]: https://www.newtonsoft.com/json\r\n\r\nMoving forward, we plan on making some changes to our JSON support:\r\n\r\n* **We need high-performance JSON APIs**. We need a new set of JSON APIs that are highly tuned for performance by using `Span<T>` and allows for processing UTF-8 directly without having to transcode to UTF-16 `string` instances. Both aspects are critical for our web server Kestrel, where throughput is a key requirement.\r\n\r\n* **Remove dependency from ASP.NET Core to Json.NET**. Today, ASP.NET Core has a dependency on Json.NET. While this provides a tight integration between ASP.NET Core and Json.NET, it also means that application developers cannot freely choose which JSON library they are using. This is also problematic for customers of Json.NET as the version is dictated by the underlying platform. However, Json.NET is frequently updated and application developers often want to -- or even have to -- use a specific version. Thus, we want to remove the dependency from ASP.NET Core 3.0 to Json.NET so that customers can choose which version to use, without fearing they might accidentally break the underlying platform. In addition, this makes it also possible to plug-in an entirely different JSON library.\r\n\r\n* **Provide an ASP.NET Core integration package for Json.NET**. Json.NET has basically become the Swiss Army knife of JSON processing in .NET. It provides many options and facilities that allow customers to handle their JSON needs with ease. We don't want to compromise on the Json.NET support customers are getting today, for example, the ability to configure the JSON serialization via the `AddJsonOptions` extension method. Thus, we want to provide the Json.NET integration as a NuGet package that developers can optionally install so they get all the bells and whistles they get from Json.NET today. The other part of this work item is to ensure we have the right extension points so that other parties can provide similar integration packages for their JSON library of choice.\r\n\r\nBelow are more details around this plan.\r\n\r\n## The need for high-performance JSON APIs\r\n\r\nThe requirements for the .NET stack have changed a bit since the arrival of .NET Core. Historically, .NET has valued usability and convenience. With .NET Core, we've added a focus on performance, and we've made significant investments to serve high performance needs. And the [improvements we made][techempower] in the popular TechEmpower benchmark are a testament to that.\r\n\r\n[techempower]: https://www.techempower.com/blog/2016/11/16/framework-benchmarks-round-13/\r\n\r\nWith .NET Core 2.1, we've added a brand new primitive called [Span\\<T>][span-msdn] that allows us to represent native memory and arrays in a uniform way. With this type, we've also added a set of parsing and encoding APIs that are much more memory efficient without having to resort to unsafe code.\r\n\r\n[span-msdn]: https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/magazine/mt814808.aspx\r\n\r\nPart of the work of minimizing allocations is to avoid having to transcode UTF-8 payloads into UTF-16 strings, purely for parsing reasons. Currently, Json.NET is implemented by reading UTF-16. We need the ability to read (and write) JSON documents directly in UTF-8 because most network protocols (including HTTP) use UTF-8.\r\n\r\nDuring .NET Core 2.1 we've learned that updating our existing APIs to leverage `Span<T>` has limits. While we did add a bunch of overloads that accept spans, we also had to produce brand new APIs that are designed around minimizing allocations and dealing with buffers, which we exposed in `System.Buffers` namespaces. And with `System.IO.Pipelines` we've also added a programming model that enables developers to share buffers without having to deal with lifetime issues.\r\n\r\nBased on these experiences we believe in order to support JSON parsing, we'll need to expose a new set of JSON APIs that are specifically geared for high-performance scenarios.\r\n\r\nYou might wonder why we can't just update Json.NET to include support for parsing JSON using `Span<T>`? Well, James Newton-King -- the author of Json.NET -- has the following to say about that:\r\n\r\n> Json.NET was created over 10 years ago, and since then it has added a wide range of features aimed to help developers work with JSON in .NET. In that time Json.NET has also become far and away NuGet's most depended on and downloaded package, and is the go-to library for JSON support in .NET. Unfortunately, Json.NET's wealth of features and popularity works against making major changes to it. Supporting new technologies like `Span<T>` would require fundamental breaking changes to the library and would disrupt existing applications and libraries that depend on it.\r\n>\r\n> Going forward Json.NET will continue to be worked on and invested in, both addressing known issues today and supporting new platforms in the future. Json.NET has always existed alongside other JSON libraries for .NET, and there will be nothing to prevent you using one or more together, depending on whether you need the performance of the new JSON APIs or the large feature set of Json.NET.\r\n\r\n## Move Json.NET integration into a separate NuGet package\r\n\r\nToday, you cannot use ASP.NET Core without Json.NET because it is a dependency of ASP.NET Core itself. Over the years, we've received feedback that the dependency can conflict with other libraries that have their own dependency on a different version of Json.NET. In the past, we've considered addressing this issue by using a private copy of Json.NET in ASP.NET. However, this would create problems when developers want to configure Json.NET (for instance, in order to control how the serializer behaves when formatting JSON objects).\r\n\r\nMoving forward we'd like to:\r\n\r\n1. Replace the internal usage of Json.NET in ASP.NET Core by the new platform-provided JSON APIs.\r\n\r\n2. Factor the public facing usage of Json.NET into an optional integration package that can be acquired from NuGet.\r\n\r\nSo the existing integration between ASP.NET Core and Json.NET will continue to be supported, but will be moving out of the platform and into a separate package. However, since the integration is then designed to sit on top of the platform, it will also allow customers to update Json.NET to later versions.\r\n\r\nFurthermore, customers who need more performance can also choose to use the new JSON APIs, at the expense of the rich feature set that Json.NET offers.\r\n\r\n## Discussion\r\n\r\nFor a discussion, please go to https://github.com/dotnet/corefx/issues/33115.","Url":"https://github.com/dotnet/announcements/issues/90","RelatedDescription":"Open issue \"The future of JSON in .NET Core 3.0\" (#90)"},{"Id":"368440353","IsPullRequest":false,"CreatedAt":"2018-10-09T23:44:06","Actor":"vivmishra","Number":"89","RawContent":null,"Title":"October 2018 .NET Updates","State":"open","Body":"# October 2018 .NET Updates\r\n\r\nThe following .NET updates were released in October 2018.
