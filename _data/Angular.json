To implement an OR operation, and other more complex algorithms, a developer can use `trustAttribute`.\r\n\r\n### Describe alternatives you've considered\r\n1. hiding data inside the class attribute and parsing it\r\n2. using a span or div inside my element which is visually hidden but which I can access through my component dom ref and parse out the value\r\n3. de-DRYing my code and having component-specific content across n components instead of being able to leverage a generic service","Url":"https://github.com/angular/angular/issues/36650","RelatedDescription":"Open issue \"Extensible Sanitizer\" (#36650)"},{"Id":"600602989","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2020-04-15T22:34:21","Actor":"atscott","Number":"36648","RawContent":null,"Title":"Revert \"fix(common): `locales/global/*.js` are not ES5 compliant (#36…","State":"closed","Body":"…342)\"\r\n\r\nThis reverts commit c8f3fa9f3e2dd41b4e15b38786268093ce556557.\r\n","Url":"https://github.com/angular/angular/pull/36648","RelatedDescription":"Closed or merged PR \"Revert \"fix(common): `locales/global/*.js` are not ES5 compliant (#36…\" (#36648)"},{"Id":"600626895","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2020-04-15T22:31:54","Actor":"AndrewKushnir","Number":"36649","RawContent":null,"Title":"fix(core): properly identify modules affected by overrides in TestBed","State":"open","Body":"When module overrides (via `TestBed.overrideModule`) are present, it might affect all modules that import (even transitively) an overridden one.

This all well and all, but all tutorials/documents neglect to mention the tiny detail that no proper free editor or tool seems to exist. \r\n\r\nThis means that unless you want to pay 50-100 $ a month to a service like phrase.com, you are supposed to manually edit the xliff xml files by hand.\r\n\r\nThis is not possible when a project has 5+ translation strings.  \r\n\r\nWould it be a suggestion to look into supporting nested JSON for translations? I know there would be limitations such as placeholders, gender/plural etc, but for the 99% of developers who live fine with this limitation, it would be really beneficial.\r\n\r\nThe current official policy seems to be to use xliff, but it is not a practical solution for most people as, editing raw xml files is not something for a sane person. \r\n\r\nGoogling for free tools leads to abandoned xliff editor projects last updated in 2014-ish. Not an option.\r\n\r\nSo please, (re-)consider: support simple json/nested-json files for i18n translations.\r\n\r\nPS: I know plenty of 3rd party runtime solutions exist using json, but I'm really not much for degrading performance etc., I want to use the compile-time solution.\r\n\r\nPlease help\r\n\r\nThank you for a great work","Url":"https://github.com/angular/angular/issues/36644","RelatedDescription":"Open issue \"i18n - please support Json format\" (#36644)"},{"Id":"600523648","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2020-04-15T19:06:59","Actor":"crisbeto","Number":"36643","RawContent":null,"Title":"docs: add example to illustrate binding order differences in ivy","State":"open","Body":"Adds some examples and an explanation about the differences in binding order between Ivy and ViewEngine.\r\n","Url":"https://github.com/angular/angular/pull/36643","RelatedDescription":"Open PR \"docs: add example to illustrate binding order differences in ivy\" (#36643)"},{"Id":"600490231","IsPullRequest":false,"CreatedAt":"2020-04-15T17:08:44","Actor":"fireflysemantics","Number":"36642","RawContent":null,"Title":"@Input properties not initializing when using `ViewEncapsulation.ShadowDom`","State":"open","Body":"Did a writeup with Demo Projects here:\r\n\r\nhttps://stackoverflow.com/questions/61225191/angular-custom-element-input-property-not-initializing?noredirect=1#comment108312318_61225191\r\n\r\nTried switching the demo app to `ViewEncapsulation.Emulated` and that also does not work.\r\n","Url":"https://github.com/angular/angular/issues/36642","RelatedDescription":"Open issue \"@Input properties not initializing when using `ViewEncapsulation.ShadowDom`\" (#36642)"},{"Id":"599626018","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2020-04-15T16:25:09","Actor":"petebacondarwin","Number":"36622","RawContent":null,"Title":"fix(ngcc): force ngcc to exit on error","State":"closed","Body":"For some reason (possibly related to async/await promises)\r\nthe ngcc process is not exiting when spawned from the CLI\r\nwhen there has been an error (such as when it timesout waiting\r\nfor a lockfile to become free).\r\n\r\nCalling `process.exit()` directly fixes this.\r\n\r\nFixes #36616\r\n","Url":"https://github.com/angular/angular/pull/36622","RelatedDescription":"Closed or merged PR \"fix(ngcc): force ngcc to exit on error\" (#36622)"},{"Id":"600426084","IsPullRequest":false,"CreatedAt":"2020-04-15T16:23:04","Actor":"vinagreti","Number":"36640","RawContent":null,"Title":"NgForm false valid on template using OnPush","State":"open","Body":"<!--🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅\r\n\r\nOh hi there! 😄\r\n\r\nTo expedite issue processing please search open and closed issues before submitting a new one.\r\nExisting issues often contain information about workarounds, resolution, or progress updates.\r\n\r\n🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅-->\r\n\r\n\r\n# 🐞 bug report\r\n\r\n### Affected Package\r\n<!-- Can you pin-point one or more @angular/* packages as the source of the bug?

However because the previous version of the clang-format the angular/angular repository was pinned to, 1.0.41, was nearly 4 years old the number of styling changes made by the formatter was greater than desired.  After running the new version of clang-format across the formatted code in angular/angular it was found that ~2500 files would be affected by the new formatting.  At the time, the presumption was this was too large of a single change to land and instead the change would need to be able to be rolled out incrementally.\r\n\r\nThe gulp tasks which run the formatter were updated to only format files which were found to be changed between the current HEAD of a ref and its previous HEAD.  This works out to be either all of the changes in a single PR being looked at, or all of the changes in a commit as it lands in a branch.  This allowed for the updated formatting to only happen in files already changed by a PR, rather than changing all ~2500 files in one change and invalidating nearly every outstanding PR.\r\n\r\nHowever it was found that this created more noise than expected in each PR and instead our best action was to reformat the remaining formatted files in the repo in a single commit.\r\n\r\nPatch version of #36613\r\n","Url":"https://github.com/angular/angular/pull/36628","RelatedDescription":"Closed or merged PR \"build: reformat repo to new clang@1.4.0\" (#36628)"},{"Id":"599766605","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2020-04-14T18:16:59","Actor":"ranma42","Number":"36627","RawContent":null,"Title":"fix(ivy): narrow `NgIf` context variables in template type checker","State":"open","Body":"When the `NgIf` directive is used in a template, its context variables\r\ncan be used to capture the bound value.

At this point it looks like a bug to me, but maybe I am just not using Angular properly. \r\n\r\n#### What are you trying to do?\r\nUse trackBy to speed up a large and somewhat complex editable table that we previously built using mat-table and a FormArray where the user can create, update, delete rows and save changes.\r\n\r\n### What are you seeing that does not match your expectations? \r\nAdding the trackBy property with a simple tracker function (obj => obj.id) makes deletion of lines of the table not rendered properly even if the data in the component looks correct.\r\n\r\n#### What troubleshooting steps have you tried?\r\n-Removing the trackBy, which works but causes other problems in the application I'm working on.\r\n-Changing the tracker function with various approaches, which yields a variety of results, but never exactly what I am looking for and/or not usable in my real case. \r\n-Make the table not tied to a form, which works but defeats my actual use of using the power of Angular reactive forms for edition, validation...\r\n-Use a FormGroup (keyed on id) instead of a FormArray, which works but complexifies data management in my case as change detection is different. This is the workaround I am trying to make work on my real-case right now. \r\n\r\n#### Reproduction\r\nI tried to isolate the problem as much as I could within: \r\n[]https://stackblitz.com/edit/angular-rijqud?file=src%2Fapp%2Fapp.component.ts\r\n\r\nTry to delete Chris for instance. You'll see Serena appear twice. Basic console.logs seem to indicate data is correct. \r\n  \r\n#### Environment\r\nTried:\r\n- Angular: 7.2.0 & 9.1.0\r\n- CDK/Material: 7.3.7 & 9.1.3\r\n- Browser(s): Chrome\r\n- Operating System (e.g. Windows, macOS, Ubuntu): Ubuntu\r\n\r\nThanks a lot !","Url":"https://github.com/angular/components/issues/19081","RelatedDescription":"Open issue \"help([MatTable]): [trackBy on a MatTable tied to a FormArray seems to fail]\" (#19081)"},{"Id":"600310649","IsPullRequest":false,"CreatedAt":"2020-04-15T13:46:35","Actor":"rdelormeCHS","Number":"19080","RawContent":null,"Title":"bug NG SERVE : fails when adding new angular material imports","State":"open","Body":"#### Reproduction\r\nI see this issue reported else where and the reports are closed, but I don' think it is.\r\nI'm somewhat new to angular and first time reporting something, so bare with me if i don't do this 100% right. I have a new project I just created. out of the box, ng new <project> installed angular/cdk, material, animations hammerjs, bootstrap to get started.\r\n\r\nstarting to import angular material modules. \r\n\r\nSteps to reproduce:\r\n1.  I run ng serve. things run fine at first, no components added yet.\r\n2. Now, to so app.module.ts -> import any angular material component, doesn't matter which one.\r\n  * add the import at the top.\r\n  * add the module to the ngModule-> Imports.\r\n3. go to app.component -> add a declaration. I just copy and paste the example for material web site for testing.\r\n4. ng serve gives following error:\r\n\r\n ERROR in node_modules/@angular/material/card/card-module.d.ts:8:22 - error NG6002: Appears in the NgModule.imports of AppModule, but could not be resolved to an NgModule class.\r\n    \r\n    This likely means that the library (@angular/material/card) which declares MatCardModule has not been processed correctly by ngcc, or is not compatible with Angular Ivy. Check if a newer version of the library is available, and update if so. Also consider checking with the library's authors to see if the library is expected to be compatible with Ivy.\r\n    \r\n    8 export declare class MatCardModule {\r\n                           ~~~~~~~~~~~~~\r\n \r\n5. Kill ng serve. \r\n6. Run ng build\r\n7. run ng serve -> now it works.\r\n\r\nThere is something internally going wrong. Usually, I can go to @ngModule->Imports and start typing a module name and use the VS COde auto-import plugin but the intellisense is not showing an material components ->only after adding the import at the top of the file, then it shows the one component in intellisense.\r\n\r\nI have another project on my same machine. The version of the @angular stuff is one revision earlier. It all works fine as expected.  I recall seeing this error in that project at the beginning too. I just don't have any idea how I got rid of it, but realistically, this shouldn't happen in a clean out of the box project using all angular components.\r\n\r\n#### Expected Behavior\r\n\r\nWhat behavior were you expecting to see?\r\n\r\nI am expecting that ng serve works as expected -> on the fly compile successfully.\r\n\r\n#### Actual Behavior\r\n\r\nrequired to kill ng serve, and do ng

The `matchSize` functionality is then executed with these modified (smaller, in this case) dimensions.\r\n\r\n--------------\r\n\r\n## Possible Solution\r\n\r\nIs a view container even necessary here?\r\nChanging the above code to the following appears to work just fine.\r\n\r\n```ts\r\n if (previewTemplate) {\r\n      // <-- HERE -->\r\n      //const viewRef = previewConfig!.viewContainer.createEmbeddedView(previewTemplate,\r\n      //                                                                 previewConfig!.context);\r\n      const viewRef = previewTemplate.createEmbeddedView(previewConfig!.context);\r\n      viewRef.detectChanges();\r\n```\r\nThis creates the same drag preview `viewRef`, except it is not immediately attached to the DOM.\r\n\r\nThe reproduction link contains some copied source code to preview this change - just need to comment/uncomment those lines.\r\n\r\nAlternatively, the dragged item could be measured before the preview is created. But if there is no reason to use a view container, the above change seems like the more optimal approach.\r\n\r\n#### Reproduction\r\n\r\n[StackBlitz](https://stackblitz.com/edit/angular-twksuh?file=src/app/cdk-drag-drop-horizontal-sorting-example.html)\r\n \r\n \r\n#### Expected Behavior\r\n\r\nPreview to match size.\r\n\r\n\r\n#### Actual Behavior\r\n\r\nPreview does not match size.\r\n\r\n\r\n#### Environment\r\n\r\n- Angular:\r\n- CDK/Material: 9.2\r\n- Browser(s):\r\n- Operating System (e.g. Windows, macOS, Ubuntu): \r\n","Url":"https://github.com/angular/components/issues/19060","RelatedDescription":"Open issue \"bug(drag-drop): cdkDragPreview matchSize does not always match size due to view container insertion\" (#19060)"},{"Id":"598631632","IsPullRequest":false,"CreatedAt":"2020-04-13T02:28:46","Actor":"ngohungphuc","Number":"19059","RawContent":null,"Title":"help([CDK]): [enter is deprecated: No longer being used.
