expect(app.testCmpCtrl.testField).toBe('overwritten');\r\n  });\r\n});\r\n```\r\n\r\nWithout ivy the test works correct, but with ivy the test fails with error: \"Error: Expected 'default' to be 'overwritten'\", which means that the override has not occurred.\r\n\r\n## 🔬 Minimal Reproduction\r\ngithub: https://github.com/nmatushevskiy/ivy-overrideModule-issue\r\n\r\n* clone repository\r\n*

This is the main package that contains the implementation that allows Angular to run in NativeScript.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Is this a regression?\r\n\r\nNo, because Ivy is a feature that we want to allow the users of NativeScript to benefit from.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Description\r\n\r\nCurrently we want to build the `@nativescript/angular` package with `ngc` (in order to support View engine) and want to make sure that the package is also correctly processed by `ngcc` (in order to support Ivy)\r\n\r\n\r\n## 🔬 Minimal Reproduction\r\n\r\nAs this is yet not merged and release because 9.0.0 is till not available officially. You cna observe the issue in a branch of `@nativescript/angular`. Here is a show setup:\r\n\r\n- Clone `git clone https://github.com/NativeScript/nativescript-angular.git`\r\n- `cd nativescript-angular`\r\n- `git checkout amiorkov/ivy`\r\n- `cd nativescript-angular && npm i && npm run pack && cd ../nativescript-angular-package && npm i`\r\n    - npm's prepare script will trigger `ngcc` and after it `ngc` (making the `@nativescript/angular` package compatible for View Engine)\r\n\r\n### Test app\r\n- `cd e2e/ivy-sample && npm i && ./node_modules/.bin/ngcc && tns run ios` - We would like to use a symlink in this app for the `nativescript-angular` package. Can we make `ngcc` work with symlinked packages (the code that ngcc needs to compile is nested in an innter `node_modules`)\r\n\r\n## 🔥 Exception or Error\r\n<pre><code>\r\n<!-- If the issue is accompanied by an exception or an error, please share it below: -->\r\nmcsofamiorkov:ivy-sample amiorkov$ ./node_modules/.bin/ngcc\r\nWarning: Entry point '@nativescript/angular' contains deep imports into '/Users/amiorkov/Desktop/Work/nativescript-angular/e2e/ivy-sample/node_modules/tns-core-modules/ui/layouts/layout-base'.

Apparently since those test components are never part of a  `@NgModule`, the compilation will fail (e.g. component not found).\r\n\r\n_accordion.spec.ts_\r\n```ts\r\n@Component({\r\n  template: `<cdk-accordion>..</cdk-accordion>`\r\n})\r\n/** notice: not exported */ class TestComponent {}\r\n```\r\n\r\nOne could argue that test files and application code shouldn't be part of the same compilation unit, but this has been working in View Engine and helped speeding up test compilation. There are more benefits like not having to use path mapping inside tests. i.e. relative imports to application code work just fine.\r\n\r\nAnother benefit is that the application/library components are compiled AOT. This is the primary reason why we follow this pattern (in `angular/components`).\r\n\r\n\r\n**Note**: CLI projects follows the same pattern where tests and application code are part of the same compilation unit. The CLI just runs `tsc` instead of the Angular compiler (which we want for AOT)\r\n\r\n### Possible solutions\r\n\r\n* Saying that this is the expected behavior, though it will be a change in v9 that involves infrastructure changes. It doesn't seem easy to split into two compilation units, if tests and application code are located next to each other.\r\n* Following NGC behavior by ignoring symbols which are not exported.\r\n* Adding `jit: true` to every test component.\r\n\r\n### Reproduction\r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/devversion/ngtsc-test-component-analysis","Url":"https://github.com/angular/angular/issues/33724","RelatedDescription":"Open issue \"ngtsc tries to compile non-exported components while ngc did not\" (#33724)"},{"Id":"520804376","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2019-11-11T08:19:03","Actor":"alan-agius4","Number":"33723","RawContent":null,"Title":"refactor(elements): ng-add schematics","State":"open","Body":"This PR brings a couple of changes;\r\n- Removes undeed dependencies in bazel targets such as `//packages/common` & `//packages/core`\r\n- Removes RxJs usage\r\n- Adds `document-register-element` to architect test targets\r\n- Use @schematics/angular helpers\r\n- Uses the standard `$source\": \"projectName\"` to get the projectName, which is defined in the `schema.json`\r\n- Use workspace writer to update the workspace config\r\n","Url":"https://github.com/angular/angular/pull/33723","RelatedDescription":"Open PR \"refactor(elements): ng-add schematics\" (#33723)"},{"Id":"520777607","IsPullRequest":false,"CreatedAt":"2019-11-10T19:15:19","Actor":"jdavidls","Number":"33722","RawContent":null,"Title":"[BUG] Unexpected value.
