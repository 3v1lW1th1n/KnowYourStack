We can put *more* time and effort into these SPA templates now the effort isn't so spread out.\r\n* If you have an existing Aurelia/Knockout/Vue project based on our SPA templates, you're not directly affected because these templates are only used to create new projects. You can continue building and shipping your app forever. Obviously we still support and enhance the underlying ASP.NET Core APIs (such as those in JavaScriptServices) that you are using.\r\n* The `Microsoft.AspNetCore.SpaTemplates` package, containing Aurelia, Knockout, and Vue templates, continues to be available, but we'll no longer update it or work on issues related to it.\r\n* We encourage enthusiastic community members to [ship your own `dotnet new` templates](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/core/tools/custom-templates).
