The `<div #foo></div>` will always match. The match from an embedded view depends on what happens with this view and there are 4 operations to consider here:\r\n* view creation;\r\n* view insertion (it is possible to create a view without attaching it to the views tree);\r\n* view detaching (it is possible to detach a view without destroying it;\r\n* view destruction.\r\n\r\nPlease note that there are logical pairs of equivalent operations here: create / destroy and insert / detach.\r\n\r\n### View engine behaviour\r\n\r\nIn the view engine we need to _both_  create _and_ insert a view for the results from an embedded view to be reported to queries. The creation itself is not sufficient - we need to insert a view so its nodes are \"visible\" to queries. This seems like a logical and sensible behaviour.\r\n\r\nInterestingly, detaching a view will _not_ make detached view results go away from queries - it is only when a view is destroyed that results are no longer reported. This seems counter intuitive and lacks symmetry when it comes to insert / detach  operations.\r\n\r\n### ngIvy behaviour\r\n\r\nngIvy uses the  insert / detach  operations to add / remove query results from embedded view. It means that query results will be updated (removed) upon view detaching.\r\n\r\n\r\nAdditionally this PR fixes a bug in the ngIvy implementation where queries were not marked as dirty when a view was inserted.\r\n","Url":"https://github.com/angular/angular/pull/28429","RelatedDescription":"Closed or merged PR \"fix(ivy): mark query as dirty upon view insertion\" (#28429)"},{"Id":"404123063","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2019-01-30T00:41:41","Actor":"kara","Number":"28415","RawContent":null,"Title":"fix(ivy): throw if @Input and @ContentChild share a property","State":"closed","Body":"In View Engine, we supported @Input and @ContentChild annotations\r\non the same property.

The `@ngtools/webpack` package can not be resolved. This happens due to a yarn monorepo structure, in which `@ngtools/webpack` will not be placed in the root `./node_modules` folder due conflicts with other dependencies, so it gets placed under `./node_modules/@angular-devkit/build-angular/node_modules`. And then it can not be found during build.\r\n\r\nI tracked down the issue and found the source. You can see the problem also in issue #10220. It was fixed by @hansl in the old single repo: https://github.com/angular/devkit/pull/647 but didn't get copied to the new monorepo? --> https://github.com/angular/angular-cli/blob/master/packages/angular_devkit/build_angular/src/angular-cli-files/models/webpack-configs/typescript.ts#L23\r\n\r\n**Can we do this change once again?**\r\n\r\nIf I change those lines locally the build is successful, but I do not know if we can simply change this without other problems?\r\n\r\nNote: If you have a monorepo with only one angular application this problem should not happen, but in my case the monorepo has also some angularjs applications and multiple webpack configurations. So multiple webpack, loader and angular dependency versions are around, not all aligned.\r\n\r\n\r\n## 🔬 Minimal Reproduction\r\n\r\nReproduction repo: https://github.com/fabianbru/angular-cli-bug-reproduction\r\nThis repo is a striped down repo, so there are many dependencies without real code.\r\n\r\nStep-by-Step guide:\r\n- Node 10 (Node version should not matter)\r\n- yarn 1.13.0\r\n- Checkout\r\n- run `yarn` in the root to install all dependencies\r\n- run `yarn dev` in the root\r\n--> ERROR will occur\r\n- change lines 7-9 locally in `node_modules/@angular-devkit/build-angular/src/angular-cli-files/models/webpack-configs/typescript.js` to:\r\n```\r\nconst webpackLoader = require.resolve('@ngtools/webpack')\r\n```\r\n---> build should be successful\r\n\r\n## 🔥 Exception or Error\r\n<pre><code>\r\n<!-- If the issue is accompanied by an exception or an error, please share it below: -->\r\nERROR in multi <workspace-path>/angular-cli-bug-reproduction/node_modules/webpack-dev-server/client?http://0.0.0.0:0 webpack/hot/dev-server ./src/main.ts\r\nModule not found: Error: Can't resolve '@ngtools/webpack' in '<workspace-path>/angular-cli-bug-reproduction/packages/angular'\r\nERROR in multi ./src/polyfills.ts\r\nModule not found: Error: Can't resolve '@ngtools/webpack' in '<workspace-path>/angular-cli-bug-reproduction/packages/angular'\r\n\r\n<workspace-path> is the path to my workspace, like `/Users/xyz/workspace`\r\n</code></pre>\r\n\r\n\r\n## 🌍 Your Environment\r\n<pre><code>\r\n<!-- run `ng version` and paste output below -->\r\nAngular CLI: 7.2.3\r\nNode: 10.15.0\r\nOS: darwin x64\r\nAngular: 7.2.2\r\n... animations, cdk, common, compiler, compiler-cli, core, forms\r\n... http, language-service, material, platform-browser\r\n... platform-browser-dynamic, platform-server, router\r\n\r\nPackage                           Version\r\n-----------------------------------------------------------\r\n@angular-devkit/architect         0.12.3\r\n@angular-devkit/build-angular     0.12.3\r\n@angular-devkit/build-optimizer   0.12.3\r\n@angular-devkit/core              7.2.3\r\n@angular-devkit/schematics        7.2.3\r\n@angular/cli                      7.2.3\r\n@angular/flex-layout              7.0.0-beta.23\r\n@schematics/angular               7.2.3\r\n@schematics/update                0.12.3\r\nrxjs                              6.3.3\r\ntypescript                        3.2.4\r\nwebpack                           4.29.0\r\n</code></pre>\r\n\r\n**Anything else relevant?**","Url":"https://github.com/angular/angular-cli/issues/13539","RelatedDescription":"Open issue \"Can't resolve '@ngtools/webpack' in yarn monorepo\" (#13539)"},{"Id":"404145057","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2019-01-29T06:45:11","Actor":"renovate-bot","Number":"13538","RawContent":null,"Title":"build: update autoprefixer to version 9.4.7","State":"open","Body":"This PR contains the following updates:\n\n| Package | Type | Update | Change | References |\n|---|---|---|---|---|\n| autoprefixer | dependencies | patch | `9.4.6` -> `9.4.7` | [source](https://togithub.com/postcss/autoprefixer) |\n\n---\n\n### Release Notes\n\n<details>\n<summary>postcss/autoprefixer</summary>\n\n### [`v9.4.7`](https://togithub.com/postcss/autoprefixer/blob/master/CHANGELOG.md#&#8203;947)\n\n[Compare Source](https://togithub.com/postcss/autoprefixer/compare/9.4.6...9.4.7)\n\n-   Fix infinite loop on mismatched parens.\n\n</details>\n\n---\n\n### Renovate configuration\n\n:date: **Schedule**: \"after 10pm every weekday,before 4am every weekday,every weekend\" in timezone America/Tijuana.\n\n:vertical_traffic_light: **Automerge**: Disabled by config.

`@angular-devkit/schematics` as a dependency in a custom CLI. I observed that when a `NodePackageInstallTask` is used within a `NodeWorkflow` where the root directory has not been provided, the working directory in `new NodePackageInstallTask(\"/path/to/directory\")` is not resolved correctly and ends up with a `ENOENT` error.\r\n\r\nIt seems to be related to the `NodeWorkflow` class: \r\n- In the constructor, [the `root` parameter is optional](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli/blob/master/packages/angular_devkit/schematics/tools/workflow/node-workflow.ts#L25) \r\n- then there is [this fallback](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli/blob/master/packages/angular_devkit/schematics/tools/workflow/node-workflow.ts#L45) returning undefined.\r\n- the node package executor fallbacks on [`process.cwd()`](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli/blob/master/packages/angular_devkit/schematics/tasks/node-package/executor.ts#L60) as root directory which is [then prepended to the working directory](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli/blob/master/packages/angular_devkit/schematics/tasks/node-package/executor.ts#L78).\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n## 🔬 Minimal Reproduction\r\n```\r\nimport { NodeJsSyncHost } from '@angular-devkit/core/node';\r\nimport { NodeWorkflow } from '@angular-devkit/schematics/tools';\r\n\r\n\r\nconst fsHost = new virtualFs.ScopedHost(new NodeJsSyncHost());\r\nconst workflow = new NodeWorkflow(fsHost, { dryRun:false });\r\n\r\n// schematics\r\nfunction schematics(){\r\n  return (host: Tree, context: SchematicContext) => {\r\n    const projectPath= \"/home/path/to/project\"\r\n    const templateSource = apply(url(templatePath), [move(projectPath)]);\r\n    context.addTask(new NodePackageInstallTask(projectPath));\r\n    return chain([branchAndMerge(mergeWith(templateSource))])(host, context);\r\n  }\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\n## 🔥 Exception or Error\r\n<pre><code>\r\nevents.js:167\r\n      throw er; // Unhandled 'error' event\r\n      ^\r\n\r\nError: spawn /bin/sh ENOENT\r\n    at Process.ChildProcess._handle.onexit (internal/child_process.js:229:19)\r\n    at onErrorNT (internal/child_process.js:406:16)\r\n    at process._tickCallback (internal/process/next_tick.js:63:19)\r\n    at Function.Module.runMain (internal/modules/cjs/loader.js:745:11)\r\n    at startup (internal/bootstrap/node.js:236:19)\r\n    at bootstrapNodeJSCore (internal/bootstrap/node.js:560:3)\r\nEmitted 'error' event at:\r\n    at Process.ChildProcess._handle.onexit (internal/child_process.js:235:12)\r\n    at onErrorNT (internal/child_process.js:406:16)\r\n    [... lines matching original stack trace ...]\r\n    at bootstrapNodeJSCore (internal/bootstrap/node.js:560:3)\r\n</code></pre>\r\n\r\n\r\n## 🌍 Your Environment\r\n<pre><code>\r\n \"@angular-devkit/core\": \"^7.3.0-rc.0\",\r\n \"@angular-devkit/schematics\": \"^7.3.0-rc.0\",\r\n  node: 10.6.0\r\n</code></pre>\r\n","Url":"https://github.com/angular/angular-cli/issues/13526","RelatedDescription":"Open issue \"NodePackageInstallTask does not resolve absolute paths\" (#13526)"},{"Id":"403027069","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2019-01-26T05:20:32","Actor":"renovate-bot","Number":"13520","RawContent":null,"Title":"build: update pacote to version 9.4.1","State":"closed","Body":"This PR contains the following updates:\n\n| Package | Type | Update | Change | References |\n|---|---|---|---|---|\n| pacote | dependencies | patch | `9.4.0` -> `9.4.1` | [source](https://togithub.com/zkat/pacote) |\n\n---\n\n### Release Notes\n\n<details>\n<summary>zkat/pacote</summary>\n\n### [`v9.4.1`](https://togithub.com/zkat/pacote/blob/master/CHANGELOG.md#&#8203;941httpsgithubcomzkatpacotecomparev940v941-2019-01-24)\n\n[Compare Source](https://togithub.com/zkat/pacote/compare/v9.4.0...v9.4.1)\n\n##### Bug Fixes\n\n-   **directory, finalize-manifest:** strip byte order marker from JSON ([723ad63](https://togithub.com/zkat/pacote/commit/723ad63))\n\n</details>\n\n---\n\n### Renovate configuration\n\n:date: **Schedule**: \"after 10pm every weekday,before 4am every weekday,every weekend\" in timezone America/Tijuana.\n\n:vertical_traffic_light: **Automerge**: Disabled by config.

It used to work work fine in both Chrome and IE (Edge, 10, 11) till I ran the `ng-build --prod` for the first time to deploy it on the server. Since then the app is breaking in all of the IE versions, but still works fine in Chrome. I traced the bug and narrowed it down to the following function:\r\n\r\n```\r\n  init(): Promise<boolean> {\r\n        return new Promise<boolean>((resolve, reject) => {\r\n            this._sessionService.getCurrentLoginInformations().toPromise().then((result: GetCurrentLoginInformationsOutput) => {\r\n                this._application = result.application;\r\n                this._user = result.user;\r\n                this._tenant = result.tenant;\r\n                resolve(true);\r\n            }, (err) => {\r\n                reject(err);\r\n            });\r\n        });\r\n    }\r\n```\r\nThe issue is that in IE nothing is getting populated for neither of the result variable properties. but again all is good when running it in Chrome!
