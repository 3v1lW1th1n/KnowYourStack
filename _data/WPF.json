Essentially:\r\n\r\n``` csharp\r\nvar x = new Application();\r\n```\r\n\r\nThat would result in that particular error.\r\n\r\nIf I'm right that's really an issue for templates to solve. The compiler is behaving properly. But I think we'll either be faced with a choice of:\r\n\r\n1. Keep the templates simple and with standard C# code spit\r\n1. Make the templates resilient to issues like this by doing using aliases and lots of `::global` qualifiers. \r\n\r\n\n\n---\n\n@taori commented on [Mon Dec 10 2018](https://github.com/dotnet/cli/issues/10454#issuecomment-445940191)\n\n@jaredpar \r\n\r\n##generated app.xaml.cs\r\n\r\n```\r\nusing System;\r\nusing System.Collections.Generic;\r\nusing System.Configuration;\r\nusing System.Data;\r\nusing System.Linq;\r\nusing System.Threading.Tasks;\r\nusing System.Windows;\r\n\r\nnamespace test.Application\r\n{\r\n    /// <summary>\r\n    /// Interaction logic for App.xaml\r\n    /// </summary>\r\n    public partial class App : Application\r\n    {\r\n    }\r\n}\r\n\r\n```\r\n\r\n`::global` seems like a great idea to solve it. \n\n---\n\n@jaredpar commented on [Mon Dec 10 2018](https://github.com/dotnet/cli/issues/10454#issuecomment-445985641)\n\n@taori thanks for providing the source there. \r\n\r\n> ::global seems like a great idea to solve it.\r\n\r\nThat will be up to the template owners to decide.

I am sure anyone would figure out how to fix it, since the diagnostic points it out just fine.
