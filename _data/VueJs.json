That is not efficient because resulting `render` function creates new functions each time component is re-rendered. This increases time of garbadge collector work, especially on mobile devices. It becomes even worse when we declare event handler inside `v-for` because `render` function instantiate new functions for each iteration despite the fact that they are the same\r\n\r\n**Example** :\r\n\r\n```html\r\n<template>\r\n  <div>\r\n     <a href=\"#\" @click.prevent=\"toggleVisibility\">toggle</a>\r\n     <div v-for=\"todo in todos\">\r\n            <input @keydown.enter=\"saveTodo(todo)\" v-model=\"todo.title\">\r\n     </div>\r\n  </div>\r\n</template>\r\n```\r\n\r\nThe compiled render function looks like this:\r\n\r\n```js\r\n        return _c('div', [_c('a', {\r\n            attrs: {\r\n                \"href\": \"#\"\r\n            },\r\n            on: {\r\n                \"click\": function($event) {\r\n                    $event.preventDefault();\r\n                    return toggleVisibility($event)\r\n                }\r\n            }\r\n        })\r\n.....\r\n```\r\n\r\nBy caching event handlers we could decrease amount of created garbage (i.e., functions) and speed up resulting `render` function\r\n\r\n### What does the proposed API look like?\r\nI propose to add a cache object to every `Vue` component instance. That object will hold references to event handlers generated by compiler. And compiler should generate code like this for handlers which compiles to function expression:\r\n\r\n```js\r\n\"click\": _z[\"click.0\"] || function($event) {\r\n   $event.preventDefault();\r\n   return toggleVisibility($event)\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nThis task can be split into 3 parts:\r\n1. Cache event handlers outside `v-for`. This is quite easy, we just create a cache object per each `Vue` instance and generate a unique id (e.g., integer) for every element which has event handlers\r\n2. Cache event handlers inside `v-for`. I don't see an easy way to do this. However, if we could associate iteration scope with an element then we would be able to cache that handlers as well. So, the resulting handler for `keydown` may look like this:\r\n\r\n```js\r\n\"keydown\": _z[\"keydown.1\"] || function($event) {\r\n    if (!('button' in $event) && _k($event.keyCode, \"enter\", 13, $event.key, \"Enter\")) return null;\r\n    return saveTodo($event.currentTarget.__vforScope__.todo)\r\n},\r\n```\r\n3. We will need to update Vue hot loader api to clear handlers cache when template is updated (similar to how static functions cache is cleared)\r\n\r\nI can work on both PRs for this feature if you are ok with the proposed changes\r\n\r\n<!-- generated by vue-issues.

Sometimes how an element looks and is styled really depends to the component it belongs to.\r\nPardon me if there's something I overlooked and that isn't an actual issue. \r\n\r\n### What does the proposed API look like?\r\nWhat catches my attention about scoped styling is it goes down to the following structure:\r\n`<div data-v-783f90ce=\"\"><header data-v-783f90ce=\"\">` so the styling goes like:\r\n```css\r\ndiv header[data-v-783f90ce] {\r\n\r\n}\r\n```\r\nWhen I believe in regular css is perfectly fine to use inheritance like:\r\n```css\r\ndiv[data-v-783f90ce] header {\r\n\r\n}\r\n```\r\nAlthough I believe that the problem I witnessed has somewhat in common with the `data-v-` attribute but not quite sure is it the real reason for the current implementation behavior.\r\nNevertheless I think **vuejs** is great framework  and I just love it and especially the ease and convenience it creates and how good and logical it structured and interacts naturally. So I believe that the following precedent creates inconvenience and is in conflict with framework great nature.\r\nI sure believe that what occurs isn't accidental so there's a particular reason for current implementation perhaps this is how upcoming native css specification looks like so you have to follow it or some other particular reason but still there might be a solution.\r\n\r\nProbably `scoped=\"deep\"`  where deep selecting works as default  or `scoped=\"inherit\"` where `data-v` inheritance concerns parent and it takes care for its children styling might be a good tip so please consider it.\r\n\r\nThank you for your time keep up the good work. Appreciate it, great framework.\r\n\r\n<!-- generated by vue-issues.

Whether the users can use a slot doesn't rely on if they want data from slot scope, but on whether the slot is gonna be rendered for multiple times inside the component self, this may raise more confusion for our users (like #8175).\r\n\r\nSo why don't we just get rid of such caveats and let a slot to be rendered more than once? We can clone them on duplication to prevent render errors as we already run the scoped slot function each time anyway. This makes the logic a lot simpler for users IMO: if we do not expect to use data from the slot scope, just use a slot, otherwise we'll always have to declare `slot-scope` to create the binding.\r\n\r\nIn addition, this would make documenting the (scoped) slots of a component more consistent, we just declare the data structure for a slot scope and users can decide if they want some data to bind to the `slot-scope` and don't need to care about how many times it will be rendered.\r\n\r\n### What does the proposed API look like?\r\nNo additional API needed, just clone the slot nodes upon render and remove the waring about duplicated slots.\r\n\r\nIt may be implemented in userland today in a quite hacky way, see: https://codesandbox.io/s/lp11y2wovz\r\n\r\nI just tweaked the `cloneVNode` function from the Vue core a little bit and it seemed to be working as expected using render function (without losing reactivity and event binding). There maybe some other edge situations I missed so correct me if it's not such trivial.\r\n\r\n<!-- generated by vue-issues.

In this particular case the problem is that the `history` object is not present.\r\n\r\nThis was not really a problem before, `history` was `undefined` and it didn't really matter. The current behavior is different. When an app tries to access the `history` object it completely crashes. A polyfill cannot be implemented either because of this.\r\n\r\nIt would seem the solution to this problem should be simply to stick to hash mode, but Vue Router still tries to access `history` even in hash mode. I imagine this is done to check whether the history API is present, but since hash mode is already specified, those checks are unnecessary.\r\n\r\nA couple of months ago I hacked my way through this by modifying Vue Router. If there is interest I could implement this feature myself.\r\n\r\nEven if this feature is not implemented the Vue team should at least be aware of this limitation.\r\n\r\n### What does the proposed API look like?\r\nNo changes in the API would be necessary.\r\n\r\n<!-- generated by vue-issues.

But as a nature of web app, user may directly visit any \"deep route\" via a \"deep url\" and the \"back\" button loses its power to navigate through the reverse path:\r\n\r\n1. User visits `https://app.example.com/settings/general/about`\r\n2. User clicks back\r\n3. App exits \r\n*Instead, we want the app to navigate to `/settings/general`*\r\n\r\nI have managed to automatically inject the `/settings`, `/settings/general` routes when user directly visits `/settings/general/about`. The problem is these two pages and transitions associated to them show up in this process. \r\n\r\nI need the routing life cycles of auto injected routes, i.e. `/settings`, `/settings/general`,  to be complete to make the later `back` operation possible, but a complete routing life cycle causes the corresponding component to be rendered thus the problem occurred.\r\n\r\nIf I can mute/turn off the `<router-view>`'s rendering before the automatic injection starts and then turn it on later when the injection ends the problem would be hopefully solved.\r\n\r\n### What does the proposed API look like?\r\n```\r\nrouter.mute()\r\nrouter.unmute()\r\n```\r\n\r\n<!-- generated by vue-issues.
