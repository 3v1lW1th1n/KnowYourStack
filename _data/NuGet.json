The first number aligns with the error level, so that C1xxx errors are all level 1 errors, C2xxx are all level 2, etc. IIRC, if they issue a warning or an error for the same issue, it has the same unique code, and just changes the initial bit from from “error” to “warning”.\r\n\r\n### Verbose Logs\r\n\r\nNot applicable\r\n\r\n### Sample Project\r\n\r\nNot applicable\r\n"},{"Id":"6597536869","Type":"IssuesEvent","CreatedAt":"2017-09-15T20:39:28","Actor":"AlexEyler","Repository":"NuGet/Home","Organization":"NuGet","RawContent":null,"RelatedAction":"opened","RelatedUrl":"https://github.com/NuGet/Home/issues/5899","RelatedDescription":"Opened issue \"NuGet packages referenced via PackageReference don't include DLLs in VSIX\" (#5899) at NuGet/Home","RelatedBody":"## Summary\r\n\r\nWhen building a VSIX that references NuGet packages, users used to be able to easily include the assembly included in the NuGet packages by setting <CopyLocal> to true on the reference.
