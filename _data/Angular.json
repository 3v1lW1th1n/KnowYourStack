But now, it seems the error is wrapped and you need to unwrap it to get the real error that's sitting on the \"rejection\" property of the error.\r\n\r\nThe docs make no mention of this here https://angular.io/api/core/ErrorHandler and neither does any googling surprisingly.\r\n\r\nI noticed this only after upgrading from angular 5 to angular 7 and one of my e2e tests that relied on my general error handler started failing.\r\n\r\nThe only workaround I found was to have something like this at the top of the error handler's handleError() method like this:\r\n\r\n```typescript\r\n    while(error.rejection) {\r\n      error = error.rejection;\r\n    }\r\n\r\n```\r\nbut...\r\n\r\n1. I'm quite sure there's a better way - now I have to type error as any\r\n2. I'm not sure if there are any other situations that will require unwrapping (e.g. from observables?).\r\n\r\nEither way, if this was some kind of intentional feature, it's definitely a gotcha that I think should be mentioned (with the RIGHT way to handle it) in the doc link I pasted.\r\n\r\n## üî¨ Minimal Reproduction\r\n<!--\r\nPlease create and share minimal reproduction of the issue starting with this template: https://stackblitz.com/fork/angular-issue-repro2\r\n-->\r\n<!-- ‚úçÔ∏è--> \r\n\r\n1. follow the docs and implement a global error handler and try to handle unhandled requests uniformly - something like this:\r\n\r\n```typescript\r\n@Injectable()\r\nexport class SpiffyErrorHandlerService implements ErrorHandler {\r\n  constructor(private injector: Injector, private snackBar: MatSnackBar) {}\r\n  public handleError(error: Error) {\r\n    if (error instanceof HttpErrorResponse) {\r\n      if (error.status === 401) {\r\n        this.snackBar.open(\r\n          'Oops.

However, some screen readers may access these focus traps without moving\r\nprogrammatic focus, leaving the SR user wondering why an empty control lives on the page.  Android\r\nTalkBack currently treats this as a stop with no announcement (because it has no content). Adding\r\nthe aria-hidden should prevent these from being accessed in SR contexts while preserving the core\r\nfunctionality of redirecting focus when it's moved linearly (e.g., with tab).\r\n\r\ncdk FocusTrap adds focus trap divs with tabindex=0 at the beginning and end of the trapped container to prevent focus from leaving when pressing tab or linearly navigating. When these elements are focused, a focus handler redirects the browser focus as to effectively cycle focus within an element. This works fine for e.g., OS X VoiceOver, which generally moves focus when navigating the page. However some screenreaders may routinely browse elements without moving focus. A notable example is TalkBack, which is one of Angular Material's supported environments https://github.com/angular/material2#browser-and-screen-reader-support. This is also true in some popular configurations of JAWS/NVDA.\r\n\r\nSettings these to have aria-hidden=true will typically cause for SRs to ignore these when linearly navigating the page, if they're not already ignored.\r\n\r\nI've tested a primitive version of this fix on TalkBack and it works well.\r\n\r\nhttps://stackblitz.com/edit/angular-e9gqbr?file=app%2Fdialog-content-example.ts\r\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SN1chzTfvTs\r\n\r\nI can imagine some rare edge cases where this could cause a regression in functionality. In cases where cdk FocusTrap is used but were relying on SRs to \"see\" the focus trap anchors and shift focus to them, so that the active focus handler would redirect focus, this may break things, and SRs may wrongly shift focus to a bad spot. However, doing it this way would have been extremely finicky in the first place. If you wanted SRs not to be able to escape the focus trap, you should have set aria-hidden on the rest of the page in the first place (MatDialog does this https://github.com/angular/material2/blob/d22f48c742c0bbdc971f79ea1261ec5c20d15a69/src/lib/dialog/dialog.ts#L345, and individual application code may wrap cdk Overlay to do this; it's a bit of a mystery to me why cdk Overlay or cdk FocusTrap doesn't do this itself, but that's a separate concern). Such a page would have been a pain for SRs in the first place since heading and landmark navigation, common SR navigation techniques, could easily have shifted focus to the underlying page anyway. These users should be encouraged to apply aria-hidden appropriately. That said, we have tested this on the following SRs on the latest versions and things appear to be no worse:\r\n\r\nAndroid TalkBack - my fix should address the hidden SR stop\r\nNVDA/JAWS with virtual cursor - similar fix, but virtual cursor configuration varies greatly among users; generally, the hidden tab stops aren't problematic\r\nOS X VO - always ignored the empty tabindex=0 anchors anyway\r\n\r\nInternal bug reference b/122041252.","Url":"https://github.com/angular/material2/pull/14644","RelatedDescription":"Open PR \"fix(focus-trap): apply aria-hidden to focus trap tab anchors\" (#14644)"},{"Id":"394180467","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2018-12-26T14:39:21","Actor":"crisbeto","Number":"14643","RawContent":null,"Title":"build: unable to render individual examples in demo app","State":"open","Body":"Seems like something that was broken by #14522 by accident.

Furthermore, I can see this being useful in `cdk/tree` and `cdk/table` as well.\r\n\r\nFixes #14635.\r\nFixes #14501.","Url":"https://github.com/angular/material2/pull/14639","RelatedDescription":"Open PR \"fix(scrolling): virtual list not updating when source array is mutated\" (#14639)"},{"Id":"394025957","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2018-12-25T14:23:51","Actor":"devversion","Number":"14638","RawContent":null,"Title":"build: remove obsolete publish snapshots check","State":"open","Body":"* Since we now have proper branch filters for all CircleCI jobs, the logic that determines whether the \"publish_snapshots\" job should run, can be removed safely.","Url":"https://github.com/angular/material2/pull/14638","RelatedDescription":"Open PR \"build: remove obsolete publish snapshots check\" (#14638)"},{"Id":"394025208","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2018-12-25T14:15:00","Actor":"crisbeto","Number":"14637","RawContent":null,"Title":"fix(list): add hover and focus indication in high contrast mode","State":"open","Body":"Fixes not being able to see which lists/list items are focused or hovered in high contrast mode.","Url":"https://github.com/angular/material2/pull/14637","RelatedDescription":"Open PR \"fix(list): add hover and focus indication in high contrast mode\" (#14637)"},{"Id":"394023600","IsPullRequest":false,"CreatedAt":"2018-12-25T13:56:46","Actor":"emreyalvac","Number":"14636","RawContent":null,"Title":"_theming.scss deprecation warnings","State":"open","Body":"Deprecation warnings when get build\r\n\r\n_theming.scss line 1404:\r\n\r\nfrom -> @return if($font-family == null, $font-family, unquote($font-family));\r\nto -> @return if($font-family == null, $font-family, $font-family);","Url":"https://github.com/angular/material2/issues/14636","RelatedDescription":"Open issue \"_theming.scss deprecation warnings\" (#14636)"},{"Id":"394023579","IsPullRequest":false,"CreatedAt":"2018-12-25T13:56:33","Actor":"Gil-Epshtain","Number":"14635","RawContent":null,"Title":"Scrolling SDK (virtual-scroll) - View isn't updated when list is updated (items added/removed)","State":"open","Body":"#### What is the expected behavior?\r\nIf a data-list that binded to `<cdk-virtual-scroll-viewport>`, is updated (items are added/ removed from this list), the `<cdk-virtual-scroll-viewport>` updated as well.\r\n\r\n#### What is the current behavior?\r\nChanging the list will not updated the view (`<cdk-virtual-scroll-viewport>`)\r\n\r\n#### What are the steps to reproduce?\r\nStackBlitz starter: https://stackblitz.com/edit/angular-hsr4tz?file=app%2Fcdk-virtual-scroll-overview-example.html<br/>\r\nIn this demo you can see that after adding items to the list, the view isn't updated.\r\n\r\n#### Which versions of Angular, Material, OS, TypeScript, browsers are affected?\r\nAngular 7.1.4\r\nMaterial 7.2.0\r\nBrowser: Chrome\r\n\r\n#### Is there anything else we should know?\r\nThe documentation doesn't discuss about adding/removing items from data-list.\r\nSee docs at: https://material.angular.io/cdk/scrolling/overview","Url":"https://github.com/angular/material2/issues/14635","RelatedDescription":"Open issue \"Scrolling SDK (virtual-scroll) - View isn't updated when list is updated (items added/removed)\" (#14635)"},{"Id":"394020406","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2018-12-25T13:23:23","Actor":"devversion","Number":"14634","RawContent":null,"Title":"build: publish docs-content bazel artifacts","State":"open","Body":"","Url":"https://github.com/angular/material2/pull/14634","RelatedDescription":"Open PR \"build: publish docs-content bazel artifacts\" (#14634)"},{"Id":"393992238","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2018-12-25T09:14:47","Actor":"crisbeto","Number":"14632","RawContent":null,"Title":"feat(tabs): add automatic scrolling when holding down paginator","State":"open","Body":"Adds some code that automatically keeps scrolling the tab header while holding down one of the paginator buttons.
