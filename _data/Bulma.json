Make the browser smaller than 1024px and note the tiling does not keep layout, it continues to change at certain breakpoints.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Expected behavior\r\n\r\nWhat I expected was that once smaller than 1024px the website would no longer change, but just get a scroll horizontal scroll bar.\r\n\r\nAgain, as I stated above, perhaps this is on purpose,but I just wanted to confirm. I'm not sure how else with Bulma one would create a min width that prevents the website from dynamically changing beyond a point.\r\n\r\nNOTE that the website does get a horizontal scroll bar (if you set `$body-overflow-x: scroll;`) and that other things don't change but the tiling seems to be relative to the viewport width and therefore continues to change.\r\n\r\n### Actual behavior\r\n\r\nRefer to step 3 of \"steps to reproduce\"\r\n\r\n### Sidenote\r\n\r\nHuge fan of Bulma, thank you so much for making this awesome framework, let me know if there is anything else you need me to explain about the issue and I will happily.\r\n","Url":"https://github.com/jgthms/bulma/issues/2528","RelatedDescription":"Open issue \"Min-width for tiling?\" (#2528)"},{"Id":"454714620","IsPullRequest":false,"CreatedAt":"2019-06-11T14:10:38","Actor":"georgfranz","Number":"2527","RawContent":null,"Title":"Responsive margin + paddings","State":"open","Body":"### Responsive margins + paddings\r\n\r\nI am sure that I am not the first one who needs a different margin and padding setting on tablet and on desktop devices etc.\r\n\r\nSo, it would be cool if you can do the following thing:\r\n\r\n`<section class=\"section is-marginless-vertical-mobile has-margin-vertical-tablet\"></section> `\r\n\r\nBy default, there are only these entries in the helper.sass:\r\n```\r\n.is-marginless\r\n  margin: 0 !important\r\n\r\n.is-paddingless\r\n  padding: 0 !important\r\n```\r\n\r\nI've extended this having such things like:\r\n\r\n```\r\nis-marginless-tablet\r\nis-paddingless-vertical\r\nhas-padding-horizontal\r\nhas-margin-vertical-desktop\r\n```\r\nIf you don't need all variations (there are a lot...), you can control this by two arrays.\r\n\r\nI attach the sass file and a sample output with all variations.\r\n\r\nIf this is also helpful for anybody else, I can do a pull request.\r\n\r\n[margin_sample.css.txt](https://github.com/jgthms/bulma/files/3276839/margin_sample.css.txt)\r\n\r\n[margin_responsive.sass.txt](https://github.com/jgthms/bulma/files/3276843/margin_responsive.sass.txt)\r\n\r\n\r\nBest wishes,\r\nGeorg.\r\n\r\n_PS: I luv Bulma!!!!_\r\n","Url":"https://github.com/jgthms/bulma/issues/2527","RelatedDescription":"Open issue \"Responsive margin + paddings\" (#2527)"},{"Id":"454253153","IsPullRequest":false,"CreatedAt":"2019-06-10T16:29:19","Actor":"ediopia","Number":"2526","RawContent":null,"Title":".has-dropdown background color makes a trouble in .hero ","State":"closed","Body":"<!-- PLEASE READ THE FOLLOWING INSTRUCTIONS -->\r\n\r\n<!-- Choose one of the following: -->\r\nThis is about **Bulma | the Docs**.\r\n\r\n<!-- Is it about Bulma or about the Docs? -->\r\n<!-- Is it a bug/feature/question or do you need help? -->\r\n<!-- If it's a bug, is it a browser bug? -->\r\n\r\n### Overview of the problem\r\n.has-dropdown background color makes a trouble in .hero \r\n<!-- UNCOMMENT THE APPROPRIATE LINES -->\r\n\r\n<!-- This is about the Bulma **CSS framework** -->\r\n<!-- This is about the Bulma **Docs** -->\r\n<!-- I'm using Bulma **version** [x.x.x] -->\r\n<!-- My **browser** is: -->\r\n<!-- This is a **Sass** issue: I'm using version [x.x.x] -->\r\n<!-- I am sure this issue is **not a duplicate**? -->\r\n\r\n### Description\r\n\r\n<!-- Description of the bug, enhancement, or question -->\r\n\r\n### Steps to Reproduce\r\n\r\n<!--\r\n1.

This is my first time opening a pull request in Bulma! 👋🏻 The .is-title-adjacent helper adds the ability to arbitrarily move any element which is below a title or a subtitle closer to that title or subtitle, in the same way that a subtitle automatically moves closer to a title.\r\n\r\n### Proposed solution\r\n\r\n<!-- Which specific problem does this PR solve and how?  -->\r\n<!-- If it fixes a particular Issue, add \"Fixes #ISSUE_NUMBER\" in your title -->\r\nSome websites like to have things like bylines, post datetimes, or other things kept close to the post title area. This helper makes it easier to do this in Bulma without writing custom code.\r\n\r\nIt fixes Issue #2346, which I filed in February.\r\n\r\n### Tradeoffs\r\n\r\nThe way this is written, it shouldn't impact those who have already written custom code to do this same thing, so that's thankfully *not* a tradeoff here. I don't see any reason why it adds any significant tradeoffs, though, of course, for more specific use cases, some users will continue to create their own custom classes.\r\n<!-- What are the drawbacks of this solution?
