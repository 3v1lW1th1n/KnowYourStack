I apologise for not turning to StackOverflow, but I find the site to be elitist and unapproachable unless you have a perfect textbook question.\r\n\r\n\r\n**Description**\r\n\r\nI have recently migrated a WPF project from Visual Studio 2015 to 2017.  I did this manually (i.e. I created a new empty WPF project and re-added all files manually).  Now I have done this, OpenXml seems to deploy **loads** more assemblies into my project output directory.\r\n\r\n**Observed**\r\n\r\nI no longer have Visual Studio 2015 installed and am reluctant to try to put it back alongside 2017, but, checking my project history, I can see that OpenXml did not add these extra assemblies in 2015.\r\n\r\n**Expected**\r\n\r\nI would expect the behaviour to be the same under Visual Studio 2017.  These extra assemblies double the size of the binary transfer I have to do to deploy the code to the client's network.\r\n\r\nIs there any way I can stop OpenXml adding these extra assemblies to my binary output directory?\r\n\r\n\r\n![extra assemblies](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/13526323/36784118-2b4e93bc-1c76-11e8-9363-911f32d6386f.png)\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"},{"Id":"7290568686","Type":"PullRequestEvent","CreatedAt":"2018-02-24T03:20:20","Actor":"twsouthwick","Repository":"OfficeDev/Open-XML-SDK","Organization":"OfficeDev","RawContent":null,"RelatedAction":"opened","RelatedUrl":"https://github.com/OfficeDev/Open-XML-SDK/pull/411","RelatedDescription":"Opened pull request \"Update schema availability attributes\" (#411) at OfficeDev/Open-XML-SDK","RelatedBody":"Some of the availability is incorrect in the repo and the source schemas have it different.
