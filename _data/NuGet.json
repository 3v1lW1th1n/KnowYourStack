Therefore, I had to split `IPackageFileService` into two, introducing a new `ICorePackageFileService`. Ideally I would have moved the whole service down to `NuGetGallery.Core` but there were some web service specific methods on `IPackageFileService` that don't make sense for orchestrator (e.g. `CreateDownloadPackageActionResultAsync` which requires an MVC dependency).\r\n\r\n`IFileStorageService` has some constants which relate to all sorts of container names and content types not specific to the `packages` container. Instead of splitting these methods in half, I chose to just push the entire methods and their associated constants down to `NuGetGallery.Core` instead of having to do `override` in `NuGetGallery`. I think this is the right move since it is simpler and more likely than not we'll have to push more into `NuGetGallery.Core` as time goes on.\r\n\r\nBy extension, `IFileStorageService` also had to be split up because it also has an MVC-dependent method, thus introducing `ICoreFileStorageService`.\r\n\r\nFinally, I split the test classes up so that implementations now in `NuGetGallery.Core` are tested by `NuGetGallery.Core.Facts`.\r\n\r\nIn general I like this pattern since we have less and less logic in our web app and more and more logic in a project which is agnostic of entry point and is abstracted away from view concerns (like .cshtml or HTTP redirects)."},{"Id":"6646818712","Type":"PullRequestEvent","CreatedAt":"2017-09-27T23:53:22","Actor":"chenriksson","Repository":"NuGet/NuGetGallery","Organization":"NuGet","RawContent":null,"RelatedAction":"opened","RelatedUrl":"https://github.com/NuGet/NuGetGallery/pull/4763","RelatedDescription":"Opened pull request \"Log user safe exceptions\" (#4763) at NuGet/NuGetGallery","RelatedBody":"Fix for: https://github.com/NuGet/Engineering/issues/809"},{"Id":"6646387435","Type":"IssuesEvent","CreatedAt":"2017-09-27T21:37:20","Actor":"skofman1","Repository":"NuGet/NuGetGallery","Organization":"NuGet","RawContent":null,"RelatedAction":"opened","RelatedUrl":"https://github.com/NuGet/NuGetGallery/issues/4762","RelatedDescription":"Opened issue \"Enable default security policies\" (#4762) at NuGet/NuGetGallery","RelatedBody":""},{"Id":"6646320379","Type":"PullRequestEvent","CreatedAt":"2017-09-27T21:20:18","Actor":"skofman1","Repository":"NuGet/NuGetGallery","Organization":"NuGet","RawContent":null,"RelatedAction":"merged","RelatedUrl":"https://github.com/NuGet/NuGetGallery/pull/4758","RelatedDescription":"Merged pull request \"Add support for default security policy\" (#4758) at NuGet/NuGetGallery","RelatedBody":"Applied to all users.
