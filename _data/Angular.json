Having the workspace information stored in `angular.json` is a misnomer as it is possible to have non-Angular projects and builders defined there. \r\n\r\n## Describe the solution you'd like\r\n\r\nWith the new Workspace API, storage of the workspace configuration is abstracted. It would be great to support a more agnostic config file such as `workspace.json` or `projects.json`. \r\n\r\nCurrently, folks can already build node apps or web-components apps in an Angular CLI workspace, but the naming of the configuration file deters folks from doing it.\r\n\r\nOne of the best things about the Angular community is how well we collaborate with other communities. Having the CLI to be more generic and used in those communities will reinforce this.\r\n\r\nThe `angular.json` file could be supported for backward compatibility. This would improve the experience for doing things outside of Angular within a workspace.\r\n\r\n## Describe alternatives you've considered\r\n\r\nAn alternative could be creating a separate CLI altogether such as the NestJS CLI but it would be great to have 1 agnostic CLI since the Angular CLI is capable of doing both.","Url":"https://github.com/angular/angular-cli/issues/14204","RelatedDescription":"Open issue \"feat: Rename angular.json to workspace.json\" (#14204)"},{"Id":"434217288","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2019-04-17T10:50:16","Actor":"gkalpak","Number":"14202","RawContent":null,"Title":"docs(@schematics/angular): fix typo in web worker schematics (\"service worker\" --> \"web worker\")","State":"open","Body":"☝️ ","Url":"https://github.com/angular/angular-cli/pull/14202","RelatedDescription":"Open PR \"docs(@schematics/angular): fix typo in web worker schematics (\"service worker\" --> \"web worker\")\" (#14202)"},{"Id":"434154672","IsPullRequest":false,"CreatedAt":"2019-04-17T08:25:34","Actor":"DmitriyIvanko","Number":"14200","RawContent":null,"Title":"Simple bug: Can't resolve '\\app-test\\src\\styles.sass' in '\\app-test'","State":"open","Body":"<!--🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅\r\n\r\nOh hi there! 😄\r\n\r\nTo expedite issue processing please search open and closed issues before submitting a new one.\r\nExisting issues often contain information about workarounds, resolution, or progress updates.\r\n\r\n🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅-->\r\n\r\n\r\n# 🐞 Bug report\r\n\r\n### Command (mark with an `x`)\r\n<!-- Can you pin-point the command or commands that are effected by this bug? -->\r\n<!-- ✍️edit: -->\r\n```\r\n- [ x ] new\r\n```\r\n\r\n### Description\r\n\r\n<!-- ✍️--> \r\nWhen creating a new project, select the option \"Sass [http://sass-lang.com]\".
