And based on the data, it can call let's say different components. \r\n\r\n```\r\nComponent A // takes 2 props. (propA,propB)\r\nComponent B // takes 3 props (propA,propB,propC)\r\nComponent C // takes 1 prop (propD)\r\n```\r\n\r\nIn my parent component, \r\n\r\nI would call \r\n\r\n```\r\n\r\n// SomeParentComponent.vue that accepts \"items (array)\" as props\r\n\r\n<template>\r\n    <div>\r\n       <div v-for=\"item in items\">\r\n            <div v-render-component=\"item.componentName\" v-component-props=\"item.props\" /> // item.props = { propA: value, propB: value ... }\r\n       </div> // props are being passed down, sort of like vue router's params and query props.\r\n    <div>\r\n</template>\r\n```\r\n\r\nSuppose we have 3 different Card Components with unique and some similar functionalities. We are rendering a single item and based on the condition we are calling the component. \r\n\r\nBut with the current API, we might need to do something like \r\n\r\n```\r\n... \r\n// inside the loop\r\n<div v-if=\"item.componentName ==== 'ComponentA'\" />\r\n    <ComponentA :propA=\"item.propA\" ... />\r\n</div>\r\n\r\n<div v-if=\"item.componentName ==== 'ComponentB'\" />\r\n    <ComponentB :propA=\"item.propA\" ... />\r\n</div>\r\n\r\n<div v-if=\"item.componentName ==== 'ComponentC'\" />\r\n    <ComponentC :propA=\"item.propA\" ... />\r\n</div>\r\n...\r\n```\r\n\r\nAlso, in the SomeParentComponent, there is no way to call on different components for another purpose. If we think of maybe a table, the data is different but we would be able to use the same component (SomeParentComponent) etc. \r\nExample\r\n```\r\n//Users.vue \r\n\r\n<SomeParentComponent :items=\"users\" />\r\n\r\n// Orders.vue\r\n\r\n<SomeParentComponent :items=\"orders\" />\r\n```\r\n\r\nThis way, not only the template portion remains the same but also the logical portion of a component. Thus, letting us comprehend the idea of 'component', a component handles a responsibility.\r\n\r\nWe can have vue directives for \"v-render-component\" and \"v-component-props\" and obviously these are pseudo names.\r\n\r\n<!-- generated by vue-issues.

Today, this means each component has a style section with base css as well as media queries.  Though this functionality is not broken, it is error prone and can cause subtle consistency issues unless development teams actively work to set up strong foundations.  So the current state of media queries in Vue is more of a hill of failure than a pit of success.\r\n\r\nThe existence of packages like `vue-mq` demonstrate that there is demand for improving this situation, and while those kinds of packages can already help, it would be cleaner and more consistent to build this into Vue itself.  Vue is presentation layer software, and this is a reasonably global presentation layer concern.\r\n\r\nThe proposed feature would make working with media queries easier, less error-prone, and more consistent.\r\n\r\n### What does the proposed API look like?\r\n## Usage\r\n\r\n```html\r\n<style size=\"base\">\r\n/**\r\n * `base` is an optional label for readability - anything that lacks a size\r\n * descriptor would automatically be base\r\n */\r\n...\r\n</style>\r\n\r\n<style size=\"xs\">\r\n...\r\n</style>\r\n\r\n<style size=\"sm\">\r\n...\r\n</style>\r\n\r\n<style size=\"md\">\r\n...\r\n</style>\r\n\r\n<style size=\"lg\">\r\n...\r\n</style>\r\n\r\n<style size=\"xl\">\r\n...\r\n</style>\r\n```\r\n\r\nThis allows developers to separate code by size without media queries, in a\r\nclean and consistent fashion.\r\n\r\n## Configuration\r\n\r\nThere should be reasonable defaults, with the ability to override via config.\r\nFor example, the default configuration could be based on bootstrap's well-known\r\nlabelled screen sizes.\r\n\r\nOverriding the configuration via `vue.config.js` might look like:\r\n\r\n```js\r\nmodule.exports = {\r\n  ...\r\n  styleSizes: [\r\n    { name: 'base', type: 'base' },\r\n    { name: 'xs', maxWidth: 575 },\r\n    { name: 'sm', minWidth: 576, maxWidth: 767 },\r\n    { name: 'md', minWidth: 768, maxWidth: 991 },\r\n    { name: 'lg', minWidth: 992, maxWidth: 1199 },\r\n    { name: 'xl', minWidth: 1200 },\r\n  },\r\n  ...\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nAlthough it would be completely configurable to use whatever labels and size\r\ncutoffs desired:\r\n\r\n```js\r\nmodule.exports = {\r\n  ...\r\n  styleSizes: [\r\n    { name: 'extra-small', type: 'base' },\r\n    { name: 'small', minWidth: 576, maxWidth: 767 },\r\n    { name: 'large', minWidth: 992, maxWidth: 1199 },\r\n    { name: 'extra-large', minWidth: 1200, maxWidth: 3839 },\r\n    { name: 'ginormous', minWidth: 3840 },\r\n  },\r\n  ...\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\n## Functionality\r\n\r\nWhen size attributes are assigned to a style, it should be transformed into a media query within a style tag with the same attributes as the original tag, except without the size attribute.\r\n\r\n### Example\r\n\r\nSo this:\r\n\r\n```html\r\n<style scoped size=\"md\">\r\n.generic-item {\r\n  ...\r\n}\r\n</style>\r\n```\r\n\r\nMight be transformed into this:\r\n\r\n```html\r\n<style scoped>\r\n@media only screen and (max-width: 768px) and (max-width: 991px) {\r\n  .generic-item {\r\n    ...\r\n  }\r\n}\r\n</style>\r\n```\r\n\r\n### Combining styles of same type\r\n\r\nI'm not sure how the internals work, but it might be preferable to combine different style sizes into a single style of the same type (so `scoped` or no `scoped`).\r\n\r\nSo this:\r\n\r\n```html\r\n<style scoped>\r\n.generic-item {\r\n  ...\r\n}\r\n</style>\r\n\r\n<style scoped size=\"md\">\r\n.generic-item {\r\n  ...\r\n}\r\n</style>\r\n```\r\n\r\nMight be transformed into this:\r\n\r\n```html\r\n<style scoped>\r\n.generic-item {\r\n  ...\r\n}\r\n\r\n@media only screen and (max-width: 768px) and (max-width: 991px) {\r\n  .generic-item {\r\n    ...\r\n  }\r\n}\r\n</style>\r\n```\r\n\r\n<!-- generated by vue-issues.

Importing router instance (similar to store import suggestion [here](https://github.com/vuejs/vue-router/issues/2118#issuecomment-484037415)) is not an option for us because we have shared set of router components, which are re-used in different vue applications, so there is no single place to import it from.\r\n\r\n### Use case\r\n\r\nI'm trying to create generic plugin for our applications which will define hook to pre-load data. In some component data pre-load will happen via vuex store, so it should be accessible in this hook.\r\n\r\nHere is simplified code for the plugin:\r\n```js\r\nexport default function install(Vue) {\r\n  Vue.mixin({\r\n    async beforeRouterEnter(to, from, next) {\r\n      if (componentOptions.preloadData) {\r\n        try {\r\n          const nextCallback = componentOptions.preloadData.call(null, router.app.$store);\r\n          next(nextCallback);\r\n        } catch (error) {\r\n          // Custom error for a generic error handler\r\n          next(new DataPreloadError(error));\r\n        }\r\n      } else {\r\n        next();\r\n      }\r\n    },\r\n  });\r\n};\r\n```\r\n\r\nThis plugin will make it possible to define custom `preloadData() { ... }` component option for a generic data pre-load as part of routing process. The only missing  references to make it work are `componentOptions` and `router`.\r\n\r\nNote that it is possible to provide `router` access in this particular example by passing it as plugin argument – `export default function install(Vue, router) { ... }`. However, it might be still beneficial to have access to router in the `beforeRouteEnter` guard, as it will be a solution for #3157.\r\n\r\n### What does the proposed API look like?\r\nProposal is to add additional `guardContext` argument to the guard function:\r\n```js\r\nbeforeRouteEnter(to, from, next, context) {\r\n // where context is { router: ..., componentOptions: ... }\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nHowever if it should be implemented in different way – would be great to hear it.\r\n\r\n<!-- generated by vue-issues.

Also there is optional `onComplete` callback for `router.push`, but there is no way to set it from `<router-link>`.\r\nNavigation with error (because of JS error in one of the guards or hooks) can be catched in global `onError` hook. Also there is optional `onAbort` callback for `router.push` (which will be called for both navigation with error and aborted navigation), but there is no way to set it from `<router-link>`.\r\nWhen it comes to aborted navigations, the only place where it can be catched – `onAbort` callback for `router.push`. However, as mentioned before, it is not possible to set it from `<router-link>`. Moreover, there is no global hook to catch aborted navigations at all.\r\n\r\n### Use case\r\n\r\nIn our application we would like to simply display loading indicator in the root App component while navigation is in progress. Also, we would like to have this functionality be generic, so it can be applied to different applications. The easiest way to achieve it is by creating separate ES module like this `navigation-state-plugin.js`:\r\n``` js\r\nimport Vue from 'vue';\r\n\r\nexport const state = Vue.observable({ navigating: false });\r\n\r\nexport default router => {\r\n  // When navigation initiated – update state and proceed\r\n  router.beforeEach((to, from, next) {\r\n    state.navigating = true;\r\n    next();\r\n  });\r\n\r\n  // When navigation successfully finished – update state accordingly\r\n  router.afterEach(() => {\r\n    state.navigating = false;\r\n  });\r\n\r\n  // When navigation failed –also update state\r\n  router.onError(error => {\r\n    state.navigating = false;\r\n  });\r\n};\r\n```\r\n\r\nIn this way in can be applied in the `main.js`:\r\n```js\r\nimport VueRouter from 'vue-router';\r\nimport applyPlugin from './navigation-state-plugin.js`;\r\n\r\n// do other initializations\r\n\r\nconst router = new VueRouter(...);\r\napplyPlugin(router);\r\n\r\n// init application\r\n```\r\n\r\nAlso state from this file can be imported in App.vue and used to display loading indicator when `state.navigating` is `true`.\r\n\r\nHowever, when navigation is aborted there is no way to track it in a global manner, which leads to loading indicator to stay visible on a screen.\r\n\r\nAs possible solution, [it was suggested](https://github.com/vuejs/vue-router/issues/3027#issuecomment-599474646) to _\"use `router.push` or the v-slot api and get the promise returned from `navigate`\"_ (which is currently not available because #3042 has no PR). However this solution would require to create wrappers around vue-router API, which should always be used throughout entire application instead of native `vue-router` api. Even though it is easy to do for `router.push`, it is cumbersome to do for `<router-link>` because wrapper should be able to support the same rendering scenarios (without slot content, with slot content, with scoped slot content, etc.)\r\nIt is also not suitable for us, because we have shared set of router components, which are re-used in different vue applications. And not all applications will have `navigation-state-plugin.js`. So we need to have possibility to use native `router.push` and `<router-link>` with an option to globally manage navigation state.\r\n\r\n### What does the proposed API look like?\r\nMost obvious would be to introduce global `onAbort` hook:\r\n```js\r\n  router.onAbort(function callback(abortedRoute, reason) { ... });\r\n```\r\nwhere `reason` can be one of the errors from #3047\r\n\r\nIt may be possible to call existing `onError` or `afterEach` hooks also for aborted navigations, but that would be a breaking change, and probably would make API more confusing.\r\n\r\n<!-- generated by vue-issues.

The check in push state wheter push state can be used, checks for `window.history && 'pushState' in window.history`, but office.js resets the fields on window.history, not window.history itself (see https://stackoverflow.com/a/42703406/).

It is impossible to clean up its popstate listener.\r\n\r\n#### Basepath bug\r\n\r\nIf you have multiple vue applications, each using vue-router, they must all share the same base path, even if you ensure only one of them is active at a time by destroying / remounting when navigating between them. Otherwise they will all attempt to ensure that every route starts with their base path.\r\n\r\nSame goes for if you have one vue-router and one react-router. The vue-router will force all urls to start with its base path within the react-owned pages, even if you have destroyed the vue application before navigating to the react application.\r\n\r\n### What is expected?\r\nI think the best solution is to call `window.addEventListener('popstate', handler)` when `const intance = new Vue({router})` is called, instead of when `new VueRouter()` is called. And then call `window.removeEventListener('popstate', handler)` when `instance.$destroy()` is called.\r\n\r\nAlternatively, it could be cleaned up like so:\r\n\r\n```js\r\n// Alternative solution (not my preferred one, but works)\r\n\r\nconst router = new VueRouter({...})\r\n// later, to clean up event listeners:\r\nrouter.detach()\r\n// later, to reattach event listeners\r\nrouter.attach()\r\n```\r\n\r\n### What is actually happening?\r\nwindow.addEventListener is called during `new VueRouter()`, and there is no way to ever remove that event listener.\r\n\r\n---\r\nSee related https://github.com/single-spa/single-spa/issues/488.

commits/actions stream","State":"closed","Body":"### What problem does this feature solve?\r\nAdd a \"mapping\" layer from the mutations/actions stream to the components that want to subscribe to them. \r\n\r\nSimilarly to the existing `mapActions` or `mapGetters` functions which decouple the Vuex store from the components using it, a new pair of functions could exist to allow the components get subscribed to the dispatched actions or committed mutations in a way such that direct usage of the store is not necessary.\r\n\r\n### What does the proposed API look like?\r\nIn the components, instead of directly accessing `$store` to subscribe to the actions stream:\r\n\r\n```js\r\ncreated() {\r\n  this.unsubscribe = this.$store.subscribeAction((action, state) => {\r\n    if (action.type === 'MY_ACTION_TYPE') { ... }\r\n  })\r\n},\r\n\r\ndestroyed() {\r\n  this.unsubscribe()\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nWe'd have something like:\r\n\r\n```js\r\ncreated() {\r\n  this.unsubscribe = subscribeAction('MY_ACTION_TYPE', (payload, state) => { ... })\r\n},\r\n\r\ndestroyed() {\r\n  this.unsubscribe()\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nThis function would not only decouple the usage of the store from the components, but also provide a filter to only respond to the given action type. Note that, since subscribing to actions is not a widespread idiom with Vuex, we could go without a plural version, such as `subscribeActions`.\r\n\r\nA similar function, `subscribeMutation` could do the same for mutations.\r\n\r\n<!-- generated by vue-issues.

The \"parent\" modules holds state for some supported features on the application and its children require to check those features in order to validate their `actions`. The root state (or parent of the parent, in this case) simply holds environment and version information.\r\n\r\n### What does the proposed API look like?\r\nI belive that a new interface `ModuleTree<S,R>` might solve the issue:\r\n\r\n```ts\r\nexport interface ModuleTree<S, R> {\r\n  [key: string]: Module<S, R>;\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nWhich could be added to the Current `Module<S, R>` interface as an `or`:\r\n\r\n```ts\r\nexport interface Module<S, R> {\r\n  namespaced?: boolean;\r\n  state?: S | (() => S);\r\n  getters?: GetterTree<S, R>;\r\n  actions?: ActionTree<S, R>;\r\n  mutations?: MutationTree<S>;\r\n  modules?: ModuleTree<R> | ModuleTree<S, R>;\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\n<!-- generated by vue-issues.
