But there is no suitable place to get the dom snapshots. Of course, I can use the hook `beforeUpdate`, but there are some problems for it. Because the flip context should cache the state for all its related doms' snapshots (the dom may be a portal, which isn't the descendant of the flip context), and currently the schedule strategy for updating watchers may make the snapshot not reliable.\r\n\r\nFor example, the flip context includes componentA and componentB, and componentB is neighbor of componentA. When componentA and componentB both need to update, the scheduler will update componentA's watcher, and then componentB's.\r\nIn componentA's `beforeUpdate` hook, we cache its dom's snapshot, then updating its view, .e.g, its height. Then in componentB's `beforeUpdate` hook, we cache a WRONG snapshot, because a layout reflow will be triggered by previous componentA's update, affecting componentB's bounding rect (and here an unnecessary layout reflow is triggered).\r\n\r\nTo handle this case, we can do something like React, which updates watchers without updating dom, but collects their side effects (dom updates), and until the all states are stable. Then trigger watchers' some api like `getSnapshotBeforeUpdate()`, and finally flush all side effects.\r\n\r\n\r\n### What does the proposed API look like?\r\n`getSnapshotBeforeUpdate()`, triggered after all watchers' updated, and before flushing all side effects (dom updates).\r\n\r\n<!-- generated by vue-issues.

This allows us to utilize the full power of Vue while not forcing  a refactor upon our entire backend to use API's when we want to upgrade Vue to v2 (even though they ideally should).\r\n\r\nFor Vue 1.28 there is a specific csp branch which utilises notevil. I want to do the same for Vue 2.6.\r\nI will try to provide a working fork, although I could use some help on this (it's my first time working with the vue source code)\r\n\r\n### What does the proposed API look like?\r\n1 branch, v2.6.x-csp, will be made where ```new Function()``` will be replaced by ```notevil.Function()``` to safely eval expressions.\r\nJust like v1.28-csp, notevil will be included in the codebase.\r\n\r\nCurrently I have found ```new Function()``` in src/compiler/to-function.js:15 38 and src/compiler/no-error.js:86 95 which have to be refactored to ```notevil.Function()``` calls.\r\n\r\n<!-- generated by vue-issues.

Plugins _alter_ an existing store / module, modules provide some completed state based functionality. \r\n\r\nTherefore it can often be the case where a reusable and freely distributed module is desirable (e.g. to include in multiple projects or multiple component libraries). \r\n\r\nAt the moment Vuex's documentation strikes a surprising balance of brevity and coverage (although in my opinion plugins could use some more expansion). However, the mention of how to make and distribute vuex modules is completely absent. \r\n\r\nSince Vue and the Vue ecosystem has lowered the barrier to entry to web development, not using Vue has complete coverage of the nuances of JavaScript and the many core libraries that help it work on the web (e.g. Babel)\r\n\r\nThus it would be relevant and beneficial to provide a complete example (even if it is minimal) of how to make a truly reusable module.\r\n\r\n\r\n### What does the proposed API look like?\r\nI would consider something simplistic (e.g. the counter app). However, I would suggest 2  modifications:\r\n\r\n1. an async / await version (as this can cause trouble with bundling)\r\n2. a typescript variant\r\n\r\n```js\r\n// reusable module\r\n\r\nconst state = () => ({\r\n  count: 0,\r\n  delay: 500\r\n})\r\n\r\nconst getters = {\r\n\r\n}\r\n\r\nconst actions = {\r\n  async updateCount({state, commit}, byHowMuch) {\r\n    let newCount = await setTimeout( () => state.count   byHowMuch, state.delay)\r\n    commit('setCount', newCount)\r\n  }\r\n}\r\n\r\nconst mutations = {\r\n  setCount(state, amount) {\r\n    state.count = amount\r\n  }\r\n}\r\n\r\n\r\nexport {namespaced:true, state, mutations, actions, getters}\r\n```\r\n\r\n\r\nthen provide the configuration file for how to use rollup and deploy to npm / yarn \r\n\r\n\r\nthen provide how to incorporate with nuxt\r\n\r\n\r\n```\r\n// <nuxt-project>/store/AsyncCountModule/index.js\r\nimport AsyncCountModule from 'AsyncCountModule'\r\n\r\nexport AsyncCountModule //<-- this doesnt work \r\n```\r\n\r\n<!-- generated by vue-issues.
