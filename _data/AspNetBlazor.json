Maybe there is a simpler solution.\r\n\r\n~~It works, but I'm not sure if this is a good general solution to the problem.~~ And the problem is that I want to call potentially slow `Blazor.platform.findMethod` only once and store the result in some variable. My first attempt was to call `Blazor.platform.findMethod` in `load` event handler, but it is to early - Blazor is not initialized yet. ~~The above code works because when the first resize event is generated Blazor is already initialized.~~ To solve the problem elegantly we need something like `blazorInitialized` event. Is it available?\r\n\r\n***Update:*** The above code works only if I have the application loaded and then press F5 to refresh the page. It does not work if I open the fresh instance of the browser and then try to load the application for the first time. I get this in console:\r\n```\r\nMonoPlatform.ts:134\r\nUncaught TypeError: assembly_load is not a function\r\n    at findAssembly (MonoPlatform.ts:134)\r\n    at findType (MonoPlatform.ts:147)\r\n    at Object.findMethod (MonoPlatform.ts:160)\r\n    at onResize ((index):40)\r\n```\r\n***Update 2:*** I have just learned that after page refresh `onResizeMethod` variable preserves its value. My current version of JavaScript code is presented below. I still don't like it.\r\n```JS\r\n<script>\r\n        (function () {\r\n            // initialize to be sure that we call Blazor.platform.findMethod after page refresh\r\n            let onResizeMethod = undefined;\r\n            const assemblyName = 'Js';\r\n            const namespace = 'Js';\r\n            const typeName = 'Browser';\r\n            const methodName = 'OnWindowResize';\r\n\r\n            function onResize(event) {\r\n                if (onResizeMethod === undefined) {\r\n                    try {\r\n                        onResizeMethod = Blazor.platform.findMethod(\r\n                            assemblyName,\r\n                            namespace,\r\n                            typeName,\r\n                            methodName\r\n                        );\r\n                    } catch (e) {\r\n                        // catch known exception and ignore, rethrow otherwise\r\n                        if (e.name !== 'TypeError' || e.message !== 'assembly_load is not a function')\r\n                            throw(e);\r\n                    }\r\n                }\r\n                if (onResizeMethod !== undefined) {\r\n                    Blazor.platform.callMethod(onResizeMethod, null, []);\r\n                }\r\n            }\r\n            window.addEventListener('resize', onResize);\r\n        })();\r\n    </script>\r\n```","Url":"https://github.com/aspnet/Blazor/issues/907","RelatedDescription":"Closed issue \"When can we safely call Blazor.platform.findMethod?\" (#907)"},{"Id":"328621784","IsPullRequest":false,"CreatedAt":"2018-06-04T10:06:05","Actor":"InnovationGB","Number":"914","RawContent":null,"Title":"Javascript interop/not linking as I would expect","State":"closed","Body":"I understand that I may be doing this wrong, but with the knowledge I have this is confusing and I am hoping someone can clear this up for me, as I am trying to understand how I can link javascript files that are already functioning with my app components. \r\nhttps://github.com/InnovationGB/BlazorRainEffect\r\nThis isn't anything I made but rather a project from 2015 utilizing webgl in order to give a rainy effect.

This is the future of Web development. Blazor WILL attract a lot of people into .Net and MST space.\r\nSo, PLEASE MAKE IT HAPPEN!!!\r\n\r\nAlso, please build native Signalr Core client interface into Blazor so we can build Real-Time apps. The Shared project makes it super easy to share our server and client share same classes. \r\n\r\nOnce it's baked a bit more, I'll be diving in seriously.\r\nThank you team for such great product.\r\n..Ben\r\n","Url":"https://github.com/aspnet/Blazor/issues/901","RelatedDescription":"Closed issue \"Feedback - Make Blazor happen\" (#901)"},{"Id":"328451954","IsPullRequest":false,"CreatedAt":"2018-06-01T13:02:13","Actor":"Worble","Number":"911","RawContent":null,"Title":"Having trouble understanding BL9980: \"Expressions like 'Title' inside of a tag must be part of an attribute.\"","State":"closed","Body":"I'm having a little trouble understanding the error here.\r\n\r\nThe error being raised is specifically to do with:\r\n`<div class=\"divider text-center\" data-content=\"@Title\"></div>`\r\n\r\nThe full error is:\r\n`BL9980 Expressions like 'Title' inside of a tag must be part of an attribute. Previous releases of Blazor supported constructs like '@onclick(...)' or '@bind(...)'.These features have been changed to use attribute syntax. Use 'onclick=\"@...\"' or 'bind=\"...\" respectively.`\r\n\r\nThe full code is:\r\n```\r\n<div class=\"divider text-center\" data-content=\"@Title\"></div>\r\n<div class=\"columns\">\r\n    <div class=\"column form-group\">\r\n        <textarea class=\"form-input\" bind-value-onchange=\"Text\"></textarea>\r\n    </div>\r\n</div>\r\n<br />\r\n<div class=\"columns\">\r\n    <div class=\"column\">\r\n        <button class=\"btn float-right\" disabled=@ButtonDisabled onclick=@OnClick>Submit</button>\r\n    </div>\r\n</div>\r\n<div class=\"column col-12 divider\"></div>\r\n\r\n@functions {\r\n    [Parameter]\r\n    View ViewType { get; set; }\r\n\r\n    bool ButtonDisabled { get; set; } = false;\r\n\r\n    string Title => (ViewType == View.Thread ? \"New Thread\" : \"New Post\");\r\n\r\n    string Text { get; set; }\r\n\r\n    public async void OnClick()\r\n    {\r\n           --Removed for verbosities sake--\r\n    }\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nFrom what I can tell, its saying that the blazor code should be specifically inside a html attribute, not just inside the tag, but it looks like it already is? I've also tried directly putting the logic in the attribute:\r\n`<div class=\"divider text-center\" data-content=\"@(ViewType == View.Thread ? \"New Thread\" : \"New Post\")\"></div>`\r\n as well as several variations with and without quotes.
