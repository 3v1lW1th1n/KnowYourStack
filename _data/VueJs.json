For example:\r\n\r\n```html\r\n<router-link to=\"/documents\">Documents</router-link>\r\n```\r\nand\r\n```ts\r\nthis.$router.push(\"/documents\");\r\n```\r\n\r\nInline constants like these are subject to rot over time, human error when refactoring multiple documents and other similar errors. As an application grows in size, these issues become more prominent.\r\n\r\n### What does the proposed API look like?\r\nAs a solution, our shop often uses a mapping from route name to a route definition. Sample implementation:\r\n\r\n```ts\r\ninterface IRouteMap {\r\n  [key: string]: ReturnType<Router['resolve']> & { name: string };\r\n}\r\n\r\nfunction mapRoutes(routeMap: IRouteMap, routes: RouteConfig[] = []) {\r\n  return routes.reduce((map, route) => {\r\n    const name = route.name;\r\n    if (name) {\r\n      map[name] = Object.assign({\r\n        name,\r\n      }, router.resolve(name));\r\n    }\r\n    if (route.children) {\r\n      mapRoutes(map, route.children);\r\n    }\r\n    return map;\r\n  }, routeMap);\r\n}\r\n\r\nexport const routeMap = mapRoutes({}, routes);\r\n```\r\n\r\nLinks and navigation can then simply use the resulting mapping:\r\n\r\n```html\r\n<router-link v-bind:to=\"routeMap.documents.location\">Documents</router-link>\r\n```\r\nand\r\n```ts\r\nthis.$router.push(routeMap.documents.location);\r\n```\r\nor\r\n```ts\r\nrouter.beforeEach((to, from, next) => {\r\n  if (to.name !== routeMap.login.name && !store.state.user) ...\r\n});\r\n```\r\n\r\nThis means that changing a route's path requires a single change in the route definition itself and no further refactoring is necessary. Route names are internal and aren't subject to change over time as route paths often can be.\r\n\r\nAdding a similar mapping (or exposing existing internals) to vue-router's public API would provide a standardized solution to the given problem and allow all vue-router consumers to reap the benefits.\r\n\r\n<!-- generated by vue-issues.
