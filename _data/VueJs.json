This platform will be deployed on kubernetes. In order to make this platform extensible we would like to implement micro frondend (https://micro-frontends.org/) like architecture. This means people (within or outside our organization) who want to extend our platform should be able to build extensions where each of these extensions will be deployed in separate k8s namespaces. Each namespace may contain one or more micro vue applications and one or more micro services. \r\n\r\nI have looked into pages feature of vue cli but not sure if this really addresses this problem. Is it possible  to implement micro frondend like architecture using vue?\r\n\r\nI am author of a java based portal platform. A portal is like a big web application which allows one to create and design layout of pages at run time (https://github.com/pistonportal/piston-docs/wiki/Page-components-and-types). It also allows one to register micro web applications (called app in Piston and portlet, widget etc in other platforms), which are developed by different teams in same or different organizations. One can then place these micro web applications on different portal pages.\r\n\r\nI am not looking for all portal features (e.g. creating pages at runtime at this moment, placing more than one apps on a portal page etc). All we need is that different teams from same or different organizations should be able to develop micro frontends which can be a full module (e.g. a functionality launched by clicking a top level link in header) or a small feature (e.g. user management which can be launched through a link embedded in user profile pop up menu).

This is due to the updateChildComponent function that sets the reactive property\r\nvm.$listeners thus triggering a rerender of the child component. \r\n\r\n## Solution\r\n\r\nOne possible solution would be to compare the new listeners with the previous listeners. But since these are javascript functions, we cannot compare them.\r\nIt is important to note however that the listeners of the child component are updated later within the updateChildComponent function. Updating the vm.$listeners attribute should therefore not trigger any of the subscribers as the virtual DOM is eventually updated later on.\r\n\r\nThis change therefore provides a new toggleNotifyingSubscribers method that disables a reactive property's ability to notify its subscribers. We use this method to prevent the vm.$listeners property from rerendering the child component.\r\n\r\nfix #7257\r\n\r\n**What kind of change does this PR introduce?** (check at least one)\r\n\r\n- [x] Bugfix\r\n- [ ] Feature\r\n- [ ] Code style update\r\n- [ ] Refactor\r\n- [ ] Build-related changes\r\n- [ ] Other, please describe:\r\n\r\n**Does this PR introduce a breaking change?** (check one)\r\n\r\n- [ ] Yes\r\n- [x] No","Url":"https://github.com/vuejs/vue/pull/10073","RelatedDescription":"Open PR \"Prevent rerender of child components that use $listeners (fix #7257)\" (#10073)"},{"Id":"448794507","IsPullRequest":false,"CreatedAt":"2019-05-27T11:03:08","Actor":"qtzheng","Number":"10072","RawContent":null,"Title":"使用typescript eslint无法排除node_modules文件的错误","State":"closed","Body":"### Version\r\n2.6.10\r\n\r\n### Reproduction link\r\n[https://github.com/qtzheng/vue-demo.git](https://github.com/qtzheng/vue-demo.git)\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n### Steps to reproduce\r\n1、使用cli创建项目。\r\n2、添加pont-engine@0.2.1依赖,在main.ts中加入import {CodeGenerator} from 'pont-engine';\r\n3、运行npm run build\r\n4、编译失败，一堆的错误\r\n\r\n\r\n### What is expected?\r\nnpm run build 能正常执行\r\n\r\n### What is actually happening?\r\n注：好像是tslint的校验不通过，但是又没法排除node_modules/pont-engine\r\n\r\n<!-- generated by vue-issues.

I have created an application with a large number of components and modules and therefore a large number of namespaced getters. Every time such a getter is invoked the makeLocalGetters function is called iterating trough all the getters in the store just to create the gettersProxy object. This is overkill for ssr performance and is being flagged as a CPU consuming process in the node profiler. \r\nI have managed to double the number of requests per second my ssr app can handle just by using memoization on the gettersProxy object creation. I think this is really impacting performance.\r\n\r\n### What is expected?\r\nNamespaced getters invokation not to be inefficient with large numbers of getters/modules\r\n\r\n### What is actually happening?\r\nA lot of hits to makeLocalGetters making performance go down\r\n\r\n<!-- generated by vue-issues.

Plugins _alter_ an existing store / module, modules provide some completed state based functionality. \r\n\r\nTherefore it can often be the case where a reusable and freely distributed module is desirable (e.g. to include in multiple projects or multiple component libraries). \r\n\r\nAt the moment Vuex's documentation strikes a surprising balance of brevity and coverage (although in my opinion plugins could use some more expansion). However, the mention of how to make and distribute vuex modules is completely absent. \r\n\r\nSince Vue and the Vue ecosystem has lowered the barrier to entry to web development, not using Vue has complete coverage of the nuances of JavaScript and the many core libraries that help it work on the web (e.g. Babel)\r\n\r\nThus it would be relevant and beneficial to provide a complete example (even if it is minimal) of how to make a truly reusable module.\r\n\r\n\r\n### What does the proposed API look like?\r\nI would consider something simplistic (e.g. the counter app). However, I would suggest 2  modifications:\r\n\r\n1. an async / await version (as this can cause trouble with bundling)\r\n2. a typescript variant\r\n\r\n```js\r\n// reusable module\r\n\r\nconst state = () => ({\r\n  count: 0,\r\n  delay: 500\r\n})\r\n\r\nconst getters = {\r\n\r\n}\r\n\r\nconst actions = {\r\n  async updateCount({state, commit}, byHowMuch) {\r\n    let newCount = await setTimeout( () => state.count   byHowMuch, state.delay)\r\n    commit('setCount', newCount)\r\n  }\r\n}\r\n\r\nconst mutations = {\r\n  setCount(state, amount) {\r\n    state.count = amount\r\n  }\r\n}\r\n\r\n\r\nexport {namespaced:true, state, mutations, actions, getters}\r\n```\r\n\r\n\r\nthen provide the configuration file for how to use rollup and deploy to npm / yarn \r\n\r\n\r\nthen provide how to incorporate with nuxt\r\n\r\n\r\n```\r\n// <nuxt-project>/store/AsyncCountModule/index.js\r\nimport AsyncCountModule from 'AsyncCountModule'\r\n\r\nexport AsyncCountModule //<-- this doesnt work \r\n```\r\n\r\n<!-- generated by vue-issues.
