Our planning has reached a point where we have a schedule for the coreclr, corefx and core-setupmoves into dotnet/runtime that we want to share out with the community.\r\n\r\n### November 13th\r\nWe’ll move all changes from the original repositories into dotnet/runtime up to 5PM PST on November 13th. We’ll try to help as many pull requests as possible get merged by then. At that point, if there’s any pull requests still open we’ll have to close them. If you’d still like to continue those pull requests, we’d encourage you to bring them to dotnet/runtime in a new pull request.\r\n\r\nThe repositories themselves will be effectively archived at this point. The state of the “master” branch will be recorded with a tag, named “master-archive”, but the branch itself will be deleted. The default branch for the repositories will be named “archive” and it will be a single commit with a README.md and CONTRIBUTING.md file pointing to our dotnet/runtime repository.\r\n\r\nThe repositories will remain active for servicing changes to .NET Core 3.1 and earlier hence we will not be using the GitHub archive capability. \r\n\r\n### November 22nd\r\nThe dotnet/runtime repository will be made public and available for community contribution. Even though the repository will be created on November 13th it will take several days to get it back into a working order: fixing up our build scripts, recreating our Azure Dev Ops build definitions, etc … Until those tasks are completed it will not be possible to accept pull request and hence the repository will remain private. Once we are in a state that pull requests can be merged again the repository will be made public.\r\n\r\nOur expectation is that will occur on November 22nd. If it is ready sooner it will be made public sooner. If the work takes longer than we planned then we will add an update to this announcement with a new expected date.\r\n\r\n### December 1st-2nd\r\nAll issues, open and closed, will be migrated from corefx, coreclr and core-setup into dotnet/runtime. This will be using GitHub’s existing issue transfer feature in a bulk migration. This means all of the existing issue links will continue to function via redirects.\r\n\r\nThis does mean though that labels will not transfer with the issues. Labels will be re-applied as a post processing step by our engineering team once the issue migration completes.\r\n\r\nEven though our issues won’t be fully migrated until this time we’d like the community to begin filing issues on dotnet/runtime as soon as it’s public rather than continuing to file issues on the original repositories.\r\n\r\n### Migrating Commits\r\nThe dotnet/runtime repository will be a new commit history from the original repositories. We are using this consolidation as an opportunity to clean up our history with the goal of having a cleaner, smaller history as a starting point. This means commits will be rewritten in the following ways as they are migrated to dotnet/runtime:\r\n\r\n1. Author information, contributor information, changed file list and time stamps from the original commit will be preserved.\r\n1. Links to issues, pull requests or commits in the repository using GitHub short links will be rewritten so they continue to point the original repository. \r\n1. Every commit will be appended with a link to the original commit it was mapped from.\r\n\r\nThe actual contents of the commit though will be updated to match the new directory layout of the dotnet/runtime repository."},{"Id":"10738283611","Type":"IssuesEvent","CreatedAt":"2019-10-29T14:32:57","Actor":"mthalman","Repository":"dotnet/announcements","Organization":"dotnet","RawContent":null,"RelatedAction":"opened","RelatedUrl":"https://github.com/dotnet/announcements/issues/132","RelatedDescription":"Opened issue \"Release of Alpine 3.10 Docker images\" (#132) at dotnet/announcements","RelatedBody":"# .NET Core Alpine Docker images updated to Alpine 3.10\r\n\r\nDocker images for .NET Core have been released that support Alpine 3.10.

(It's increased to more than 15% with the array allocations taken out.)\n\nIt would be awesome if RyuJIT could eliminate calls to that method for sealed types :)\n\ncc @mikedn @CarolEidt @jkotas @omariom\n\r\ncategory:cq\r\ntheme:helpers\r\nskill-level:expert\r\ncost:medium"}],"ResultType":"GitHubEvent"},"CLI":{"Events":[{"Id":"10947100601","Type":"PullRequestEvent","CreatedAt":"2019-11-26T04:55:11","Actor":"dotnet-maestro[bot]","Repository":"dotnet/cli","Organization":"dotnet","RawContent":null,"RelatedAction":"opened","RelatedUrl":"https://github.com/dotnet/cli/pull/13124","RelatedDescription":"Opened pull request \"[release/3.1.1xx] Update dependencies from aspnet/AspNetCore\" (#13124) at dotnet/cli","RelatedBody":"This pull request updates the following dependencies\r\n\r\n[marker]: <> (Begin:c7c33a9e-18af-4618-5026-08d727dabd66)\r\n## From https://github.com/aspnet/AspNetCore\r\n- **Build**: 20191125.14\r\n- **Date Produced**: 11/26/2019 4:11 AM\r\n- **Commit**: 7db696998c6ae4852fbf01827efdb10634e22668\r\n- **Branch**: refs/heads/release/3.1\r\n- **Updates**:\r\n  - **Microsoft.AspNetCore.DeveloperCertificates.XPlat** -> 3.1.0-rtm.19575.14\r\n\r\n[marker]: <> (End:c7c33a9e-18af-4618-5026-08d727dabd66)\r\n\r\n"},{"Id":"10946668690","Type":"PullRequestEvent","CreatedAt":"2019-11-26T03:11:27","Actor":"flcdrg","Repository":"dotnet/cli","Organization":"dotnet","RawContent":null,"RelatedAction":"opened","RelatedUrl":"https://github.com/dotnet/cli/pull/13123","RelatedDescription":"Opened pull request \"Add switch to enable searching global path for existing SDK version\" (#13123) at dotnet/cli","RelatedBody":"Implements #11058"},{"Id":"10946201149","Type":"PullRequestEvent","CreatedAt":"2019-11-26T01:27:59","Actor":"wtgodbe","Repository":"dotnet/cli","Organization":"dotnet","RawContent":null,"RelatedAction":"merged","RelatedUrl":"https://github.com/dotnet/cli/pull/13122","RelatedDescription":"Merged pull request \"Add trigger for internal builds\" (#13122) at dotnet/cli","RelatedBody":"Needed for the internal builds for 3.1.1.

I am not clear if this is a Visual Studio component, or a general re-usable component that might be shared between Visual Studio and Visual Studio Code.  If there is a general re-usable component, I'd like to contribute test cases to improve its behavior.\r\n\r\nAs a brief example of annoyances:\r\n\r\n```xml\r\n    <Content Include=\"App.config\">\r\n      <CopyToOutputDirectory>Always</CopyToOutputDirectory>\r\n    </Content>\r\n    <Content Include=\"App.*.config\">\r\n      <DependentUpon>App.config</DependentUpon>\r\n      <CopyToOutputDirectory>Always</CopyToOutputDirectory>\r\n    </Content>\r\n```\r\n\r\nRight clicking on App.config and doing copy-paste results in a new file.  Then you re-name that file App.Production.config and get an additional entry (as well as an error message box from Visual Studio).\r\n\r\nThis produces spurious entries in my csproj SDK file:\r\n\r\n```xml\r\n  <ItemGroup>\r\n    <None Remove=\"App - Copy.config\" />\r\n    <None Remove=\"App.Production.config\" />\r\n```\r\n\r\nFurther, creating an App.Beta.config on top of App.config and App.Production.config produces even more spruious behavior that is truly unexpected.  Copying and renaming App.config to App.Beta.Config generates a spurious App - Copy.Production.config!\r\n\r\nIf this is not a first class component, I think it's worth considering.  Benefits include fewer merge conflicts and cleaner csproj SDK projects."},{"Id":"10944701784","Type":"PullRequestEvent","CreatedAt":"2019-11-25T21:08:21","Actor":"wtgodbe","Repository":"dotnet/sdk","Organization":"dotnet","RawContent":null,"RelatedAction":"opened","RelatedUrl":"https://github.com/dotnet/sdk/pull/3969","RelatedDescription":"Opened pull request \"Add trigger for internal builds\" (#3969) at dotnet/sdk","RelatedBody":"Needed for the internal builds for 3.1.1.

I am not clear if this is a Visual Studio component, or a general re-usable component that might be shared between Visual Studio and Visual Studio Code.  If there is a general re-usable component, I'd like to contribute test cases to improve its behavior.\r\n\r\nAs a brief example of annoyances:\r\n\r\n```xml\r\n    <Content Include=\"App.config\">\r\n      <CopyToOutputDirectory>Always</CopyToOutputDirectory>\r\n    </Content>\r\n    <Content Include=\"App.*.config\">\r\n      <DependentUpon>App.config</DependentUpon>\r\n      <CopyToOutputDirectory>Always</CopyToOutputDirectory>\r\n    </Content>\r\n```\r\n\r\nRight clicking on App.config and doing copy-paste results in a new file.  Then you re-name that file App.Production.config and get an additional entry (as well as an error message box from Visual Studio).\r\n\r\nIf this is not a first class component, I think it's worth considering.

What we have also noticed is that there are some **\"unmanaged/native DLL\"** that are used (`sni.dll`) internally by `System.Data.SqlClient`, possibly from within `TdsParserStateObjectNative`. Not sure if this is causing any issues. \r\n\r\nIs something that we are attempting to do, incorrect?

Take the following method:\r\n\r\n```c#\r\n[MethodImpl(MethodImplOptions.AggressiveInlining)]\r\npublic static bool HasFlag(T value, T flag) where T : struct, Enum\r\n{\t\t\t\r\n    int size = Unsafe.SizeOf<T>();\r\n\r\n    if (size == 1)\r\n        return (Unsafe.As<T, byte>(ref value) | Unsafe.As<T, byte>(ref flag)) == Unsafe.As<T, byte>(ref value);\r\n    else if (size == 2)\r\n        return (Unsafe.As<T, short>(ref value) | Unsafe.As<T, short>(ref flag)) == Unsafe.As<T, short>(ref value);\r\n    else if (size == 4)\r\n        return (Unsafe.As<T, int>(ref value) | Unsafe.As<T, int>(ref flag)) == Unsafe.As<T, int>(ref value);\r\n    else // size == 8\r\n        return (Unsafe.As<T, long>(ref value) | Unsafe.As<T, long>(ref flag)) == Unsafe.As<T, long>(ref value);\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nWith the branch elimination it is doing it should be able to produce the optimal ASM, i.e.:\r\n\r\n```\r\n    L0000: or edx, ecx\r\n    L0002: cmp edx, ecx\r\n    L0004: setz al\r\n    L0007: movzx eax, al\r\n    L000a: ret\r\n```\r\n\r\nIt gets somewhat close but produces this instead (for size 4 types):\r\n\r\n```\r\n    L0000: mov [rsp+0x8], ecx\r\n    L0004: mov [rsp+0x10], edx\r\n    L0008: mov eax, [rsp+0x8]\r\n    L000c: mov edx, [rsp+0x10]\r\n    L0010: or edx, eax\r\n    L0012: cmp edx, eax\r\n    L0014: setz al\r\n    L0017: movzx eax, al\r\n    L001a: ret\r\n```\r\n\r\nWhich runs about half as fast and uses 16 additional bytes (26 instead of just 10). I'm not sure exactly what is going on here but I believe it has to do with the way the stack is used when there are multiple branches that use locals causing some optimizations not to be done because this produces the optimal ASM:\r\n\r\n```c#\r\npublic static bool HasFlag(T value, T flag) where T : struct, Enum\r\n{\t\t\t\r\n    int size = Unsafe.SizeOf<T>();\r\n\r\n    if (size == 4)\r\n        return (Unsafe.As<T, int>(ref value) | Unsafe.As<T, int>(ref flag)) == Unsafe.As<T, int>(ref value);\r\n    \r\n    throw new NotSupportedException();    \r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nI imagine that improving this could reduce JITted code size and bump performance in many cases. One of the concerns about adding generic enum methods is the JIT bloat it will produce and this could potentially help with that given that most of the methods would be simple bitwise operations like the one above.","Url":"https://github.com/dotnet/coreclr/issues/27917","RelatedDescription":"Open issue \"JIT Optimization (Stack Usage?)\" (#27917)"},{"Id":"526812011","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2019-11-21T20:06:22","Actor":"dotnet-maestro-bot","Number":"27916","RawContent":null,"Title":"[automated] Merge branch 'release/2.1' => 'release/2.2'","State":"closed","Body":"I detected changes in the release/2.1 branch which have not been merged yet to release/2.2.

The chain in three deep: we have a self-signed root CA, which has signed a domain level CA, which in turn has signed a server (non-CA) cert.\r\n\r\nWhen validating the chain, we're met with a X509ChainStatusFlags.NotSignatureValid error carrying a \"certificate signature failure\" StatusInformation string.  The error appears to originate from openssl, but the native code responsible for bubbling this up to the managed world seems to be new (or at least heavily reworked) for .NET Core 3.0 and largely introduced by this pull request: https://github.com/dotnet/corefx/pull/35801\r\n\r\nThe issue occurs only on Linux (both x64 and ARM), not Windows.  It is seen with both .NET Core 3.0 and 3.1, but not with 2.2, 2.1, or 2.0.  I've also tested with both openssl 1.1.1 and 1.0.2 libs and it's seen with both.\r\n\r\nI've validated the chain on the command line with both the openssl and GnuTLS certtool command (in the same Linux environments) and both show no errors.\r\n\r\nThe attached project (with a junk cert chain formed similarly to our own) should reproduce the issue easily.  On Windows (or Linux with .NET Core 2.x) it's output with be \"Chain Valid\".  On Linux with .NET Core 3.0/3.1, it'll print \"Chain Invalid: NotSignatureValid: certificate signature failure\"\r\n\r\n[CertChainValidateTest.zip](https://github.com/dotnet/corefx/files/3889530/CertChainValidateTest.zip)\r\n\r\nLet me know if there's anything else I can provide or should check.\r\n\r\nThanks a lot!\r\n\r\nMatt\r\n","Url":"https://github.com/dotnet/corefx/issues/42717","RelatedDescription":"Open issue \"X509Chain NotSignatureValid error on Linux with .NET Core 3.0+\" (#42717)"},{"Id":"528400827","IsPullRequest":false,"CreatedAt":"2019-11-25T23:39:23","Actor":"ViktorHofer","Number":"42716","RawContent":null,"Title":"🎉🎉🎉 dotnet/runtime welcomes you 🎉🎉🎉","State":"open","Body":"We are excited to announce that we just opened the [dotnet/runtime](https://github.com/dotnet/runtime) repository for community members: https://github.com/dotnet/runtime/issues/253.

Basically, when a WinRT stream is an adapter around a .Net `Stream` and you attempt to write an empty **native** `IBuffer` to that stream, you get an `ArgumentOutOfRangeException`. Here is an example (.Net Core 3.0 console app):\r\n\r\n``` csharp\r\nstatic async Task Main()\r\n{\r\n    using var fileStream = File.OpenWrite(\"TestFile.txt\");\r\n    using var winRtStream = fileStream.AsOutputStream();\r\n\r\n    // This works OK.\r\n    await fileStream.WriteAsync(ReadOnlyMemory<byte>.Empty);\r\n    Console.WriteLine(\"fileStream.WriteAsync completed OK\");\r\n\r\n    var winRtbuffer = new Windows.Storage.Streams.Buffer(capacity: 0);\r\n\r\n    // This fails!\r\n    await winRtStream.WriteAsync(winRtbuffer);\r\n    Console.WriteLine(\"winRtStream.WriteAsync completed OK\");\r\n}\r\n```\r\nThis gives the following when running:\r\n\r\n```\r\nfileStream.WriteAsync completed OK\r\nUnhandled exception.

Actually, if the `IBuffer` is a wrapper for managed memory, all works fine (because internally the write is done differently in this case). \r\n\r\nIt's easy to find the root of the problem. [Here](https://github.com/dotnet/corefx/blob/a12c557a72988070b8624cc7ecc46899629895c4/src/System.Runtime.WindowsRuntime/src/System/IO/StreamOperationsImplementation.cs#L207)  `Stream.CopyAsync` method is used, which doesn't support zero buffer length and crashes.

In the next PR I think that a similar pattern to SynthesizedMethodBaseSymbol should be applied to SynthesizedParameterSymbol (delegating to the BaseMethodSymbol depending on a flag on the SynthesizedParameterSymbol).\r\n\r\n/cc @cston @agocke","Url":"https://github.com/dotnet/roslyn/pull/40011","RelatedDescription":"Open PR \"Support extern local functions and well-known method attributes\" (#40011)"},{"Id":"528345211","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2019-11-25T21:24:16","Actor":"AlekseyTs","Number":"40010","RawContent":null,"Title":"Track assemblies declaring well-known types used by a compilation.","State":"open","Body":"Related to #37768.","Url":"https://github.com/dotnet/roslyn/pull/40010","RelatedDescription":"Open PR \"Track assemblies declaring well-known types used by a compilation.\" (#40010)"},{"Id":"528298968","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2019-11-25T21:12:59","Actor":"chsienki","Number":"40009","RawContent":null,"Title":"Extend profiling inputs drop time to 90 days","State":"closed","Body":"","Url":"https://github.com/dotnet/roslyn/pull/40009","RelatedDescription":"Closed or merged PR \"Extend profiling inputs drop time to 90 days\" (#40009)"},{"Id":"528075389","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2019-11-25T19:46:25","Actor":"dotnet-maestro[bot]","Number":"40005","RawContent":null,"Title":"[master] Update dependencies from dotnet/arcade","State":"closed","Body":"This pull request updates the following dependencies\r\n\r\n[marker]: <> (Begin:567feadf-e495-4ebb-cee4-08d67668456c)\r\n## From https://github.com/dotnet/arcade\r\n- **Build**: 20191124.1\r\n- **Date Produced**: 11/24/2019 2:49 PM\r\n- **Commit**: 87b59e17420bf0c3341edacbd8a6721e619afbac\r\n- **Branch**: refs/heads/master\r\n- **Updates**:\r\n  - **Microsoft.DotNet.Arcade.Sdk** -> 5.0.0-beta.19574.1\r\n\r\n[marker]: <> (End:567feadf-e495-4ebb-cee4-08d67668456c)\r\n\r\n","Url":"https://github.com/dotnet/roslyn/pull/40005","RelatedDescription":"Closed or merged PR \"[master] Update dependencies from dotnet/arcade\" (#40005)"},{"Id":"528143987","IsPullRequest":false,"CreatedAt":"2019-11-25T15:02:13","Actor":"stephentoub","Number":"40008","RawContent":null,"Title":"IDE0019 changes program behavior when casting expressions influenced by ambient state","State":"open","Body":"**Version Used**: \r\n3.5.0-beta2-19570-07+4bd316035f64c9776d5420af71df8ba38e8e23e4\r\n\r\n**Steps to Reproduce**:\r\nPaste this into a project:\r\n```C#\r\nusing System;\r\n\r\nclass Program\r\n{\r\n    static bool s_value = true;\r\n\r\n    static void Main()\r\n    {\r\n        string o = GetValue() as string;\r\n        s_value = false;\r\n        if (o != null)\r\n        {\r\n            Console.WriteLine(\"got string\");\r\n        }\r\n    }\r\n\r\n    private static object GetValue() => s_value ? \"string\" : new object();\r\n}\r\n```\r\nand apply IDE0019.\r\n\r\n**Expected Behavior**:\r\nIDE0019 should not be offered.\r\n\r\n**Actual Behavior**:\r\nIt refactors the program to this:\r\n```C#\r\nusing System;\r\n\r\nclass Program\r\n{\r\n    static bool s_value = true;\r\n\r\n    static void Main()\r\n    {\r\n        s_value = false;\r\n        if (GetValue() is string o)\r\n        {\r\n            Console.WriteLine(\"got string\");\r\n        }\r\n    }\r\n\r\n    private static object GetValue() => s_value ? \"string\" : new object();\r\n}\r\n```\r\nwhich now has different behavior.

I am not clear if this is a Visual Studio component, or a general re-usable component that might be shared between Visual Studio and Visual Studio Code.  If there is a general re-usable component, I'd like to contribute test cases to improve its behavior.\r\n\r\nAs a brief example of annoyances:\r\n\r\n```xml\r\n    <Content Include=\"App.config\">\r\n      <CopyToOutputDirectory>Always</CopyToOutputDirectory>\r\n    </Content>\r\n    <Content Include=\"App.*.config\">\r\n      <DependentUpon>App.config</DependentUpon>\r\n      <CopyToOutputDirectory>Always</CopyToOutputDirectory>\r\n    </Content>\r\n```\r\n\r\nRight clicking on App.config and doing copy-paste results in a new file.  Then you re-name that file App.Production.config and get an additional entry (as well as an error message box from Visual Studio).\r\n\r\nThis produces spurious entries in my csproj SDK file:\r\n\r\n```xml\r\n  <ItemGroup>\r\n    <None Remove=\"App - Copy.config\" />\r\n    <None Remove=\"App.Production.config\" />\r\n```\r\n\r\nFurther, creating an App.Beta.config on top of App.config and App.Production.config produces even more spruious behavior that is truly unexpected.  Copying and renaming App.config to App.Beta.Config generates a spurious App - Copy.Production.config!\r\n\r\nIf this is not a first class component, I think it's worth considering.  Benefits include fewer merge conflicts and cleaner csproj SDK projects.","Url":"https://github.com/dotnet/sdk/issues/3967","RelatedDescription":"Closed issue \"[Question] Is there a component that drives how to update csproj files?\" (#3967)"},{"Id":"528210775","IsPullRequest":false,"CreatedAt":"2019-11-25T16:51:05","Actor":"kmuthukumar23","Number":"3968","RawContent":null,"Title":"How can install preview version of SDKs in linux using CLI","State":"open","Body":"I want to install the .net core 3.1 preview 3 in linux machine using command line\r\n\r\nIs there any ways to install the preview versions of .Net Core SDKs in linux machine using command line?\r\n\r\nFor example,\r\n\r\n> sudo apt-get update\r\n\r\n> sudo apt-get install apt-transport-https\r\n\r\n> sudo apt-get update\r\n\r\n> sudo apt-get install dotnet-sdk-3.0\r\n\r\nAbove Command used to install the SDK 3.0 in linux.

Our planning has reached a point where we have a schedule for the coreclr, corefx and core-setupmoves into dotnet/runtime that we want to share out with the community.\r\n\r\n### November 13th\r\nWe’ll move all changes from the original repositories into dotnet/runtime up to 5PM PST on November 13th. We’ll try to help as many pull requests as possible get merged by then. At that point, if there’s any pull requests still open we’ll have to close them. If you’d still like to continue those pull requests, we’d encourage you to bring them to dotnet/runtime in a new pull request.\r\n\r\nThe repositories themselves will be effectively archived at this point. The state of the “master” branch will be recorded with a tag, named “master-archive”, but the branch itself will be deleted. The default branch for the repositories will be named “archive” and it will be a single commit with a README.md and CONTRIBUTING.md file pointing to our dotnet/runtime repository.\r\n\r\nThe repositories will remain active for servicing changes to .NET Core 3.1 and earlier hence we will not be using the GitHub archive capability. \r\n\r\n### November 22nd\r\nThe dotnet/runtime repository will be made public and available for community contribution. Even though the repository will be created on November 13th it will take several days to get it back into a working order: fixing up our build scripts, recreating our Azure Dev Ops build definitions, etc … Until those tasks are completed it will not be possible to accept pull request and hence the repository will remain private. Once we are in a state that pull requests can be merged again the repository will be made public.\r\n\r\nOur expectation is that will occur on November 22nd. If it is ready sooner it will be made public sooner. If the work takes longer than we planned then we will add an update to this announcement with a new expected date.\r\n\r\n### December 1st-2nd\r\nAll issues, open and closed, will be migrated from corefx, coreclr and core-setup into dotnet/runtime. This will be using GitHub’s existing issue transfer feature in a bulk migration. This means all of the existing issue links will continue to function via redirects.\r\n\r\nThis does mean though that labels will not transfer with the issues. Labels will be re-applied as a post processing step by our engineering team once the issue migration completes.\r\n\r\nEven though our issues won’t be fully migrated until this time we’d like the community to begin filing issues on dotnet/runtime as soon as it’s public rather than continuing to file issues on the original repositories.\r\n\r\n### Migrating Commits\r\nThe dotnet/runtime repository will be a new commit history from the original repositories. We are using this consolidation as an opportunity to clean up our history with the goal of having a cleaner, smaller history as a starting point. This means commits will be rewritten in the following ways as they are migrated to dotnet/runtime:\r\n\r\n1. Author information, contributor information, changed file list and time stamps from the original commit will be preserved.\r\n1. Links to issues, pull requests or commits in the repository using GitHub short links will be rewritten so they continue to point the original repository. \r\n1. Every commit will be appended with a link to the original commit it was mapped from.\r\n\r\nThe actual contents of the commit though will be updated to match the new directory layout of the dotnet/runtime repository.","Url":"https://github.com/dotnet/announcements/issues/133","RelatedDescription":"Open issue \"Repository Consolidation Timeline\" (#133)"},{"Id":"513963125","IsPullRequest":false,"CreatedAt":"2019-10-29T14:32:55","Actor":"mthalman","Number":"132","RawContent":null,"Title":"Release of Alpine 3.10 Docker images","State":"open","Body":"# .NET Core Alpine Docker images updated to Alpine 3.10\r\n\r\nDocker images for .NET Core have been released that support Alpine 3.10.

With [.NET Standard 2.0](https://devblogs.microsoft.com/dotnet/announcing-net-standard-2-0/), we tried to make it much more viable to share code between .NET Framework, .NET Core, and Xamarin which resulted in approximately 38K .NET Frameworks APIs being available in .NET Core 2.0. We also built the [Windows Compatibility Pack](https://devblogs.microsoft.com/dotnet/announcing-the-windows-compatibility-pack-for-net-core/) which made another 21K .NET Framework APIs available to .NET Core, resulting in almost 60K additional APIs. And in .NET Core 3.0 we added WPF and WinForms, which increased the number of .NET Framework APIs ported to .NET Core to over 120k, which is more than half of all .NET Framework APIs.\r\n\r\nIt’s also worth pointing out that we added about 62K APIs to .NET Core that don’t exist in .NET Framework. If we compare their total number of APIs, .NET Core has about 80% of the API surface of .NET Framework.\r\n\r\n<p align=\"center\">\r\n<img src=\"https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/5169960/66777114-f8db7c80-ee7c-11e9-9161-acfe1c491586.png\" width=\"600\" align=\"center\">\r\n</p>\r\n\r\nWe announced that the [future of .NET](https://devblogs.microsoft.com/dotnet/net-core-is-the-future-of-net/) will be based on .NET Core. And at Build 2019, [Scott Hunter stated](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZlO1utbB2GQ&t=54m20s) that AppDomains, remoting, Web Forms, WCF server, and Windows Workflow won’t be ported to .NET Core.\r\n\r\nWith .NET Core 3.0, we’re at the point where we’ve ported all technologies that are required for modern workloads, be that desktop apps, mobile apps, console apps, web sites, or cloud services. That’s not to say that we don’t have any gaps or opportunities for new technologies, but we generally believe we won’t be finding them in the .NET Framework code base anymore. Moving forward, we’re focusing our resources on incorporating new technologies.\r\n\r\nSimultaneously, we’re looking into releasing more of the [.NET Framework code base under the MIT license](https://github.com/microsoft/referencesource) on GitHub to allow the community to create OSS projects for technologies we’re not intending to bring to .NET Core. For example, there already are community projects for [CoreWF](https://github.com/UiPath/corewf) and [CoreWCF](https://github.com/CoreWCF/CoreWCF).\r\n\r\nWe’d like to thank everyone who filed issues with requests for APIs being ported. Those issues allowed us to prioritize and close the gaps that prevented people from porting to .NET Core.\r\n\r\nBut since we generally no longer plan to bring existing technologies from .NET Framework to .NET Core we’ll be closing all issues that are [labeled with port-to-core](https://github.com/dotnet/corefx/issues?utf8=%E2%9C%93&q=is%3Aissue+is%3Aopen+label%3Aport-to-core).\r\n\r\n### Discussion\r\n\r\nTo discuss this issue, please comment on the corresponding issue at https://github.com/dotnet/corefx/issues/41769.","Url":"https://github.com/dotnet/announcements/issues/130","RelatedDescription":"Open issue \".NET Core 3.0 concludes the .NET Framework API porting project\" (#130)"},{"Id":"505445666","IsPullRequest":false,"CreatedAt":"2019-10-10T18:45:56","Actor":"TaraOverfield","Number":"129","RawContent":null,"Title":"October 2019 .NET Updates","State":"open","Body":"The following .NET updates were released on October 2019.

While this is still work in progress, we'd like to give you an update on where we are.\r\n\r\nSo far, we've identified the following repos:\r\n\r\n* dotnet/**runtime**\r\n\t- Will contain [coreclr](https://github.com/dotnet/coreclr), [corefx](https://github.com/dotnet/corefx), [core-setup](https://github.com/dotnet/core-setup), [aspnet/Extensions](https://github.com/aspnet/Extensions), and some of [mono/mono](https://github.com/mono/mono)\r\n* [dotnet/**sdk**](https://github.com/dotnet/sdk)\r\n\t- Will contain [toolset](https://github.com/dotnet/toolset), [sdk](https://github.com/dotnet/sdk), [cli](https://github.com/dotnet/cli)\r\n* dotnet/**installer**\r\n\t- Renamed from [core-sdk](https://github.com/dotnet/core-sdk)\r\n* dotnet/**aspnetcore**\r\n\t- Moved from [aspnet/AspNetCore](https://github.com/aspnet/AspNetCore) and will also contain [aspnet/AspNetCore-Tooling](https://github.com/aspnet/AspNetCore-Tooling)\r\n* dotnet/**efcore**\r\n\t- Moved from [aspnet/EntityFrameworkCore](https://github.com/aspnet/EntityFrameworkCore)\r\n* [dotnet/**winforms**](https://github.com/dotnet/winforms)\r\n\t- Unchanged, but listed for clarity \r\n* [dotnet/**wpf**](https://github.com/dotnet/wpf)\r\n\t- Unchanged, but listed for clarity\r\n\r\n### Name changes\r\n\r\nYou might notice that we changed our mind on naming from our [earlier announcement][ann]. Based on your feedback, we decided to go with **dotnet/runtime** instead of **dotnet/platform** and **dotnet/sdk** instead of **dotnet/cli**.\r\n\r\nSeveral people pointed out that the previous names weren't relatable to how we talk about the product, for example on download pages. So, we decided to match the product distributions as the primary design point for the new names. We generally refer to the bits you need to run your app as *the runtime* and the bits you need to build apps as *the SDK*. This also matches the naming chosen by other platforms.\r\n\r\n### New repos can't be used for .NET Core 3.x or earlier\r\n\r\nThe consolidated repositories are going to be about .NET 5 and going forward. It will not be possible to build .NET Core 3.1 or earlier from these repositories. As such, only the master branch from each of the repositories will be brought forward. There will be no porting of the individual release branches in the source repositories.\r\n\r\n### Personal names and email addresses\r\n\r\nSince we're planning on rebasing the history in the merged repositories, we can map your name and email address to new values as well. We primarily do this to support our friends in the LGBTQ+ community who have changed their names to reflect their identities. However, anybody is welcome to use this to change their email and name.\r\n\r\nWhatever your reason might be: we value your contributions and we hope this small gesture makes your life a little bit better. So if you changed your name/email – or simply prefer us to use different values – please [submit a request](mailto:dotnet@microsoft.com&subject=.NET%20repo%20consolidation%3A%20request%20for%20name%20change&body=Hey%2C%20%0A%0AI%E2%80%99d%20like%20to%20change%20my%20email%2Fdisplay%20name%20in%20the%20consolidated%20repo%20from%20%0A%0A%20%20%20%20%20%20%20%20My%20Old%20Name%20%3Cold.me%40example.org%3E%20%0A%0Ato%20%0A%0A%20%20%20%20%20%20%20%20My%20New%20Name%20%3Cnew.me%40example.org%3E%20%0A%0AThanks%21%20%0A).\r\n\r\n### More is coming\r\n\r\nWe'll share more updates in the upcoming months.

However, this separation has led to a variety of complications for contributors and maintainers alike.  For example:\r\n- **Confusion about where issues should be opened.**  It’s not always clear in which repo an issue should be reported, complicated by the fact that some implementations actually span repositories (e.g. a type might be exposed through a reference assembly and have its tests in corefx but actually be implemented in System.Private.CoreLib in coreclr).\r\n- **Difficulty sharing source.**  System.Private.CoreLib is intricately connected to the rest of the runtime, and thus has lived with the runtime code.  That, however, means that although corefx has been intended as the place to share as much core library code as possible across any underlying runtime, we’ve needed to keep a significant body of code in System.Private.CoreLib, which then has meant it’s needed to be “mirrored” to each runtime repo (coreclr, corert, mono) that needs to consume it as source; similarly, corefx has similarly required access to much of that source, for example to use the same interop DllImports that are employed elsewhere in the runtimes.  The automatic mirror that shares this source needs to be maintained, and even when it has been, it’s often led to lag.  It’s also complicated developer processes, where to validate a change in one repo generally requires manually mirroring the code to other local repos in order to validate the change and ensure merging into one repo won’t break the others.\r\n- **PRs spanning multiple repos.**  Because the runtime, CoreLib, and the core libraries are all intricately linked, changing runtime behaviors, adding new APIs, or changing various build processes (e.g. improving static analysis) often requires multiple PRs carefully staged across time and multiple repos.  For example, to add a new method to a type like Dictionary<>, a developer must first make the source changes in her local coreclr repo and the test and reference assembly changes in her local corefx repo.  When satisfied with the fix, the developer must submit a PR to coreclr as well as a PR to corefx, the latter of which will fail.  Eventually the coreclr PR will be merged, and the changes will mirror to the other runtimes that also require the update.  Eventually those mirror PRs will be merged, and builds will be created containing the fix for each runtime.  At some point later those builds will be consumed into the corefx repo, after which point the original corefx PR can be re-validated and eventually merged.  That’s the best case; things get more complicated in situations where there are bidirectional dependencies.\r\n- **Building an installable runtime.** Self-hosting a custom built .NET requires intricate knowledge of how all the repos work and interact.  A developer can’t just clone a single repo, make a desired change, and easily produce an installer.\r\n- **Consistency.**  One goal we had for more fine-grained repos was to enable isolation and independence for teams working within each repo’s confines, but this has led to non-trivial duplication of effort on things like build systems and CI, and then the resulting lack of consistency as each system ends up diverging from the others.\r\n\r\nThe issues go beyond the runtime.  For example, the ASP.NET maintainers and community did a great job in the past year or so consolidating from ~55 repos down to ~5 repos, but that’s still more repos than is desirable, leading to similar issues as cited above for the runtime.  On top of that, these ASP.NET repositories are in the aspnet GitHub org, which adds an additional set of issues, for example:\r\n- **Complications moving issues between repos.**  If a developer opens an issue in aspnet/aspnetcore and it’s determined that the cause of the issue is actually in dotnet/corefx, there is no GitHub mechanism to enable easily moving that issue across the aspnet to dotnet organizational boundary.\r\n- **Permissions.** Each organization’s permissions end up needing to be managed and maintained separately.\r\n\r\nThe issues extend into tooling as well.  For example, we currently have multiple repositories that all logically make up the dotnet CLI, but actually creating a working installer spans multiple repos.\r\n\r\n### Plan\r\n\r\nTo address these issues, we’re planning to make some changes to our repository structure:\r\n- **dotnet/platform.**  We plan to combine dotnet/coreclr, dotnet/corefx, dotnet/corert, dotnet/core-setup, and the relevant portions of mono/mono into a new dotnet/platform repo.  Everything needed to build and produce the Microsoft.NETCore.App shared framework will be in this repo.  We will no longer suffer from the complications of source mirroring.  Features like changing runtime behavior or adding an API will no longer require a complicated dance across multiple repos.  Etc.\r\n- **dotnet/aspnetcore.**  We plan to move the existing aspnet/aspnetcore repository into the dotnet organization.  Along with that, we aim to combine a variety of the other aspnet repositories into aspnetcore, such as aspnet/blazor.  Whether repos like entityframeworkcore remain separate or combined remains an open question.  A goal is that, just as dotnet/platform will be responsible for the creation of Microsoft.NETCore.App, dotnet/aspnetcore will be responsible for the creation of Microsoft.AspNETCore.App.\r\n- **dotnet/cli.**  We plan to combine dotnet/toolset and dotnet/sdk into the dotnet/cli repo.\r\n\r\n### FAQ\r\n\r\n#### Why are we merging repos?\r\n\r\nWe believe we can significantly improve several aspects of .NET on GitHub by combining repos, benefiting both maintainers and contributors.  These improvements will manifest in a variety of ways, such as in better issue management, much easier models of contribution, and easier and faster ways to build and install the resulting bits.\r\n\r\n####  What will happen to the aspnet org?\r\n\r\nThe aspnet org as a separate entity is legacy and artificial.  In time we hope to absorb it into the dotnet org and sunset the aspnet org.\r\n\r\n#### Will the coreclr and corefx repos go away?\r\n\r\nWith the help of GitHub, we plan to migrate all issues from these repos to the new dotnet/platform repo, and then lock down creation of additional issues, such that the repos will no longer be used for issue management.  We will also inhibit the creation of PRs to the master branch, which will effectively become an archive for read-only review of history.  In this sense, these repos will be archived, and no active development will happen with them.  However, we plan to continue servicing previous .NET Core releases out of these repos, so the various release branches (e.g. release/2.1, release/3.0, etc.) will continue to see (limited) activity.\r\n\r\n#### Will the mono repo go away?\r\n\r\nNo. mono/mono contains the source for the full mono stack and will continue to live on happily.  We will simply be moving the managed source associated with System.Private.CoreLib and copying the relatively small amount of source that makes up the native mono runtime to dotnet/platform.  We may choose to then use some mirroring technology to keep the runtime copy in sync (this will, however, not suffer from the same mirroring issues we currently experience, as we would not be mirroring between two components required to build the same binaries), or we may choose to let them diverge and manually sync only those changes deemed relevant to both implementations.\r\n\r\n#### Will the corert repo go away?\r\n\r\nYes.  We plan to retire/archive the corert repo.  Some of the technology in the corert repo will be migrated to the master branch of dotnet/platform, where it will be productized as part of .NET.  Other portions of the corert repo will be migrated to feature branches of dotnet/platform, where the experimentation can continue.  In this way, we will use feature branches to continue experimenting with the corert technology, while making it easier to share portions with its shipping counterpart and also graduate functionality into master if/when it’s ready.\r\n\r\n#### Does this mean there will be a single repo for all of .NET?\r\n\r\nNo.  We will be reducing the number of repos that contribute to .NET, but currently we do not believe that going all the way down to one is the right answer.\r\n\r\n#### Doesn’t this mean that issue and PR tracking will now be overwhelming?\r\n\r\nIt is already the case that the vast majority of issues in a given repo are not relevant to any individual developer, and with several thousand open issues in each repo and on the order of a hundred open PRs in each, we already need systems (e.g. labels) to successfully manage issues and PRs.  As such, we don’t believe the merging will have a significant impact on this aspect of developer productivity.  If it turns out to have an unexpectedly large negative impact, we will work with the community to find ways to mitigate the problem.  However, there are already a multitude of successful open source projects on GitHub with at least an order of magnitude more issues.\r\n\r\n#### What will happen to existing issues?\r\n\r\nWith the help of GitHub functionality, we plan to migrate all issues from old repos (e.g. dotnet/coreclr, dotnet/corefx) to the new repos (e.g. dotnet/platform).  We may also use this as a forcing function to revisit stale issues and either close those that are no longer relevant or reinvigorate those that are demanding of more immediate attention.\r\n\r\n#### What about git history?\r\n\r\nIn general, we plan to keep history, such that history from each constituent repo will be a part of the new repo.  However, we have made some mistakes in the past (e.g. large binaries, multitudes of automated PRs for flowing bits and source between repos, etc.), and we plan to rewrite history to correct those mistakes wherever possible and impactful.  Some rough calculations suggest this could end up significantly reducing the size of the repos as well as the time it takes to clone, which should not only help developers approaching the project but also CI.  This will end up meaning that SHAs may be different in the new repo than they were in the old repo; as previously mentioned, however, any references to the old SHAs in the old repos will continue to work, as those repos will remain accessible.\r\n\r\n#### Will I still show up in the contributor list due to previous contributions?\r\n\r\nYes.  We plan to merge all such history.\r\n\r\n#### Will this break debugging with SourceLink?\r\n\r\nNo.  The existing repos will continue to be accessible, and commit SHAs there will remain unchanged.\r\n\r\n#### Might plans change?\r\n\r\nSure.  Part of the goal of posting this announcement is to hear from you, hear about additional benefits you're excited about, and hear about additional concerns we may not have considered.  We will include such ideas in our planning and course correct as necessary.\r\n\r\n## Discussion\r\n\r\nTo discuss these plans, please comment on the corresponding issue at https://github.com/dotnet/coreclr/issues/26175.\r\n","Url":"https://github.com/dotnet/announcements/issues/119","RelatedDescription":"Open issue \"Consolidating .NET GitHub repos\" (#119)"},{"Id":"470434872","IsPullRequest":false,"CreatedAt":"2019-07-19T16:54:02","Actor":"richlander","Number":"118","RawContent":null,"Title":".NET Core master branches have switched to \"5.0\"","State":"open","Body":"# .NET Core master branches have switched to \"5.0\"\r\n\r\nVarious .NET Core repos have switched their `master` branches to \"5.0\", and will use 3.x branches for 3.0 and 3.1 projects.

Please consider that to be an open invitation!\r\n\r\nNotably, [dotnet/core-sdk](https://github.com/dotnet/core-sdk) is not yet producing 5.0 builds. We expect that the dotnet/core-sdk master branch will continue as a 3.0 branch for 2-3 months while we finish up the .NET Core 3.0 project.\r\n\r\nAt present, there is no developer experience for 5.0.

These files, along with the top level [releases-index.json](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dotnet/core/master/release-notes/releases-index.json), are becoming increasingly important .NET Core release assets. These files, one for each major.minor channel, are relied upon by many to detect when updates for .NET Core are available, discover security update details and other uses.\r\n\r\nChanges are sometimes necessary, and the growing dependencies require that we treat compatibility of the schema with the utmost care. This announcement describes an addition to the releases.json schema.\r\n\r\n## SDK Versions and Visual Studio\r\n\r\nBecause of current .NET Core SDK product construction dependencies, there is a hard link between the Runtime, SDK, toolset (compilers, MSBuild, NuGet, and other components), and Visual Studio. Simplistically, this means that when anything updates, everything updates. The unfortunate result of this linking is that multiple versions of the SDK are released with each monthly update for each supported versions of Visual Studio. For example, the May Update for .NET Core 2.2 included the 2.2.5 runtime, 2.2.107 SDK for Visual Studio 2017 and 2.2.204 for Visual Studio 2019 and yet another pair of SDK versions for .NET Core 2.1. An example of this is the [2.2.5 Release Notes](https://github.com/dotnet/core/blob/master/release-notes/2.2/2.2.5/2.2.5.md). \r\n\r\nThis is a confusing situation and we are working to mitigate the need to release multiple SDKs with .NET Core 3.0. The need for multiple SDK versions will persist for 2.1 LTS.\r\n\r\n## Adding the SDKS array\r\n\r\nTo appropriately model multiple SDKs per release, we are adding an SDKs array to releases.json, which will contain SDK objects. The top-level SDK object will represent the highest versioned SDK for a given update. Using the previous 2.2.5 update example, SDK 2.2.204 is in the top SDK object as well as duplicated in the SDKS array. All other applicable 2.2* SDK objects are included in the SDKS array. The SDK objects within the array will carry specific Visual Studio compatibility and version inclusion information to provide appropriate context.\r\n\r\nHere is an example of the new array based on the upcoming July update.\r\nAgain, this will be additive and the previous SDK object will include the highest SDK version for the release.\r\n\r\n```json\r\n{\r\n    \"sdk\": {\r\n        \"version\": \"2.2.301\",\r\n        \"version-display\": \"2.2.301\",\r\n        \"runtime-version\": \"2.2.6\",\r\n        \"vs-version\": \"16.1.3\",\r\n        \"vs-support\": \"Visual Studio 2019 (v16.1)\",\r\n        \"csharp-version\": \"7.3\",\r\n        \"fsharp-version\": \"4.5\",\r\n        \"vb-version\": null,\r\n        \"files\": []\r\n    },\r\n    \"sdks\": [\r\n        {\r\n            \"version\": \"2.2.301\",\r\n            \"version-display\": \"2.2.301\",\r\n            \"runtime-version\": \"2.2.6\",\r\n            \"vs-version\": \"16.1.3\",\r\n            \"vs-support\": \"Visual Studio 2019 (v16.1)\",\r\n            \"csharp-version\": \"7.3\",\r\n            \"fsharp-version\": \"4.5\",\r\n            \"vb-version\": null,\r\n            \"files\": []\r\n        },\r\n        {\r\n          \"version\": \"2.2.205\",\r\n          \"version-display\": \"2.2.205\",\r\n          \"runtime-version\": \"2.2.6\",\r\n          \"vs-version\": \"16.0.5\",\r\n          \"vs-support\": \"Visual Studio 2019 (v16.0)\",\r\n          \"csharp-version\": \"7.3\",\r\n          \"fsharp-version\": \"4.5\",\r\n          \"vb-version\": null,\r\n          \"files\": []\r\n        }\r\n    ]\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\n## vs-version and the Runtime\r\n\r\nThe same version of the runtime is included in multiple versions of Visual Studio. To account for this, the vs-version field is being updated to a comma-delimited string. The string will represent all versions of Visual Studio which first include the particular .NET Core update. Again, an example from the upcoming July Update.\r\n\r\n```json\r\n\"runtime\": {\r\n        \"version\": \"2.2.6\",\r\n        \"version-display\": \"2.2.6\",\r\n        \"vs-version\": \"15.9.13, 16.1.3, 16.2.0\",\r\n```\r\n\r\nThe same `vs-versions` changes will be seen in the `aspnetcore-runtime` object.\r\n\r\n## Future Enhancements\r\n\r\nThere are other improvements to the schema which have been suggested by the community which we are evaluating. Generally, theses enhancements are additive and should not represent compatibility compromises for existing parsers and similar announcements will be published ahead of any changes.\r\n\r\n","Url":"https://github.com/dotnet/announcements/issues/116","RelatedDescription":"Open issue \"Updates to releases.json (.NET Core release metadata)\" (#116)"},{"Id":"444065225","IsPullRequest":false,"CreatedAt":"2019-05-14T18:38:23","Actor":"TaraOverfield","Number":"114","RawContent":null,"Title":"May 2019 .NET Updates","State":"open","Body":"# May 2019 .NET Updates\r\n\r\nThe following .NET updates were released in May 2019.
