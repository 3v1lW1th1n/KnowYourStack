That results in a couple issues:\r\n\r\n* for Pipes with the same `name` and present in `declarations` and in an imported module, Pipe from imported module was selected. In View Engine the logic is opposite: Pipes from `declarations` field receive higher priority.\r\n* for Directives with the same selector and present in `declarations` and in an imported module, we first invoked the logic of a Directive from `declarations` field and after that - imported Directive logic. In View Engine, it was the opposite and the logic of a Directive from the `declarations` field was invoked last.\r\n\r\nIn order to align Ivy and View Engine behavior, this commit updates the logic in which we populate module scope: we first process all imports and after that handle `declarations` field. As a result, in Ivy both use-cases listed above work similar to View Engine.\r\n\r\nResolves #35502.\r\n\r\n\r\n## PR Type\r\nWhat kind of change does this PR introduce?\r\n\r\n- [x] Bugfix\r\n\r\n\r\n## Does this PR introduce a breaking change?\r\n\r\n- [ ] Yes\r\n- [x] No","Url":"https://github.com/angular/angular/pull/35850","RelatedDescription":"Open PR \"fix(compiler): process `imports` first and `declarations` second while calculating scopes\" (#35850)"},{"Id":"575079080","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2020-03-04T01:47:26","Actor":"JiaLiPassion","Number":"35849","RawContent":null,"Title":"docs(zone.js): update coments of zone configuration API definition","State":"open","Body":"## PR Checklist\r\nPlease check if your PR fulfills the following requirements:\r\n\r\n- [x] The commit message follows our guidelines: https://github.com/angular/angular/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md#commit\r\n- [ ] Tests for the changes have been added (for bug fixes / features)\r\n- [ ] Docs have been added / updated (for bug fixes / features)\r\n\r\n\r\n## PR Type\r\nWhat kind of change does this PR introduce?\r\n\r\n<!-- Please check the one that applies to this PR using \"x\". -->\r\n\r\n- [ ] Bugfix\r\n- [ ] Feature\r\n- [ ] Code style update (formatting, local variables)\r\n- [ ] Refactoring (no functional changes, no api changes)\r\n- [ ] Build related changes\r\n- [ ] CI related changes\r\n- [x] Documentation content changes\r\n- [ ] angular.io application / infrastructure changes\r\n- [ ] Other...

This is a subtle effect of the build infrastructure,\r\nbut it boils down to a TsickleHost method `shouldSkipTsickleProcessing`.\r\n\r\nFor ngc_wrapped builds (Bazel + Angular), this method is defined in the\r\n`@bazel/typescript` (aka bazel rules_typescript) implementation of\r\n`CompilerHost`. The default behavior is to skip tsickle processing for files\r\nwhich are not present in the original `srcs[]` of the build rule. In\r\nAngular's case, this includes all generated shim files.\r\n\r\nFor View Engine factories this is probably desirable as they're quite\r\ncomplex and they've never been tested with tsickle. Ivy factories however\r\nare smaller and very straightforward, and it makes sense to treat them like\r\nany other output.\r\n\r\nThis commit adjusts two independent implementations of\r\n`shouldSkipTsickleProcessing` to enable transformation of Ivy shims:\r\n\r\n* in `@angular/bazel` aka ngc_wrapped, the upstream `@bazel/typescript`\r\n  `CompilerHost` is patched to treat .ngfactory files the same as their\r\n  original source file, with respect to tsickle processing.\r\n\r\n  It is currently not possible to test this change as we don't have any test\r\n  that inspects tsickle output with bazel. It will be extensively tested in\r\n  g3.\r\n\r\n* in `ngc`, Angular's own implementation is adjusted to allow for the\r\n  processing of shims when compiling with Ivy. This enables a unit test to\r\n  be written to validate the correct behavior of tsickle when given a host\r\n  that's appropriately configured to process factory shims.\r\n\r\nFor ngtsc-as-a-plugin, a similar fix will need to be submitted upstream in\r\ntsc_wrapped.\r\n","Url":"https://github.com/angular/angular/pull/35848","RelatedDescription":"Open PR \"feat(bazel): transform generated shims (in Ivy) with tsickle\" (#35848)"},{"Id":"574896032","IsPullRequest":false,"CreatedAt":"2020-03-04T00:11:00","Actor":"tonivj5","Number":"35838","RawContent":null,"Title":"Maybe there's an inconsistent with style.width binding","State":"closed","Body":"<!--üîÖüîÖüîÖüîÖüîÖüîÖüîÖüîÖüîÖüîÖüîÖüîÖüîÖüîÖüîÖüîÖüîÖüîÖüîÖüîÖüîÖüîÖüîÖüîÖüîÖüîÖüîÖüîÖüîÖüîÖüîÖ\r\n\r\nOh hi there! üòÑ\r\n\r\nTo expedite issue processing please search open and closed issues before submitting a new one.\r\nExisting issues often contain information about workarounds, resolution, or progress updates.\r\n\r\nüîÖüîÖüîÖüîÖüîÖüîÖüîÖüîÖüîÖüîÖüîÖüîÖüîÖüîÖüîÖüîÖüîÖüîÖüîÖüîÖüîÖüîÖüîÖüîÖüîÖüîÖüîÖüîÖüîÖüîÖüîÖüîÖüîÖ-->\r\n\r\n\r\n# üêû bug report\r\n\r\n### Affected Package\r\n<!-- Can you pin-point one or more @angular/* packages as the source of the bug? -->\r\n<!-- ‚úçÔ∏èedit: --> The issue is caused by package @angular/core (?)\r\n\r\n\r\n### Is this a regression?\r\nI don't know\r\n<!-- Did this behavior use to work in the previous version? -->\r\n\r\n\r\n### Description\r\n\r\nI think there is an inconsistency with style bindings in properties such as height, width, etc. with number values.

When using these angular elements (web-components) in any other application everything works fine. So now we started migrating our application towards a new workspace where we could integrate these feature libraries and while doing so we are lazy loading the modules to improve performance.\r\n\r\nSo basically its not possible to lazy load any libraries/packages from your node_modules, therefor you have to create a small wrapper module. So we did that and use a component to render our feature. The strange thing is, if we render our angular element (web-component) everything works perfect, angular doesnt try to do smart things and the providers are available including our config. But as soon as we start to render the angular component variant, it throws error about providers that are missing.\r\n\r\nWe define our providers inside of our feature module with the providers array syntax. We are aware of the `@Injectable({ providedIn })` options, but none of these work for us.\r\n\r\n## üî¨ Minimal Reproduction\r\n<!--\r\nPlease create and share minimal reproduction of the issue starting with this template: https://stackblitz.com/fork/angular-issue-repro2\r\n-->\r\n<!-- ‚úçÔ∏è--> Because of the size i can not include any example of the current setup but i could try to make a small repro ASAP.

a large application with some angular modules that are manually loaded with `moduleFactory.create()`.\r\nAll the modules works as intended, except for the child routes configurations: all the child routes specified in the lazy loaded modules are not loaded by the router and does not work.\r\n\r\nAll the child routes are specified via \r\n```\r\nRouterModule.forChild([{\r\n     //routes\r\n}]),\r\n```\r\nso for example \r\n```\r\n@NgModule({\r\n    declarations: [\r\n      LazyComponent\r\n    ],\r\n    imports: [\r\n        CommonModule,\r\n

   constructor() { }\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nThe lazy module are manually loaded this way:\r\n```\r\nimport { Compiler, Injectable, Injector, NgModuleFactory } from '@angular/core';\r\n\r\n@Injectable()\r\nexport class ModuleLoaderService {\r\n    constructor(private compiler: Compiler, private injector: Injector) {}\r\n\r\n    loadModule() {\r\n        const lazyModuleInjector = Injector.create({\r\n            providers: [],\r\n            parent: this.injector,\r\n            name: 'lazyModule'\r\n        });\r\n        return import('./lazy/lazy.module')\r\n            .then(\r\n                m => m.default,\r\n                () => {}\r\n            )\r\n            .then(elementModuleOrFactory => {\r\n                try {\r\n                    return this.compiler.compileModuleAsync(elementModuleOrFactory);\r\n                } catch (err) {}\r\n            })\r\n            .then(moduleFactory => {\r\n                try {\r\n                    const elementModuleRef = moduleFactory.create(lazyModuleInjector);\r\n                    return Promise.resolve(elementModuleRef.instance);\r\n                } catch (err) {\r\n                    console.log(err);\r\n                }\r\n            });\r\n    }\r\n}\r\n```\r\n(the code is based on this guide https://juristr.com/blog/2019/10/lazyload-module-ivy-viewengine/)\r\n\r\nBased on this code, the issue is that i can't navigate to `/lazy`, so for example \r\n`this.router.navigate(['lazy'])` will throw an ` Error: Cannot match any routes` exception.\r\n\r\nWhat i am doing wrong?\r\n## üî¨ Minimal Reproduction\r\nhttps://stackblitz.com/edit/angular-nhh9eg\r\nSimply click on the buttons for

I was using v8.0.6 and was updating to latest v8 on my way to v9 (soon).\r\n\r\n\r\n### Description\r\n\r\n<!-- ‚úçÔ∏è--> A clear and concise description of the problem...\r\nIn the latest version of ng 8 the emitted files from the webpack build are handled differently by `ng build` than by `ng serve`. This was not the case in 8.0.6. (I have not tested this in ng 9 nor have I tested `ng test`). \r\n\r\nThis is due to this code being removed from `@angular-devkit/build-webpack/src/utils.js`:\r\n```javascript\r\n// entrypoints might have multiple outputs\r\n// such as runtime.js\r\nfor (const [name, entrypoint] of compilation.entrypoints) {\r\n    const entryFiles = (entrypoint && entrypoint.getFiles()) || [];\r\n    for (const file of entryFiles) {\r\n        files.push({ name, file, extension: path.extname(file), initial: true });\r\n    }\r\n}\r\n```\r\ncommit: https://github.com/angular/angular-cli/commit/e2b190584b0f18a53e00f7f58facd7be3a4c282a#diff-4e79ab2e1e76b5c5a42a38b4f3b50036\r\n\r\nThe `getEmittedFiles` method is how `ng build` determines the emitted files. In 8.0.6 it used to traverse the compilations entry points and then the chunks. Now in 8.3.25 it just traverses the chunks. `ng serve`, however, still traverses the endpoints:\r\n`@angular-devkit/build-angular/src/angular-cli-files/plugins/index-html-webpack-plugin.js`\r\n```javascript\r\nfor (const [entryName, entrypoint] of compilation.entrypoints) {\r\n  const entryFiles = ((entrypoint && entrypoint.getFiles()) || []).map((f) => ({\r\n    name: entryName,\r\n    file: f,\r\n    extension: path.extname(f),\r\n  }));\r\n  //...\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nThe outcome of this issue is that additional outputs of the `main` entrypoint are no longer added to the index.html when running `ng build` but they are included when I run `ng serve` which created false positives. (and lead to some really fun \"works on my box\" discussions with the quality engineer)\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n## üî¨ Minimal Reproduction\r\n<!--\r\nSimple steps to reproduce this bug.\r\n\r\nPlease include: commands run (including args), packages added, related code changes.\r\n\r\nIf reproduction steps are not enough for reproduction of your issue, please create a minimal GitHub repository with the reproduction of the issue. \r\nA good way to make a minimal reproduction is to create a new app via `ng new repro-app` and add the minimum possible code to show the problem. \r\nShare the link to the repo below along with step-by-step instructions to reproduce the problem, as well as expected and actual behavior.\r\n\r\nIssues that don't have enough info and can't be reproduced will be closed.\r\n\r\nYou can read more about issue submission guidelines here: https://github.com/angular/angular-cli/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md#-submitting-an-issue\r\n-->\r\nThis is where it gets messy and I admit that I'm using a build extension. I'm adding to the webpack config through an `ngx-build-plus` plugin. Utilizing the plugin I add the following merge to the webpack config:\r\n\r\n```javascript\r\nconst merge = require(\"webpack-merge\");\r\n\r\nexports.default = {\r\n  pre(options) {\r\n    // ...\r\n  },\r\n  config(config) {\r\n    const mergeStrategy = merge.strategy({\r\n      // ...,\r\n      \"config.optimization.splitChunks.cacheGroups\": \"append\",\r\n    });\r\n\r\n    return mergeStrategy(config, {\r\n      optimization: {\r\n        splitChunks: {\r\n          cacheGroups: {\r\n            angularJS: {\r\n              name: \"angularJS\",\r\n              chunks: \"initial\",\r\n              test: /[\\\\/]node_modules[\\\\/](angular-?|ng-)/,\r\n              priority: 5,\r\n            },\r\n            angular: {\r\n              name: \"angular\",\r\n              chunks: \"initial\",\r\n              test: /[\\\\/]node_modules[\\\\/](@angular)[\\\\/]/,\r\n              priority: 5,\r\n            },\r\n          },\r\n        },\r\n      },\r\n    });\r\n  },\r\n  post(options) {\r\n    // ... \r\n  },\r\n};\r\n```\r\nThis creates 2 new bundles `angular.[hash:20].js` and `angularJS.[hash:20].js` (did I mention it's a hybrid app?) which are initial bundles which are output by the `main` entrypoint. When I run `ng serve` they are included in the index.html because they are attached to the `main` endpoint. When I run `ng build`, they are not included in the `index.html`.\r\n\r\nWith `ngx-build-plus` installed and assuming the above plugin is in a file called `config/webpack-loaders/ajs-plugin.js` run the build:\r\n`ng build --plugin ~config/webpack-loaders/ajs-plugin.js` or\r\n`ng serve --plugin ~config/webpack-loaders/ajs-plugin.js -o`\r\n\r\nI know that what I need to do is use the post step to enforce the cachegroups get added the way I expect, but I wanted to call out the inconsistency between the commands.\r\n\r\n## üåç Your Environment\r\n<pre><code>\r\n<!-- run `ng version` and paste output below -->\r\n<!-- ‚úçÔ∏è-->\r\n// OLD VERSION\r\nAngular CLI: 8.0.6\r\nNode: 12.16.1\r\nOS: win32 x64\r\nAngular: 8.2.14\r\n... animations, common, compiler, compiler-cli, core, forms\r\n... language-service, platform-browser, platform-browser-dynamic\r\n... router, upgrade\r\n\r\nPackage                           Version\r\n-----------------------------------------------------------\r\n@angular-devkit/architect         0.800.6\r\n@angular-devkit/build-angular     0.800.6\r\n@angular-devkit/build-optimizer   0.800.6\r\n@angular-devkit/build-webpack     0.800.6\r\n@angular-devkit/core              8.0.0\r\n@angular-devkit/schematics        8.0.0\r\n@angular/cli                      8.0.6\r\n@ngtools/webpack                  8.0.6\r\n@schematics/angular               8.0.0\r\n@schematics/update                0.800.6\r\nrxjs                              6.4.0\r\ntypescript                        3.4.5\r\nwebpack                           4.30.0\r\n\r\n\r\n// NEW VERSION\r\nAngular CLI: 8.3.25\r\nNode: 12.16.1\r\nOS: win32 x64\r\nAngular: 8.2.14\r\n... animations, common, compiler, compiler-cli, core, forms\r\n... language-service, platform-browser, platform-browser-dynamic\r\n... router, upgrade\r\n\r\nPackage                           Version\r\n-----------------------------------------------------------\r\n@angular-devkit/architect         0.803.25\r\n@angular-devkit/build-angular     0.803.25\r\n@angular-devkit/build-optimizer   0.803.25\r\n@angular-devkit/build-webpack     0.803.25\r\n@angular-devkit/core              8.0.0\r\n@angular-devkit/schematics        8.0.0\r\n@angular/cli                      8.3.25\r\n@ngtools/webpack                  8.3.25\r\n@schematics/angular               8.0.0\r\n@schematics/update                0.803.25\r\nrxjs                              6.4.0\r\ntypescript                        3.5.3\r\nwebpack                           4.39.2\r\n</code></pre>\r\n\r\nAngular json build options:\r\n```json\r\n\"architect\": {\r\n  \"build\": {\r\n    \"builder\": \"ngx-build-plus:browser\",\r\n    \"options\": {\r\n      \"outputPath\": \"dist/website\",\r\n      \"index\": \"config/templates/index.html\",\r\n      \"main\": \"src/main.ts\",\r\n      \"polyfills\": \"src/polyfills.ts\",\r\n      \"tsConfig\": \"tsconfig.app.json\",\r\n      \"aot\": false,\r\n      \"showCircularDependencies\": false,\r\n      \"assets\": [\r\n        \"src/assets\",\r\n      ],\r\n      \"styles\": [\r\n        \"src/styles.scss\"\r\n      ],\r\n    },\r\n  },\r\n  \"configurations\": {\r\n    \"production\": {\r\n      \"fileReplacements\": [{\r\n        \"replace\": \"src/environments/environment.ts\",\r\n        \"with\": \"src/environments/environment.prod.ts\"\r\n      }],\r\n      \"optimization\": true,\r\n      \"outputHashing\": \"all\",\r\n      \"sourceMap\": false,\r\n      \"extractCss\": true,\r\n      \"namedChunks\": false,\r\n      \"aot\": true,\r\n      \"extractLicenses\": true,\r\n      \"vendorChunk\": true,\r\n      \"forkTypeChecker\": true,\r\n      \"buildOptimizer\": true,\r\n      \"budgets\": []\r\n    },\r\n  },\r\n  \"serve\": {\r\n    \"builder\": \"ngx-build-plus:dev-server\",\r\n    \"options\": {\r\n      \"browserTarget\": \"website:build\"\r\n    },\r\n    \"configurations\": {\r\n      \"production\": {\r\n        \"browserTarget\": \"website:build:production\"\r\n      },\r\n      \"staging\": {\r\n        \"browserTarget\": \"website:build:staging\"\r\n      }\r\n    }\r\n  },\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\n\r\n**Anything else relevant?**\r\n<!-- ‚úçÔ∏èIs this a browser specific issue?

This is because the name is set as the name of the entrypoint the `emittedFile` was found in.\r\n\r\nWhen running `ng build` the same files are built (according to `webpack-bundle-analyzer`) but the `files` array looks like this:\r\n```javascript\r\n[\r\n  { file: 'runtime.bc9d7222a5be40bb49f2.js', extension: '.js', name: 'runtime' },\r\n  { file: 'angularJS.bd8c6b36a4d831de98ad.js', extension: '.js', name: 'angularJS~main' },\r\n  { file: 'angular.2378ac52c8e97a70ffb9.js', extension: '.js', name: 'angular~main' },\r\n  { file: 'main.776ae6e317ff60328da0.js', extension: '.js', name: 'main' },\r\n  { file: 'polyfills.83265812522305ef22ce.js', extension: '.js', name: 'polyfills' },\r\n  { file: 'styles.2cdb9ded7df542f838e1.css', extension: '.css', name: 'styles' },\r\n  { file: 'vendor.7dc8e0ec3a85cc2dc3fc.js', extension: '.js', name: 'vendor' }\r\n]\r\n```\r\nNote that the name of these `emittedFiles` are the chunk name and not the entrypoint. These arrays of `emittedFile`s are then compared to the array of entrypoints to determine which ones are to be added to `index.html`:\r\n```javascript\r\n[\r\n  'polyfills-nomodule-es5',\r\n  'polyfills-es5',\r\n  'polyfills',\r\n  'styles',\r\n  'vendor',\r\n  'main'\r\n]\r\n```\r\nSo `ng serve` recognizes the angular bundles are part of the main entrypoint and adds them to \r\n`index.html` accordingly. `ng build` on the other hand doesn't because the chunk names are not the same as an entrypoint in the hardcoded list of entrypoints.\r\n\r\nIn conclusion:\r\n1) I need to make my use of the build extension more robust and ensure the `cachegroup` bundles are added to the `index.html` in the plugin's `post` step.\r\n2) I don't think `ng serve` and `ng build` should be different in how they map the emitted files.\r\n3) I am very open to hearing the \"right way\" of doing things if there is a better/more accepted approach for handling large, eagerly loaded 3rd party bundles.","Url":"https://github.com/angular/angular-cli/issues/17146","RelatedDescription":"Open issue \"ng build and ng serve use inconsistent methods to determine files emitted from webpack\" (#17146)"},{"Id":"574440692","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2020-03-03T21:37:37","Actor":"renovate[bot]","Number":"17137","RawContent":null,"Title":"build: update typescript to version 3.8.3","State":"closed","Body":"This PR contains the following updates:\n\n| Package | Type | Update | Change |\n|---|---|---|---|\n| [typescript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/) ([source](https://togithub.com/Microsoft/TypeScript)) | devDependencies | patch | [`3.8.2` -> `3.8.3`](https://renovatebot.com/diffs/npm/typescript/3.8.2/3.8.3) |\n| [typescript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/) ([source](https://togithub.com/Microsoft/TypeScript)) | dependencies | patch | [`3.8.2` -> `3.8.3`](https://renovatebot.com/diffs/npm/typescript/3.8.2/3.8.3) |\n\n---\n\n### Release Notes\n\n<details>\n<summary>Microsoft/TypeScript</summary>\n\n### [`v3.8.3`](https://togithub.com/Microsoft/TypeScript/releases/v3.8.3)\n\n[Compare Source](https://togithub.com/Microsoft/TypeScript/compare/v3.8.2...v3.8.3)\n\nFor release notes, check out the [release announcement](https://devblogs.microsoft.com/typescript/announcing-typescript-3-8/).\n\nFor new features, check out the [What's new in TypeScript v3.8](https://www.typescriptlang.org/docs/handbook/release-notes/typescript-3-8.html).\n\nFor the complete list of fixed issues, check out the\n\n-   [fixed issues query for Typescript v3.8.0 (Beta)](https://togithub.com/Microsoft/TypeScript/issues?utf8=%E2%9C%93&q=is%3Aissue+milestone%3A%22TypeScript+3.8.0%22+is%3Aclosed+).\n-   [fixed issues query for Typescript v3.8.1 (RC)](https://togithub.com/Microsoft/TypeScript/issues?utf8=%E2%9C%93&q=is%3Aissue+milestone%3A%22TypeScript+3.8.1%22+is%3Aclosed+).\n-   [fixed issues query for Typescript v3.8.2 (Final)](https://togithub.com/Microsoft/TypeScript/issues?utf8=%E2%9C%93&q=is%3Aissue+milestone%3A%22TypeScript+3.8.2%22+is%3Aclosed+).\n-   [fixed issues query for Typescript v3.8.3](https://togithub.com/Microsoft/TypeScript/issues?utf8=%E2%9C%93&q=is%3Aissue+milestone%3A%22TypeScript+3.8.3%22+is%3Aclosed+).\n\nDownloads are available on:\n\n-   [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/package/typescript)\n-   [Visual Studio](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=TypeScriptTeam.TypeScript-383) ([Select new version in project options](https://togithub.com/Microsoft/TypeScript/wiki/Updating-TypeScript-in-Visual-Studio-2017))\n-   [NuGet package](https://www.nuget.org/packages/Microsoft.TypeScript.MSBuild)\n\n</details>\n\n---\n\n### Renovate configuration\n\n:date: **Schedule**: \"after 10pm every weekday,before 4am every weekday,every weekend\" in timezone America/Tijuana.\n\n:vertical_traffic_light: **Automerge**: Disabled by config.

Unfortunately, there is a response size limit of 1Mb between ALB and Lambda. (https://docs.aws.amazon.com/elasticloadbalancing/latest/application/lambda-functions.html). Except for a trivial app, all my apps include at least one JS file that are larger than 1Mb. Sometimes it's `main-...js` files or it's `vendor-...js` files depending on the `--vendor-chunk`.\r\n\r\nThis is somewhat related to https://github.com/angular/angular-cli/issues/16866, but this is a request independent of any other problems. (I'm currently using cli v9.0.4, and enableIvy:false setting doesn't make much difference.) I never knew there was 1Mb limit when I started building for ALB+Lambda, and there will be many situations (currently unknown) that would prevent successful deployment of Angular apps in many different production environments.\r\n\r\nAt this point, there seems to be no workaround.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Describe the solution you'd like\r\n\r\nSomething like `--max-js-size = 516k` will be nice to control the maximum size of the generated JS files. Instead of generating 1 main or 1 vendor files, they should be divided into multiple files, each no bigger than 516k, for instance.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Describe alternatives you've considered\r\n\r\nOr, alternatively, if we can control the number of generated JS files, that'll be useful as well. For example, `--main-js-files=3` will divide the main js files into 3 files instead of one.\r\n\r\n","Url":"https://github.com/angular/angular-cli/issues/17135","RelatedDescription":"Open issue \"Need a way to build smaller javascript files / to set maximum size for generated js files\" (#17135)"},{"Id":"573201291","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2020-03-02T20:14:11","Actor":"renovate[bot]","Number":"17122","RawContent":null,"Title":"build: update bazel_toolchains to version 2.1.1","State":"closed","Body":"This PR contains the following updates:\n\n| Package | Type | Update | Change |\n|---|---|---|---|\n| [bazel_toolchains](https://togithub.com/bazelbuild/bazel-toolchains) | http_archive | patch | `2.1.0` -> `2.1.1` |\n\n---\n\n### Release Notes\n\n<details>\n<summary>bazelbuild/bazel-toolchains</summary>\n\n### [`v2.1.1`](https://togithub.com/bazelbuild/bazel-toolchains/releases/2.1.1)\n\n[Compare Source](https://togithub.com/bazelbuild/bazel-toolchains/compare/2.1.0...2.1.1)\n\nSHA256:b5a8039df7119d618402472f3adff8a1bd0ae9d5e253f53fcc4c47122e91a3d2\n\n</details>\n\n---\n\n### Renovate configuration\n\n:date: **Schedule**: \"after 10pm every weekday,before 4am every weekday,every weekend\" in timezone America/Tijuana.\n\n:vertical_traffic_light: **Automerge**: Disabled by config.

When another developer pulls that change, package.json is updated but node_modules is not. To fix this, the second developer should run `npm install` but this is often forgotten. This can lead to unexpected behavior when using `ng test` or `ng serve` - sometimes the error is quickly identified but sometimes it 'kind of works' and the second developer loses a lot of time tracking it down. \r\n\r\n### Describe the solution you'd like\r\nWhen executing a ng command (in particular the ones marked above), ng should check if package.json matches node_modules. If not, it should output a clear warning, or fail the command.\r\n\r\n### Describe alternatives you've considered\r\nAn alternative could be setting up an alias for ng that does the above check, but it would be much more user friendly if this was built in.","Url":"https://github.com/angular/angular-cli/issues/17132","RelatedDescription":"Open issue \"ng commands should warn (or fail) on package.json and node_modules mismatch\" (#17132)"},{"Id":"573928163","IsPullRequest":false,"CreatedAt":"2020-03-02T12:02:57","Actor":"richtems","Number":"17131","RawContent":null,"Title":"Empty source map with localization and --watch","State":"open","Body":"<!--üîÖüîÖüîÖüîÖüîÖüîÖüîÖüîÖüîÖüîÖüîÖüîÖüîÖüîÖüîÖüîÖüîÖüîÖüîÖüîÖüîÖüîÖüîÖüîÖüîÖüîÖüîÖüîÖüîÖüîÖüîÖ\r\n\r\nOh hi there! üòÑ\r\n\r\nTo expedite issue processing please search open and closed issues before submitting a new one.\r\nExisting issues often contain information about workarounds, resolution, or progress updates.\r\n\r\nüîÖüîÖüîÖüîÖüîÖüîÖüîÖüîÖüîÖüîÖüîÖüîÖüîÖüîÖüîÖüîÖüîÖüîÖüîÖüîÖüîÖüîÖüîÖüîÖüîÖüîÖüîÖüîÖüîÖüîÖüîÖüîÖüîÖ-->\r\n\r\n\r\n# üêû Bug report\r\n\r\n### Command (mark with an `x`)\r\n<!-- Can you pin-point the command or commands that are effected by this bug? -->\r\n<!-- ‚úçÔ∏èedit: -->\r\n\r\n- [ ] new\r\n- [x] build\r\n- [ ] serve\r\n- [ ] test\r\n- [ ] e2e\r\n- [ ] generate\r\n- [ ] add\r\n- [ ] update\r\n- [ ] lint\r\n- [ ] xi18n\r\n- [ ] run\r\n- [ ] config\r\n- [ ] help\r\n- [ ] version\r\n- [ ] doc\r\n\r\n\r\n### Is this a regression?\r\n\r\n<!-- Did this behavior use to work in the previous version? -->\r\n<!-- ‚úçÔ∏è--> Yes, the previous version in which this bug was not present was: 8.2.2\r\n\r\n\r\n### Description\r\n\r\n<!-- ‚úçÔ∏è--> When using @angular/localization and building with --watch, the main.js source map is empty.\r\n\r\n\r\n## üî¨ Minimal Reproduction\r\n<!--Please include: commands run (including args), packages added, related code changes.\r\n\r\nIf reproduction steps are not enough for reproduction of your issue, please create a minimal GitHub repository with the reproduction of the issue. \r\nA good way to make a minimal reproduction is to create a new app via `ng new repro-app` and add the minimum possible code to show the problem. \r\nShare the link to the repo below along with step-by-step instructions to reproduce the problem, as well as expected and actual behavior.\r\n\r\nIssues that don't have enough info and can't be reproduced will be closed.\r\n\r\nYou can read more about issue submission guidelines here: https://github.com/angular/angular-cli/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md#-submitting-an-issue\r\n-->\r\n```\r\nng new TestApp\r\ncd .\\TestApp\\\r\nng add @angular/localize\r\n```\r\n\r\nAdd i18n to project in angular.json:\r\n\r\n<pre><code>\r\n\"projects\": {\r\n  ...\r\n  \"TestApp\": {\r\n    ...\r\n    <i><b>\"i18n\": {\r\n      \"sourceLocale\": \"en-US\",\r\n      \"locales\": {\r\n        \"fr\": \"src/locale/messages.fr.xlf\"\r\n      }\r\n    }</b></i>\r\n    ...\r\n    \"architect\": {\r\n      \"build\": {\r\n          ...\r\n          \"options\": {\r\n            ...\r\n            <i><b>\"localize\": [\"fr\"],</b></i>\r\n\r\n</code></pre>\r\n\r\n`ng xi18n`\r\ncopy messages.xlf to \"src/locale/messages.fr.xlf\"\r\n`ng build --watch`\r\n\r\nNow the content of dist/TestApp/fr/main.js.map is:\r\n`{}`\r\n\r\n## üåç Your Environment\r\n<pre><code>\r\n<!-- run `ng version` and paste output below -->\r\n<!-- ‚úçÔ∏è-->\r\nAngular CLI: 9.0.4\r\nNode: 10.15.1\r\nOS: win32 x64\r\n\r\nAngular: 9.0.4\r\n... animations, cli, common, compiler, compiler-cli, core, forms\r\n... language-service, localize, platform-browser\r\n... platform-browser-dynamic, router\r\nIvy Workspace: Yes\r\n\r\nPackage                           Version\r\n-----------------------------------------------------------\r\n@angular-devkit/architect         0.900.4\r\n@angular-devkit/build-angular     0.900.4\r\n@angular-devkit/build-optimizer   0.900.4\r\n@angular-devkit/build-webpack     0.900.4\r\n@angular-devkit/core              9.0.4\r\n@angular-devkit/schematics        9.0.4\r\n@ngtools/webpack                  9.0.4\r\n@schematics/angular               9.0.4\r\n@schematics/update                0.900.4\r\nrxjs                              6.5.4\r\ntypescript                        3.7.5\r\nwebpack                           4.41.2\r\n</code></pre>\r\n\r\n**Anything else relevant?**\r\n<!-- ‚úçÔ∏èIs this a browser specific issue?

When I build for production, the React.createElement calls remain as React.createElement instead of being compiled to the proper webpack import name.\r\n\r\nIf I add ANY explicit reference to React in any file, for example `console.log(React.version);`, the production build starts working again.\r\n\r\nI suspect what is happening is a pass to strip out unused code is happening before .tsx files are processed by TypeScript. And then after the code is compiled down to JS webpack then compiles everything together but React is already gone so the React references are left intact.\r\n\r\nIf so the best fix I can think of is to split up the TypeScript compilation process to first convert .TSX to temporary .TS files (if possible), run the stripping process on those and not the original .TSX, then complete the build process as normal with the .TS files.\r\n\r\nSimpler solutions might include hard coding React to never be stripped out if there are .tsx files present in the project.\r\n\r\n## üî¨ Minimal Reproduction\r\nUnfortunately, I don't have the needed skill set currently to create a minimal test case from scratch (no experience in React) and I am not authorized to share code from my project publicly.

Create an angular app. Use BreakpointObserver to dynamically adjust layouts based on the window size.\r\n2. Enable Angular SSR.\r\n3. Load an app and observe that the initial server-loaded layout is different from the client-based layout.\r\n \r\n \r\n#### Expected Behavior\r\n\r\nIt'll be great if the server-side rendering and client-side rendering use the same layout.\r\n\r\n#### Actual Behavior\r\n\r\nServer-side rendered page layout is completely different from the client-side layout. I'm not sure if there will be any solution for this. But, unfortunately, the current implementation essentially makes server side rendering incompatible with BreakpointObserver. That is, if you wanna use SSR, you cannot use BreakpointObserver. Or, if you use BreakpointObserver, you cannot really use SSR (because of the abrupt layout change during the page load).\r\n\r\n\r\n#### Environment\r\n\r\n- Angular: 9.0.4\r\n- CDK/Material: 9.1.0\r\n- Browser(s): N/A\r\n- Operating System (e.g. Windows, macOS, Ubuntu): N/A\r\n","Url":"https://github.com/angular/components/issues/18680","RelatedDescription":"Closed issue \"Layout issues with CDK BreakpointObserver when used with Angular SSR \" (#18680)"},{"Id":"574513103","IsPullRequest":false,"CreatedAt":"2020-03-04T03:20:33","Actor":"poojadamkondwar","Number":"18686","RawContent":null,"Title":"how to use colspan in angular materiel table","State":"closed","Body":"Below is code which I use:\r\n\r\n<table mat-table [dataSource]=\"dataSource\" class=\"mat-elevation-z8\"\r\n  class=\"table table-bordered table-responsive-md table-striped \">\r\n\r\n  <!-- Position Column -->\r\n  <ng-container matColumnDef=\"position\">\r\n    <th mat-header-cell *matHeaderCellDef> <b>No.</b> </th>\r\n    <td mat-cell *matCellDef=\"let element\" class=\"unselected\"> {{element.position}} </td>\r\n  </ng-container>\r\n\r\n  <!-- Name Column -->\r\n  <ng-container matColumnDef=\"name\">\r\n    <th mat-header-cell *matHeaderCellDef style=\"word-wrap: break-word;\"> Name </th>\r\n    <td mat-cell *matCellDef=\"let element\" contenteditable=\"true\" [textContent]=\"element.name\" (input)=\"element.name=$event.target.textContent\">\r\n      {{element.name}}\r\n      {{element.name}}\r\n      <!-- <p\r\n    \r\n   \r\n    [(ngModel)]=\"element.name\"\r\n    ></p> -->\r\n    </td>\r\n    <!-- <td mat-cell style=\"overflow-wrap: break-word;\" (mousedown)=\"onMouseDown(i, 1, 'name')\" (mouseup)=\"onMouseUp(i, 1, 'name')\" *matCellDef=\"let element; let i = index\"\r\n        [ngClass]=\"{'selected': selectedCellsState[i][1], 'unselected': !selectedCellsState[i][1]}\"> {{element.name}}\r\n    </td> -->\r\n  </ng-container>\r\n\r\n  <!-- Weight Column -->\r\n  <ng-container matColumnDef=\"weight\">\r\n    <th mat-header-cell *matHeaderCellDef> Weight </th>\r\n    <td [attr.colspan]=\"getColspan(i,'weight')\" mat-cell *matCellDef=\"let element; let i = index\" contenteditable=\"true\">{{element.weight}}</td>\r\n  </ng-container>\r\n\r\n  <!-- Symbol Column -->\r\n  <ng-container matColumnDef=\"symbol\">\r\n    <th mat-header-cell *matHeaderCellDef> Symbol </th>\r\n    <td mat-cell *matCellDef=\"let element; let i = index\" contenteditable=\"true\"> {{element.symbol}} </td>\r\n  </ng-container>\r\n\r\n\r\n  <tr mat-header-row *matHeaderRowDef=\"displayedColumns\"></tr>\r\n  <tr mat-row *matRowDef=\"let row; columns: displayedColumns;\"></tr>\r\n</table>","Url":"https://github.com/angular/components/issues/18686","RelatedDescription":"Closed issue \"how to use colspan in angular materiel table\" (#18686)"},{"Id":"575091057","IsPullRequest":false,"CreatedAt":"2020-03-04T02:27:52","Actor":"hfournier","Number":"18701","RawContent":null,"Title":"mat-slide-toggle using incorrect text color in dark-theme","State":"open","Body":"#### Reproduction\r\n\r\nSteps to reproduce:\r\n1.

Checks to perform a sort occur after this code line.\r\n\r\nThis has the potential to cause undesirable behavior when a container is re-entered at a location not near the initial index AND when no sorting occurs.\r\n\r\nLike this:\r\n![GIF](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/23387905/75818602-290db400-5d67-11ea-996a-1e67bd869211.gif)\r\n\r\nNow, I assume this behavior was coded this way to better handle when sorting is disabled, because it makes more sense that the item shouldn't be sorted away from its initial index. But when sorting is **enabled** (like in the gif above) and those stated conditions are met, the item doesn't get placed into the expected index.\r\n\r\nCan the following change be made (checking for `sortingDisabled`)?\r\n```ts\r\nthis._dropContainer.enter(this, x, y,\r\n            // If we're re-entering the initial container,\r\n            // put item the into its starting index to begin with.\r\n            newContainer === this._initialContainer && newContainer.sortingDisabled ? this._initialIndex : undefined);\r\n```\r\nWith this change in place, the behavior becomes: \r\n![GIF2](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/23387905/75819670-15fbe380-5d69-11ea-8f41-5d8ca3bbb040.gif)\r\n\r\n\r\n[StackBlitz with change](https://stackblitz.com/edit/angular-qvajsn?file=src/app/cdk-drag-drop-connected-sorting-group-example.ts)\r\n\r\n","Url":"https://github.com/angular/components/issues/18697","RelatedDescription":"Open issue \"[drag-drop] Re-entering the initial container can place the dragged item in an undesirable index\" (#18697)"},{"Id":"574565221","IsPullRequest":false,"CreatedAt":"2020-03-03T20:30:18","Actor":"boufenzi","Number":"18688","RawContent":null,"Title":"is there a way to navigate from step to step using name attribute not the index","State":"closed","Body":"Hello guys, i'm trying to see if there is a way to navigate from step to another step using a static attribute like name or Id and not the index of the step because if i add a step all my steps will get there indexes changes,  so i must update all of them which is not a good way of programing. is there a way to navigate from a step to another without using indexes but the Id which is a static term. \r\ni want my steps to have always the same id even if i add before or after them a new step. can someone help me with an example ?? thank you guys \r\n","Url":"https://github.com/angular/components/issues/18688","RelatedDescription":"Closed issue \"is there a way to navigate from step to step using name attribute not the index\" (#18688)"},{"Id":"575028063","IsPullRequest":false,"CreatedAt":"2020-03-03T17:24:31","Actor":"brianpilati","Number":"18699","RawContent":null,"Title":"Angular Material 9 does not support an imported npm module using Angular Material 8","State":"open","Body":"# üêû bug report\r\n\r\n### Affected Package\r\nAngular Material 9\r\n\r\n### Is this a regression?\r\nWorks fine in Angular 8\r\n\r\n\r\n### Description\r\n\r\nWhen I attempt to import a npm project running Angular 8 and Material 8 into an Angular 9 app running Material 9, it will not compile because the paths for material do not exist.\r\n\r\nShockingly, it also happens if you import a project running Angular 9 and Material into an Angular 9 app running Material9\r\n\r\n\r\n## üî¨ Minimal Reproduction\r\nCreate an app in Angular 9 with Angular Material 9.

The shadow is blinking while closing.\r\nThe class I created:\r\n`.mat-shadow {\r\n  box-shadow: -5px 15px 5px 10px rgba(60, 60, 60, 0.2), -5px 0 5px -5px rgba(60, 60, 60, 0.3),\r\n    -5px 0 5px -5px rgba(139, 139, 139, 0.4) !important;\r\n}`\r\n\r\n#### What is the expected behavior?\r\nShadow remains the same while the animation is happening \r\n\r\n\r\n#### What is the current behavior?\r\n\r\n\r\n#### What are the steps to reproduce?\r\nProviding a StackBlitz reproduction is the *best* way to share your issue. <br/>\r\nStackBlitz starter: https://goo.gl/wwnhMV<br/>\r\n\r\n\r\n#### What is the use-case or motivation for changing an existing behavior?\r\n\r\n\r\n#### Which versions of Angular, Material, OS, TypeScript, browsers are affected?\r\nAngular CLI: 8.3.25\r\nNode: 10.16.3\r\nOS: win32 x64\r\nAngular: 8.2.14\r\n... animations, common, compiler, compiler-cli, core, forms\r\n... language-service, platform-browser, platform-browser-dynamic\r\n... router\r\n\r\nPackage                           Version\r\n-----------------------------------------------------------\r\n@angular-devkit/architect         0.803.25\r\n@angular-devkit/build-angular     0.803.25\r\n@angular-devkit/build-optimizer   0.803.25\r\n@angular-devkit/build-webpack     0.803.25\r\n@angular-devkit/core              8.3.25\r\n@angular-devkit/schematics        8.3.25\r\n@angular/cdk                      8.2.3\r\n@angular/cli                      8.3.25\r\n@angular/flex-layout              8.0.0-beta.27\r\n@angular/material                 8.2.3\r\n@ngtools/webpack                  8.3.25\r\n@schematics/angular               8.3.25\r\n@schematics/update                0.803.25\r\nrxjs                              6.4.0\r\ntypescript                        3.5.3\r\nwebpack                           4.39.2\r\n\r\n#### Is there anything else we should know?\r\nMaybe this is somehow related to the [#8386](https://github.com/angular/components/issues/8386)\r\n","Url":"https://github.com/angular/components/issues/18675","RelatedDescription":"Open issue \"Angular Material shadow missing while closing mat-sidenav \" (#18675)"},{"Id":"574042371","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2020-03-02T15:13:44","Actor":"fileto1","Number":"18674","RawContent":null,"Title":"Update table-row-context-example.html","State":"open","Body":"Fixed comments for each column.","Url":"https://github.com/angular/components/pull/18674","RelatedDescription":"Open PR \"Update table-row-context-example.html\" (#18674)"},{"Id":"574011233","IsPullRequest":false,"CreatedAt":"2020-03-02T14:27:07","Actor":"ataraciuk","Number":"18673","RawContent":null,"Title":"[cdk drag drop] restrict possible insert positions for a drag into a dropList","State":"open","Body":"#### Feature Description\r\n\r\nI would like to be able to somehow limit at what positions a drag element can be dropped into a dropList. I couldn't find any way of doing that with the current API.\r\n\r\nIdeally, if let's say a drag can only be dropped into position 3 or bigger, and it's begin dragged over position 1, the drop would still allowed, but the placeholder would show position 3, and drop event would occur over position 3, and not 1.\r\n\r\nI'm considering using a combination of CdkDragEnter and CdkDragMove to style the placehoder for invalid positions and then the drop event to cancel an invalid move, but maybe there's a better way of doing that? Any advice will be appreciated.\r\n\r\nI also considered using multiple droplists, but I need the whole area to be droppable, and with the long term goal of showing the placeholder on the previous valid index (as opposed to not showing a placeholder and not allowing the drop), a single dropList sounds a better approach.\r\n\r\nThank you.\r\n\r\n#### Use Case\r\n\r\nFor a dropList with 10 elements, a drag element can only be dropped between positions 3 and 7. Dragging over positions 1 and 2 shows the placeholder element on position 3, and drop event has position parameter set as 3. As a less desirable but still happy outcome, when dragging over positions 1 or 2 a placeholder is not shown, and the dropList does not fire the drop event when dropping there, as if the move were invalid.\r\n","Url":"https://github.com/angular/components/issues/18673","RelatedDescription":"Open issue \"[cdk drag drop] restrict possible insert positions for a drag into a dropList\" (#18673)"},{"Id":"573986206","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2020-03-02T13:47:34","Actor":"devversion","Number":"18672","RawContent":null,"Title":"build: include tslib helpers in umd bundles","State":"open","Body":"Similarily to https://github.com/angular/angular/commit/2e270bb96a162af797bfc80f06cff3dd1c523877, we should include tslib in the UMD bundles.\r\n\r\nFixes #18655.","Url":"https://github.com/angular/components/pull/18672","RelatedDescription":"Open PR \"build: include tslib helpers in umd bundles\" (#18672)"}],"ResultType":"GitHubIssue"}},"RunOn":"2020-03-04T05:30:05.8273039Z","RunDurationInMilliseconds":3179}
