issue \"Improve Support for Custom / Wrapped NuGet Clients\" (#6161) at NuGet/Home","RelatedBody":"I'm currently trying to migrate a custom NuGet client from an old v2.x version to the latest v4.x NuGet in order to secure long-term support and allow dealing with netstandard packages that require a newer version. Maybe this is just me failing to wrap my head around some concepts, but so far the experience feels like a downgrade from the old v2.x integration. In any case, any input would be appreciated.\r\n\r\nThis issue is rather generic, so should we identify actual problems to be solved by NuGet in the process, it probably would make sense to move them to more specific issues.\r\n\r\n## Use Case\r\n\r\n- I'm maintaining a standalone desktop application that depends on NuGet package management to allow users to install and uninstall plugins, as well as update the applications individual components. \r\n- Some packages are non-standard and specific to the project, others are just your regular NuGet packages from the main repository, and either of them can depend on any NuGet package out there.\r\n- Packages are installed into a local folder, their contents are examined and selectively copied to or removed from the proper application directories. The application restarts, done.\r\n- A core concept of the application is self-contained, i.e. allowing users to keep any number of installations in separate folders, each being independent from both the system and unknowing of other installations.\r\n\r\n## Issues\r\n\r\n- All existing NuGet documentation seems to revolve around publishing and consuming packages using any of the official clients and Visual Studio. The only helpful instance I found is a [tutorial by Dave Glick](https://daveaglick.com/posts/exploring-the-nuget-v3-libraries-part-1), which is helpful, but only to a degree. There seems to be a **lack of both manual pages and code documentation** with regard to using NuGet libraries directly.\r\n- There seems to be a big increase in NuGet classes the user has to deal with and learn about in order to get anything up and running, most of which remain somewhat fuzzy in their purpose and hidden behind interfaces. Internal designs are all good and well, but some **shortcuts would be appreciated**: Simple package manager with N custom repository urls - do I really need to manually instantiate an `ISettings`, an `IPackageSourceProvider` and an `ISourceRepositoryProvider` for that, all of which may or may not require a custom implementation?\r\n- I haven't figured out a way to either provide no settings, or provide custom / local settings only yet. All of the constructors or static methods seem to load or require machine-wide or user-specific settings in some way, there is no empty constructor, and lots of objects require a settings reference - so **how do I sandbox NuGet inside my application folder**?\r\n- **Not all methods provide a non-async overload**. This is a design choice that may match with a developers use case, or it may not - but since async is somewhat viral, the lack of non-async overloads is an inconvenience with technical implications.\r\n- The **micro dependency model** leads to 15 dependencies and ~30 files in the output directory for a fresh new console project with just nuget, which just feels wrong. Not expecting that my gut feeling will have an impact on architectural design decisions, but kind of need to put that on the list.\r\n\r\nSo.. thank you for reading this big block of text - feedback and insights appreciated."},{"Id":"6841021257","Type":"IssuesEvent","CreatedAt":"2017-11-11T07:46:03","Actor":"emgarten","Repository":"NuGet/Home","Organization":"NuGet","RawContent":null,"RelatedAction":"closed","RelatedUrl":"https://github.com/NuGet/Home/issues/6143","RelatedDescription":"Closed issue \"Restore nuget failed : Ambigous project name\" (#6143) at NuGet/Home","RelatedBody":"# Version details\r\n\r\n**Nuget version** : AppVeyor version ( Current Visual Studio 2017 version )\r\n\r\n**MSBuild version** : 15.4.8.50001\r\n\r\n**OS** : AppVeyor version\r\n\r\n**Project Type** : Multiplaform nuget for Xamarin\r\n\r\n**Link to appveyor** :\r\nhttps://ci.appveyor.com/project/AlexTeixeira/askmethat-xforms-controls/build/1.1.1-CI-11-ythksvpb\r\n\r\n**Link to GitHub project** :\r\nhttps://github.com/AlexTeixeira/Askmethat-XForms-Controls/tree/master/src\r\n\r\n# Problem\r\n\r\n```\r\nRestoring packages for C:\\projects\\askmethat-xforms-controls\\src\\Askmethat.XForms.Controls.NuGet\\Askmethat.XForms.Controls.NuGet.nuproj...\r\nnuget : Ambiguous project name 'Askmethat.XForms.Controls'.\r\nAt line:1 char:1\r\n+ nuget restore .\\src\\Askmethat.XForms.Controls.sln\r\n+ ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\r\n    + CategoryInfo          : NotSpecified: (Ambiguous proje...orms.Controls'.:String) [], RemoteException\r\n    + FullyQualifiedErrorId : NativeCommandError\r\n \r\nCommand executed with exception: Ambiguous project name 'Askmethat.XForms.Controls'.\r\n\r\n```\r\n\r\nThis error is thrown when nuget restore try to restore all project, it's happens with Askmethat.XForms.Controls.NuGet project.\r\n\r\nI check all configuration files ( csproj & sln ) and I do not found any duplicate project name or package id.\r\nI also try to check if any circular dependency exist...\r\n\r\nThe nuget restore work on my machine ( macOS : up to date ).\r\n\r\nIf I remove the package ID from the nuget it works.
