This is a subtle effect of the build infrastructure,\r\nbut it boils down to a TsickleHost method `shouldSkipTsickleProcessing`.\r\n\r\nFor ngc_wrapped builds (Bazel + Angular), this method is defined in the\r\n`@bazel/typescript` (aka bazel rules_typescript) implementation of\r\n`CompilerHost`. The default behavior is to skip tsickle processing for files\r\nwhich are not present in the original `srcs[]` of the build rule. In\r\nAngular's case, this includes all generated shim files.\r\n\r\nFor View Engine factories this is probably desirable as they're quite\r\ncomplex and they've never been tested with tsickle. Ivy factories however\r\nare smaller and very straightforward, and it makes sense to treat them like\r\nany other output.\r\n\r\nThis commit adjusts two independent implementations of\r\n`shouldSkipTsickleProcessing` to enable transformation of Ivy shims:\r\n\r\n* in `@angular/bazel` aka ngc_wrapped, the upstream `@bazel/typescript`\r\n  `CompilerHost` is patched to treat .ngfactory files the same as their\r\n  original source file, with respect to tsickle processing.\r\n\r\n  It is currently not possible to test this change as we don't have any test\r\n  that inspects tsickle output with bazel. It will be extensively tested in\r\n  g3.\r\n\r\n* in `ngc`, Angular's own implementation is adjusted to allow for the\r\n  processing of shims when compiling with Ivy. This enables a unit test to\r\n  be written to validate the correct behavior of tsickle when given a host\r\n  that's appropriately configured to process factory shims.\r\n\r\nFor ngtsc-as-a-plugin, a similar fix will need to be submitted upstream in\r\ntsc_wrapped.\r\n","Url":"https://github.com/angular/angular/pull/35975","RelatedDescription":"Open PR \"feat(bazel): transform generated shims (in Ivy) with tsickle\" (#35975)"},{"Id":"578184495","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2020-03-09T21:31:41","Actor":"AndrewKushnir","Number":"35973","RawContent":null,"Title":"Revert \"feat: Monkey patches MessagePort onproperties (onmessage/onme‚Ä¶","State":"closed","Body":"‚Ä¶ssageerror) (#34610)\"\r\n\r\nThis reverts commit 1882451ec03daeebe32f2355030faf7e2f90ae8a.\r\n\r\nReason: breaks some g3 targets.\r\n\r\nNote: reverting in master only, since original changes were merged only to master.","Url":"https://github.com/angular/angular/pull/35973","RelatedDescription":"Closed or merged PR \"Revert \"feat: Monkey patches MessagePort onproperties (onmessage/onme‚Ä¶\" (#35973)"},{"Id":"578150321","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2020-03-09T21:00:24","Actor":"matsko","Number":"35970","RawContent":null,"Title":"Revert \"feat(bazel): transform generated shims (in Ivy) with tsickle (#35848)\"","State":"closed","Body":"This reverts commit 9ff9a072e62af9aacc3703936e01c984ad44d6d6.","Url":"https://github.com/angular/angular/pull/35970","RelatedDescription":"Closed or merged PR \"Revert \"feat(bazel): transform generated shims (in Ivy) with tsickle (#35848)\"\" (#35970)"},{"Id":"578187259","IsPullRequest":false,"CreatedAt":"2020-03-09T20:58:28","Actor":"alevyKorio","Number":"35974","RawContent":null,"Title":"<ng-content> doesn't work as WebComponent","State":"open","Body":"# üêû bug report\r\n\r\n### Affected Package\r\nangular/elements\r\n\r\n### Description\r\n\r\nI am making a container component in Angular 9 to be turned into a web component.\r\nThe container component is first turned into a Web Component once that is done ANY children can be passed into it and manipulate it.

speed-measure-webpack-plugin via addy osmani and thought it would be interesting to have it in @angular/cli too. As of today even with ngx-build-plus I don't see how you could wrap existing plugins with SMP. You can use it for the plugins you added yourself but that's all. All plugins already declared by the @angular/cli won't be affected.\r\n\r\nOn my project, (big project), I'm pretty sure the license plugin is taking a lot of times every time I build. I would love to have numbers for that. I would also love being able to disable it in dev mode but that's another subject. \r\n\r\n### Describe the solution you'd like\r\n<!-- ‚úçÔ∏è--> If you have a solution in mind, please describe it.\r\n\r\nThe easiest solution would be to integrate SMP or something similar in @angular/cli. Even if we don't have control on everything it would give us hints about what takes times and maybe we can do something.\r\n\r\n### Describe alternatives you've considered\r\n<!-- ‚úçÔ∏è--> Have you considered any alternative solutions or workarounds?\r\n\r\nI don't see any alternative if you want to keep using @angular/cli.\r\n","Url":"https://github.com/angular/angular-cli/issues/17170","RelatedDescription":"Closed issue \"speed-measure-webpack-plugin integration\" (#17170)"},{"Id":"577310823","IsPullRequest":false,"CreatedAt":"2020-03-07T09:55:53","Actor":"mboughaba","Number":"17168","RawContent":null,"Title":"Moderate vulnerability in `@angular-devkit/build-angular` deps","State":"open","Body":"Dear,\r\n\r\nNPM audit report a moderate vulnerability in dev-dependency `@angular-devkit/build-angular`\r\nI am not sure if `angular/cli` is affected :)\r\n\r\n```\r\n> npm audit --registry https://registry.npmjs.org/\r\n\r\n\r\n                       === npm audit security report ===\r\n\r\n\r\n                                 Manual Review\r\n             Some vulnerabilities require your attention to resolve\r\n\r\n          Visit https://go.npm.me/audit-guide for additional guidance\r\n\r\n\r\n  Moderate        Regular Expression Denial of Service\r\n\r\n  Package         acorn\r\n\r\n  Patched in      >=7.1.1\r\n\r\n  Dependency of   @angular-devkit/build-angular [dev]\r\n\r\n  Path            @angular-devkit/build-angular > webpack > acorn\r\n\r\n  More info       https://npmjs.com/advisories/1488\r\n\r\nfound 1 moderate severity vulnerability in 23729 scanned packages\r\n  1 vulnerability requires manual review.

Chokidar installations by the user will be ignored in favour of the bundled instance ([#&#8203;3331](https://togithub.com/rollup/rollup/issues/3331))\n-   Modules that are completely tree-shaken will no longer be listed as part of any chunks in `generateBundle`\n-   The `experimentalOptimizeChunks` and `chunkGroupingSize` options have been removed\n-   [acorn](https://togithub.com/acornjs/acorn) plugins can only be used if they accept a passed-in acorn instance instead of importing it themselves. See [acornjs/acorn#&#8203;870 (comment)](https://togithub.com/acornjs/acorn/pull/870#issuecomment-527339830) for what needs to be done to make plugins compatible that do not support this yet ([#&#8203;3391](https://togithub.com/rollup/rollup/issues/3391))\n-   Emitted chunks now have the TypeScript type `UInt8Array` instead of `Buffer`. A `Buffer` can still be used, though ([#&#8203;3395](https://togithub.com/rollup/rollup/issues/3395))\n-   The TypeScript types no longer use ESTree types for AST nodes but a very generic type that does not contain information specific to certain node types ([#&#8203;3395](https://togithub.com/rollup/rollup/issues/3395))\n-   The signature of the `writeBundle` plugin hook has been changed to match `generateBundle`: The bundle object is now passed as second parameter instead of first and the first parameter is the output options ([#&#8203;3361](https://togithub.com/rollup/rollup/issues/3361))\n-   The following plugin hooks have been removed:\n    -   ongenerate: use `generateBundle` instead\n    -   onwrite: use `writeBundle` instead\n    -   transformBundle: use `renderChunk` instead\n    -   transformChunk: use `renderChunk` instead\n-   You can no longer access `this.watcher` on the plugin context.\n-   The `transform` hook can no longer return `dependencies`.\n-   The `treeshake.pureExternalModules` option will now show a deprecation warning when used: use `treeshake.moduleSideEffects: 'no-external'` instead\n-   Using `import.meta.ROLLUP_ASSET_URL_<..>` and `import.meta.ROLLUP_CHUNK_URL_<..>` in code will now show warnings: use `import.meta.ROLLUP_FILE_URL_<..>` instead\n-   The `resolveAssetUrl` hook will now show a deprecation warning when used: use `resolveFileUrl` instead\n-   The following plugin context functions will show warnings when used:\n    -   `this.emitAsset`: use `this.emitFile`\n    -   `this.emitChunk`: use `this.emitFile`\n    -   `this.getAssetFileName`: use `this.getFileName`\n    -   `this.getChunkFileName`: use `this.getFileName`\n    -   `this.isExternal`: use `this.resolve`\n    -   `this.resolveId`: use `this.resolve`\n-   Directly adding properties to the bundle object in the `generateBundle` is deprecated will show a warning (removing properties is allowed, though): Use `this.emitFile`\n-   Accessing `chunk.isAsset` on the bundle is deprecated: Use `chunk.type === 'asset'` instead\n-   The error code for a missing `name` property when targeting UMD has been changed to `MISSING_NAME_OPTION_FOR_IIFE_EXPORT` to emphasize this is needed for the IIFE part of UMD ([#&#8203;3393](https://togithub.com/rollup/rollup/issues/3393))\n\n##### Features\n\n-   Rollup now bundles [Chokidar](https://togithub.com/paulmillr/chokidar) for a better watch experience ([#&#8203;3331](https://togithub.com/rollup/rollup/issues/3331))\n-   Rollup now bundles [acorn](https://togithub.com/acornjs/acorn) again, removing its only external dependency ([#&#8203;3391](https://togithub.com/rollup/rollup/issues/3391))\n-   Do not consider empty imports from side-effect-free modules for chunking and hoist side-effect imports if necessary ([#&#8203;3369](https://togithub.com/rollup/rollup/issues/3369))\n-   Rollup can now be imported as an ES module in Node via `import {rollup} from 'rollup'`.

Wasn't sure where should I open issue in Angular repo or here + not sure if it is a bug or feature request :)\r\nAnyway here is the thing:\r\nIn our project, we use i18n in a bit different way. We have 13 variations of our app. They share the same core and logic, but the logo, design, and content is different. So we not translating with i18n, but using it to deliver different options of content (for example in one website the welcome message will be 'Welcome customer' and in another, it will be 'Welcome dear partner').\r\nNow we are updating to angular 9 and we are very excited that we won't need to build 13 times, but only once. We started to make a POC, and turns out that in `angular.json` the key `i18n.locales` have a regex pattern of `^[a-zA-Z]{2,3}(-[a-zA-Z]{4})?(-([a-zA-Z]{2}|[0-9]{3}))?(-[a-zA-Z]{5,20})?$` according to `./node_modules/@angular/cli/lib/config/schema.json`. Our translation for today is smth like `en-corporate`, `en-private`, `en-pb`. So while `en-private` would work two another wouldnt. I understand that it is not a scenario that you built it for. But is there a solution that we could use without renaming? Is it possible to disable regex validation somehow?\r\n\r\n### Describe the solution you'd like\r\n<!-- ‚úçÔ∏è-->\r\nTo be able to use custom locale names or to disable pattern validation","Url":"https://github.com/angular/angular-cli/issues/17163","RelatedDescription":"Open issue \"Custom i18n locales names\" (#17163)"},{"Id":"576521956","IsPullRequest":false,"CreatedAt":"2020-03-06T07:14:44","Actor":"mfduar8766","Number":"17155","RawContent":null,"Title":"Can you add [(ngModel)]support back into reactive forms?

This text box submits user input when it loses focus.\r\n* I want to know what is the correct / recommended approach to move focus to other control, we I'm inside a menu item `click` callback.\r\n* Is it possible for `matMenu` to stop moving focus to the triggering button when closing the menu, if user's focus is not inside `matMenu` at the time just before the menu closes? (something like #11696, but with a pre-condition)\r\n\r\n#### What troubleshooting steps have you tried?\r\nI need to use `setTimeout(..., 0)` to defer moving focus to text box, so the focus will be moved to the menu-triggering button, *then moved to the text box at last*. However, this looks flaky to me and I'm not sure if it's the best practice.\r\n\r\n#### Reproduction\r\n\r\nhttps://stackblitz.com/edit/angular-component-mat-menu-focus?file=src%2Fapp%2Ftext-editor%2Ftext-editor.component.ts\r\n\r\nSteps to reproduce:\r\n1. Open the sandbox link above, note the following code in `text-editor.component.ts`.\r\n```ts\r\n  ngAfterViewInit() {\r\n    // If we remove setTimeout, textInput.blur event will be triggered immediately.\r\n    window.setTimeout(() => {\r\n      // Move focus to the text box automatically.\r\n      this.textInput.nativeElement.focus();\r\n    }, 0);\r\n  }\r\n```\r\n2. In the app, you can edit the text with \"Edit\" menu item. That's expected behavior.\r\n![temp](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/50703224/76141096-013a8b00-609c-11ea-889e-7ec2edb7e474.gif)\r\n\r\n3.
