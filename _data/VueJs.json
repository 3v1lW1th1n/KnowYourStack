Create a new component\r\n2. Use a `<svg>` element in that component\r\n\r\n### What is expected?\r\nThe SVG should be rendered the same way it is rendered, if there was no component.\r\n\r\n### What is actually happening?\r\nThe SVG is not rendered correctly - in the example the size of the circle seems to be disconnected from the viewbox of the svg element.\r\n\r\n---\r\nIn the codepen, I also managed to reproduce the issue when generating the SVG from Javascript. I assume that this is the same issue, as Vue templates will likely be parsed in a similar fashion.\r\n\r\n<!-- generated by vue-issues.
