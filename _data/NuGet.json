For example, in a .NET 4.7.2 project with the following:\r\n\r\n```xml\r\n<ItemGroup>\r\n    <Reference Include=\"System.Net.Http\" Aliases=\"snh\" />\r\n    <PackageReference Include=\"System.Net.Http\" Version=\"4.1.0\" />\r\n</ItemGroup>\r\n```\r\n\r\nAnd with the following code:\r\n\r\n```c#\r\nextern alias snh;\r\nusing System;\r\n\r\nclass Program\r\n{\r\n    static void Main(string[] args)\r\n    {\r\n        var client = new snh::System.Net.Http.HttpClient();\r\n    }\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nWill fail to build, because NuGet will try to replace the `Reference` to System.Net.Http with the version of that DLL that comes from the NuGet package, and the Aliases information is lost.

I am planning to fix some of them in this PR: https://github.com/dotnet/sdk/pull/3331\r\n\r\nThe changes in that PR, together with deleting the referenced line from Microsoft.NuGet.targets, make this scenario work.

[#7912](https://github.com/NuGet/Home/issues/7912)\r\n\r\nThe following commands are being deprecated because these are cause of confusion due to their nomenclature and/or other related commands that already exist:\r\n* [`nuget list`](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/nuget/tools/cli-ref-list): Currently displays a list of packages from a given source\r\n  * This will be replaced by an equivalent command **`nuget search`** which will be later enhanced with more capabilities as we make progress with or [search improvements](nvmd got it: https://github.com/NuGet/NuGetGallery/issues/6371​​​​​​​).\r\n* [`nuget add`](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/nuget/tools/cli-ref-add): Currently adds a specified package to a non-HTTP package source (a folder or UNC path) in a hierarchical layout, wherein folders are created for the package ID and version number. \r\n  * This will be replaced by overloading **`nuget push`** command.\r\n\r\n>
