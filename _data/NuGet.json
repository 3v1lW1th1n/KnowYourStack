Configure Visual Studio 2017 to use *PackageReference* instead of *packages.config*.\r\n\r\n2. Create a new C# *Class Library (.NET Framework)* targeting .NET Framework 4.5.\r\n\r\n3.

Create a valid nuspec file without specifying any dependencies (they should be inferred and included automatically)\r\n\r\n6. Run `nuget pack` and check the .nuspec file included in the generated .nupkg file.

You can see in the .nupack generated by running `nuget pack .\\ClassLibrary1.csproj` that the .nuspec file in it does not include any dependencies, while in the ClassLibrary2 project, created using packages.config, the dependencies are included.\r\n\r\n"}],"ResultType":"GitHubEvent"},"Announcements":{"Events":[{"Id":"6645602469","Type":"IssuesEvent","CreatedAt":"2017-09-27T18:36:51","Actor":"anangaur","Repository":"NuGet/Announcements","Organization":"NuGet","RawContent":null,"RelatedAction":"opened","RelatedUrl":"https://github.com/NuGet/Announcements/issues/9","RelatedDescription":"Opened issue \"Markdown based documentation for packages\" (#9) at NuGet/Announcements","RelatedBody":"Announcing support for rich markdown based documentation for packages\r\n\r\nThis feature has following parts:\r\n**1.

The NuGet open source codebase (both the NuGet gallery and the NuGet client) will remain open source and continue as .NET Foundation supported projects under the same terms as before.\r\n\r\nWe encourage you to read the full [Terms of Use](https://www.nuget.org/policies/Terms) and [Privacy Statement](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkId=521839), as well as the [blog post](https://blog.nuget.org/20170907/Changes-to-NuGet-dot-org-service-management-and-performance-improvements-in-China.html) about the changes.
