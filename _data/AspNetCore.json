If so, what release should I target for/when should I start? I would assume at the very least once `@vue/cli` releases a stable version (it's currently at `3.0.0-alpha.8`), but if I can (or should) start earlier, that's fine as well.\r\n- As I understand, getting the Vue template to work with `@vue/cli` like the Angular and React templates do with their respective CLIs will require changes to both the [aspnet/Templating] and [aspnet/JavaScriptServices] repos. Is there any preferred way to coordinate these contributions? Should I send PRs to both repositories at the same time, or should I wait for one to be merged before sending the other?\r\n- Currently, it appears the Angular and React templates have a `ClientApp` folder consisting of pre-generated output from their respective CLIs. Is this how other SPA CLI-based templates should be created moving forward, or should I look into invoking Vue's CLI `create` command as part of template generation? This would give users more control over the output since `@vue/cli` already has [quite a few substantial choices users can make].\r\n- The Contributing Guide directs me to https://cla2.dotnetfoundation.org to sign the CLA, but that site appears to be down. Is that still the correct place for CLAs?\r\n\r\n[existing Vue SPA template]: https://github.com/aspnet/templating/tree/a4427f5263c78ce7203e727a0bae106f530f22bd/src/Microsoft.AspNetCore.SpaTemplates/content/Vue-CSharp\r\n[`@vue/cli`]: https://github.com/vuejs/vue-cli\r\n[aspnet/Templating]: https://github.com/aspnet/templating\r\n[aspnet/JavaScriptServices]: https://github.com/aspnet/JavaScriptServices\r\n[quite a few substantial choices users can make]: https://github.com/vuejs/vue-cli#creating-a-new-project"},{"Id":"7195877506","Type":"IssuesEvent","CreatedAt":"2018-02-04T21:29:17","Actor":"davidfowl","Repository":"aspnet/Home","Organization":"aspnet","RawContent":null,"RelatedAction":"opened","RelatedUrl":"https://github.com/aspnet/Home/issues/2849","RelatedDescription":"Opened issue \"Consider replacing InlineStringBuilder with ValueStringBuilder\" (#2849) at aspnet/Home","RelatedBody":"https://github.com/dotnet/corefx/blob/5d71d9ea70418c26874949b36e6434c4849fde52/src/Common/src/CoreLib/System/Text/ValueStringBuilder.cs#L11\r\n\r\nWe should look at the places where we use InlineStringBuilder today and consider replacing those instances with ValueStringBuilder (of course measuring performance along the way).
