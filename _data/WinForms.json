Some were wrapped around null, some were wrapped around things that had no hold on the handle in question. There is also no need to `HandleRef` things you're deleting in `Dispose()`. The idea behind `HandleRef` is to ensure that you don't get finalized during a P/Invoke invocation. Some of the ones I left in with the method moves can likely be removed with a bit more rationaliztion/thinking. I just killed ones that were fairly obvious.\r\n\r\nWhen I needed `HandleRef` overrides I manually wrote wrappers for `IntPtr` exports. Exports with identical signatures share the same generated interop IL, which can add up significantly in something as interop heavy as WinForms.\r\n\r\ncc: @hughbe\n\n###### Microsoft Reviewers: [Open in CodeFlow](http://wpcp.azurewebsites.net/CodeFlowProtocolProxy2.php?pullrequest=https://github.com/dotnet/winforms/pull/1459)","Url":"https://github.com/dotnet/winforms/pull/1459","RelatedDescription":"Open PR \"Create DC and Region interop files\" (#1459)"},{"Id":"472064047","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2019-07-24T03:52:54","Actor":"dotnet-maestro[bot]","Number":"1458","RawContent":null,"Title":"[master] Update dependencies from dotnet/core-setup","State":"closed","Body":"This pull request updates the following dependencies\r\n\r\n[marker]: <> (Begin:46621eff-65ab-4284-d49b-08d6b1351be3)\r\n## From https://github.com/dotnet/core-setup\r\n- **Build**: 20190723.17\r\n- **Date Produced**: 7/24/2019 3:40 AM\r\n- **Commit**: 5d8d5e866113c9f144136a04222f191456dfff1d\r\n- **Branch**: refs/heads/release/3.0\r\n- **Updates**:\r\n  -

When we get windows messages (`WM_*`) we create event classes and jump through a lot of hoops that would not be necessary in a closed system.\r\n\r\nFor one example, getting a `WM_ERASEBKGND` often ends up being a `FillRect` on the passed in `HDC`.  We could potentially avoid a lot of hoop jumping some allocations if we knew the `OnPaintBackground` was completely under our control.\r\n\r\nWe would pay up front for this sort of check, but could potentially earn it back quite quickly. The following code takes a couple of milliseconds on class creation:\r\n\r\n``` C#\r\nType type = GetType();\r\n_isTypeInAssembly = type.Assembly == typeof(Control).Assembly;\r\n\r\n_isOnPaintBackgroundLocal = _isTypeInAssembly\r\n    || type.GetMethod(\r\n        \"OnPaintBackground\",\r\n        BindingFlags.NonPublic | BindingFlags.Instance,\r\n        null,\r\n        new Type[] { typeof(PaintEventArgs) }, null\r\n             ).DeclaringType.Assembly == typeof(Control).Assembly;\r\n```\r\n\r\nIf we find measurable situations where we go \"if only we knew this wasn't customized\" this may be a strategy to attempt.","Url":"https://github.com/dotnet/winforms/issues/1441","RelatedDescription":"Open issue \"Consider using reflection to optimize code paths in stock scenarios\" (#1441)"},{"Id":"471219723","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2019-07-22T17:43:19","Actor":"hughbe","Number":"1440","RawContent":null,"Title":"Fix HelpProvider argument validation parameter names","State":"open","Body":"\n\n###### Microsoft Reviewers: [Open in CodeFlow](http://wpcp.azurewebsites.net/CodeFlowProtocolProxy2.php?pullrequest=https://github.com/dotnet/winforms/pull/1440)","Url":"https://github.com/dotnet/winforms/pull/1440","RelatedDescription":"Open PR \"Fix HelpProvider argument validation parameter names\" (#1440)"},{"Id":"471157365","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2019-07-22T15:20:55","Actor":"hughbe","Number":"1439","RawContent":null,"Title":"Add CodeDomComponentSerializationService tests and fix some bugs","State":"open","Body":"\n\n###### Microsoft Reviewers: [Open in CodeFlow](http://wpcp.azurewebsites.net/CodeFlowProtocolProxy2.php?pullrequest=https://github.com/dotnet/winforms/pull/1439)","Url":"https://github.com/dotnet/winforms/pull/1439","RelatedDescription":"Open PR \"Add CodeDomComponentSerializationService tests and fix some bugs\" (#1439)"},{"Id":"471059145","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2019-07-22T12:37:40","Actor":"hughbe","Number":"1438","RawContent":null,"Title":"Rename control.ime.cs to match guidelines","State":"closed","Body":"\n\n###### Microsoft Reviewers: [Open in CodeFlow](http://wpcp.azurewebsites.net/CodeFlowProtocolProxy2.php?pullrequest=https://github.com/dotnet/winforms/pull/1438)","Url":"https://github.com/dotnet/winforms/pull/1438","RelatedDescription":"Closed or merged PR \"Rename control.ime.cs to match guidelines\" (#1438)"},{"Id":"471051449","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2019-07-22T11:51:41","Actor":"hughbe","Number":"1437","RawContent":null,"Title":"Consolidate and cleanup pinvokes for loading libraries/dlls","State":"open","Body":"\n\n###### Microsoft Reviewers: [Open in CodeFlow](http://wpcp.azurewebsites.net/CodeFlowProtocolProxy2.php?pullrequest=https://github.com/dotnet/winforms/pull/1437)","Url":"https://github.com/dotnet/winforms/pull/1437","RelatedDescription":"Open PR \"Consolidate and cleanup pinvokes for loading libraries/dlls\" (#1437)"},{"Id":"470441006","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2019-07-22T10:34:46","Actor":"hughbe","Number":"1433","RawContent":null,"Title":"Add more ContainerControl tests, cleanup ContainerControl and fix an NRE","State":"closed","Body":"\n\n###### Microsoft Reviewers: [Open in CodeFlow](http://wpcp.azurewebsites.net/CodeFlowProtocolProxy2.php?pullrequest=https://github.com/dotnet/winforms/pull/1433)","Url":"https://github.com/dotnet/winforms/pull/1433","RelatedDescription":"Closed or merged PR \"Add more ContainerControl tests, cleanup ContainerControl and fix an NRE\" (#1433)"},{"Id":"470382906","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2019-07-22T09:00:14","Actor":"hughbe","Number":"1431","RawContent":null,"Title":"Add ToolTip tests, cleanup code and add missing validation","State":"closed","Body":"\n\n###### Microsoft Reviewers: [Open in CodeFlow](http://wpcp.azurewebsites.net/CodeFlowProtocolProxy2.php?pullrequest=https://github.com/dotnet/winforms/pull/1431)","Url":"https://github.com/dotnet/winforms/pull/1431","RelatedDescription":"Closed or merged PR \"Add ToolTip tests, cleanup code and add missing validation\" (#1431)"},{"Id":"470626721","IsPullRequest":false,"CreatedAt":"2019-07-20T02:50:06","Actor":"maikebing","Number":"1436","RawContent":null,"Title":"If possible, want the Ribbon control.","State":"open","Body":"Existing open source projects\r\nhttps://github.com/RibbonWinForms/RibbonWinForms\r\n\r\nMFC's Ribbon Designer \r\nhttps://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/cpp/mfc/ribbon-designer-mfc?view=vs-2019\r\n\r\nSo, I think winforms should have Ribbon.
