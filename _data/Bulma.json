I'm pulling Bulma in to SimulatedGREG's [electron-vue](https://github.com/SimulatedGREG/electron-vue) boilerplate. Then npm installing bulma as a dependency. I'd rather not have to touch the framework just to keep two/three links visible. I know an electron app probably wasn't the original intent of where this would be used, but it's a great fit if you all could support some scenarios like this.\r\n\r\n### Steps to Reproduce\r\n1 - Pull down the [electron-vue](https://github.com/SimulatedGREG/electron-vue) boilerplate and `npm i`\r\n2 - Get maybe 2 or 3 routes setup (like for a simple app)\r\n3 - Grab the 1st navbar example from the Bulma site, change the 1st two navbar-item's to router-links\r\n4 - Remove burger and everything else to make it look kinda like below:\r\n```\r\n<template lang='pug'>\r\n#app\r\n    nav.navbar(role=\"navigation\" aria-label=\"main navigation\")\r\n        .navbar-brand\r\n            a.navbar-item(href=\"https://bulma.io\")\r\n                img(src=\"https://bulma.io/images/bulma-logo.png\" width=\"112\" height=\"28\")\r\n        #navbarBasicExample.navbar-menu\r\n            .navbar-start\r\n                router-link(to='/').navbar-item\r\n                    | Menu-Link1\r\n                router-link(to='/something').navbar-item\r\n                    | Menu-Link2\r\n    router-view\r\n</template>\r\n\r\n<style lang='scss'>\r\n@import \"~bulma/css/bulma.css\";\r\n/* CSS */\r\n</style>\r\n```\r\n5 - `npm run dev`\r\n\r\n### Expected behavior\r\n\r\nIf burger html or class like 'disable-responsive' or 'disable-burger' (pick 1, I'm not saying all 3) is added to nav element with 'navbar', the two links will remain. When super small width they can just break as the min-width of the window could be set at the electron level, preventing the user from ever seeing it.\r\n\r\n### Actual behavior\r\nSplit screen with few views results in unnecessary click by user. Dependency has to be tweaked. #1042 doesn't really hit the mark here since it is more involved and Bulma is already a great fit stock for small apps.\r\n","Url":"https://github.com/jgthms/bulma/issues/2391","RelatedDescription":"Open issue \"[Feature Request] Class flag to disable responsiveness on navbar (links always show, no hamburger).\" (#2391)"},{"Id":"416546917","IsPullRequest":false,"CreatedAt":"2019-03-03T18:28:00","Actor":"dark-kitt","Number":"2390","RawContent":null,"Title":"grid/columns.sass | $column-gap | double of the default value","State":"open","Body":"Hey,\r\n\r\nI've just  a little question...
