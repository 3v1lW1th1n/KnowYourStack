It also includes a tiny fix: ``only back up the original `prepublishOnly` script and not the overwritten one``\r\n\r\nSee the individual commit messages for more details.\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n**Notes on testing**\r\n\r\nI have added unit tests for all added/modified code except for the `ClusterMaster` class, because:\r\n- It mostly orchestrates other parts (that are independently tested).\r\n- The most important parts of its functionality are covered by integration tests.\r\n- I didn't want to spend too much time on testing it before a first review (in case the implementation changed drastically).\r\n\r\nThe integration tests at [ngcc/test/integration/ngcc_spec.ts](https://github.com/angular/angular/blob/f5bec3ff5/packages/compiler-cli/ngcc/test/integration/ngcc_spec.ts), which are run under bazel, don't play well with spawning multiple processes, so they are only run on one process (which means they don't exercise the `ClusterExecutor`).\r\n\r\nThe integration tests at [integration/ngcc/test.sh](https://github.com/angular/angular/blob/f5bec3ff5/integration/ngcc/test.sh) do run in parallel mode (and only in that mode, since that is the only option with `ivy-ngcc`).\r\n\r\nOther than that, I have manually verified that `ngcc` can successfully build angular.io in parallel mode (with various command-line argument combinations) and that the resulting `node_modules/`are identical to those produced in sync mode with the following exceptions:\r\n- `package.json > __processed_by_ivy_ngcc__` might have properties in different order.\r\n    _This is expected, since now the order is which tests are run/completed is different and non-deterministic._\r\n- Some generated variable names can be different (mostly(/only?) noticed in UMD bundles). E.g. `data_r50` vs `data_r450`.\r\n    _Not sure why that is and whether it is problematic._\r\n\r\n##\r\n**Notes on performance**\r\n\r\nFor processing angular.io, I have observed speed improvement between 1.8x (on my Windows laptop - 7 workers) to 2.6x (on Linux CI - 8 workers). This was a little surprizing, since task processing (which runs on multiple processes) takes up 80%-90% and all workers are busy most of the time (i.e. there are rarely idle workers).\r\n\r\nMore investigation is needed to better understand/improve those numbers, but this can happen after the PR lands.\r\n\r\nFun fact:\r\nThere doesn't seem to be much improvement above 4 workers. Even with up to 20 workers on CI, the duration was the same (if not worse: 29s vs 23s).\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n**TODO**\r\n\r\n- [ ] Get the PR reviewed.\r\n- [ ] Determine whether the differences in variable names (in UMD bundles?) are an issue.\r\n- [ ] Determine whether we need unit tests for `ClusterMaster`.\r\n","Url":"https://github.com/angular/angular/pull/32427","RelatedDescription":"Open PR \"perf(ngcc): add support for parallel execution of tasks\" (#32427)"},{"Id":"487670834","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2019-08-30T21:05:38","Actor":"rkirov","Number":"32425","RawContent":null,"Title":"refactor(benchpress): remove two mutable exports from largetable/util.ts","State":"open","Body":"Mutable exports, i.e. using this pattern\r\n\r\n```\r\nexport let x = 0;\r\nexport function f() {\r\n  x += 1;\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nis problematic to transpile to CommonJS and Goog.module systems, we are\r\nworking on banning it google internal codebase.

message. If the validation fails, an error message is printed and the commit is aborted.\r\n\r\nOccasionally, people may have written a non-trivial commit message which could turn out to be invalid (due a small typo for example). In that case, it is frustrating to \"lose\" the whole message and have to write it all over again (from memory). This is frustrating and has happened to me enough times to finally seek a solution.\r\n\r\nFortunately, it turns out that git stores the last commit message in `.git/COMMIT_EDITMSG`, so it is easy to get it back (as long as you know where to look for it). This commit mentions this info in the validation error to help people that might not know about it.\r\n\r\n(This issue is probably mostly relevant for people using git from the command-line and not through a UI, but it won't hurt in either case.)\r\n","Url":"https://github.com/angular/angular/pull/32420","RelatedDescription":"Closed or merged PR \"build: mention where to find the invalid commit message, when validation fails\" (#32420)"},{"Id":"487064978","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2019-08-30T17:52:46","Actor":"matsko","Number":"32401","RawContent":null,"Title":"perf(ivy): add a micro benchmark for style and class bindings","State":"closed","Body":"This patch introduces a new micro benchmark that performance tests\r\nagainst style and class bindings in Ivy running together on the same\r\nelement.","Url":"https://github.com/angular/angular/pull/32401","RelatedDescription":"Closed or merged PR \"perf(ivy): add a micro benchmark for style and class bindings\" (#32401)"},{"Id":"487584282","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2019-08-30T17:03:34","Actor":"crisbeto","Number":"32421","RawContent":null,"Title":"fix(ivy): unable to bind to properties that start with class or style","State":"open","Body":"Fixes Ivy picking up property bindings that start with `class` or `style` as if they're style bindings.\r\n\r\nFixes #32310.","Url":"https://github.com/angular/angular/pull/32421","RelatedDescription":"Open PR \"fix(ivy): unable to bind to properties that start with class or style\" (#32421)"},{"Id":"487509161","IsPullRequest":false,"CreatedAt":"2019-08-30T14:19:37","Actor":"HemendPatel63","Number":"32419","RawContent":null,"Title":"Is there an option to Interrupt (stop) the component life cycle","State":"open","Body":"I’m working on RBAC implementation in my angular app. I want to interrupt (stop) the component lifecycle and the rendering of the component template (and child components / templates).
