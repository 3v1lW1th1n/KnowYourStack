As such, it will always access the wrong package even if you've correctly defined a solution-level `nuget.config`.\r\n\r\n(tagging @mj1856, who helped discover this, thanks Matt!)\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\nNuGet product used (NuGet.exe | VS UI | Package Manager Console | dotnet.exe):\r\n\r\nNuGet.exe, VS UI\r\n\r\nNuGet version (x.x.x.xxx):\r\n\r\n4.9.3.5777\r\n\r\nVS version (if appropriate): \r\n\r\nVS 2017\r\n\r\nOS version (i.e. win10 v1607 (14393.321)):\r\n\r\nWin10\r\n\r\n## Detailed repro steps so we can see the same problem\r\n\r\n**Please see the PR listed below for easy repro!**\r\n\r\n1. Define a `nuget.config` in a source-level directory (i.e., `src/nuget.config`) with `repositorypath` all lowercase. Set the value to be `incorrectPackage`.\r\n\r\n2. Define another `nuget.config` in a folder beyond (i.e., `src/TestFolder/nuget.config`) with `repositoryPath` and set the value to be `correctPackage`.\r\n\r\n3. Make a Visual Studio solution at this level (note: this declares intent \"I want the project packages to be written as this config specifies\").\r\n\r\nHierarchy should look something like this:\r\n```\r\nsrc\r\n- TestFolder\r\n    - nuget.config\r\n    - TestProject.sln\r\n- nuget.confg\r\n```\r\n\r\nWe expect that the `nuget.config` closest to `TestProject.sln` (with `correctPackages` defined) will be used.\r\n\r\n4. Run the following from root: `nuget restore src\\TestFolder\\TestProject.sln` and see the packages are installed to `incorrectPackages` in root.\r\n\r\n### Sample Project\r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/jonnykrysh/nuget-issue\r\n\r\n"},{"Id":"9900793695","Type":"IssuesEvent","CreatedAt":"2019-06-26T20:05:01","Actor":"rrelyea","Repository":"NuGet/Home","Organization":"NuGet","RawContent":null,"RelatedAction":"closed","RelatedUrl":"https://github.com/NuGet/Home/issues/8263","RelatedDescription":"Closed issue \"NuGet.CommandLine as dotnet global tool\" (#8263) at NuGet/Home","RelatedBody":"I'm resolving various tools in a build script using `dotnet tool install`:\r\n\r\n```ps1\r\ndotnet tool install altcover.global --tool-path tools\r\ndotnet tool install Codecov.Tool --tool-path tools\r\n\r\n# ...\r\n\r\ntools\\altcover --inputDirectory=...\r\ntools\\codecov --name=...\r\n```\r\n\r\n(After 3.0 is released, I'll be using the beautiful and amazing https://github.com/dotnet/cli/issues/10288 to do the same thing.)\r\n\r\nOne of the tasks I want to do from the build script is `nuget sign`.
