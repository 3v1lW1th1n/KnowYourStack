It looks like this process somehow stopped working for Saucelabs Android devices. I tried updating to Android 9 and 10, but the same issue surfaced.\r\n\r\nIn the past, we had similar issues and the issue magically got resolved after we opened up a support ticket. They mentioned that they had issues (no real details), and that everything should work again.\r\n\r\nIn general though, I think we could improve the stability of our tests by not relying on this Saucelabs process. Even though this issue doesn't surface too often, we had it a couple of times now, and identifying the issue / temporarily disabling tests slows down the overall productivity. Not mentioning the fact that all PRs are red..\r\n\r\nI personally think it would be worth doing such a change, so that we don't need to worry about it in the future, don't need to spend resources investigating, and that we aren't dependent on the Saucelabs support to fix/investigate it. The impact of such outage seems to cause unnecessary slow-down for the caretaker, dev-infra (in terms of investigating) and the PR submitters (who need to rebase etc.). We can make this more stable long-term by adding an alias for `localhost` to the CircleCI hosts, and using that from within the Saucelabs browsers. These requests will always go through the tunnel (might be even faster that way). Similar solutions seem to be recommended by SauceLabs if specifically needed ports aren't forwarded by the Saucelabs VM process, so the solution seems somewhat proven.","Url":"https://github.com/angular/angular/pull/35171","RelatedDescription":"Open PR \"ci: ensure saucelabs browsers can load karma test page\" (#35171)"},{"Id":"560553344","IsPullRequest":false,"CreatedAt":"2020-02-05T18:33:11","Actor":"ajitsinghkaler","Number":"35170","RawContent":null,"Title":"Add end to end tests for api search functionality","State":"open","Body":"<!--🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅\r\n\r\nOh hi there! 😄\r\n\r\nTo expedite issue processing please search open and closed issues before submitting a new one.\r\nExisting issues often contain information about workarounds, resolution, or progress updates.\r\n\r\n🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅-->\r\n\r\n# 📚 Docs or angular.io bug report\r\n\r\n### Description\r\n\r\nAdd end to end tests for api search functionality on https://angular.io/api.

We’ve noticed an issue that when navigating away from a route, at least some of the loaded components are getting destroyed **but not** deallocated and garbage collected. (The issue might not be restricted to routing.)\r\n\r\nThe problem is that unnecessary memory is not deallocated, which might lead to problems on mobile and other low-memory devices and might also have security implications (e.g. when sensitive state remains in memory, even after a user has logged out).\r\n\r\n## 🔬 Minimal Reproduction\r\n\r\nHere is a minimal repo of the problem. It’s a plain Angular CLI application with three routes and four components:\r\n\r\n* `/#/route1` (`Route1Component`) includes the `ContentComponent` as a child that loads the contents of a large file retrieved via the network into a field of its class during `ngOnInit`, consuming some memory. This component logs to the console when it’s being initialized or destroyed.\r\n* `/#/route2` (`Route2Component`) and `route3` (`Route3Component`) don’t include this component.\r\n\r\n**Repro steps:**\r\n\r\n```\r\ngit clone https://github.com/thinktecture-labs/ivy-mem-leak.git\r\ncd ivy-mem-leak\r\nnpm i\r\nnpm start\r\n```\r\n\r\n* Open http://localhost:4200/#/route3\r\n* Open Chrome dev tools > Memory\r\n* Click 🔴 _Take Heap Snapshot_\r\n* Open http://localhost:4200/#/route2\r\n* Take a snapshot (size should stay roughly the same)\r\n* Open http://localhost:4200/#/route1, wait until the large file has been downloaded (check the _Network_ tab)\r\n* Take a snapshot (size should be larger than before)\r\n* Open http://localhost:4200/#/route2\r\n* Take a snapshot (size should not significantly change, even though the `ContentComponent` was destroyed, check the _Console_ tab)\r\n\r\nStop `ng serve` and compare this with the behavior of Angular 8:\r\n\r\n```\r\ngit checkout ng8\r\nnpm i\r\nnpm start\r\n```\r\n\r\n* Click 🚫 _Clear All Profiles_\r\n* Open http://localhost:4200/#/route3\r\n* Take a snapshot\r\n* Open http://localhost:4200/#/route2\r\n* Take a snapshot (size should stay roughly the same)\r\n* Open http://localhost:4200/#/route1\r\n* Take a snapshot (should be larger than before)\r\n* Open http://localhost:4200/#/route2\r\n* Take a snapshot (should be similar to the first two snapshots again)\r\n\r\n## 🔥 Exception or Error\r\n\r\nThe memory of `route1`’s components doesn’t seem to be correctly deallocated when leaving `route1` for `route2` on Angular 9/Ivy:\r\n\r\n| Angular 9/Ivy  | Angular 8/View Engine |\r\n| ------------- | ------------- |\r\n| ![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/6698344/73792514-bf6cab00-47a4-11ea-80e1-0de438081183.png)  | ![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/6698344/73792454-a06e1900-47a4-11ea-9c84-3470bd5e4e12.png) |\r\n\r\nAs per DevTools, (at least) the component instance of the `ContentComponent` seems to be retained by a `contextLView` array even after it has been destroyed:\r\n\r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/6698344/73793133-0a3af280-47a6-11ea-8aa1-2ed23ce08d3d.png)\r\n\r\nIs this behavior intended or is this a bug?\r\n\r\nResearched by @ManuelRauber, @thomashilzendegen and me.\r\n\r\n## 🌍  Your Environment\r\n\r\n**Angular Version:**\r\n<pre><code>\r\n     _                      _                 ____ _     ___\r\n    / \\   _ __   __ _ _   _| | __ _ _ __     / ___| |   |_ _|\r\n   / △ \\ | '_ \\ / _` | | | | |/ _` | '__|   | |   | |    | |\r\n  / ___ \\| | | | (_| | |_| | | (_| | |      | |___| |___ | |\r\n /_/   \\_\\_| |_|\\__, |\\__,_|_|\\__,_|_|       \\____|_____|___|\r\n                |___/\r\n\r\n\r\nAngular CLI: 9.0.0-rc.12\r\nNode: 12.14.1\r\nOS: darwin x64\r\n\r\nAngular: 9.0.0-rc.14\r\n... animations, common, compiler, compiler-cli, core, forms\r\n... language-service, platform-browser, platform-browser-dynamic\r\n... router\r\nIvy Workspace: Yes\r\n\r\nPackage                           Version\r\n-----------------------------------------------------------\r\n@angular-devkit/architect         0.900.0-rc.12\r\n@angular-devkit/build-angular     0.900.0-rc.12\r\n@angular-devkit/build-optimizer   0.900.0-rc.12\r\n@angular-devkit/build-webpack     0.900.0-rc.12\r\n@angular-devkit/core              9.0.0-rc.12\r\n@angular-devkit/schematics        9.0.0-rc.12\r\n@angular/cli                      9.0.0-rc.12\r\n@ngtools/webpack                  9.0.0-rc.12\r\n@schematics/angular               9.0.0-rc.12\r\n@schematics/update                0.900.0-rc.12\r\nrxjs                              6.5.4\r\ntypescript                        3.7.5\r\nwebpack                           4.41.2\r\n</code></pre>\r\n\r\n**Anything else relevant?**\r\n<!-- ✍️Is this a browser specific issue?

I think there are competing setups of different development environments.\r\n\r\n### Description\r\n\r\nThere seem to be different interpretations where the `sockjs-node` endpoint of the webpack development server should be reachable.\r\n\r\nMy usecase:\r\n\r\nI have an Asp.Net Core project with multiple angular-apps on the client side. Each Angular dev-server runs on a different port (configured in angular.json in `projects.appX.architect.serve.port`.\r\nIn `projects.appX.architect.build.deployUrl` is the `/appX/ `, because every request under that url is redirected either to the static files of the built app (in production mode) or proxied to the dev-server (in development mode).\r\n\r\nThe url of the Asp.Net Core project is given as `public-host` to `ng serve`, so each live-reload client knows, where to reach its server (something like `https://localhost:44733/appX`, all apps get the same url obviously). Every request on the baseHref of each app is proxied to the right port of the corresponding dev-server (which is configured within the Asp.Net Core project).\r\n\r\nThe Asp.Net Core backend doesn't change the request path on these request, so a request heading to `public-host/appX/sockjs-node/info` will be proxied to `http://localhost:4500/appX/sockjs-node/info`. Unfortunatly webpack was listening on `http://localhost:4500/sockjs-node/info` so live-reloading didn't work.\r\n\r\nCommit 5260bbb added the missing webpack option so everything worked fine. But this seem to break other people's setup, because they configured their reverse proxies in a different way, so all requests to `public-host/appX/sockjs-node` are forwarded to `http://localhost:4500/sockjs-node/info`.\r\n\r\nIs there any kind of configuration option, so I can serve the `sockjs-node` endpoint under the baseHref? Maybe I'm missing something, but the documentation is not very clear about the topic, how baseHref, deployUrl, servePath and publicHost are meant to work together.\r\n\r\nDoes any option of these have an effect on webpack?","Url":"https://github.com/angular/angular-cli/issues/16836","RelatedDescription":"Open issue \"live-reloading broken (again): misunderstandings about webpack's sockPath\" (#16836)"},{"Id":"559913964","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2020-02-04T19:17:43","Actor":"sacgrover","Number":"16835","RawContent":null,"Title":"Schematics: rename to a non-existing dir fails on sync to disk #16484","State":"closed","Body":"Schematics: rename to a non-existing dir fails on sync to disk #16484","Url":"https://github.com/angular/angular-cli/pull/16835","RelatedDescription":"Closed or merged PR \"Schematics: rename to a non-existing dir fails on sync to disk #16484\" (#16835)"},{"Id":"559811306","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2020-02-04T18:15:04","Actor":"alan-agius4","Number":"16830","RawContent":null,"Title":"[LTS] fix(@angular-devkit/build-angular): provide supported browsers to babel","State":"closed","Body":"By default the browserslist `configPath` will default to `process.cwd()`.

Each function has a reference to another function in the same namespace\r\n}\r\n\r\nexport namespace Hello { // Repeats as above\r\n  export function g1() { \r\n    // ...\r\n  }\r\n}\r\n\r\n// ...\r\n// There are several more all with the same namespace name\r\n// each function in each namespace has a unique name, there are no collisions\r\n\r\n```\r\n\r\nI then dynamically access the namespace using the function names as accessors, i.e. \r\n```ts\r\nimport { Hello } from './hello';\r\n\r\n// get the function name, so we can access Hello;\r\nconst name = Hello.f1.name;\r\n\r\nHello[name] // this will break when AOT/Prod is enabled since variables are renamed\r\n// So we do\r\nconst key = Object.keys(Hello).find(key => Hello[key].name === name)\r\n\r\nHello[key] // This doesn't work but should\r\n```\r\n\r\nThe problem is that when using multiple namespaces that merge during compilation, the way functions are enumerated restarts for each `export namespace Hello { ...`. The problem goes away when only one namespace is used.\r\n\r\n\r\n## 🔬 Minimal Reproduction\r\nhttps://stackblitz.com/edit/angular-issue-repro2-fljw6o\r\n\r\n**The problem only presents itself when running in production mode with AOT.**\r\n\r\n**So please download and try locally**\r\n\r\nThe app takes the two namespaces, logs their keys, then logs the names of the functions associated with the keys. You can see that the split up namespace has duplicated function names, while the mono-namespace has unique names.\r\n\r\n## 🌍  Your Environment\r\n\r\n**Angular Version:**\r\n<pre><code>\r\nAngular CLI: 9.0.0-rc.10\r\nNode: 12.14.1\r\nOS: linux x64\r\n\r\nAngular: 9.0.0-rc.11\r\n... common, compiler, compiler-cli, core, language-service\r\n... platform-browser, platform-browser-dynamic, router\r\nIvy Workspace: Yes\r\n\r\nPackage                           Version\r\n-----------------------------------------------------------\r\n@angular-devkit/architect         0.900.0-rc.10\r\n@angular-devkit/build-angular     0.900.0-rc.10\r\n@angular-devkit/build-optimizer   0.900.0-rc.10\r\n@angular-devkit/build-webpack     0.900.0-rc.10\r\n@angular-devkit/core              9.0.0-rc.10\r\n@angular-devkit/schematics        9.0.0-rc.10\r\n@angular/cli                      9.0.0-rc.10\r\n@ngtools/webpack                  9.0.0-rc.10\r\n@schematics/angular               9.0.0-rc.10\r\n@schematics/update                0.900.0-rc.10\r\nrxjs                              6.5.4\r\ntypescript                        3.7.5\r\nwebpack                           4.41.2\r\n</code></pre>\r\n","Url":"https://github.com/angular/angular-cli/issues/16831","RelatedDescription":"Open issue \"Prod minified code breaks app when using namespace merging\" (#16831)"},{"Id":"558710781","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2020-02-02T15:16:53","Actor":"schneiderl","Number":"16816","RawContent":null,"Title":"multiple files: fix typos","State":"open","Body":"Please be aware that this pull request was automatically created using [gtf](https://github.com/schneiderl/gtf) - a typo fixing bot\r\n\r\nYou should be able to merge this with no other problems.\r\nIn case the proposed changes do not make sense, I would be glad to hear about it.","Url":"https://github.com/angular/angular-cli/pull/16816","RelatedDescription":"Open PR \"multiple files: fix typos\" (#16816)"},{"Id":"558516773","IsPullRequest":false,"CreatedAt":"2020-02-01T10:00:58","Actor":"xiaoxiangmoe","Number":"16814","RawContent":null,"Title":"support rootDirs in typescript","State":"open","Body":"<!--🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅\r\n\r\nOh hi there! 😄\r\n\r\nTo expedite issue processing please search open and closed issues before submitting a new one.\r\nExisting issues often contain information about workarounds, resolution, or progress updates.\r\n\r\n🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅-->\r\n\r\n\r\n# 🚀 Feature request\r\n\r\n\r\n### Command (mark with an `x`)\r\n<!-- Can you pin-point the command or commands that are relevant for this feature request? -->\r\n<!-- ✍️edit: -->\r\n- [ ] new\r\n- [x] build\r\n- [x] serve\r\n- [ ] test\r\n- [ ] e2e\r\n- [ ] generate\r\n- [ ] add\r\n- [ ] update\r\n- [ ] lint\r\n- [ ] xi18n\r\n- [ ] run\r\n- [ ] config\r\n- [ ] help\r\n- [ ] version\r\n- [ ] doc\r\n\r\n### Description\r\n\r\nhttp://www.typescriptlang.org/docs/handbook/release-notes/typescript-2-0.html#virtual-directories-with-rootdirs\r\n","Url":"https://github.com/angular/angular-cli/issues/16814","RelatedDescription":"Open issue \"support rootDirs in typescript\" (#16814)"}],"ResultType":"GitHubIssue"},"material2-Issues":{"Issues":[{"Id":"560721925","IsPullRequest":false,"CreatedAt":"2020-02-06T01:17:39","Actor":"keatkeat87","Number":"18409","RawContent":null,"Title":"ChipList allow to set null or empty string instead of undefined when nothing select","State":"open","Body":"#### Feature Description\r\nCurrently, when chip list no select anything the ngModel value will be undefined.\r\nbut sometime null or empty string is better chose.\r\nso i suggest to let's user to set the fallbackValue. \r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/8691013/73897549-65add300-48c1-11ea-8f35-65f7c005a418.png)\r\n\r\n\r\n \r\n","Url":"https://github.com/angular/components/issues/18409","RelatedDescription":"Open issue \"ChipList allow to set null or empty string instead of undefined when nothing select\" (#18409)"},{"Id":"560709152","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2020-02-06T00:40:06","Actor":"jelbourn","Number":"18408","RawContent":null,"Title":"chore: bump version to 9.0.0-rc.10 w/ changelog","State":"closed","Body":"","Url":"https://github.com/angular/components/pull/18408","RelatedDescription":"Closed or merged PR \"chore: bump version to 9.0.0-rc.10 w/ changelog\" (#18408)"},{"Id":"560658304","IsPullRequest":false,"CreatedAt":"2020-02-06T00:17:57","Actor":"matiasnoriega","Number":"18405","RawContent":null,"Title":"Sidenav not working properly","State":"closed","Body":"## What are you trying to do?\r\n\r\nI'm trying to implement mat-drawer, a sidenav, on a simple project but even on the online documentation it only shows plain text if it even works.

We did this because it was unclear how to proceed\r\ndue to a limitation with the MDC notched-outline.\r\n\r\nAfter chatting more with the MDC team about this, and experimenting with\r\nmore alternatives, the form-field will now follow MDC as close as\r\npossible. Instead of requiring changes upstream to MDC which aren't\r\nnecessarily reasonable (due to us supporting arbitrary prefix/suffix\r\ncontent), we just use the notched-outline as intended.\r\n\r\nTo summarize what happened before: Our form-field supports abitrary\r\nprefixes and suffixes. This is different in MDC, which always assumes a\r\nfixed width/size for prefixes and suffixes. Ultimately, this causes\r\nproblems for us since in the outline appearance, the label should\r\nbe relative to the infix container (not overlap prefixes), but still\r\nbe aligned vertically over the prefix container. MDC achieves this by\r\nsimply shifting the label by a fixed amount of pixels (since they only\r\nallow a specific width for prefixes and suffixes). This won't work for\r\nus since our prefix container can scale as much as possible.\r\n\r\nTo reasonably fix this issue in a way that leverages/follows MDC as much\r\nas possible, we determine the prefix container width programmatically\r\nand shift the floating label horizontally based on the measured width.\r\nThis is basically the same approach MDC takes.. just that we have a\r\ndynamic label offset measured at runtime.\r\n\r\nFor more context on the issue, refer to the original feature request in\r\nMDC: material-components/material-components-web#5326.","Url":"https://github.com/angular/components/pull/18381","RelatedDescription":"Open PR \"fix(material-experimental/mdc-form-field): notched-outline should include prefixes and suffixes\" (#18381)"},{"Id":"559649013","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2020-02-04T11:12:33","Actor":"RudarDaman","Number":"18380","RawContent":null,"Title":"docs: responsiveness of examples in angular version 7.3.x","State":"open","Body":"![Screenshot from 2020-02-04 14-45-58](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/15893684/73739994-5453b200-476d-11ea-9c9f-29e7ef0913be.png)\r\n","Url":"https://github.com/angular/components/pull/18380","RelatedDescription":"Open PR \"docs: responsiveness of examples in angular version 7.3.x\" (#18380)"}],"ResultType":"GitHubIssue"}},"RunOn":"2020-02-06T05:30:06.5176955Z","RunDurationInMilliseconds":2781}
