For example, although DbProviderFactory is the all encompassing root concept if you need everything from an ADO.NET provider, a DbConnection can give you everything but DbConnectionStringBuilder, and it is a much more familiar abstraction for most users than the DbProviderFactory. So, unless you need to manipulate connection strings in a provider agnostic way (not commonly an useful thing to do), you could make the sugar Load method generic on the provider's DbConnection type.\r\nAll in all, I would would love to meet with you and the devs and walk trough the product code and API.
