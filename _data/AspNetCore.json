It can look like this\r\n````\r\npublic class Organization\r\n{\r\n    public string Id { get; set; }\r\n    public string Name { get; set; }\r\n    public string Address { get; set; }\r\n\r\n    // Some other properties\r\n}\r\n````\r\nA user can be a member of many organization.\r\nThe next step is to extend `UserManager` with some methods\r\n````\r\nAddUserToOrganizationAsync\r\nRemoveUserFromOrganizationAsync\r\nGetUserOrganizationsAsync\r\n````\r\n\r\nMy question is: what is the proper way to implement these methods?\r\n1. Should I invent a new class `UserOgranizationInfo` (analogue of `UserLoginInfo`)?\r\n\r\nSo the methods will look like\r\n````\r\npublic class UserOgranizationInfo\r\n{\r\n    public string Id { get; set; }\r\n    public string Name { get; set; }\r\n}\r\n\r\npublic class MyUserManager<TUser> : UserManager<TUser> where TUser : class\r\n{\r\n    public Task AddUserToOrganizationAsync(TUser user, UserOrganizationInfo org);\r\n    public Task RemoveUserFromOrganizationAsync(TUser user, UserOrganizationInfo org);\r\n    public Task<IEnumerable<UserOrganazationInfo>>GetUserOrganizationsAsync(TUser user);\r\n}\r\n````\r\n\r\n2. Or is it normal to use my entity type here?\r\n\r\nSo my UserManager will look like\r\n````\r\npublic MyUserManager<TUser, TOrganization> : UserManager<TUser>\r\n    where TUser : class, TOrganization : class\r\n{\r\n     // Other code\r\n\r\n    public Task AddUserToOrganizationAsync(TUser user, TOrganization org);\r\n    public Task RemoveUserFromOrganizationAsync(TUser user, TOrganization org);\r\n    public Task<IEnumerable<TOrganazation>>GetUserOrganizationsAsync(TUser user);\r\n\r\n    // Other code\r\n}\r\n````\r\n\r\nOr even more simpler\r\n````\r\npublic MyUserManager: UserManager<IdentityUser>\r\n{\r\n     // Other code\r\n\r\n    public Task AddUserToOrganizationAsync(IdentityUseruser, Organization org);\r\n    public Task RemoveUserFromOrganizationAsync(IdentityUseruser, Organization org);\r\n    public Task<IEnumerable<Organazation>>GetUserOrganizationsAsync(IdentityUser user);\r\n\r\n    // Other code\r\n}\r\n````\r\n\r\nI think that the only purpose for the first case (with `UserOrganizationInfo`) is to support store that doesn't support Organizations at all. In this case it will be quite inconvenient to add dependency on Organization.\r\nBut if I know that my stores and my UserManager will always support Organizations the second way is ok, is it? Because the second way is much more convenient: we can get full organization info directly from the UserManager rather than from additional `OrganizationManager` class.\r\n\r\nAm I right?\r\n\r\n"},{"Id":"6658674214","Type":"PullRequestEvent","CreatedAt":"2017-09-30T22:26:44","Actor":"mvas","Repository":"aspnet/Identity","Organization":"aspnet","RawContent":null,"RelatedAction":"closed","RelatedUrl":"https://github.com/aspnet/Identity/pull/1305","RelatedDescription":"Closed pull request \"fixed typos, mostly in documentation comments.\" (#1305) at aspnet/Identity","RelatedBody":"fixed typos, mostly in documentation comments\r\n-mostly xml docs\r\n-some comments\r\n-log string"}],"ResultType":"GitHubEvent"},"Kestrel":{"Events":[{"Id":"6670029069","Type":"PullRequestEvent","CreatedAt":"2017-10-03T21:34:15","Actor":"halter73","Repository":"aspnet/KestrelHttpServer","Organization":"aspnet","RawContent":null,"RelatedAction":"merged","RelatedUrl":"https://github.com/aspnet/KestrelHttpServer/pull/2092","RelatedDescription":"Merged pull request \"Fix flaky MaxRequestBodySizeTest\" (#2092) at aspnet/KestrelHttpServer","RelatedBody":"- Don't attempt to send any data after the request might already be rejected.\r\n\r\n#1926"}],"ResultType":"GitHubEvent"},"Razor":{"Events":[{"Id":"6671100552","Type":"IssuesEvent","CreatedAt":"2017-10-04T04:53:09","Actor":"NTaylorMullen","Repository":"aspnet/Razor","Organization":"aspnet","RawContent":null,"RelatedAction":"closed","RelatedUrl":"https://github.com/aspnet/Razor/issues/1704","RelatedDescription":"Closed issue \"Autocompletion removes code and does not commit on space\" (#1704) at aspnet/Razor","RelatedBody":"VS 15.4.0 Preview 3\r\n\r\nCreate a default ASP.NET Core app, and make one of the cshtml files contain the following:\r\n\r\n```C#\r\n@if (Model.HasText)\r\n{\r\n\t@if (Model.Count < 1)\r\n\t{\r\n\r\n\t}\r\n\telse\r\n\t{\r\n\t\tif (Model.IsHappy)\r\n\t\t{\r\n\t\t\t<table>\r\n\t\t\t|\r\n\t\t\t</table>\r\n\t\t}\r\n\t\telse\r\n\t\t{\r\n\t\t\t<table>\r\n\t\t\t@foreach (var group in Model.SadGroups)\r\n\t\t\t{\r\n\t\t\t\t<tr><td>@group.Key</td></tr>\r\n\t\t\t}\r\n\t\t\t</table>\r\n\t\t}\r\n\t}\r\n\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nInside the first `<table>`, type `@fore` and hit space so that `@foreach` is committed.\r\n\r\nExpected:\r\n```C#\r\n...\r\n\t\tif (Model.IsHappy)\r\n\t\t{\r\n\t\t\t<table>\r\n\t\t\t@foreach |\r\n\t\t\t</table>\r\n\t\t}\r\n...\r\n```\r\n\r\nActual:\r\n```C#\r\n...\r\n\t\tif (Model.IsHappy)\r\n\t\t{\r\n\t\t\t<table>\r\n\t\t\t@fore  |\r\n\t\t\t</table>\r\n\t\t\t<table>\r\n\t\t\t@foreach (var group in Model.SadGroups)\r\n\t\t\t{\r\n\t\t\t\t<tr><td>@group.Key</td></tr>\r\n\t\t\t}\r\n\t\t\t</table>\r\n\t\t}\r\n...\r\n```\r\n\r\nHTML spacing is set to tabs, C# spacing is set to spaces.\r\n\r\nNote that this works as expected if the autocompletion is invoked manually using Ctrl+Space."},{"Id":"6669743680","Type":"IssuesEvent","CreatedAt":"2017-10-03T20:29:50","Actor":"ajaybhargavb","Repository":"aspnet/Razor","Organization":"aspnet","RawContent":null,"RelatedAction":"closed","RelatedUrl":"https://github.com/aspnet/Razor/issues/1461","RelatedDescription":"Closed issue \"Hitting <Enter> after \"@page\" in a Razor page indents unnecessarily\" (#1461) at aspnet/Razor","RelatedBody":"![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/54385/27452348-1c515fce-5747-11e7-974b-eebd95717ce7.png)\r\n\r\nThe screenshot shows the editor immediately after `<Enter>`. `<Backspace>` once puts the cursor back at the beginning of the line."},{"Id":"6667801139","Type":"IssuesEvent","CreatedAt":"2017-10-03T13:51:52","Actor":"kurtiswen","Repository":"aspnet/Razor","Organization":"aspnet","RawContent":null,"RelatedAction":"opened","RelatedUrl":"https://github.com/aspnet/Razor/issues/1708","RelatedDescription":"Opened issue \"can razor pages update part of the webpage\" (#1708) at aspnet/Razor","RelatedBody":"sorry, haven't been coding in asp.net for a long time. Recently started a new project and I'm now considering using asp.net core 2.0 with razor pages, which sames good for fast developing. But I'm confused about how could I make a complex web page to be only partial update, like using ajax. means I may only want to post a part of the web page bank to server, and make some update only in the part of the web page instead of refreshing the whole page. I wander if there is already a way to do this using razor pages in asp.net core 2.0."},{"Id":"6664017493","Type":"IssuesEvent","CreatedAt":"2017-10-02T18:33:18","Actor":"RandyBuchholz","Repository":"aspnet/Razor","Organization":"aspnet","RawContent":null,"RelatedAction":"opened","RelatedUrl":"https://github.com/aspnet/Razor/issues/1707","RelatedDescription":"Opened issue \"Question - Razor Pages -  What is the CSS in Head?\" (#1707) at aspnet/Razor","RelatedBody":"I created a default Razor Pages project.
