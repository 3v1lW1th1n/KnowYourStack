While this can be done in C# today by using COM interop, you have to roll your own `IDataObject` implementation to do so, as the default Windows Forms one does not support setting arbitrary COM-based private formats into the data object, per Windows requirements. Would it be possible to update the Windows Forms `DataObject` class to enable this? (It would be even better if there would be higher-level code added to obviate the need to do custom COM interop to use thesee features, but I do not know what the API design for that would look like.)
