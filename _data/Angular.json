At runtime, however, `styleMap` would set invalid styles that look like `<div style=\"0:w;1:i;2:d;3:t;4:h;5::;7:1;\">`. In `ViewEngine` interpolations inside `style` weren't supported either, however there we'd output invalid styles like `<div style=\"unsafe\">`, even if the content was trusted.\r\n\r\n**Note:** it looks like the Codefresh failure isn't due to these changes.","Url":"https://github.com/angular/angular/pull/31211","RelatedDescription":"Open PR \"refactor(ivy): move classMap interpolation logic internally\" (#31211)"},{"Id":"459484223","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2019-06-22T15:25:12","Actor":"JoostK","Number":"31210","RawContent":null,"Title":"fix(ivy): include type parameter for `ngBaseDef` declaration","State":"open","Body":"When a class uses Angular decorators such as `@Input`, `@Output` and\r\nfriends without an Angular class decorator, they are compiled into a\r\nstatic `ngBaseDef` field on the class, with the TypeScript declaration\r\nof the class being altered to declare the `ngBaseDef` field to be of type\r\n`…µ…µBaseDef`.

Please describe:\r\n\r\n\r\n## What is the current behavior?\r\n\r\nIssue Number: #31116\r\n\r\nQuestion mark characters were not accepted as part of a query parameter value, despite them being valid according to the URI spec. This was particularly a problem for including a URL (such as a redirect) as a query param.\r\n\r\n## What is the new behavior?\r\n\r\nThe query param value regex has been relaxed to allow question marks. I have left the query param key regex unchanged, as there seems to be less reason for having question marks as part of a query param key, and this might be more likely to cause problems.\r\n\r\n## Does this PR introduce a breaking change?\r\n\r\n- [ ] Yes\r\n- [ ] No\r\n\r\nI'm not 100% sure. I suppose theoretically there could applications that rely, knowingly or unknowingly, on the previous behaviour. E.g. an app that is loaded with URLs or other question-mark-containing strings as query string params and relies on this behaviour to strip out the \"?\" and everything after it in order to product strings that are valid for the app's purposes.\r\n\r\n## Other information\r\n","Url":"https://github.com/angular/angular/pull/31187","RelatedDescription":"Open PR \"fix(router): Allow question marks in query param values\" (#31187)"},{"Id":"459197939","IsPullRequest":false,"CreatedAt":"2019-06-21T13:27:39","Actor":"SoAsEr","Number":"31186","RawContent":null,"Title":"Docs: where you can use template variables","State":"open","Body":"# üìö Docs or angular.io bug report\r\n\r\n### Description\r\n\r\nAccording to the docs: https://angular.io/guide/template-syntax#ref-vars\r\n\r\n>You can refer to a template reference variable anywhere in the component's template.\r\n\r\nHowever, as mentioned here: https://github.com/angular/angular/issues/6179\r\nyou cannot link a template reference variable which was declared in an ngIf outside of it.

This one works fine on every situation (despite the performace issues that may arise when using large dataproviders)\r\n\r\nThe one on the right is a mat-select using virtual-scroll. This one has several issues. I will just describe one here which I believe it's not been filed yet.\r\n\r\nSteps to reproduce:\r\n\r\n1. Select an option from the mat-select on the Right.

I use custom directive to do that.\r\n\r\n#### What troubleshooting steps have you tried?\r\n\r\nI use a custom directive to manage zoom on my application layout to bind my user zoom settings. But, mat-select/mat-dialog/mat-menu overlay is out of body element, so overlay don't get css zoom. I have to use [panelClass] input to override size with static css class.\r\n\r\nI don't want to set panelClass attribute every time I need to use \"mat-overlay-component\". \r\n\r\nMaybe there is a better way to do that ?\r\n\r\nSame issue with mat-dialog\r\n\r\n#### Reproduction\r\n\r\nhttps://stackblitz.com/edit/angular-material-example-4wem1y\r\n  \r\n#### Environment\r\n\r\n- Angular: 8.0.0\r\n- CDK/Material: 8.0.0\r\n- Browser(s): chrome 75.0\r\n- Operating System: Windows \r\n","Url":"https://github.com/angular/components/issues/16342","RelatedDescription":"Open issue \"Zoom on overlay mat-components\" (#16342)"},{"Id":"458563487","IsPullRequest":false,"CreatedAt":"2019-06-20T12:45:34","Actor":"benneq","Number":"16340","RawContent":null,"Title":"Bottom Sheet with TemplateRef","State":"closed","Body":"#### Feature Description\r\n\r\nBottom Sheet should be able to display a TemplateRef.
