Today, this property is always `\"\"` on catalog leafs.\r\n\r\n### To Reproduce\r\n\r\nSee the `packageTypes` property on the following catalog leafs:\r\n\r\n* .NET CLI tool: https://api.nuget.org/v3/catalog0/data/2018.10.17.01.01.10/dotnet-xunit.2.4.0-beta.1.build3958.json\r\n* .NET CLI template: https://api.nuget.org/v3/catalog0/data/2018.11.30.06.14.50/giraffe-template.0.1.0-alpha007.json\r\n\r\n### Expected behavior\r\nThe catalog leaf should be a JSON array of all the package type names in the nuspec. For example:\r\n\r\n```\r\n\"packageTypes\": [\r\n    \"DotnetCliTool\"\r\n]\r\n```\r\n\r\n### Additional context\r\nThis is necessary to properly support package type filtering (see https://github.com/NuGet/NuGetGallery/issues/5762). Today, the job mutating the search index must guess the package type from the catalog leafs' `packageEntries` property. This approach isn't ideal as the search index must be rebuilt when a new package type is introduced."},{"Id":"11191797733","Type":"IssuesEvent","CreatedAt":"2020-01-02T16:23:30","Actor":"joelverhagen","Repository":"NuGet/NuGetGallery","Organization":"NuGet","RawContent":null,"RelatedAction":"closed","RelatedUrl":"https://github.com/NuGet/NuGetGallery/issues/7755","RelatedDescription":"Closed issue \"[PackageType]Add E2E test to push and then search by a DotnetTool package\" (#7755) at NuGet/NuGetGallery","RelatedBody":""},{"Id":"11185296134","Type":"IssuesEvent","CreatedAt":"2020-01-01T00:07:53","Actor":"loic-sharma","Repository":"NuGet/NuGetGallery","Organization":"NuGet","RawContent":null,"RelatedAction":"opened","RelatedUrl":"https://github.com/NuGet/NuGetGallery/issues/7794","RelatedDescription":"Opened issue \"Permission system does n+1 queries to fetch users' organizations\" (#7794) at NuGet/NuGetGallery","RelatedBody":"### Describe the bug\r\nThis line performs n+1 SQL queriers, where n is the number of organizations the user is in:\r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/NuGet/NuGetGallery/blob/90f8fbea00217db2e5d918e140621c0aea0ca12d/src/NuGetGallery.Services/Permissions/ActionRequiringEntityPermissions.cs#L79\r\n\r\nFor example, if I am a user in two organizations, the following SQL queries will be generated:\r\n\r\n```sql\r\n// Get my memberships\r\nexec sp_executesql N'SELECT \r\n    [Extent1].[OrganizationKey] AS [OrganizationKey], \r\n    [Extent1].[MemberKey] AS [MemberKey], \r\n    [Extent1].[IsAdmin] AS [IsAdmin]\r\n    FROM [dbo].[Memberships] AS [Extent1]\r\n    WHERE [Extent1].[MemberKey] = @EntityKeyValue1',N'@EntityKeyValue1 int',@EntityKeyValue1=1\r\n\r\n// Load the first organization\r\nexec sp_executesql N'SELECT \r\n    ''0X0X'' AS [C1], \r\n    [Extent1].[Key] AS [Key], \r\n    [Extent2].[EmailAddress] AS [EmailAddress], \r\n    [Extent2].[UnconfirmedEmailAddress] AS [UnconfirmedEmailAddress], \r\n    [Extent2].[Username] AS [Username], \r\n    [Extent2].[EmailAllowed] AS [EmailAllowed], \r\n    [Extent2].[IsDeleted] AS [IsDeleted], \r\n    [Extent2].[EnableMultiFactorAuthentication] AS [EnableMultiFactorAuthentication], \r\n    [Extent2].[NotifyPackagePushed] AS [NotifyPackagePushed], \r\n    [Extent2].[EmailConfirmationToken] AS [EmailConfirmationToken], \r\n    [Extent2].[PasswordResetToken] AS [PasswordResetToken], \r\n    [Extent2].[PasswordResetTokenExpirationDate] AS [PasswordResetTokenExpirationDate], \r\n    [Extent2].[CreatedUtc] AS [CreatedUtc], \r\n    [Extent2].[LastFailedLoginUtc] AS [LastFailedLoginUtc], \r\n    [Extent2].[FailedLoginCount] AS [FailedLoginCount]\r\n    FROM  [dbo].[Organizations] AS [Extent1]\r\n    INNER JOIN [dbo].[Users] AS [Extent2] ON [Extent1].[Key] = [Extent2].[Key]\r\n    WHERE [Extent1].[Key] = @EntityKeyValue1',N'@EntityKeyValue1 int',@EntityKeyValue1=3\r\n\r\n//Load the second organization\r\nexec sp_executesql N'SELECT \r\n    ''0X0X'' AS [C1], \r\n    [Extent1].[Key] AS [Key], \r\n    [Extent2].[EmailAddress] AS [EmailAddress], \r\n    [Extent2].[UnconfirmedEmailAddress] AS [UnconfirmedEmailAddress], \r\n    [Extent2].[Username] AS [Username], \r\n    [Extent2].[EmailAllowed] AS [EmailAllowed], \r\n    [Extent2].[IsDeleted] AS [IsDeleted], \r\n    [Extent2].[EnableMultiFactorAuthentication] AS [EnableMultiFactorAuthentication], \r\n    [Extent2].[NotifyPackagePushed] AS [NotifyPackagePushed], \r\n    [Extent2].[EmailConfirmationToken] AS [EmailConfirmationToken], \r\n    [Extent2].[PasswordResetToken] AS [PasswordResetToken], \r\n    [Extent2].[PasswordResetTokenExpirationDate] AS [PasswordResetTokenExpirationDate], \r\n    [Extent2].[CreatedUtc] AS [CreatedUtc], \r\n    [Extent2].[LastFailedLoginUtc] AS [LastFailedLoginUtc], \r\n    [Extent2].[FailedLoginCount] AS [FailedLoginCount]\r\n    FROM  [dbo].[Organizations] AS [Extent1]\r\n    INNER JOIN [dbo].[Users] AS [Extent2] ON [Extent1].[Key] = [Extent2].[Key]\r\n    WHERE [Extent1].[Key] = @EntityKeyValue1',N'@EntityKeyValue1 int',@EntityKeyValue1=5\r\n```\r\n\r\n### Expected behavior\r\nThe user's organizations should be fetched with a single SQL query.\r\n\r\n### Screenshots\r\nIf applicable, add screenshots to help explain your problem.\r\n\r\n### Additional context\r\nAdd any other context about the problem here."}],"ResultType":"GitHubEvent"},"Home":{"Events":[{"Id":"11194583962","Type":"IssuesEvent","CreatedAt":"2020-01-03T01:49:11","Actor":"nkolev92","Repository":"NuGet/Home","Organization":"NuGet","RawContent":null,"RelatedAction":"opened","RelatedUrl":"https://github.com/NuGet/Home/issues/8991","RelatedDescription":"Opened issue \"Basic developer docs\" (#8991) at NuGet/Home","RelatedBody":"All of the how to work with NuGet docs should be public and on GitHub!\r\n\r\nWe should avoid the wiki for workflow related things and use the repo itself. \r\nIt improves discoverability for contributors.
