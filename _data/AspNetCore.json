To achieve that, I've created a custom UserManager which pulls the additional needed data:\r\n\r\npublic class MyDotNetCoreAppUserManager : UserManager<MyDotNetCoreAppUser>\r\n    {\r\n\r\n        public MyDotNetCoreAppUserManager(IUserStore<MyDotNetCoreAppUser> store, IOptions<IdentityOptions> optionsAccessor,\r\n        IPasswordHasher<MyDotNetCoreAppUser> passwordHasher, IEnumerable<IUserValidator<MyDotNetCoreAppUser>> userValidators,\r\n        IEnumerable<IPasswordValidator<MyDotNetCoreAppUser>> passwordValidators, ILookupNormalizer keyNormalizer,\r\n        IdentityErrorDescriber errors, IServiceProvider services, ILogger<UserManager<MyDotNetCoreAppUser>> logger)\r\n        : base(store,optionsAccessor,passwordHasher,userValidators,passwordValidators,keyNormalizer,errors,services,logger)\r\n        {\r\n        }\r\n\r\n        /// <summary>\r\n        /// Gets all users\r\n        /// </summary>\r\n        /// <param name=\"includes\">Optional parameter for eager loading related entities</param>\r\n        /// <returns>An list of users</returns>\r\n        public async Task<MyDotNetCoreAppUser> GetAll(string userName, params string[] includes)\r\n        {\r\n\r\n            // Get our User DbSet\r\n            var users = base.Users.Where(u=>u.UserName == userName);\r\n\r\n            // For each include, include in the query\r\n            foreach (var include in includes)\r\n                users = users.Include(include);\r\n\r\n            // Return our result\r\n            return await users.FirstOrDefaultAsync();\r\n        }\r\n\r\n\r\n        //This is called on initial login and is necessary to pull additional related user data\r\n        //used in claim generation.

The problem is that after 30 minutes, when it's time to revalidate the security stamp and the user refreshes, one of two things happens:\r\n\r\n-If I do NOT override FindByIdAsync, it somewhat works, meaning the user stays logged in and claims are generated - however, the user object passed ot GenerateClaimsAsync does NOT contain the required OrganizationMemberships property populated.\r\n-If I DO override FindByIdAsync, I hit that breakpoint when I refresh the page after the security stamp timeout expires. However, after I continue, I don't hit the ClaimsGeneration method. Instead, I'm logged out and redirected to the login page.\r\n\r\nAlso maybe relevant:\r\n\r\n           services.AddIdentity<MyDotNetCoreAppUser, MyDotNetCoreAppRole>(opt =>\r\n            {\r\n                opt.Password.RequireNonAlphanumeric = false;\r\n                opt.Password.RequireUppercase = false;\r\n            })\r\n                .AddEntityFrameworkStores<MyDotNetCoreAppDbContext>()\r\n                .AddUserManager<MyDotNetCoreAppUserManager>()\r\n                .AddSignInManager<MyDotNetCoreAppSignInManager>()\r\n                .AddDefaultTokenProviders();\r\n\r\n            services.AddAuthorization(opt =>\r\n            {\r\n                opt.AddPolicy(\"OrgAdmin\", policy => policy.RequireClaim(MyDotNetCoreAppClaimTypes.MyDotNetCoreAppOrgAdmin));\r\n                opt.AddPolicy(\"OrgMember\", policy => policy.RequireClaim(MyDotNetCoreAppClaimTypes.MyDotNetCoreAppOrgMember));\r\n            });\r\n            services.Configure<SecurityStampValidatorOptions>(options =>\r\n            {\r\n                // enables immediate logout, after updating the user's stat.\r\n                options.ValidationInterval = TimeSpan.FromSeconds(6);\r\n            });\r\n\r\n(I set the validation interval to 6 seconds to be able to debug the security stamp validation more easily.)\r\n\r\nAppreciative of any thoughts on this.
