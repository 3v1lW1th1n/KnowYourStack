Notice how the query params don't change according to `document.location.search` (it does change according to `this.$route.query`).\r\nIf you click on the `/foo` link and **then** click the `/home?iam=home` link then it works. I.e., changing the query params only works if you change the path as well.\r\n\r\nNote that the same problem happens if you try to push/replace routes via javascript code. For instance, none of the following 4 lines have any effect on the browser's urlbar.\r\n\r\n    this.$router.push({query: {x: 5}})\r\n    this.$router.push({path: document.location.pathname, query: {x: 5}})\r\n    this.$router.replace({query: {x: 5}})\r\n    this.$router.replace({path: document.location.pathname, query: {x: 5}})\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n### What is expected?\r\nThe query string should always be appended to the url.\r\n\r\n### What is actually happening?\r\nNothing. No error is signaled and the URL doesn't change.\r\n\r\n---\r\nIf you remove `mode: 'history'`, you get the expected behaviour.\r\nAlso, if you change the `path` to something different from the current path, you get the correct behaviour as well.\r\n\r\nAlso, even though `$route.query` gets updated, it's important for the browser's urlbar to update as well.\r\n\r\n<!-- generated by vue-issues.
