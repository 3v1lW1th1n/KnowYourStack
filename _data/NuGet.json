I need to perform some operations that aren't directly supported by existing NuGet apps or ADO build pipeline tasks, which is why I'm programming directly against the SDK. The relevant code will be running as part of a build pipeline. It's not entirely clear how NuGet clients are supposed to authenticate in this scenario, but having asked some ALM MVPs, they've pointed me at the `system.accesstoken` build variable.\r\n\r\nIf I program directly against the NuGet REST API with HTTP requests, this works fine—I'm able to get the token from that build variable, and it works just fine for accessing the protected feed. I just need to put the token into the HTTP request's `Authorization` header, prefixed with `Bearer `, and the ADO package feed is happy to talk to me.\r\n\r\nBut I don't want to work directly at the HTTP level. I was hoping to use the NuGet client SDK, because it has a whole load of well thought out and extensively tested support for working with NuGet feeds.\r\n\r\nUnfortunately, the [NuGet Client SDK docs](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/nuget/reference/nuget-client-sdk) appear to consist entirely of \"Go read these three blog entries, and then because those were written in 2016 and there have been important changes since then, meaning that what you've just read is out of date, now read this fourth blog entry.\"\r\n\r\nHere's my starting point:\r\n\r\n```csharp\r\nSourceRepository source = Repository.Factory.GetCoreV3(\"https://api.nuget.org/v3/index.json\");\r\nListResource listResource = source.GetResource<ListResource>();\r\nIEnumerableAsync<IPackageSearchMetadata> x = await listResource.ListAsync(\r\n    \"Endjin.Retry\",\r\n    prerelease: false,\r\n    allVersions: true,\r\n    includeDelisted: false,\r\n    log: new NullLogger(),\r\n    token: CancellationToken.None);\r\n\r\nIEnumeratorAsync<IPackageSearchMetadata> e = x.GetEnumeratorAsync();\r\nwhile (await e.MoveNextAsync())\r\n{\r\n    IPackageSearchMetadata c = e.Current;\r\n    Console.WriteLine(c.Identity);\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nThis works well enough against the public NuGet.org feed (although given the state of the documentation I've no idea whether this is the best way to do this). It searches for the publicly listed `Endjin.Retry` package. It finds it. This is good.\r\n\r\nHowever, if I replace the URL there with the one for my private feed: \"https://pkgs.dev.azure.com/IanGriffiths/_packaging/Ian.LibraryVersioningExperiment/nuget/v3/index.json\" I get this error:\r\n\r\n`System.AggregateException: One or more errors occurred. (Unable to load the service index for source https://pkgs.dev.azure.com/IanGriffiths/_packaging/Ian.LibraryVersioningExperiment/nuget/v3/index.json.) ---> NuGet.Protocol.Core.Types.FatalProtocolException: Unable to load the service index for source https://pkgs.dev.azure.com/IanGriffiths/_packaging/Ian.LibraryVersioningExperiment/nuget/v3/index.json. ---> System.Net.Http.HttpRequestException: Response status code does not indicate success: 401 (Unauthorized).`\r\n\r\nThis seems to occur inside the call to `source.GetResource<ListResource>()`.\r\n\r\nThis is unsurprising of course—this is a protected feed, and my code has not yet made any attempt to supply credentials, so you'd expect it to fail.\r\n\r\nBut the question is: how am I supposed to supply a token?\r\n\r\nIt looks like `HttpHandlerResourceV3Provider.cs` is where it sets up the `HttpClientHandler` and `HttpMessageHandler`. In particular, I found at https://github.com/NuGet/NuGet.Client/blob/dev/src/NuGet.Core/NuGet.Protocol/HttpSource/HttpHandlerResourceV3Provider.cs#L62 this code:\r\n\r\n```csharp\r\nmessageHandler = new StsAuthenticationHandler(packageSource, TokenStore.Instance)\r\n{\r\n    InnerHandler = messageHandler\r\n};\r\n```\r\n\r\nThis made me wonder if I needed to supply the token store with my token. So I tried adding this line before doing anything else with the client libraries:\r\n\r\n```csharp\r\nTokenStore.Instance.AddToken(new Uri(FeedUrl), token);\r\n```\r\nBut it made no difference. And although I can't claim to have understood how 'STS Authentication' fits into this code, it appears it sets the `X-NuGet-STS-Token` header. But the token I've got is for use as an HTTP Authorization Bearer header. In case it's relevant, here's the decoded body of the JWT that I've got:\r\n\r\n```json\r\n{\r\n  \"nameid\": \"fb6c9195-1108-490b-a5a2-1d36f69972af\",\r\n  \"scp\": \"app_token\",\r\n  \"aui\": \"1e7bc101-05e3-4396-8ae2-481fd28eed86\",\r\n  \"sid\": \"f3614a90-e4df-4cf5-ad12-f2f3f0c14fa8\",\r\n  \"iss\": \"app.vstoken.visualstudio.com\",\r\n  \"aud\": \"app.vstoken.visualstudio.com|vso:49ebc6d2-c78c-4aa6-96af-1a4273e6143b\",\r\n  \"nbf\": 1548066236,\r\n  \"exp\": 1548071036\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nTo reiterate, this works just fine against the package feed when I hit it manually from Postman. (Obviously I need to get a new token every now and then because they expire, but I've manually verified that the token I'm trying to use with the NuGet Client SDK is still valid even after seeing 401 failures in my app by using it again directly against the HTTP API.)\r\n\r\nI've cloned the `NuGet/NuGet.Client` repo and searched it for use of the `Authorization` header, and the only place it shows up directly is in unit tests, all of which appear to be looking for basic auth. So it appears that the client doesn't set the Authorization header directly. As far as I can tell, instead it sets the `HttpClientHandler.Credentials` property with an `HttpSourceCredentials`. This seems to end up providing a `NetworkCredential`, and it's not clear whether it's even possible to set the `Authorization` header to a `Bearer` token with one of those. Pretty much every example out there showing how to use bearer tokens in .NET does it by setting the `Headers.Authorization` property on the `HttpRequestMessage`.\r\n\r\nSo the 'obvious' mechanisms for that would be either to use the `HttpClient.DefaultRequestHeaders`, or to insert an `HttpMessageHandler`, but it looks like the creation of the client and handler chain is all locked up inside `HttpHandlerResourceV3Provider` and is not open to extension.\r\n\r\nI took a look at https://github.com/Microsoft/artifacts-credprovider too, and from that I get the impression that it doesn't actually set a Bearer token either.\r\n\r\nAt this point I dredged up a dim memory that with ADO APIs, you can also use basic auth, with anything you like as the username and a PAT as the password, so I tried this:\r\n\r\n```csharp\r\nprivate class Creds : ICredentialProvider\r\n{\r\n    private readonly string token;\r\n\r\n    public Creds(string token)\r\n    {\r\n        this.token = token;\r\n    }\r\n\r\n    public string Id { get; }\r\n\r\n    public Task<CredentialResponse> GetAsync(Uri uri, IWebProxy proxy, CredentialRequestType type, string message, bool isRetry, bool nonInteractive, CancellationToken cancellationToken)\r\n    {\r\n        return Task.FromResult(new CredentialResponse(new NetworkCredential(\"x\", this.token)));\r\n    }\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nand also this:\r\n\r\n```csharp\r\nvar ps = new AsyncLazy<IEnumerable<ICredentialProvider>>(() => Task.FromResult<IEnumerable<ICredentialProvider>>(new ICredentialProvider[] { new Creds(token) }));\r\nHttpHandlerResourceV3.CredentialService = new Lazy<ICredentialService>(() => new CredentialService(ps, true, true));\r\n```\r\n\r\nThis has in fact enabled me to move forwards. But I'm left with a feeling of \"Surely this isn't what we're actually expected to do?\"\r\n\r\n\r\n## Details about Problem\r\n\r\nNuGet product used: NuGet Client SDK (`NuGet.Credentials`, `NuGet.Protocol`) \r\n\r\nPackage versions: 4.9.2\r\n\r\nOS version: Windows 10 v1809 (17763.253)\r\n\r\n\r\nTagging @rrelyea since he offered to help with this on Twitter"},{"Id":"8927093298","Type":"IssuesEvent","CreatedAt":"2019-01-22T07:34:59","Actor":"v-luzh","Repository":"NuGet/Home","Organization":"NuGet","RawContent":null,"RelatedAction":"opened","RelatedUrl":"https://github.com/NuGet/Home/issues/7713","RelatedDescription":"Opened issue \"[Test Failure][Dotnet List Package]An error occur when executing dotnet list package in a project with multiple TFMs\" (#7713) at NuGet/Home","RelatedBody":"## Details about Problem\r\nOS Version: Windows 10 RS4_Release 17134.1.180410-1804\r\nDotnet SDK: 3.0.100-preview-010140\r\n## Detailed repro steps so we can see the same problem\r\n1.
