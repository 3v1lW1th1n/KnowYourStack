Therefore, it would be desirable to be able to support multiple hashes in a single identity database, and transparently re-encrypt users' passwords as they login if a more secure hash function is available.\r\n\r\nA newer hash function may mean a new algorithm (e.g. Argon2), or simply more iterations / different configuration parameters for the algorithm already in use.\r\n\r\nA possible implementation would be:\r\n\r\n1.  ASPNet the identity `UserManager` has a `PasswordHashers` property added, which is a list of `IPasswordHasher` objects in order of ascending secure-ness called `PasswordHashers`. The existing `PasswordHasher` property is changed to retrieve the last item in the list, and is made read-only, so that newly stored passwords use the latest hash function.\r\n\r\n2. The  list index of the `PasswordHasher` that was used for a particular user is stored in a property of the `TUser` object called `PasswordHashVersion` \r\n\r\n3. During the authentication process, if the password check is successful, but the `PasswordHashVersion` value indicates it was not hashed using the current hasher, re-hash the password using the current `UserManager.PasswordHasher` and update the hash and version stored in the `TUser` object.\r\n\r\nThis would mean, over time, users still using the application would have their password encryption level upgraded and it would not be stuck at the quality of hashing algorithm available in the year they signed up. Users who no longer user the application would be stuck with the older password hashes. However, administrators could query the database to report on the number of users with legacy hashes, and contact them to request they sign-in to retain their account.\r\n\r\n"},{"Id":"6718683055","Type":"IssuesEvent","CreatedAt":"2017-10-15T15:41:12","Actor":"heku","Repository":"aspnet/Identity","Organization":"aspnet","RawContent":null,"RelatedAction":"opened","RelatedUrl":"https://github.com/aspnet/Identity/issues/1465","RelatedDescription":"Opened issue \"Best practice to integrate Identity into a multiple-layers project?\" (#1465) at aspnet/Identity","RelatedBody":"Hi,\r\n\r\nI have google/bing this but no good solution/suggestion found, as all examples just demonstrate the usage in one project, I'm wondering what's the best practice for integrate Identity with a real solution like below.\r\n\r\n- UI Layer (MVC)\r\n- Domain/Models Layer (i.e. `AppUser`, and we may want to keep this layer POCOs)\r\n- Infrastructures Layers (i.e. `AppDbContext`)\r\n\r\nIn this case, we cannot define an `AppDbContext : IdentityDbContext<AppUser>` because` AppUser` is expected an `IdentityUser`, to make this work, we have to add reference to Identity stuffs to Domain layer.\r\n\r\nI understand that if I re-implement all Identity Stores inside the Infrastructures layer, this would work, but this sounds not so good.\r\n\r\nIs there a best practice that we can reuse majority of Identity and keep each layer clean?\r\n\r\nIt's very appreciated to hear your suggestion?\r\n\r\n"},{"Id":"6713193125","Type":"IssuesEvent","CreatedAt":"2017-10-13T12:33:47","Actor":"naveddeshmukh","Repository":"aspnet/Identity","Organization":"aspnet","RawContent":null,"RelatedAction":"opened","RelatedUrl":"https://github.com/aspnet/Identity/issues/1464","RelatedDescription":"Opened issue \"Change Type from String to Int and Auto-generated UserName and NormalizedUserName Properties \" (#1464) at aspnet/Identity","RelatedBody":"I intended to use UserName property as Employee Codes (integers and auto-incrementing). \r\n\r\nAs per policy, My application requires the employee to be able to log in using their employee code (which are integer values of 5 digits, if that's relevant ). \r\n\r\nI was using UserName property to store the employee codes, but now the requirement is to automatically generate an Employee Code (similar behavior of auto increment in SQL Server.) \r\n\r\nIs their anyway to override UserName and used it as integer and make auto-generated whenever a new user is created.

The Microsoft.AspNetCore.Authentication.WsFederation 2.0.0-preview1 package is available at https://www.nuget.org/packages/Microsoft.AspNetCore.Authentication.WsFederation/. This is a standalone preview that targets netstandard2.0 and should work with existing ASP.NET Core 2.0.0 applications (.NET Core 2.0 or .NET 4.6.1). A non-preview ASP.NET Core 2.0.0 compatible package will follow once we’ve addressed your feedback.\r\n \r\nThe code is available at https://github.com/aspnet/security/tree/rel/2.0.0-ws-preview1 and issues can be filed at https://github.com/aspnet/security/issues. Please give us a 👍 from the reactions menu on the linked discussion post if you have successfully used this component and are ready for the final release.\r\n \r\nThis component is a port from Microsoft.Owin.Security.WsFederation and uses many of the same mechanics. It has also been updated to integrate with ASP.NET Core 2.0’s authentication model. See the samples below.\r\n \r\nAside from updating the usage pattern to match ASP.NET Core, there are also some functional changes to be aware of.\r\nA.\tThis component no longer checks every form post request for sign-in messages by default. Sign-in callbacks are restricted to the \"/signin-wsfed\" path by default. The CallbackPath can be changed to the application root “/” used by some auth providers if you also enable SkipUnrecognizedRequests to allow sharing that request path with other components.\r\nB.\tThis component no longer allows unsolicited logins by default. That WsFederation protocol feature is susceptible to XSRF attacks.
