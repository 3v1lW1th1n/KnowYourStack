Load the reproducer and take a memory heap snapshot. Searching the heap you will find 4 VueComponents (App, Container, Child, Async Child)\r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/1207606/44921752-6c6e0900-ad11-11e8-81e9-6751416a49ff.png)\r\n\r\n2. Click the Destroy button. This toggles a v-if which will remove Child component and thus AsyncChild component as well.\r\n3. At this point, the page is updated as expected\r\n4. Take another memory heap snapshot. Search the heap again for \"VueComponent\" and you will see that 4 VueComponents still exist\r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/1207606/44921772-7a238e80-ad11-11e8-9215-c6ca2bd14706.png)\r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/1207606/44921791-8a3b6e00-ad11-11e8-82d9-a52d4f9c0e52.png)\r\n\r\n\r\n### What is expected?\r\nAfter destroying Child component, the component and it's asynchronously loaded child component should be destroyed and the memory freed up.\r\n\r\n### What is actually happening?\r\nVue is holding on to a context reference which is preventing these components from being garbage collected\r\n\r\n---\r\nThis is happening due to the resolve-async-component logic located here: https://github.com/vuejs/vue/blob/52719ccab8fccffbdf497b96d3731dc86f04c1ce/src/core/vdom/helpers/resolve-async-component.js#L57-L68\r\n\r\nIn the forceRender function on line 64, after calling $forceUpdate, the contexts array should be cleared to free up those references so that the components will be able to be garbage collected at a later point in time\r\n\r\n<!-- generated by vue-issues.

And every time when the getter was called, it will call dependArray on the value of this.entities, which is the array with length n.\r\nSince dependArray will iterate the value, the depend function will be called **(n + 1)^2** times totally.\r\n\r\nI found this code when I'm reviewing someone's PR, and the original code use `for (let i = 0; i < this.entities.length; i++) ` and make another n times call to the getter.\r\n\r\nIt was easy to avoid this problem, such as using some array methods like `filter` to only call getter once.\r\nEven cache the value of entities by `const cache = this.entities` can solve it.\r\n\r\nAlthough it was easy to avoid of this pattern, I still think it is dangerous because the original code was not an obvious anti-pattern.\r\nAnd this will not show any performance issue when the array is small, but may cause serious performance issue when the array is large in some production environment.\r\n\r\n### What is expected?\r\nI've read the related source code and I think this is the expected result of the observer system.\r\n\r\nThen I read some chapter of the guide again to ensure there is no mention about this, so I'm not sure whether we need to add this as a NOT TODO in the computed property chapter.\r\n\r\n### What is actually happening?\r\nDescribed.\r\n\r\n<!-- generated by vue-issues.

When using `v-model` on android/chrome the model only gets updated when pressing space, enter, backspace or unfocusing the field (and maybe in some other cases). The model does not update when in the middle of typing a word. However when using `v-bind` and `v-on:input` the model gets updated as it is supposed to.\r\n\r\nIt seems like `v-model` isn't binding the `input` event on android. The correct behavior can be achieved by adding `v-on:input` regardless of whether `v-model` or `v-bind:value` is used. This applies to `input` and `textarea` elements.\r\n\r\n### What is expected?\r\nThe behavior is expected to be the same on all platforms: The model should update live with every keypress.\r\n\r\n### What is actually happening?\r\nOn chrome on android the model isn't updated on every keypress. This can be reproduced with the example inputs that are shown in the docs.\r\n\r\n---\r\nThis is a problem when for example creating a list that should be filtered live with user input. I'm wondering whether this is a bug or a documentation issue. I feel like it's a bug since the same code has different behavior on different platforms.\r\n\r\n<!-- generated by vue-issues.

It provides a few code snippets and assumes you'll understand. The documentation has been the biggest source of my frustration while using Vue since it never actually explains anything.\r\n\r\nFor example, on the Vuex installation page, sandwiched between CDN/package manager installation and building from source, you've put that Vuex needs to be instantiated in a module set up. You've provided zero context for this. Is this in the store? Is this for every file you need to access the store in? More importantly, it shouldn't be on the installation page, let alone sandwiched in between different installation methods. Vue's documentation is riddled with these issues. Unfortunately, I still don't actually know enough about how Vue actually works to be able to contribute to the documentation in any way. If I didn't have to use Vue for the project I am on, I would be using React, Redux, & RxJs and have access to meaningful, better written documentation that bothers to walk you through the set up. If Vue actually wants to gain any real traction, you're going to need to actually show folks how to use and set up your tools.\r\n\r\n<!-- generated by vue-issues.
