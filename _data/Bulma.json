When this is done, though, it appears to cease to function properly as a tile; it loses its ability to be sized using the .is-x column sizing scheme and won't size its height according to the other tiles in its row.\r\n\r\n### Steps to Reproduce\r\n\r\n1. Create a tile structure resembling this:\r\n```\r\ndiv class=\"tile is-ancestor\"\r\n  div class=\"tile is-parent\"\r\n    a href=\"#\" rel=\"Text\"\r\n      article class=\"tile is-child is-4 notification is-warning\"\r\n        p class=\"title\" Some text\r\n        p class=\"subtitle\" some text\r\n  div class=\"tile is-parent\"\r\n    a href=\"#\" rel=\"Text\"\r\n      article class=\"tile is-child is-4 notification is-info\"\r\n        p class=\"title\" Some other text\r\n        p class=\"subtitle\" some text\r\n  div class=\"tile is-parent\"\r\n    a href=\"#\" rel=\"Text\"\r\n      article class=\"tile is-child is-4 notification is-success\"\r\n        p class=\"title\" Even more text\r\n        p class=\"subtitle\" some text\r\n```\r\n2. Observe.\r\n\r\n### Expected behavior\r\n\r\nThe tiles will appear as expected, and also be functional links.\r\n\r\n### Actual behavior\r\n\r\nWhile having the appropriate y-coordinates that they otherwise should, the tiles fail to adhere to the specified default width, and the tiles shrink to fit around the content; the width specifically shrinks to fit around the widest character in the text, leaving each tile looking long and tall, like an unfurled banner. The heights of each tile no longer line up.\r\n\r\n### Commentary\r\n\r\nSwitch the \"is-4\" class from the .is-child divs to the .is-parent divs and observe the change in behavior. Note how while the tiles are still shrinking to fit around the content, it no longer appears strange as the tiles aren't shrinking on their x-axis.","Url":"https://github.com/jgthms/bulma/issues/2506","RelatedDescription":"Open issue \"0.7.5: Wrapping .tile.is-child in <a> element breaks tile width sizing, possibly the tiles entirely\" (#2506)"},{"Id":"449913532","IsPullRequest":false,"CreatedAt":"2019-05-29T16:44:54","Actor":"purrloftruth","Number":"2505","RawContent":null,"Title":"0.7.5: Tile gaps don't work unless each .is-child is wrapped in its own .is-parent, docs unclear","State":"open","Body":"<!-- PLEASE READ THE FOLLOWING INSTRUCTIONS -->\r\n\r\n<!-- Choose one of the following: -->\r\nThis is about **both Bulma and the Docs**.

However, in Bulma 0.7.5, each individual .tile.is-child needs to be housed within its own .tile.is-parent (where .is-vertical is not being used; it was not tested here and its effect here is currently unknown as it has as of yet been unnecessary for my project) for gaps to show up.\r\n\r\n### Steps to Reproduce\r\n\r\n1.

Observe.\r\n\r\n### Expected behavior\r\n\r\nAs intimated by the documentation, a gap should appear between the three tiles.\r\n\r\n### Actual behavior\r\n\r\nNo gap appears between each tile.\r\n\r\n### Commentary\r\n\r\nAdd a surrounding .tile.is-parent to each individual .tile.is-child element.
