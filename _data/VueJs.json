Now, I could add a property or event-listener on the parent specifically to be used by the child, but often times its difficult to think of the different attributes the end user of the component might want to modify, or the events they'd like to listen to on this target child. I COULD add a large set of optional properties, prefixed by some descriptor to indicate what sub-part of the component they will be applied to (e.g `$props = {  bodyClass,  footerClass, menuClass }, $listeners =  { footerClicked, headerFieldChanged}`... etc), but this has a few drawbacks:\r\n\r\n  - its inelegant\r\n  - its very verbose\r\n  - its utility is limited by my ability to think of all the attributes on a child target that I or someone using this component might want to modify or extend, and that doesn't even touch on if the consumer wanted to add a directive.\r\n\r\nAnd so, my proposal is that Vue add a new feature, which I admittedly couldn't think of a good name for, so I went with `slotted-attributes` for now. Mostly because I think the cleanest implementation would be an extension of slots. I realize this name has good deal baggage that could confuse users, though, so I'm not attached to this name or the slots approach inherently, mostly just the feature, in some form or fashion.\r\n\r\n### What does the proposed API look like?\r\nI have a suspicion this will be seen as a convolution of the API, but to me, most intuitive way to implement this would simply be to add a `attrs` modifier to the `v-slot` directive. For example:\r\n\r\n_Template using the the slotted attributes_\r\n```html\r\n<template>\r\n  <base-layout>\r\n    <!-- Seems weird to use the \"template\" tag for this, but I was just trying to be consistent with other slots -->\r\n    <template #header.attrs @click=\"headerClicked\" class=\"header-class\" title=\"headerText\"/>\r\n    <template #body>\r\n      /*slot stuff*/\r\n    </template>\r\n    <template #footer>\r\n      /* slot stuff */\r\n    </template>\r\n  </base-layout>\r\n</template\r\n```\r\n\r\n_Component template_\r\n```html\r\n<div>\r\n  <!-- Some header component that takes a `title` prop, I admittedly struggled to think of a good way for the slot-consuming component to indicate the node the attributes should go to -->\r\n  <HeaderComponent attrs-slot=\"header\" />\r\n  <div class=\"body\">\r\n    <slot name=\"body\"/>\r\n  </div>\r\n  <div class=\"footer\">\r\n    <slot name=\"footer\"/>\r\n  </div>\r\n</div>\r\n```\r\n\r\n<!-- generated by vue-issues.

Maybe some parts do have functions I haven't found yet, but **it's undeniable that some of them inevitably cause extra memory waste**.\r\n\r\nI hope Vue can make full use of every memory it requires. And if deps in `__ob__` **(instead of deps in closures)** can show mores useful infos in console, it would be even better.\r\n\r\n<!-- generated by vue-issues.

Some of my routes must have an 'Organization' selected. If a user attempts to hit the route without having an organization selected, they are redirected to another route to set up an organization. All of my routes require that a user is authenticated, or else they are redirected to my auth server.\r\n\r\nI understand that it is possible to nest each of my guards in one single guard; however, I have unique combinations of guards per route (not all routes have the same guards), which makes it difficult to express the requirements of a route without writing a guard to contain each guard the route requires (versus something easier and more expressive, such as an array).\r\n\r\nIn my opinion, this is clearly a responsibility of the framework to support this. I have heard the arguments that you can write one guard that contains each guard inside of it, but is that really a solution when we have multiple people asking for this feature?
