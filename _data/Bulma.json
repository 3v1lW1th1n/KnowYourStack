I made a `$custom-colors` map in my sass:\r\n\r\n```sass\r\n$custom-colors: (\"foo\": #f3488c)\r\n```\r\n\r\n2. I added some html which works:\r\n\r\n```html\r\n<a class=\"button is-foo\">this works as expected</a>\r\n<p class=\"has-text-foo\">this works too</p>\r\n```\r\n\r\n3.

I found another way to get at the calculated colors but it seems a bit roundabout.  In my sass:\r\n\r\n```sass\r\n.bar\r\n  color: nth(map-get($colors, 'foo'), 4)\r\n  // These don't compile because there's no such variable:\r\n  // color: $foo\r\n  // color: $foo-dark\r\n```\r\n\r\nThen in my html this works:\r\n\r\n```html\r\n<a class=\"button bar\">ok</a>\r\n<p class=\"bar\">also ok</p>\r\n```\r\n\r\nPlease can you tell me whether there's a better way?\r\n\r\nMany thanks in advance!\r\n","Url":"https://github.com/jgthms/bulma/issues/2674","RelatedDescription":"Closed issue \"How to use custom colors (v0.8.0)?\" (#2674)"},{"Id":"510827183","IsPullRequest":false,"CreatedAt":"2019-10-22T18:31:32","Actor":"LunaticMuch","Number":"2673","RawContent":null,"Title":"Burger doesn't work with Bulma 0.8.0","State":"closed","Body":"I am testing Bulma **0.8.0**.\r\n\r\nI've created an example with navbar and two menu entries, which I expect to be rendered by the hamburger when on mobile (or <1024px).
