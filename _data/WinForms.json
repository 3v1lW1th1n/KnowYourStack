A code fix is provided to add the header if a file is missing one. See notes in the diff for additional commentary.\r\n\r\n⚠️ I wanted the file header warnings (SA1633, SA1636) to show up as warnings when building inside the IDE, but I was not able to do that. Something in the current project configuration is forcing warnings to be treated as errors everywhere. I typically configure projects so code style issues are reported as warnings during iterative development, and only turn into errors for command line builds (optional) and CI builds (encouraged).","Url":"https://github.com/dotnet/winforms/pull/213","RelatedDescription":"Open PR \"Verify copyright headers in CI\" (#213)"},{"Id":"388925259","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2018-12-08T14:07:19","Actor":"Liminiens","Number":"212","RawContent":null,"Title":"Clean up resx code","State":"open","Body":"- Use newer C# features where possible\r\n- Compare types directly\r\n- Use char `String.Split` overload\r\n- Replaced `str != null && str.Length > 0` pattern with `String.IsNullOrEmpty`\r\n- Use language keywords insted of BCL types\r\n- Removed unused parameter `isMetaData` in `ResXResourceReader.ParseAssemblyNode`\r\n- Removed unused field `binaryFormatter ` in `ResXResourceWriter`\r\n- Simplified/unnested `if` statements where possible\r\n- Replaced `for` loops with `foreach` loops\r\n- Fixed local variable naming in a few places","Url":"https://github.com/dotnet/winforms/pull/212","RelatedDescription":"Open PR \"Clean up resx code\" (#212)"},{"Id":"388920279","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2018-12-08T13:01:44","Actor":"dotnet-maestro[bot]","Number":"211","RawContent":null,"Title":"Update dependency files","State":"open","Body":"This pull request updates the following dependencies\r\n\r\nUpdates from https://github.com/dotnet/arcade\r\n\r\n- Microsoft.DotNet.Arcade.Sdk - 1.0.0-beta.18607.6\r\n\r\n","Url":"https://github.com/dotnet/winforms/pull/211","RelatedDescription":"Open PR \"Update dependency files\" (#211)"},{"Id":"388865238","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2018-12-08T00:51:25","Actor":"AdamYoblick","Number":"209","RawContent":null,"Title":"Revert \"disable test signing for now (#206)\"","State":"closed","Body":"This reverts commit cf9f5f7a0d4bed538deb68a7b84a144bc44e44a3.","Url":"https://github.com/dotnet/winforms/pull/209","RelatedDescription":"Closed or merged PR \"Revert \"disable test signing for now (#206)\"\" (#209)"},{"Id":"388861842","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2018-12-08T00:49:21","Actor":"AdamYoblick","Number":"208","RawContent":null,"Title":"disable test signing for real this time","State":"closed","Body":"","Url":"https://github.com/dotnet/winforms/pull/208","RelatedDescription":"Closed or merged PR \"disable test signing for real this time\" (#208)"},{"Id":"388849536","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2018-12-08T00:15:34","Actor":"AdamYoblick","Number":"206","RawContent":null,"Title":"disable test signing for now","State":"closed","Body":"test signing is running into sporadic failures on build machines, so disable it for now","Url":"https://github.com/dotnet/winforms/pull/206","RelatedDescription":"Closed or merged PR \"disable test signing for now\" (#206)"},{"Id":"388821500","IsPullRequest":false,"CreatedAt":"2018-12-08T00:09:01","Actor":"lextm","Number":"204","RawContent":null,"Title":"Verb runas does not trigger UAC elevation in preview 1","State":"closed","Body":"* .NET Core Version: (3.0 Preview1)\r\n* Have you experienced this same bug with .NET Framework?: No\r\n\r\n**Problem description:**\r\nIt is very common to call another executable using `Process` class and pass `\"runas\"` as verb to trigger UAC prompt, so that the executable to call is launched as elevated.\r\n\r\n**Actual behavior:** <!-- callstack for crashes / exceptions -->\r\nNo UAC prompt.
