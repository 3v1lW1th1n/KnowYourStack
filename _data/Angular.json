If\r\nthe processing occurs on a different worker (in a different process)\r\nthan where `@angular/core` is processed, this could prime the filesystem\r\ncache with `@angular/core/core.d.ts` before `@angular/core` has been\r\nprocessed, thereby poisoning the cache with an unprocessed version of\r\n`@angular/core/core.d.ts`.

In Angular v8 and before, the browser would consistently show errors, regardless of when you executed `npm start`\r\n\r\n\r\n### Description\r\n\r\n<!-- ✍️--> What you see in the browser when you have an error depends on when you execute `npm start`.  You may get this:\r\n\r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/7987365/79477249-dc043b00-7fbe-11ea-9d87-d084a9a6615f.png)\r\nNo error shown.

This is very unhelpful, especially for Angular beginners. This appears if you run `npm start` after making an error. It appears that it cannot serve any files in this case.\r\n\r\nOr you may get lucky and get this:\r\n\r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/7987365/79477536-2a193e80-7fbf-11ea-80cb-bf6c32213bea.png)\r\nThis is much more helpful, but not consistently shown.\r\n\r\n## 🔬 Minimal Reproduction\r\n<!--\r\nSimple steps to reproduce this bug.\r\n\r\nPlease include: commands run (including args), packages added, related code changes.\r\n\r\nIf reproduction steps are not enough for reproduction of your issue, please create a minimal GitHub repository with the reproduction of the issue. \r\nA good way to make a minimal reproduction is to create a new app via `ng new repro-app` and add the minimum possible code to show the problem. \r\nShare the link to the repo below along with step-by-step instructions to reproduce the problem, as well as expected and actual behavior.\r\n\r\nIssues that don't have enough info and can't be reproduced will be closed.\r\n\r\nYou can read more about issue submission guidelines here: https://github.com/angular/angular-cli/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md#-submitting-an-issue\r\n-->\r\n\r\nThis is one example, but it happens with many different errors, such as forgetting to add a component to an Angular module:\r\n\r\n1) ng new APM\r\n2) cd APM\r\n3) code .\r\n4) Run npm start\r\n5) Add the following line to the template: `<input type='text' [(ngModel)]='listFilter' /> `\r\n(This is an error because we don't have listFilter defined and we have not imported FormsModule.)\r\n6) View the browser. No error.\r\n7) Using the F12 tools, you see the ngModel error.\r\n8) Stop the compiler.\r\n9) Restart the compiler and you see the black background and an error in the browser.\r\nI assume this is the behavior that we *should* see in every case.\r\n10) Remove the added input line. The code does not recompile and the browser still shows the error. So it appears as if it was not fixed.\r\n11) Stop the compiler.\r\n12) Add the above input element again (step #5)\r\n13) Start the compiler.\r\n14) This time you'll see the `cannot get` error.\r\n\r\nSo depending on when the `npm start` is executed, the developer will see different results, some of which, like the `cannot get` error, provide no information in the browser as to what is wrong.\r\n\r\n## 🔥 Exception or Error\r\n<pre><code>\r\n<!-- If the issue is accompanied by an exception or an error, please share it below: -->\r\n<!-- ✍️-->\r\n\r\n</code></pre>\r\n\r\n\r\n## 🌍 Your Environment\r\n<pre><code>\r\n<!-- run `ng version` and paste output below -->\r\n<!-- ✍️-->\r\n@angular-devkit/build-angular     0.901.1\r\n@angular-devkit/build-optimizer   0.901.1\r\n@angular-devkit/build-webpack     0.901.1\r\n@angular-devkit/core              9.1.1\r\n@angular-devkit/schematics        9.1.1\r\n@ngtools/webpack                  9.1.1\r\n@schematics/angular               9.1.1\r\n@schematics/update                0.901.1\r\nrxjs                              6.5.5\r\ntypescript                        3.8.3\r\nwebpack                           4.42.0\r\n</code></pre>\r\n\r\n**Anything else relevant?**\r\n<!-- ✍️Is this a browser specific issue?

Also, there’s now [an example](https://togithub.com/puppeteer/puppeteer/blob/master/examples/cross-browser.js) showing how to launch Firefox with Puppeteer.\n-   File uploads are generally more reliable ([#&#8203;5363](https://togithub.com/puppeteer/puppeteer/issues/5363)) and `elementHandle.uploadFile(...filePaths)` now triggers a `change` event, matching the old behavior in Puppeteer v1.20.0.

([#&#8203;5136](https://togithub.com/puppeteer/puppeteer/issues/5136))\n\n#### Behind the scenes\n\n-   Puppeteer is migrating to TypeScript. Although this doesn't affect the way developers can consume Puppeteer, it improves the quality of the Puppeteer type definitions which can be used by modern editors.\n-   Our custom test runner framework has been removed in favor of Mocha, reducing maintenance overhead.\n-   Our CI setup and the way we deal with test flakiness is being reworked in order to increase our confidence of landing PRs without breaking anything.\n\n#### Raw notes\n\n[`6760b92`](https://togithub.com/puppeteer/puppeteer/commit/6760b92) -

Look at the stack blitz.\r\n2. Markup has an effect on ability to even start a drag without any console or compile indicator that cdkDrag and cdkDropList **cannot** be on the same drag element (they could be in v8 --v9 allows them on the same container for the \"drop element\") \r\n3. Exit/Enter aren't reliably detected based on the client-rect\r\n \r\n \r\n#### Expected Behavior\r\n\r\nWhat behavior were you expecting to see?\r\n\r\n- Drop zone container should always be detected as soon as the mouse goes over the element.\r\n- If use of cdkDrag/cdkDropList combo only works in certain situations (e.g. codebase looks for this._container on a dragref in v9...which appears to only get set if cdkDropList is on a parent element).  That should either be documented and also the compiler should write an error to the console...or the code should be adjusted to set this._container to the element itself to handle the directive combo on the same element.\r\n\r\n\r\n#### Actual Behavior\r\n\r\nWhat behavior did you actually see?\r\n\r\n- No errors to console or at compile time with directives appended in any fashion.\r\n- v9 does not detect a drop-zone accurately at all for entry or exit. Shaking the mouse a bunch over drop zones or redragging repeatedly will randomly then detect it correctly...though continuing to drag around shows the same inability to detect the drop-zones.\r\n\r\n\r\n#### Environment\r\n\r\n- Angular: v9.1.2 (really any v9.x for the drop-zone detection)\r\n- CDK/Material: v9.2.1\r\n- Browser(s): 80.0.3987.149\r\n- Operating System (e.g. Windows, macOS, Ubuntu): MacOS 10.14.6 \r\n","Url":"https://github.com/angular/components/issues/19085","RelatedDescription":"Open issue \"bug(drag-drop): Unreliable drop-zone detection & markup structure.\" (#19085)"},{"Id":"600648694","IsPullRequest":false,"CreatedAt":"2020-04-15T23:32:57","Actor":"aduyinuo","Number":"19084","RawContent":null,"Title":"error NG8001: 'cdk-virtual-scroll-viewport' is not a known element:","State":"open","Body":"I used the` <cdk-virtual-scroll-viewport>` component in my html\r\n\r\n#### Actual Behavior\r\nBut constantly getting \r\n```\r\n ERROR in new-post.component.html:73:1 - error NG8001: 'cdk-virtual-scroll-viewport' is not a known element:\r\n    1.

At this point it looks like a bug to me, but maybe I am just not using Angular properly. \r\n\r\n#### What are you trying to do?\r\nUse trackBy to speed up a large and somewhat complex editable table that we previously built using mat-table and a FormArray where the user can create, update, delete rows and save changes.\r\n\r\n### What are you seeing that does not match your expectations? \r\nAdding the trackBy property with a simple tracker function (obj => obj.id) makes deletion of lines of the table not rendered properly even if the data in the component looks correct.\r\n\r\n#### What troubleshooting steps have you tried?\r\n-Removing the trackBy, which works but causes other problems in the application I'm working on.\r\n-Changing the tracker function with various approaches, which yields a variety of results, but never exactly what I am looking for and/or not usable in my real case. \r\n-Make the table not tied to a form, which works but defeats my actual use of using the power of Angular reactive forms for edition, validation...\r\n-Use a FormGroup (keyed on id) instead of a FormArray, which works but complexifies data management in my case as change detection is different. This is the workaround I am trying to make work on my real-case right now. \r\n\r\n#### Reproduction\r\nI tried to isolate the problem as much as I could within: \r\n[]https://stackblitz.com/edit/angular-rijqud?file=src%2Fapp%2Fapp.component.ts\r\n\r\nTry to delete Chris for instance. You'll see Serena appear twice. Basic console.logs seem to indicate data is correct. \r\n  \r\n#### Environment\r\nTried:\r\n- Angular: 7.2.0 & 9.1.0\r\n- CDK/Material: 7.3.7 & 9.1.3\r\n- Browser(s): Chrome\r\n- Operating System (e.g. Windows, macOS, Ubuntu): Ubuntu\r\n\r\nThanks a lot !","Url":"https://github.com/angular/components/issues/19081","RelatedDescription":"Open issue \"help([MatTable]): [trackBy on a MatTable tied to a FormArray seems to fail]\" (#19081)"},{"Id":"600310649","IsPullRequest":false,"CreatedAt":"2020-04-15T13:46:35","Actor":"rdelormeCHS","Number":"19080","RawContent":null,"Title":"bug NG SERVE : fails when adding new angular material imports","State":"open","Body":"#### Reproduction\r\nI see this issue reported else where and the reports are closed, but I don' think it is.\r\nI'm somewhat new to angular and first time reporting something, so bare with me if i don't do this 100% right. I have a new project I just created. out of the box, ng new <project> installed angular/cdk, material, animations hammerjs, bootstrap to get started.\r\n\r\nstarting to import angular material modules. \r\n\r\nSteps to reproduce:\r\n1.  I run ng serve. things run fine at first, no components added yet.\r\n2. Now, to so app.module.ts -> import any angular material component, doesn't matter which one.\r\n  * add the import at the top.\r\n  * add the module to the ngModule-> Imports.\r\n3. go to app.component -> add a declaration. I just copy and paste the example for material web site for testing.\r\n4. ng serve gives following error:\r\n\r\n ERROR in node_modules/@angular/material/card/card-module.d.ts:8:22 - error NG6002: Appears in the NgModule.imports of AppModule, but could not be resolved to an NgModule class.\r\n    \r\n    This likely means that the library (@angular/material/card) which declares MatCardModule has not been processed correctly by ngcc, or is not compatible with Angular Ivy. Check if a newer version of the library is available, and update if so. Also consider checking with the library's authors to see if the library is expected to be compatible with Ivy.\r\n    \r\n    8 export declare class MatCardModule {\r\n                           ~~~~~~~~~~~~~\r\n \r\n5. Kill ng serve. \r\n6. Run ng build\r\n7. run ng serve -> now it works.\r\n\r\nThere is something internally going wrong. Usually, I can go to @ngModule->Imports and start typing a module name and use the VS COde auto-import plugin but the intellisense is not showing an material components ->only after adding the import at the top of the file, then it shows the one component in intellisense.\r\n\r\nI have another project on my same machine. The version of the @angular stuff is one revision earlier. It all works fine as expected.  I recall seeing this error in that project at the beginning too. I just don't have any idea how I got rid of it, but realistically, this shouldn't happen in a clean out of the box project using all angular components.\r\n\r\n#### Expected Behavior\r\n\r\nWhat behavior were you expecting to see?\r\n\r\nI am expecting that ng serve works as expected -> on the fly compile successfully.\r\n\r\n#### Actual Behavior\r\n\r\nrequired to kill ng serve, and do ng

The `matchSize` functionality is then executed with these modified (smaller, in this case) dimensions.\r\n\r\n--------------\r\n\r\n## Possible Solution\r\n\r\nIs a view container even necessary here?\r\nChanging the above code to the following appears to work just fine.\r\n\r\n```ts\r\n if (previewTemplate) {\r\n      // <-- HERE -->\r\n      //const viewRef = previewConfig!.viewContainer.createEmbeddedView(previewTemplate,\r\n      //                                                                 previewConfig!.context);\r\n      const viewRef = previewTemplate.createEmbeddedView(previewConfig!.context);\r\n      viewRef.detectChanges();\r\n```\r\nThis creates the same drag preview `viewRef`, except it is not immediately attached to the DOM.\r\n\r\nThe reproduction link contains some copied source code to preview this change - just need to comment/uncomment those lines.\r\n\r\nAlternatively, the dragged item could be measured before the preview is created. But if there is no reason to use a view container, the above change seems like the more optimal approach.\r\n\r\n#### Reproduction\r\n\r\n[StackBlitz](https://stackblitz.com/edit/angular-twksuh?file=src/app/cdk-drag-drop-horizontal-sorting-example.html)\r\n \r\n \r\n#### Expected Behavior\r\n\r\nPreview to match size.\r\n\r\n\r\n#### Actual Behavior\r\n\r\nPreview does not match size.\r\n\r\n\r\n#### Environment\r\n\r\n- Angular:\r\n- CDK/Material: 9.2\r\n- Browser(s):\r\n- Operating System (e.g. Windows, macOS, Ubuntu): \r\n","Url":"https://github.com/angular/components/issues/19060","RelatedDescription":"Open issue \"bug(drag-drop): cdkDragPreview matchSize does not always match size due to view container insertion\" (#19060)"},{"Id":"598631632","IsPullRequest":false,"CreatedAt":"2020-04-13T02:28:46","Actor":"ngohungphuc","Number":"19059","RawContent":null,"Title":"help([CDK]): [enter is deprecated: No longer being used.
