A year ago, we introduced [scoped API keys](https://blog.nuget.org/20170202/introducing-scoped-api-keys.html) to help our users better manage their API keys. While we recommend the use of scoped API keys, we will continue to support our legacy 'Full access API keys' that were previously granted by the service. Such keys do not expire if you use them at least one every 365 days to push a package.\r\n \r\nWe are making a change to our service such that a newly issued API key cannot be copied after the page is refreshed. While this was always the case for scoped API keys, we were allowing users with 'Full access API keys' to copy them down at any point. We plan to remove this capability in the future, as making this change allows us to migrate all of our APIs keys to use a one-way hash and further protect against malicious use of the key.\r\n\r\n**Starting Feb 5th 2018, the 'Full access API key' cannot be copied from NuGet.org**. While most of the packages pushed to NuGet.org now use a scoped API key and are not impacted by this change, users continuing to use our legacy 'Full access API keys' will need to securely stash the key before this date after which they will not be accessible. Please note that the 'Full access API keys' will continue to work just like they did before. We are only removing the ability to copy them down from NuGet.org.\r\n\r\nIf you have further question, please reach out to us by commenting on the [discussion issue](https://github.com/NuGet/NuGetGallery/issues/5231) or send me an email at [anangaur@microsoft.com](mailto:anangaur@microsoft.com).
