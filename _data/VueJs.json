Can it be described simply like follow\r\n```\r\n// child.vue\r\n<script>\r\nexport default {\r\n    props: {\r\n        foo: {\r\n            required: true,\r\n            // my imagination\r\n            type:[Number,null]\r\n        },\r\n    },\r\n};\r\n</script>\r\n```\r\nIt certainly failed. Because the function assertType of source code in vue/src/core/util/props.js  was:\r\n```\r\nconst simpleCheckRE = /^(String|Number|Boolean|Function|Symbol)$/\r\n\r\nfunction assertType (value: any, type: Function): {\r\n  valid: boolean;\r\n  expectedType: string;\r\n} {\r\n  let valid\r\n  const expectedType = getType(type)\r\n  if (simpleCheckRE.test(expectedType)) {\r\n    const t = typeof value\r\n    valid = t === expectedType.toLowerCase()\r\n    // for primitive wrapper objects\r\n    if (!valid && t === 'object') {\r\n      valid = value instanceof type\r\n    }\r\n  } else if (expectedType === 'Object') {\r\n    valid = isPlainObject(value)\r\n  } else if (expectedType === 'Array') {\r\n    valid = Array.isArray(value)\r\n  } else {\r\n    valid = value instanceof type\r\n  }\r\n  return {\r\n    valid,\r\n    expectedType\r\n  }\r\n}\r\n```\r\nWhen the first element(Number) of types array call this function , it worked well.\r\nBut the second element(null) of  types array call this function , it does not match expection.  \r\nThat's because the param \"type\" was not a function so that the getType function could not work.\r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/21165139/44444801-2a5a0e80-a611-11e8-9197-0698d70dc51b.png)\r\n\r\nSo maybe the easiest way to solve this feature was do extra judge for null in the assertType function\r\n\r\n\r\n### What does the proposed API look like?\r\n```\r\nexport default {\r\n    props: {\r\n        foo: {\r\n            required: true,\r\n            type:[Number,null]\r\n        }\r\n    }\r\n}\r\n```\r\n<!-- generated by vue-issues.

Then destroy the vue instance. \r\n\r\nThe router instance continues to exist and fire.\r\n\r\n### What is expected?\r\nThe router should be able to properly destroy itself; either by explicit call, or when the vue instance is destroyed\r\n\r\n### What is actually happening?\r\nThe router exists and cannot be destroyed\r\n\r\n---\r\nI did some googling and see that vue-router cannot currently be destroyed, but I am asking for reconsideration. Unlike the other issue I found (https://github.com/vuejs/vue-router/issues/954) where it appeared the user wanted to destroy and create a new router in the same application, the issue I am having is completely separate. \r\n\r\nI have a massive application that essentially uses pjax methodologies to be able to run several SPAs (vue being one) that create the full site. When we navigate away from one SPA to another, the SPA needs to destroy itself so it's code does not interfere with the other SPAs. However, because the vue router cannot be destroyed; it's attempting to execute logic for routing even when the SPA that created it is destroyed. The issue compounds when we have more than 1 vue application running, as there are now 2 instances of vue-router (or more) running at a time. \r\n\r\nSpecifically, we are using the hash version of routing. It looks like the router just attaches an event to the window and listens for popstates, but things get weird when more than one event does something with popstate (an understandably oddball behavior).  I would appreciate reconsideration for allowing vue-router to destroy itself when appropriate. Thanks!\r\n\r\n[edited for spelling/grammar]\r\n\r\n<!-- generated by vue-issues.
