Additionally, these classes/functions, which are defined inside the `core` package, are imported by the `platform-browser` package.\r\n\r\nPreviously, this code was not tree-shaken as expected in Ivy. #30130 partially addressed the issue, but only for the case where `core` and `platform-browser` end up in the same closure after webpack's scope hoisting.

Perhaps there's a justification for why the `ActivatedRoute` behaves the way it does now, but in its present state it seems very counter-intuitive.\r\n\r\nThe `ActivatedRoute` snapshot during `ngOnInit` does not contain query string params that are in the URL. I find this very counter-intuitive, given that they _are_ available at that time.\r\n\r\nThe issue I have is that I have some logic that might do route redirecting based on app or local/session storage state, and it might fire before the qs param check. I actually need to know when my component loads if I have a certain qs param or not so I can redirect based on that param. The issue is that I want this to occur _before_ any application logic fires which is not going to happen since the only way to get it is to subscribe to the `ActivatedRoute`. QS params fire after the ngOnInit function completes.\r\n\r\nIs there a justification for why QS params are not part of the route snapshot? Given that qs params are part of the URL used to get to the current view, I find it (as do many people on Stack Overflow as evidenced by the number of tickets on this topic) counter-intuitive and ergonomically ugly. Having to subscribe async (and therefore out of order for what I need) causes dirty code vs something that I actually need to be sync. I know I can do something like wrap a timeout, but if the QS param isn't set, then I have this observable hanging out and never completing unless I wire up a timeout or something else for the activated route subscription. Overall, I find it confusing, counter-intuitive, and a source of ugly code.\r\n\r\n### Describe the solution you'd like\r\nAdd the query string params to the `ActivatedRoute.snapshot` _before_ `OnInit` is called, as one might expect them to be.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Describe alternatives you've considered\r\nMy current alternative is to subscribe to the `ActivatedRoute`, and `take(2)` (since the first emission is always an empty object), and then take the 2nd emission. There are two problems in my use case for this:\r\n\r\n1) I need this to be synchronous because it creates a race condition with my other `ngOnInit` bootstrap code and there is a chance that another redirect that _shouldn't_ happen could happen first given my app state.\r\n2) If there are no qs params, `ActivatedRoute` subscription doesn't terminate, which will force me to write an additional arbitrary timeout just to get rid of it, or leave it un-terminated. This is not ideal.\r\n","Url":"https://github.com/angular/angular/issues/35018","RelatedDescription":"Open issue \"Make Query String Params Available in ngOnInit ActivatedRoute snapshot\" (#35018)"},{"Id":"556504704","IsPullRequest":false,"CreatedAt":"2020-01-28T22:13:02","Actor":"mbrierst","Number":"35016","RawContent":null,"Title":"Going back/forward multiple steps doesn't reload components sometimes","State":"open","Body":"1.

Yes, the pipeline to build/deploy was working in Angular 8.2, the behaviour changed migrating to Angular 9.rc10\r\n\r\n\r\n### Description\r\n\r\nThe way that angular.json configuration for \"fileReplacements\" and \"assets\" works has changed.\r\n\r\n\r\n## üî¨ Minimal Reproduction\r\n\r\nTo deploy with CloudFoundry I need to provide an environment specific manifest.yml file.\r\nSo I have a manifest.{env}.yml for each environment.\r\n\r\nIn 8.2, I was specifying to replace the manifest file with \"fileReplacements\", and then adding the manifest.yml as an \"asset\" to push to CloudFoundry.\r\n\r\nFor example for the environment \"staging\" I would have:\r\n/src/deployment/manifest.staging.yml\r\n/src/deployment/manifest.yml\r\n\r\nThe first step here would be fileReplacements kicking in, moving the content from manifest.staging.yml inside manifest.yml\r\n\r\nThe second/last step is manifest.yml being included in dist through the \"assets\" configuration, but with the staging's configuration inside.\r\n\r\nInstead, after migrating to Angular 9.rc10, fileReplacements doesn't happen in time and manifest.yml has the content of the original (non-staging) one.\r\n\r\nAs a possible fix I tried this approach:\r\nI tried to change my assets configuration to grab directly the manifest file:\r\n{\r\n\t\"glob\":   \"manifest.staging.yml\",\r\n\t\"input\":  \"apps/appointment-manager/src/deployment\",\r\n\t\"output\": \"manifest.yml\"\r\n},\r\n\r\nI expected:\r\ndist/manifest.yml\r\nInstead I got:\r\ndist/manifest.yml/manifest.staging.yml\r\n\r\nthe output was read as a directory where to place the content.\r\n\r\n## üî• Exception or Error\r\n\r\nNope.\r\n\r\n\r\n## üåç Your Environment\r\n<pre><code>\r\nAngular CLI: 9.0.0-rc.10\r\nNode:

When I navigate away from another page (index > 0) and come back to it, an `ExpressionChangedAfterIthasBeenChecked` error is raised.\r\n\r\nReproduction link : https://stackblitz.com/edit/angular-okcqx3\r\n\r\nSteps to reproduce:\r\n1. Clic on \"item11\" or \"item22\" link, then \"back to table\". No error is raised\r\n2. Navigate to page 2 or 3 and clic any link (\"item33\" for instance), then \"back to table\". Error is raised.\r\n\r\nDetailed messages (two different errors are raised) : \r\n\r\n- `Previous value: 'disabled: true'. Current value: 'disabled: false'`\r\n- `Previous value: 'null: undefined'. Current value: 'null: 33'`\r\n\r\nI know the conditions which can lead to `ExpressionChangedAfterIthasBeenChecked` but could not identify any here. I could narrow the condition for the second error :\r\n\r\n`<a (click)=\"displayItem(item)\" *ngIf=\"item.id\">{{item.name}}</a>`\r\n\r\nHowever, I do not understand why my code would trigger a change during the two detection cycles. I cannot figure out why the `*ngIf` at this line of the template would be interpreted once as undefined, then as 33. The id of the item is always present in this 33 item. The name of the property (`null`) is also quite strange.\r\n \r\n#### Expected Behavior\r\n\r\nNo error raised in browser console.\r\n\r\n#### Actual Behavior\r\n\r\nAn `ExpressionChangedAfterIthasBeenChecked` Error is raised.\r\n\r\nNote : This behavior is present only during development phase as the check is removed as expected by the `--prod` compilation. I did NOT see any production problem related to it. However, due to a general ErrorHandler in the application (which is catching all the frontend errors for proper display), the `ExpressionChangedAfterIthasBeenChecked` is rather annoying as it triggers this general handler.\r\n\r\n#### Environment\r\n\r\n- Angular: 8.2.14\r\n- CDK/Material: 8.2.3\r\n- Browser(s): Tested on Chrome and Firefox\r\n- Operating System : Win 10\r\n","Url":"https://github.com/angular/components/issues/18311","RelatedDescription":"Open issue \"Table with paginator, ExpressionChangedAfterItHasBeenChecked when restoring page index\" (#18311)"},{"Id":"556164808","IsPullRequest":false,"CreatedAt":"2020-01-28T12:04:24","Actor":"aitboudad","Number":"18310","RawContent":null,"Title":"[Form field] mat-label doesn't not instantly reflected in UI when using ngIf","State":"open","Body":"#### Reproduction\r\n\r\nhttps://stackblitz.com/edit/angular-mscc8j\r\n \r\n \r\n#### Expected Behavior\r\n\r\nshould render label when is set\r\n\r\n\r\n#### Actual Behavior\r\n\r\nWhen the label is set the UI doesn't detect changes until the field catches focus\r\n\r\n\r\n#### Environment\r\n\r\n- Angular: `8.2.14`\r\n- CDK/Material: `8.2.3`\r\n- Browser(s): `Chrome`\r\n- Operating System (e.g. Windows, macOS, Ubuntu): `macOS`\r\n","Url":"https://github.com/angular/components/issues/18310","RelatedDescription":"Open issue \"[Form field] mat-label doesn't not instantly reflected in UI when using ngIf\" (#18310)"},{"Id":"556115865","IsPullRequest":false,"CreatedAt":"2020-01-28T11:50:06","Actor":"miohtama","Number":"18309","RawContent":null,"Title":"StackBlitz links are broken","State":"closed","Body":"#### Documentation Feedback\r\n\r\nCurrently StackBlitz links are not working.\r\n\r\nAn example link picked up from the page:\r\n\r\nhttps://run.stackblitz.com/api/angular/v1?file=src%2Fapp%2Fform-field-overview-example.ts\r\n\r\n<img width=\"625\" alt=\"image\" src=\"https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/49922/73255837-2f859a80-41c1-11ea-9c92-a1a852369a53.png\">\r\n\r\nGives HTTP 500 on StackBlitz\r\n\r\n<img width=\"556\" alt=\"image\" src=\"https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/49922/73255909-4b893c00-41c1-11ea-8577-6812e1efa9c9.png\">\r\n\r\n\r\n**Affected documentation page:** \r\n\r\nThis page https://material.angular.io/components/form-field/examples and many others.\r\n\r\nI suspect the lnk format is somehow wrong, though I do not have insight how Angular and StackBlitz links were wired.\r\n","Url":"https://github.com/angular/components/issues/18309","RelatedDescription":"Closed issue \"StackBlitz links are broken\" (#18309)"},{"Id":"556112894","IsPullRequest":false,"CreatedAt":"2020-01-28T10:23:57","Actor":"xXKeyleXx","Number":"18308","RawContent":null,"Title":"Stuttering scrollbar (Virtual scrolling) when using el.offsetHeight","State":"open","Body":"#### Reproduction\r\n\r\nhttps://stackblitz.com/edit/angular-dz9eqz?file=src%2Fapp%2Fcdk-virtual-scroll-overview-example.ts\r\n\r\nSteps to reproduce:\r\n1.
