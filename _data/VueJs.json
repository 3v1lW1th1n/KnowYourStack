First contributor + pretty new to Vue 👋 😄 \r\n\r\nThis PR adds `aria-current=\"page\"` to active links, and resolves #2116. I made the following two choices:\r\n\r\n1. Use `aria-current=\"page\"` over other token values\r\nThe original issue mentions allowing custom token values, or future `<router-link>` extension possibilities. That still seems useful, but `aria-current=\"page\"` seems like the right choice at least 90% of the time. The other tokens are either much less common (e.g. `step`) or unlikely to be used with a router at all (e.g. `date`)\r\n\r\n2. Use the `activeClass` logic over only applying it to the exact active route\r\nThis is more hand-wavy, but seems like the better choice -- URL params shouldn't necessarily affect `aria-current`, and it's not the worst thing to have parent routes also receive `aria-current` if `exact` is not applied.\r\n\r\nI'm hoping this is a small enough change that it can go in before the harder work of figuring out how to extend `<router-link>` is done, and it seems like a sensible default even with customization. I've run into some issues using vue-router b/c of this, so I'd personally love to see `aria-current` added :). I'm happy to answer any questions on the accessibility side, and let me know if I missed anything PR-wise.

But `beforeRouteEnter` can not modify existing state (or even access it). \r\n\r\n\r\n### What is expected?\r\nSince the component is reused, I would expect `beforeRouteUpdate` to be fired.\r\n\r\nIn my situation, if my query param changes, I need to fetch new data from the backend and store them in local state. As of now, there is no easy way to detect that my param changes.\r\n\r\nI would need to add a watcher on $route, but that watcher will run in every other child component since my component is not destroyed. \r\n\r\n### What is actually happening?\r\n`beforeRouteEnter` is fired\r\n\r\n---\r\nWith this situation, if I keep using `keep-alive` , it makes it pretty hard to detect when my page is openend again. \r\nSince my watchers would still run even when I am visiting other child-pages, there is a lot of overhead of introducing a $route watcher that performs some action when my query params change. In addition, I would need to make sure that the action only triggers when I am actually seeing this sub-page (requiring my component to be aware of its route, which feels wrong). \r\n\r\nI think that in cases with existing components, Vue Router should fire `beforeRouteUpdate` even when the route changes. \r\nI do understand though that technically the route is changing so it makes sense to call beforeRouteEnter instead of Update. \r\nBut then, it would help if the second beforeRouteEnter, that is called when then component already exists, has access to `this`.\r\n\r\n<!-- generated by vue-issues.

Clicking on the home tab (router link) destroys the about component and resets lingeringObj to null- this causes the LingeringObject to get removed by the garbage collector- this is all fine, and can be tested by taking a heap snapshots in chrome. Now, the memory leak that I've noticed happens when you use the 'Go Home' button on the about tab. This uses router.push() instead of a \\<router-link\\>. After clicking the Go Home button, if you take a snapshot, you'll notice the LingeringObject is still in memory. What's even weirder is when you inspect the object to see what is still holding onto a reference of it- it's showing HTMLButtonElement, which is the Go Home button. Very peculiar. According to the [vue router documentation](https://router.vuejs.org/guide/essentials/navigation.html#router-push-location-oncomplete-onabort): \"...clicking \\<router-link :to=\"...\"\\> is the equivalent of calling router.push(...).\"\r\n\r\nHere is the source code for the reproduction link:\r\nhttps://github.com/ChuckFields/VueRouterLingeringObject\r\n\r\n### What is expected?\r\nThe LingeringObject to get removed from memory when using router.push()\r\n\r\n### What is actually happening?\r\nIt's staying in memory\r\n\r\n<!-- generated by vue-issues.

But if I decide to create an additional route afterwards, this would not be available as the catch-all route would take priority.\r\n\r\nFor example, I want to allow administrator users to press an \"Add content to this URL\" button when they land on a URL that doesn't exist in the route list. In order to achieve this, I would need to create a new route for the non-existent URL *before* the catch-all route. The only alternative I can currently see is to completely refresh the page using a POST request to add the URL or to dismantle and recreate the Vue.$router object.\r\n\r\n### What does the proposed API look like?\r\nFor my specific use-case, I expect the desired behaviour could be achieved by adding an optional \"before\" parameter to the addRoutes function e.g. `router.addRoutes([ { path:\"/new-page\" } ], catchAllRoute)`. But I see a greater benefit in general if the route list could be accessed and updated in a more dynamic way.\r\n\r\n<!-- generated by vue-issues.
