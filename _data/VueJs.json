Reason for this is large number of DOM tree. Notice that ul tags have v-pre directive.\r\n\r\n### What is expected?\r\nI expect that Vue.js will skip elements that are marked with v-pre and execution time should be similar to template without these lists.(https://jsfiddle.net/sqyzd6f9/) \r\n\r\n### What is actually happening?\r\nVue.js skip evaluating of vue tags, but still somehow compile and parse this static content and execution time is similar to normal template without v-pre.(https://jsfiddle.net/58kguf39/1/)\r\n\r\n<!-- generated by vue-issues.

But `beforeRouteEnter` can not modify existing state (or even access it). \r\n\r\n\r\n### What is expected?\r\nSince the component is reused, I would expect `beforeRouteUpdate` to be fired.\r\n\r\nIn my situation, if my query param changes, I need to fetch new data from the backend and store them in local state. As of now, there is no easy way to detect that my param changes.\r\n\r\nI would need to add a watcher on $route, but that watcher will run in every other child component since my component is not destroyed. \r\n\r\n### What is actually happening?\r\n`beforeRouteEnter` is fired\r\n\r\n---\r\nWith this situation, if I keep using `keep-alive` , it makes it pretty hard to detect when my page is openend again. \r\nSince my watchers would still run even when I am visiting other child-pages, there is a lot of overhead of introducing a $route watcher that performs some action when my query params change. In addition, I would need to make sure that the action only triggers when I am actually seeing this sub-page (requiring my component to be aware of its route, which feels wrong). \r\n\r\nI think that in cases with existing components, Vue Router should fire `beforeRouteUpdate` even when the route changes. \r\nI do understand though that technically the route is changing so it makes sense to call beforeRouteEnter instead of Update. \r\nBut then, it would help if the second beforeRouteEnter, that is called when then component already exists, has access to `this`.\r\n\r\n<!-- generated by vue-issues.

Clicking on the home tab (router link) destroys the about component and resets lingeringObj to null- this causes the LingeringObject to get removed by the garbage collector- this is all fine, and can be tested by taking a heap snapshots in chrome. Now, the memory leak that I've noticed happens when you use the 'Go Home' button on the about tab. This uses router.push() instead of a \\<router-link\\>. After clicking the Go Home button, if you take a snapshot, you'll notice the LingeringObject is still in memory. What's even weirder is when you inspect the object to see what is still holding onto a reference of it- it's showing HTMLButtonElement, which is the Go Home button. Very peculiar. According to the [vue router documentation](https://router.vuejs.org/guide/essentials/navigation.html#router-push-location-oncomplete-onabort): \"...clicking \\<router-link :to=\"...\"\\> is the equivalent of calling router.push(...).\"\r\n\r\nHere is the source code for the reproduction link:\r\nhttps://github.com/ChuckFields/VueRouterLingeringObject\r\n\r\n### What is expected?\r\nThe LingeringObject to get removed from memory when using router.push()\r\n\r\n### What is actually happening?\r\nIt's staying in memory\r\n\r\n<!-- generated by vue-issues.

But if I decide to create an additional route afterwards, this would not be available as the catch-all route would take priority.\r\n\r\nFor example, I want to allow administrator users to press an \"Add content to this URL\" button when they land on a URL that doesn't exist in the route list. In order to achieve this, I would need to create a new route for the non-existent URL *before* the catch-all route. The only alternative I can currently see is to completely refresh the page using a POST request to add the URL or to dismantle and recreate the Vue.$router object.\r\n\r\n### What does the proposed API look like?\r\nFor my specific use-case, I expect the desired behaviour could be achieved by adding an optional \"before\" parameter to the addRoutes function e.g. `router.addRoutes([ { path:\"/new-page\" } ], catchAllRoute)`.
