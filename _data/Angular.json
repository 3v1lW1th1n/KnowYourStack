The introduction of the EmptyOutletComponent indeed fixes the issue, however a missing capability is getting reference to the *true* activated component. i.e. When using the (activate) event to get ref to the component instance in the outlet, these named outlets now return an EmptyOutletComponent (correctly) but there is no way to easily get the instance of the actual underlying activated component. It would be nice if we could additionally have a way to get a reference to the router matched component instead of or in addition to the empty outlet component.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Describe the solution you'd like\r\n<!-- ‚úçÔ∏è--> Once possible solution is to simply emit the underlying router matched component INSTEAD of the the EmptyOutletComponent so that developers using the (activate) event on their named outlet will get the expected component instead of an EmptyOutletComponent reference.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n### Describe alternatives you've considered\r\n<!-- ‚úçÔ∏è--> An alternative solution would be to simply merge activate events from the router outlet inside the empty outlet component into the man named outlet's activate events and have developers filter for the one that they want (e.g. type of component != EmptyOutletComponent)\r\n","Url":"https://github.com/angular/angular/issues/27696","RelatedDescription":"Open issue \"Expose matched component inside EmptyOutletComponent\" (#27696)"},{"Id":"391452376","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2018-12-16T10:08:12","Actor":"devversion","Number":"27695","RawContent":null,"Title":"build: test karma disconnect fix","State":"open","Body":"* Tests a Karm fix that should _finally_ ensure that restarted browsers will _be able_ to reconnect and run execution.
