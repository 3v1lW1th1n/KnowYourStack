I am aware that there was already a discussion on this topic in #2872 and can understand the viewpoints expressed by the maintainers there. However I'd still like to ask to reconsider this change and not reject for duplicated navigations.\r\n\r\nThe main arguments I would put into consideration against treating `NavigationDuplicated` as an error are:\r\n\r\n- Not rejecting is more consistent with how `<a>` tags and `<router-link>` are working, i. e. I'd argue it is the API that is least surprising to users of `vue-router` because it is how browsers usually work.\r\n- A client can already find out if a duplication is happening by looking at the current route and the push target if this functionality is desired. While this might be slightly more complicated for that use-case,  the changed API puts a burden on all clients that don't care about the duplication, which is IMHO the more common case.\r\n- It essentially seems not possible anymore to call `push` without an attached `catch` because otherwise we might get irrelevant error logs, i. e. the API is now always (albeit minimally) more complex.\r\n- Introducing the rejection was effectively a breaking change of the API for a lot of clients. The observable behaviour of pushing the same navigation twice was a no-op before and now it isn't anymore.\r\n\r\n### What does the proposed API look like?\r\nA duplicated navigation is a \"no-op\" or warning log in vue-router itself and doesn't require clients to handle this in any way.\r\n\r\n<!-- generated by vue-issues.

My confusion comes from the statement _\"but this component is reused in the new route\"_.  What about in a scenario with `<router-view :key=\"$route.path\">` in which we may navigate from `/user/1` to `/user/2` but we want to animate between the two and thus we force a new component creation (assuming the route path is `/user/:id)`.\r\n\r\nIf you look at the linked codepen console when navigating between the two routes, the component instance is destroyed and a new one created, but it still calls `beforeRouteUpdate`\r\n\r\nWhich of the following should be correct in this scenario?\r\n* `beforeRouteEnter` is called on the destination component because it is a net-new component, even though we're still within the same \"route\".  If so, I think this would be need a bug fix.\r\n* `beforeRouteUpdate` is called on the destination component because even though we use a new component, we remained in the same `/user/:id` \"route\".  If this is the case, I think `vue-router` is functioning correctly but the docs are misleading about `beforeRouteUpdate` being called when the component is reused.\r\n\r\n### What is expected?\r\nFrom the docs are they stand, it seems to me that `beforeRouteEnter` should be called on the new component when using a `<router-view>` `:key` prop that causes a new component instance to be created.  This also is more intuitive IMO because the component is not updating in place.\r\n\r\n### What is actually happening?\r\n`beforeRouteUpdate` is being called\r\n\r\n---\r\nWe found this when trying to figure out the best place to show/hide our loaders during page to page transitions.  Initially it seemed like the `next` callback of `beforeRouteEnter` might be the best place because it triggers after the new DOM was patched.\r\n\r\n<!-- generated by vue-issues.

The first time you click at the \"Create\" link, the page will display correctly with url: http://localhost:8080/event/create, but if you refresh the page even though the url remains the same vue try to load the \"event-show\" component instead.\r\n\r\n### What is expected?\r\nReloading the page does not change the component.\r\n\r\n### What is actually happening?\r\nWhen page is reloaded the url: http://localhost:8080/event/create tries to load \"event-show\" component instead of its own component \"event-create\".\r\n\r\n---\r\nA solution to the problem is simply changing the router's order like so:\r\n\r\nroutes: [\r\n    {\r\n      path: '/',\r\n      name: 'event-list',\r\n      component: EventList\r\n    },\r\n{\r\n      path: '/event/create',\r\n      name: 'event-create',\r\n      component: EventCreate\r\n    },\r\n    {\r\n      path: '/event/:id',\r\n      name: 'event-show',\r\n      component: EventShow,\r\n      props: true\r\n    }\r\n  ]\r\nThen it works perfectly fine. Not sure why vue-router gets confused when you have a router that receives a parameter above the one you're trying to access.\r\n\r\nCould it be recognizing the \"/create\" as being a prop/parameter?\r\n\r\n<!-- generated by vue-issues.

reproduce\r\nSince version 3.1.0 there is a 'fix' which I consider a regression.  \"Errors thrown inside action subscribers no longer cause the entire action to fail.\"\r\n\r\n1) Create an action subscriber\r\n\r\n2) throw an error in the subscriber\r\n\r\n3) --> action is performed regardless of exception\r\n\r\n\r\n### What is expected?\r\nWhen an error is thrown in an action subscriber, I expect the action to be interrupted and the exception to bubble up to the caller.\r\n\r\n### What is actually happening?\r\nThe exception is quietly swallowed.\r\nAlso seems i cannot catch the exception.\r\n\r\n\r\n---\r\nIm not sure you can revert to the old behaviour since other users might be dependent on this silent swallowing (though I fail to see why anyone would like such behaviour :-) ... fail early and never ignore exceptions.)\r\nIf it cant be reverted, it would be nice to be able to interrupt the action flow by some other mechanism.\r\n\r\nI use this as part of validation/permission framework to prevent user in UI to perform actions shes not allowed to do. Of course this is checked in backend also, but user feedback can be given quicker and easier this way and it does not require implementation in every action - only in the subscriber.\r\n\r\n<!-- generated by vue-issues.
