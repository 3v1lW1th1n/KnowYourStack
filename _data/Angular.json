This list is a little arbitrary making it hard to tell when this must be done manually or if `ng_package` does it for you etc. It should probably either do nothing or be replaced with something more generic such as anything in `node_modules` or `dependencies` from `package.json`.\r\n\r\nThe error message is also quite cryptic and appears to be very angular/component specific. For example when depending on `@angular/material/x` I got an error about an ngfactory file file missing from an indirect dependency:\r\n```\r\n[!] (Plugin at position 3 plugin) Error: Could not resolve import '@angular/cdk/scrolling/virtual-scroll-viewport.ngfactory' from '...long tmp dir path.../bazel-out/darwin-fastbuild/bin/<path>/npm.es6/external/angular_material/src/cdk/overlay/overlay-container.js'\r\n```\r\n\r\n## üî¨ Minimal Reproduction\r\nA basic repro showing the issue when depending on material: https://github.com/jbedard/ng_package-material, running `bazel build //ui:npm` produces the error.\r\n\r\nIn this case it can be fixed quite easily by just adding:\r\n```\r\n   globals = {\r\n       '@angular/material/button': 'ng.material.button',\r\n       '@angular/material/icon': 'ng.material.icon',\r\n   }\r\n```\r\nBut that doesn't seem obvious based on the error message, and isn't clear why this one is required but something such as `@angular/animations` is not required.","Url":"https://github.com/angular/angular/issues/28971","RelatedDescription":"Open issue \"ng_package only marks main @angular packages as external\" (#28971)"}],"ResultType":"GitHubIssue"},"AngularCli-Issues":{"Issues":[{"Id":"414764406","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2019-02-26T18:53:06","Actor":"alexeagle","Number":"13776","RawContent":null,"Title":"feat(@angular/cli): recommend plugins that John Papa recommends","State":"open","Body":"This list comes from https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=johnpapa.angular-essentials\r\nBut we don't write a .prettier.json config file so we don't include the Prettier plugin yet\r\n\r\nSuggested by @StephenFluin ","Url":"https://github.com/angular/angular-cli/pull/13776","RelatedDescription":"Open PR \"feat(@angular/cli): recommend plugins that John Papa recommends\" (#13776)"},{"Id":"414572011","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2019-02-26T18:49:59","Actor":"filipesilva","Number":"13773","RawContent":null,"Title":"feat(@schematics/angular): rename experimentalIvy to enableIvy","State":"closed","Body":"Followup to https://github.com/angular/angular/pull/28569#discussion_r259558085","Url":"https://github.com/angular/angular-cli/pull/13773","RelatedDescription":"Closed or merged PR \"feat(@schematics/angular): rename experimentalIvy to enableIvy\" (#13773)"},{"Id":"413896702","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2019-02-26T16:39:59","Actor":"clydin","Number":"13754","RawContent":null,"Title":"fix(@schematics/angular): default newProjectRoot to current directory","State":"closed","Body":"Fixes #13704","Url":"https://github.com/angular/angular-cli/pull/13754","RelatedDescription":"Closed or merged PR \"fix(@schematics/angular): default newProjectRoot to current directory\" (#13754)"},{"Id":"414467571","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2019-02-26T16:37:51","Actor":"alan-agius4","Number":"13770","RawContent":null,"Title":"fix(@angular-devkit/build-angular): sourceMap option not working in t‚Ä¶","State":"closed","Body":"‚Ä¶ests\r\n\r\nFixes #13766","Url":"https://github.com/angular/angular-cli/pull/13770","RelatedDescription":"Closed or merged PR \"fix(@angular-devkit/build-angular): sourceMap option not working in t‚Ä¶\" (#13770)"},{"Id":"414207654","IsPullRequest":false,"CreatedAt":"2019-02-26T16:37:50","Actor":"jvalkeejarvi","Number":"13766","RawContent":null,"Title":"sourceMap option for ng test in angular.json is not working correctly","State":"closed","Body":"<!--üîÖüîÖüîÖüîÖüîÖüîÖüîÖüîÖüîÖüîÖüîÖüîÖüîÖüîÖüîÖüîÖüîÖüîÖüîÖüîÖüîÖüîÖüîÖüîÖüîÖüîÖüîÖüîÖüîÖüîÖüîÖ\r\n\r\nOh hi there!

I've configured my app this way intentionally, and I don't want to see these warnings every time I start my application for development.\r\n\r\nHere is my command:\r\n\r\n    ng serve --host 0.0.0.0 --port 8000 --ssl true --ssl-key localhost.key --ssl-cert localhost.cert\r\n\r\nAnd the warnings:\r\n\r\n```\r\nWARNING: This is a simple server for use in testing or debugging Angular applications\r\nlocally. It hasn't been reviewed for security issues.\r\n\r\nBinding this server to an open connection can result in compromising your application or\r\ncomputer. Using a different host than the one passed to the \"--host\" flag might result in\r\nwebsocket connection issues. You might need to use \"--disableHostCheck\" if that's the\r\ncase.\r\n```\r\n\r\nThe top one is useful, but I don't need to be reminded, I'm already not using Angular CLI in production.\r\n\r\nThe second one is of course useful as well, but I'm running this app inside of a Docker container on my dev machine with an port exposed to the host, so that's not an issue in my case either.\r\n\r\n### Describe the solution you'd like\r\nA broad flag (or a number of more specific flags) to disable warnings at start time.  I have found another issue requesting something like this here:\r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/angular/angular-cli/issues/11802\r\n\r\nHowever, the answer given to this is to redirect stderr.  This does have the desired effect, but it _also_ disables all compile-time errors, which I _need_ for the development process.\r\n\r\n### Describe alternatives you've considered\r\nEither find a configuration that Angular complains about less, or simply ignore the warnings.\r\n","Url":"https://github.com/angular/angular-cli/issues/13765","RelatedDescription":"Open issue \"Disable start-up warnings\" (#13765)"},{"Id":"414139127","IsPullRequest":false,"CreatedAt":"2019-02-25T14:44:27","Actor":"mwhitis","Number":"13764","RawContent":null,"Title":"Incorrect scss file name generated","State":"open","Body":"# üêû Bug report\r\n\r\n### Command (mark with an `x`)\r\n<!-- Can you pin-point the command or commands that are effected by this bug? -->\r\n<!-- ‚úçÔ∏èedit: -->\r\n```\r\n- [x] new\r\n- [ ] build\r\n- [ ] serve\r\n- [ ] test\r\n- [ ] e2e\r\n- [ ] generate\r\n- [ ] add\r\n- [ ] update\r\n- [ ] lint\r\n- [ ] xi18n\r\n- [ ] run\r\n- [ ] config\r\n- [ ] help\r\n- [ ] version\r\n- [ ] doc\r\n```\r\n\r\n### Is this a regression?\r\n\r\n<!-- Did this behavior use to work in the previous version? -->\r\n<!-- ‚úçÔ∏è--> Yes, the previous version in which this bug was not present was: ....\r\nHas worked previously, but I don't know how long ago it regressed\r\n\r\n### Description\r\n\r\n<!-- ‚úçÔ∏è--> A clear and concise description of the problem...\r\nUsing cli 7.3.3\r\n\r\nGenerates src/styles.**scss**\r\n\r\nAngular.json looking for src/styles.**sass**\r\n\r\n## üî¨ Minimal Reproduction\r\n\r\nng new foo \r\nY to angular routing\r\nChange Stylesheet to SASS\r\n\r\nng serve\r\n\r\n## üî• Exception or Error\r\n<pre><code>\r\n<!-- If the issue is accompanied by an exception or an error, please share it below: -->\r\n<!-- ‚úçÔ∏è-->\r\nERROR in multi ./src/styles.sass\r\nModule not found: Error: Can't resolve '/Users/mwhitis/git/mwhitis/foo/src/styles.sass' in '/Users/m420498/git/mwhitis/foo'\r\n‚Ñπ ÔΩ¢wdmÔΩ£: Failed to compile.\r\n</code>\r\n</pre>\r\n\r\n\r\n## üåç Your Environment\r\n<pre><code>\r\n<!-- run `ng version` and paste output below -->\r\n<!-- ‚úçÔ∏è-->\r\n     _                      _                 ____ _     ___\r\n    / \\   _ __   __ _ _   _| | __ _ _ __     / ___| |   |_ _|\r\n   / ‚ñ≥ \\ | '_ \\ / _` | | | | |/ _` | '__|   | |   | |    | |\r\n  / ___ \\| | | | (_| | |_| | | (_| | |      | |___| |___ | |\r\n /_/   \\_\\_| |_|\\__, |\\__,_|_|\\__,_|_|       \\____|_____|___|\r\n                |___/\r\n\r\n\r\nAngular CLI: 7.3.3\r\nNode: 11.10.0\r\nOS: darwin x64\r\nAngular: 7.2.6\r\n... animations, common, compiler, compiler-cli, core, forms\r\n... language-service, platform-browser, platform-browser-dynamic\r\n... router\r\n\r\nPackage                           Version\r\n-----------------------------------------------------------\r\n@angular-devkit/architect         0.13.3\r\n@angular-devkit/build-angular     0.13.3\r\n@angular-devkit/build-optimizer   0.13.3\r\n@angular-devkit/build-webpack     0.13.3\r\n@angular-devkit/core              7.3.3\r\n@angular-devkit/schematics        7.3.3\r\n@angular/cli                      7.3.3\r\n@ngtools/webpack                  7.3.3\r\n@schematics/angular               7.3.3\r\n@schematics/update                0.13.3\r\nrxjs                              6.3.3\r\ntypescript                        3.2.4\r\nwebpack                           4.29.0\r\n</code></pre>\r\n\r\n**Anything else relevant?**\r\n<!-- ‚úçÔ∏èIs this a browser specific issue?
