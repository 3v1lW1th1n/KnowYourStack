The end user would be able to continue to paginate until there is no results from the backend. \r\n\r\nTwo issues\r\n\r\n1. You wouldn't know the actual max length.\r\n2. If the last page set returns the same as the page size, then it would still allow to paginate to next page. However, there would be no results.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe end user who can live with these two issues can simply mask the total length by specifying the display label  such as \"More\" or \"...\"\r\n\r\nExample.\r\n\r\n200-300 (More) \"<\"  \">\"\r\nOr\r\n200-300 (...) \"<\"  \">\"\r\n\r\n<mat-paginator [maskTotal]=\"true\"  [maskTotalLabel]=\"'More'\"","Url":"https://github.com/angular/components/issues/17449","RelatedDescription":"Open issue \"Enhance the mat-paginator so the total length can be masked.\" (#17449)"},{"Id":"509309147","IsPullRequest":false,"CreatedAt":"2019-10-18T21:02:40","Actor":"achrafjdily","Number":"17448","RawContent":null,"Title":"mat-chip separatorKeyCodes doesn't work if the mat-auto-complete panel is open ","State":"open","Body":"#### Reproduction\r\n\r\nUse StackBlitz to reproduce your issue: https://run.stackblitz.com/api/angular/v1?file=app%2Fchips-autocomplete-example.ts\r\n\r\nSteps to reproduce:\r\n1. try to write 'app' and tap enter or comma to add the chip \r\n2. you can't add 'app' in this case because apple is present in the autocomplete\r\n \r\n \r\n#### Expected Behavior\r\n\r\nThe autocomplete should not  prevent the user from adding chips\r\n\r\n#### Actual Behavior\r\n\r\nThe autocomplete prevent adding chips\r\n\r\n\r\n#### Environment\r\n\r\n- Angular:8.1.0\r\n- CDK/Material:8.2.1\r\n- Browser(s): chrome\r\n- Operating System (e.g. Windows, macOS, Ubuntu): win 10 \r\n","Url":"https://github.com/angular/components/issues/17448","RelatedDescription":"Open issue \"mat-chip separatorKeyCodes doesn't work if the mat-auto-complete panel is open \" (#17448)"},{"Id":"509011140","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2019-10-18T20:43:10","Actor":"devversion","Number":"17444","RawContent":null,"Title":"refactor: hammer migration should add \"HammerModule\" if needed","State":"closed","Body":"The v9 HammerJS migration should add the `HammerModule` to the\r\napp module if needed.\r\n\r\nAdditionally if HammerJS is not used in templates (or in general),\r\nwe remove references to the \"HammerModule\".

Put a tooltip on a `matTabLink`\r\n2. Disabled the `matTabLink`\r\n \r\n#### Expected Behavior\r\n\r\nTab should be disabled, and tooltip should show.\r\n\r\n#### Actual Behavior\r\n\r\nTooltip did not show.\r\n\r\n#### Notes/Thoughts\r\n\r\nIf the input is changed to `matTabLinkDisabled`, then `disabled` and `[disabled]=\"true\"` should still be able to work. However, it would also be possible to use `matTabLinkDisabled`, which would make it possible to disable the `MatTabLink` specifically, without disabling any other directive on the element.\r\n\r\nI *believe* this would be a non breaking change, as the input is declared in the `inputs` field on component:\r\n\r\n```typescript\r\n@Directive({\r\n  selector: '[mat-tab-link], [matTabLink]',\r\n  exportAs: 'matTabLink',\r\n  inputs: ['disabled', 'disableRipple', 'tabIndex'], // <== HERE\r\n  host: {\r\n    'class': 'mat-tab-link',\r\n    '[attr.aria-current]': 'active ? \"page\" : null',\r\n    '[attr.aria-disabled]': 'disabled',\r\n    '[attr.tabIndex]': 'tabIndex',\r\n    '[class.mat-tab-disabled]': 'disabled',\r\n    '[class.mat-tab-label-active]': 'active',\r\n  }\r\n})\r\nexport class MatTabLink \r\n```\r\nSo *my understanding* is right now, you can‚Äôt read the disabled field by name anyways.\r\n\r\n#### Environment\r\n\r\n- Angular: 8.2.11\r\n- CDK/Material: 8.2.1\r\n- Browser(s): Version 77.0.3865.120 (Official Build) (64-bit)\r\n- Operating System (e.g. Windows, macOS, Ubuntu): Debian Rodette\r\n","Url":"https://github.com/angular/components/issues/17446","RelatedDescription":"Open issue \"matTabLink `disabled` input should be `matTabLinkDisabled`\" (#17446)"}],"ResultType":"GitHubIssue"}},"RunOn":"2019-10-23T05:30:06.2038553Z","RunDurationInMilliseconds":3377}
