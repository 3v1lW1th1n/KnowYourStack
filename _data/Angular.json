For example, we have Shop part and Settings part in our app. I think it would be nice to compile components in shop part in some child zone of angular zone like `shop`. Settings part would be compiled in `settings` zone. Also, it would be nice to allow create hierarchy of zones. Like shop/cart or shop/sales or settings/profile, settings/subscription, settings/cards etc. Also, you can have shared reusable component which is used in settings and in shop modules. It would be compiled in settings/list and shop/list zones.\r\n\r\nWhat are profits:\r\n- easily debug how your application works (for example you have shared service with business logic or logger service and you can understand context in methods of such services).\r\n- track contexts of API requests (for example in our app we have tons of requests and we can implement some monitoring on server side. we use such feature in AngularJS part of our application).\r\n\r\n### Describe the solution you'd like\r\n<!-- ✍️--> If you have a solution in mind, please describe it.\r\n\r\nExample:\r\n\r\n```\r\n@Component({\r\n  selector: `app-shop-container`,\r\n  template: `\r\n    <app-profile-data></app-profile-data>\r\n    <app-shop-cart></app-shop-cart>\r\n    <app-shop-sales></app-shop-sales>\r\n    <app-shop-goods></app-shop-goods>\r\n  `,\r\n  zone: `shop`\r\n})\r\nexport class ShopCart {\r\n}\r\n\r\n@Component({\r\n  selector: `app-shop-cart`,\r\n  template: `\r\n    <div></div>\r\n  `,\r\n  zone: `cart`\r\n})\r\nexport class ShopCart {\r\n  ngAfterViewInit() {\r\n    fetchCart(); // this would be in zone shop/cart\r\n  }\r\n}\r\n\r\n@Component({\r\n  selector: `app-shop-goods`,\r\n  template: `\r\n    <div></div>\r\n  `\r\n})\r\nexport class ShopGoods {\r\n  ngAfterViewInit() {\r\n    fetchGoods(); // this would be in zone shop (since we don't have zone property in decorator\r\n  }\r\n}\r\n\r\n\r\n@Component({\r\n  selector: `app-settings-container`,\r\n  template: `\r\n    <app-profile-data></app-profile-data>\r\n    <app-profile-edit></app-profile-edit>\r\n  `\r\n  zone: `settings`\r\n})\r\nexport class ShopGoods {\r\n  ngAfterViewInit() {\r\n    fetchSomething(); // this would be in zone settings\r\n  }\r\n}\r\n\r\n@Component({\r\n  selector: `app-profile-data`,\r\n  template: `\r\n    <app-profile-data></app-profile-data>\r\n    <app-profile-edit></app-profile-edit>\r\n  `\r\n  zone: `profile-data`\r\n})\r\nexport class ShopGoods {\r\n  ngAfterViewInit() {\r\n    fetchProfile(); // this would be in zone settings/profile-data or shop/profile-data (it depends on place where component is rendered: in shop module, or in settings module\r\n  }\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nAll of these zones are children of `angular` zone, so they would not affect change detection, rendering and others.\r\n\r\nI think it could be made by improvement of Component/Directive decorators. `zone` properties should be added there. This properties should somehow be stored in views which are created when application compiles. For example, in `view.zone` property. And final point that ngfactories of views/components (if I remember correctly it is about `view.def.updateDirectives`) should be called in `view.zone` zone. If zone was not passed to Component/Directive decorator, then zone from parent view would be in created view.\r\n\r\nIf anybody will use something like `NgZone.isInAngularZone` method in such zones he will get same result as now, since all of created zones are children of `angular` zone.\r\n\r\n### Describe alternatives you've considered\r\n<!-- ✍️--> Have you considered any alternative solutions or workarounds?\r\n\r\nOur team tried some ways. I will describe one of them, which was the closest.\r\n\r\nWe tried to create our own decorator like Component which will call constructor and patch methods of the component. Patched methods are same methods, but with `zone.run` wrapper. Such decorator was able to accept `zoneName` property. This way does not work, since we got exception on AOT build.\r\n\r\nAny way, this way is not what we need there. If I remember correctly, there was not any problem with calling `cdr.detectChanges` manually. Zones were correct in child components. But if component was created after calling `appRef.tick`, then zone was not correct (`angular` zone). It happened because some other part of application triggered `tick` and `changeDetection` from root.\r\n\r\nTrying to run `appRef.tick` in some specific zone is not correct, since change detection in whole application would be performed in some specific zone.\r\n\r\nSeems to me, correct way to solve the problem is running ngfactories of components in needed zones.

Using a custom datepicker validator should be allowed instead of it.\r\n\r\n#### Actual Behavior\r\n\r\nFor invalid non-empty values, this is the control errors object:\r\n\r\n```json\r\n{ \"required\": true, \"matDatepickerParse\": { \"text\": \"jjj\" } }\r\n```\r\n\r\n#### Environment\r\n\r\n```console\r\nAngular CLI: 8.2.0\r\nNode: 12.8.0\r\nOS: darwin x64\r\nAngular: 8.2.0\r\n... animations, cli, common, compiler, compiler-cli, core, forms\r\n... language-service, platform-browser, platform-browser-dynamic\r\n... router\r\n\r\nPackage                           Version\r\n-----------------------------------------------------------\r\n@angular-devkit/architect         0.802.0\r\n@angular-devkit/build-angular     0.802.0\r\n@angular-devkit/build-optimizer   0.802.0\r\n@angular-devkit/build-webpack     0.802.0\r\n@angular-devkit/core              8.2.0\r\n@angular-devkit/schematics        8.2.0\r\n@angular/cdk                      8.1.2\r\n@angular/flex-layout              8.0.0-beta.26\r\n@angular/material                 8.1.2\r\n@ngtools/webpack                  8.2.0\r\n@schematics/angular               8.2.0\r\n@schematics/update                0.802.0\r\nrxjs                              6.5.2\r\ntypescript                        3.5.3\r\nwebpack                           4.38.0\r\n```","Url":"https://github.com/angular/components/issues/16761","RelatedDescription":"Open issue \"Datepicker required validation is wrong\" (#16761)"},{"Id":"480008204","IsPullRequest":false,"CreatedAt":"2019-08-13T07:46:21","Actor":"jochenjonc","Number":"16760","RawContent":null,"Title":"Form Field font size","State":"open","Body":"#### Documentation Feedback\r\n\r\nI'm struggling with using mat-typography in combination with other material controls, especially mat-form-field. When using the class mat-typography on a container of even the body of the page all mat-form-field elements under within that container have smaller fonts, 14px instead of 16px. This creates an inconsistent layout. \r\n\r\nThere is no documentation on how to cope with that or that warns for this issue. For the moment I have no idea how to fix it. I want the mat-form-fields to not change their size because I'm using mat-typography. The only explanation I found is this  #8939.\r\n\r\nBut I think that if this is default behavior it should be explained better in the documentation.\r\n\r\n**Affected documentation page:** https://material.angular.io/guide/typography\r\n","Url":"https://github.com/angular/components/issues/16760","RelatedDescription":"Open issue \"Form Field font size\" (#16760)"},{"Id":"479860847","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2019-08-12T21:34:50","Actor":"mbehrlich","Number":"16759","RawContent":null,"Title":"feat(google-maps): add input options for google Map component","State":"open","Body":"Add inputs to configure Google Map, including the main options, as well\r\nas center and zoom.
