Please describe.\r\n\r\nWhen the SemVer 2.0.0 changes were introduced to the V2 and V3 protocol, they are intended to mitigate the impact of SemVer 2.0.0 packages breaking old clients, e.g. suppose a very popular package released a SemVer 2.0.0 version. In such a case a 2.x customer would fail to restore a package because the version parsing would explode. So we make SemVer 2.0.0 packages \"opt-in\". \r\n\r\nThis protocol change meant that SemVer 2.0.0 packages were hidden in most of our APIs for clients that predate NuGet version 4.3. 4.3 is when the SemVer 2.0.0 protocol was implemented. At that same time we put a warning banner on nuget.org.\r\n\r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/94054/73881689-a223f500-4815-11ea-8717-653f6302cc65.png)\r\nhttps://www.nuget.org/packages/NuGet.Versioning/5.5.0-preview.2.6382\r\n\r\nA similar warning is also visible during UI upload and during package push. And during pack (NU5105).\r\n\r\nSince 4.3 was shipped so long ago, most clients now support the SemVer 2.0.0 protocol and this warning is more noisy than helpful.\r\n\r\nRange | Percent | Note\r\n-- | -- | --\r\n≥ 4.3 | ~96.4% | Supports SemVer 2.0.0 protocol\r\n≥ 3.0 && < 4.3 | ~3.6% | Partial SemVer 2.0.0 but not SemVer 2.0.0 protocol `*`\r\n< 3.0 | ~0.0% | Does not support SemVer 2.0.0\r\n\r\n`*` =\r\n- Anything before 4.3 will not see SemVer 2.0.0 in search or in the PM UI.\r\n- 3.5.0 and on supported SemVer 2.0.0 restore in packages.config so people can hand edit to work-around.\r\n- PackageReference always supported SemVer 2.0.0 from what I can tell so people could hard-code a SemVer 2.0.0 package in their .csproj and still restore.\r\n- V3 feeds always return SemVer 2.0.0 packages from flat container so packages can be found prior to SemVer 2.0.0. protocol support\r\n\r\n### Describe the solution you'd like\r\n\r\nRemove these warnings entirely.\r\n\r\n### Additional details\r\n\r\nPrompted by https://twitter.com/SimonCropp/status/1169447145939685376, https://github.com/NuGet/NuGetGallery/pull/7772, and https://github.com/NuGet/Home/issues/5201.\r\n\r\n/cc @nkolev92 @SimonCropp @agr @karann-msft \r\n"}],"ResultType":"GitHubEvent"},"Home":{"Events":[{"Id":"11660190382","Type":"IssuesEvent","CreatedAt":"2020-03-03T02:29:59","Actor":"shantanu1singh","Repository":"NuGet/Home","Organization":"NuGet","RawContent":null,"RelatedAction":"opened","RelatedUrl":"https://github.com/NuGet/Home/issues/9248","RelatedDescription":"Opened issue \"Content hash validation failure across operating systems and processor architectures\" (#9248) at NuGet/Home","RelatedBody":"Please read the following information before posting the issue.\r\n\r\n## Details about Problem\r\n\r\nNuGet product used (NuGet.exe | VS UI | Package Manager Console | dotnet.exe): dotnet\r\n\r\nNuGet version (x.x.x.xxx): 5.4.0.1\r\n\r\ndotnet.exe --version (if appropriate): 3.1.102\r\n\r\nVS version (if appropriate):\r\n\r\nOS version (i.e. win10 v1607 (14393.321)): \r\nWin10 v1909 (18363.657)\r\nand Ubuntu 19.04 amd64\r\n\r\nWorked before?

The difference in the lock files indicates that it's because of the runtime identifier specification bringing in some .NET dependencies that are specific to arm64.\r\n\r\nIs this expected? If so, what is the recommended workaround for this? How should we be using lock files across operating systems and processor architectures while still being able to enforce the package versions?\r\n\r\n"},{"Id":"11659640153","Type":"IssuesEvent","CreatedAt":"2020-03-03T00:40:18","Actor":"cdmihai","Repository":"NuGet/Home","Organization":"NuGet","RawContent":null,"RelatedAction":"opened","RelatedUrl":"https://github.com/NuGet/Home/issues/9247","RelatedDescription":"Opened issue \"GeneratePackageOnBuild does not pack project references when building a csproj instead of a solution\" (#9247) at NuGet/Home","RelatedBody":"If you have:\r\n- three projects, A->B->C\r\n- A and C have GeneratePackageOnBuild set to true\r\n- Build A.csproj\r\n\r\nThen A will pack and C won't.
