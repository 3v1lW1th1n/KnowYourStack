Open the JSFiddle\r\n2. Click the \"Change\" button\r\n3. The transition plays (it should not).\r\n\r\nTry removing any of the DOM elements and the errant transition no longer plays!\r\n\r\n### What is expected?\r\nThe transition should not run.\r\n(CSS transition classes should not be applied, hooks should not be called, etc.)\r\n\r\n### What is actually happening?\r\nThe transition is run (CSS transition classes are applied).\r\n\r\n---\r\nI came across this while building a complex form with multiple buttons that appear/disappear based on form state.\r\nI noticed duplicated buttons in one of my unit tests, and found that a transition was being run even though its child's `v-if` binding was not being changed. I duplicated the component and whittled it down until I arrived at the attached JSFiddle.\r\n\r\n\r\nThis issue appears when the following sequence of elements are aligned:\r\n1. A boolean entry in the Vue component's `data` dictionary (`hasChanges: false`, in the JSFiddle)\r\n\r\nThe DOM contains\r\n2. A `<div>` whose `v-if` is bound to the boolean entry (1).\r\n2. A `<transition>` containing a button which modifies the boolean entry (1).\r\n3. An empty `<transition>` element.\r\n4. A `<div>` whose `v-if` is bound to the boolean entry (1) modified by logical NOT (!). (In the fiddle, `v-if=\"!hasChanges\"`).\r\n\r\nWith this exact structure, modifying the boolean entry (1) will run the transition - even though the transition is not bound to the boolean at all!\r\n\r\nIf you remove any of the above elements, **or even reorder them** (!) the errant transition will not run (which is the correct behavior).\r\n\r\n\r\nWhy does the transition run when placed with this particular set of siblings in this particular order?\r\n\r\n<!-- generated by vue-issues.

On the other hand it is not possible to hook into a plugins destroy/replacement.\r\nIn production mode there is no need for such hook, because it's not possible to remove a plugin (this might be reconsidered after https://github.com/vuejs/vuex/issues/467#issuecomment-266493888).\r\n\r\nBut given the [plugin example](https://vuex.vuejs.org/guide/plugins.html#committing-mutations-inside-plugins) which registers event handlers on the `socket` and taking [hot reloading](https://vuex.vuejs.org/guide/hot-reload.html) into account, the handlers are registered multiple times.\r\nThere is no way to unregister an event handler before the plugin gets replaced.\r\n\r\nI'm not sure if this is a general problem with a HMR system (like webpack's) or if its caused by the [`store.hotUpdate()`](https://vuex.vuejs.org/api/#hotupdate) function. I suspect, that even `store.subscribe()` gets called multiple times causing the code to be executed multiple times after some hot replacements.\r\n\r\n**Workaround**:\r\nStore event handlers in a local variable outside the plugin's context.\r\n\r\n### What does the proposed API look like?\r\nEither additional methods exposed by the plugin (similar to [this](https://github.com/vuejs/vuex/issues/467#issuecomment-270836284)):\r\n```\r\nconst myPlugin = {\r\n  init(store) {\r\n     registerAllEventListeners()\r\n\r\n     store.subscribe((mutation, state) => {\r\n        doSomething()\r\n     })\r\n  },\r\n  beforeDestroy(store) {\r\n     unregisterAllEventListeners()\r\n  }\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nOr as a store instance method:\r\n```\r\nconst myPlugin = (store) => {\r\n   registerAllEventListeners()\r\n\r\n   store.subscribe((mutation, state) => {\r\n       doSomething()\r\n   })\r\n\r\n  store.subscribeBeforeDestroy(() => {\r\n     unregisterAllEventListeners()\r\n  }\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nThe latter wouldn't introduce breaking changes of the plugin API.\r\n\r\n<!-- generated by vue-issues.

Often, I found it is annoying when I \"time-traveled\", there is a side-effect being performed due to the component life cycle or routing middleware try to do their \"regular\" task... this resulted in a polluted mutation records... Consider the fact that some component can be delayed rendered by `v-if=state` (so components may be mounted/unmounted during time-traveling), the same may also happen if the one uses `@vue/vuex-router-sync`, this feature is good to have.\r\n\r\n### What does the proposed API look like?\r\nWhen we click \"time travel to the state\" in the dev tool, Vuex internally have a mechanism to silent and ignore any dispatch or commit to be performed (or prevent state to be mutated during time-traveling).  This locking mechanism can be unlocked if we decide to either **revert** or **traverse** to the latest state (they are basically the same).

It will cause bug easily.\r\nAnd there are duplicated namespace called `\"todos\"`. It will inhibit maintainabillity.\r\n\r\n### What does the proposed API look like?\r\nThe way to introduce it is not to suggest a new API, but to use the existing API properly.\r\nWe can use `createNamespacedHelpers` API with constants in store directory!\r\n\r\n### Example\r\n\r\n_@/store/todos/types.js_\r\n\r\n```js\r\nexport const NAMESPACE = \"todos\";\r\n```\r\n\r\n_@/store/todos/index.js_\r\n\r\n```js\r\nimport { createNamespacedHelpers } from\"vuex\";\r\nimport { NAMESPACE } from \"./types\";\r\n\r\n// Key point !\r\nconst { mapState, mapGetters, mapActions } = createNamespacedHelpers(NAMESPACE);\r\n\r\nexport { mapState, mapGetters, mapActions };\r\n\r\nexport default { /* namespaced, state, getters, mutations, actions */ }\r\n```\r\n\r\n_@/store/todos/getters.js_\r\n\r\n```js\r\n// Key point !\r\nexport const DONE_ITEMS = \"DONE_ITEMS\";\r\nexport const ACTIVE_ITEMS = \"ACTIVE_ITEMS\";\r\n\r\nexport default {\r\n  [DONE_ITEMS]: state => state.items.filter(todo => todo.isDone),\r\n  [ACTIVE_ITEMS]: state => state.items.filter(todo => !todo.isDone)\r\n};\r\n```\r\n\r\nIf we do this, we can use customized binding helpers.\r\n\r\n_my-component.vue_ (TO-BE version)\r\n\r\n```js\r\nimport * as todos from '@/store/todos'; // Key point !\r\nimport * as getters from '@/store/todos/getters'; // Key point !\r\nimport * as actions from '@/store/todos/types'; // Key point !\r\n\r\nexport default {\r\n  computed: {\r\n    ...todos.mapState({\r\n      allItems: ({ items }) => items,\r\n    }),\r\n    ...todos.mapGetters([\r\n      getters.DONE_ITEMS,\r\n      getters.ACTIVE_ITEMS,\r\n    ])\r\n  },\r\n  methods: {\r\n    ...todos.mapActions([\r\n      actions.ADD_ITEM,\r\n    ]),\r\n  }\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nHow about this?

What does it mean? For example, if we are controlling the state of the application drawer (like this [one](https://vuetifyjs.com/en/components/navigation-drawers#example-dark) on the Vuetify project or more specifically some inline editing actions in the data table component) and we would like to connect (even mapping) the store state directly in the component we will not be able to log the mutations there, since there's no mutation action involved.\r\n\r\nMaybe we could use events to try to accomplish that but I'll be far more difficult.\r\n\r\nI think it could be very good for us we have the possibility to log state changes that are not triggered by mutations and actions too.\r\n\r\n### What does the proposed API look like?\r\n```\r\nconst myPlugin = store => {\r\n  // called when the store is initialized\r\n  store.subscribe((state, mutation, action) => {\r\n    // called after every state change and not only on mutations.\r\n    // The mutation comes in the format of `{ type, payload }`.\r\n  })\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\n<!-- generated by vue-issues.
