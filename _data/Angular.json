If the `console.log()` statement is in a function bound to the view model, change detection can recursively run.\r\n\r\nAn easy way to prevent the problem would be to wrap the `console.log` statement to run outside of angular. However, this is very unwieldy and not-obvious to a developer adding `console.log` statements to debug their program (aka me).\r\n\r\nI recognize that this likely could be considered an issue with the 3rd party package. However, I'm not entirely certain that there is anything that _can_ be done from that package, as it is meant to be a generic package used in a variety of projects, and not just Angular projects.\r\n\r\nThe 3rd party package, in this case, is [Sentry](https://github.com/getsentry/sentry-javascript), which overwrites the `console.log` function in order to record breadcrumbs for error logging. I'm opening an issue both here and against Sentry's repo, because I'm very uncertain which project can/should ultimately fix this issue.\r\n\r\nEdit: https://github.com/getsentry/sentry-javascript/issues/1883\r\n\r\n## üî¨ Minimal Reproduction\r\nReproduction repo that uses [Sentry](https://github.com/getsentry/sentry-javascript) to reproduce the problem: https://github.com/ibedard16/sentry-recursion-demo\r\n\r\nInstructions to reproduce are in the [readme](https://github.com/ibedard16/sentry-recursion-demo#the-demo).\r\n\r\n\r\n## üåç  Your Environment\r\n\r\n**Angular Version:**\r\n<pre><code>\r\n     _                      _                 ____ _     ___\r\n    / \\   _ __   __ _ _   _| | __ _ _ __     / ___| |   |_ _|\r\n   / ‚ñ≥ \\ | '_ \\ / _` | | | | |/ _` | '__|   | |   | |    | |\r\n  / ___ \\| | | | (_| | |_| | | (_| | |      | |___| |___ | |\r\n /_/   \\_\\_| |_|\\__, |\\__,_|_|\\__,_|_|       \\____|_____|___|\r\n                |___/\r\n\r\n\r\nAngular CLI: 7.3.1\r\nNode: 8.11.3\r\nOS: win32 x64\r\nAngular: 7.2.4\r\n... animations, common, compiler, compiler-cli, core, forms\r\n... language-service, platform-browser, platform-browser-dynamic\r\n... router\r\n\r\nPackage                           Version\r\n-----------------------------------------------------------\r\n@angular-devkit/architect         0.11.4\r\n@angular-devkit/build-angular     0.11.4\r\n@angular-devkit/build-optimizer   0.11.4\r\n@angular-devkit/build-webpack     0.11.4\r\n@angular-devkit/core              7.1.4\r\n@angular-devkit/schematics        7.3.1\r\n@angular/cli                      7.3.1\r\n@ngtools/webpack                  7.1.4\r\n@schematics/angular               7.3.1\r\n@schematics/update                0.13.1\r\nrxjs                              6.4.0\r\ntypescript                        3.2.4\r\nwebpack                           4.23.1\r\n</code></pre>\r\n\r\n**Anything else relevant?**\r\nUsing `@sentry/browser @4.5.4`","Url":"https://github.com/angular/angular/issues/28647","RelatedDescription":"Open issue \"3rd party packages can cause console.log() to trigger change detection\" (#28647)"},{"Id":"408919002","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2019-02-11T18:35:38","Actor":"devversion","Number":"28646","RawContent":null,"Title":"build: fix rollup config tslint rule not working on windows","State":"open","Body":"The `rollupConfigRule` currently does not work on Windows\r\nbecause it accidentally fails looking for the `rollup.config.js` files.\r\n\r\nThis is because the tslint rule compares the current `ts.SourceFile`\r\nfile path with the `process.cwd()` path.

This is exacerbated by the fact that @angular/material components will implicitly use the default hue of the palette when selecting this text color - for example in `_form-field_theme.scss`:\r\n\r\n  ```$focused-label-color: mat-color($primary);```\r\n\r\nit's very hard to pick a palette whose primary is effective both as a strong background color and as a strong text color for small text on a neutral background _and_ conforms to any existing brand guidelines.\r\n\r\nOne way to fix this would be to extend `mat-palette` with a fourth argument, `$text`. For compatibility it could default to `$default` if not specified, but this would allow you to use a much darker hue on form field labels and so on without making primary backgrounds darker everywhere else.\r\n\r\nYou can quite easily see the accessibility issues with the current system with some of the prepackaged themes.
