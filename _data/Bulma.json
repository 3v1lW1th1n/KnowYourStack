I think this is something that is being done more and more so I'm assuming this will be more and more of a problem so I think it would be best to omit the background-color on the HTML tag.\r\n\r\nPlease let me know if you want me to do further investigation or even make a PR for this.\r\n\r\nThanks for looking into this.\r\n\r\n","Url":"https://github.com/jgthms/bulma/issues/2919","RelatedDescription":"Open issue \"Dark theme issues because bulma sets background-color on HTML element\" (#2919)"},{"Id":"602727387","IsPullRequest":false,"CreatedAt":"2020-04-19T14:23:04","Actor":"marcoczen","Number":"2918","RawContent":null,"Title":"Section doesnt go full width - there is space on  right hand side for scroll bar","State":"open","Body":"###  This is about ** Bulma  CSS v0.8.0 **\r\n### Overview of the problem\r\n\r\n Hi, \r\n\r\n1. With the code block below, i  dont get a full width background image \r\n that spans the entire window. There  is space on the right side of the browser window for a vertical  scrollbar ( the login box is not that tall that we need to scroll  vertically to see everything )\r\n\r\n```\r\n <section class=\"section is-fullheight  background_img\">           \r\n       <div class=\"container\">\r\n              <div class=\"columns is-centered\">\r\n                  <div class=\"column is-3\"> \r\n                        My Login Box Here\r\n                  </div>\r\n              </div>\r\n          </div>\r\n</section>\r\n\r\n```\r\n\r\nNote that when i place my background_img class in in the  html tag as shown below, i get the image to the very edge of both the left and right hand side of the browser window.\r\n```\r\n<html class=\"background_img\"  lang=\"en\" >\r\n```\r\n Is there additional css  or modifier that i need to add to\r\n``` <section class=\"section background_img  is-fullheight\">  ```   or there is another trick that i can use ?\r\n\r\nNote - My aim is to have  a full  window background image with no horizontal or vertical scroll bars since the content is just a login box\r\n\r\n2.

However, my form has `has-text-grey-lighter` color helper class applied. Due to that, when hovering each of the radio buttons, their label's text changes color to dark grey. According to the docs, radio button should not have any color variations, so I believe this is a bug?\r\n\r\n### Steps to Reproduce\r\n\r\n```html\r\n<form class=\"has-text-grey-lighter\">  \r\n  <div class=\"field\">\r\n    <div class=\"control\">\r\n      <label class=\"radio\">\r\n        <input type=\"radio\" name=\"question\">\r\n        Yes\r\n        </label>\r\n      <label class=\"radio\">\r\n        <input type=\"radio\" name=\"question\">\r\n        No\r\n      </label>\r\n    </div>\r\n  </div>\r\n</form>\r\n```\r\n\r\n### Expected behavior\r\n\r\nRadio button's label preserves its initial color when hovered.\r\n\r\n### Actual behavior\r\n\r\nRadio button's label changes color to dark grey when hovered.\r\n\r\nIf this is a bug, I am willing to contribute.","Url":"https://github.com/jgthms/bulma/issues/2906","RelatedDescription":"Open issue \"Radio button's label changes color on hover when color helper is applied\" (#2906)"},{"Id":"598016097","IsPullRequest":false,"CreatedAt":"2020-04-10T18:01:14","Actor":"mkbctrl","Number":"2905","RawContent":null,"Title":"CSS bundle in company of JS file - is it supposed to be that way?","State":"open","Body":"<!-- PLEASE READ THE FOLLOWING INSTRUCTIONS -->\r\n\r\n<!-- Choose one of the following: -->\r\nThis is about **Bulma and the Docs**.\r\n\r\nhttps://bulma.io/documentation/customize/with-webpack/\r\nfollowing the page above.\r\n\r\n### Overview of the problem\r\n\r\nAfter adding bulma to my project I have notice additional .js file generated along with css file.
