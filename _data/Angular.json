This may be a static value or a function that returns a value.This must be specified in the options and cannot be injected. Also the value cannot be determined asynchronously via a Promise or Observable \r\n\r\n\r\n### Describe the solution you'd like\r\n1. Provide a way of injecting the scrollOffset function instead or (or as well as) providing it inline. This would allow us to derive the offset from other Injectable services.\r\n2. Allow the scrollOffset to be determined asynchronously. In our apps we depend on a nav bar that has a dynamic size, this size needs to be accounted for in the scrollOffset, unfortunately the API for this navbar uses promises so we can't easily return a value for the scrollOffset function.

To\r\nsupport this case, the PartialEvaluator has the concept of a foreign\r\nfunction resolver.\r\n\r\nThis allows the interpretation of expressions like:\r\n\r\nconst router = RouterModule.forRoot([]);\r\n\r\neven though the definition of the 'forRoot' function has no body. In\r\nngtsc today, this will be resolved to a Reference to RouterModule itself,\r\nvia the ModuleWithProviders foreign function resolver.\r\n\r\nHowever, the PartialEvaluator also associates any Identifiers in the path\r\nof this resolution with the Reference. This is done so that if the user\r\nwrites\r\n\r\nconst x = imported.y;\r\n\r\n'x' can be generated as a local identifier instead of adding an import for\r\n'y'.\r\n\r\nThis was at the heart of a bug. In the above case with 'router', the\r\nPartialEvaluator added the identifier 'router' to the Reference generated\r\n(through FFR) to RouterModule.\r\n\r\nThis is not correct. References that result from FFR expressions may not\r\nhave the same value at runtime as they do at compile time (indeed, this is\r\nnot the case for ModuleWithProviders). The Reference generated via FFR is\r\n\"synthetic\" in the sense that it's constructed based on a useful\r\ninterpretation of the code, not an accurate representation of the runtime\r\nvalue. Therefore, it may not be legal to refer to the Reference via the\r\n'router' identifier.\r\n\r\nThis commit adds the ability to mark such a Reference as 'synthetic', which\r\nallows the PartialEvaluator to not add the 'router' identifier down the\r\nline. Tests are included for both the PartialEvaluator itself as well as the\r\nresultant buggy behavior in ngtsc overall.\r\n","Url":"https://github.com/angular/angular/pull/29387","RelatedDescription":"Closed or merged PR \"fix(ivy): don't track identifiers of ffr-resolved references\" (#29387)"},{"Id":"422513809","IsPullRequest":false,"CreatedAt":"2019-03-19T02:24:15","Actor":"gak10100","Number":"29391","RawContent":null,"Title":"Route Snapshot fragment is sometimes null and sometimes undefined","State":"open","Body":"<!--🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅\r\n\r\nOh hi there! 😄\r\n\r\nTo expedite issue processing please search open and closed issues before submitting a new one.\r\nExisting issues often contain information about workarounds, resolution, or progress updates.\r\n\r\n🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅-->\r\n\r\n\r\n# 🐞 bug report\r\n\r\n### Affected Package\r\n<!-- Can you pin-point one or more @angular/* packages as the source of the bug? -->\r\n<!-- ✍️edit: --> The issue is caused by package @angular/router\r\n\r\n\r\n### Is this a regression?\r\n\r\n<!-- Did this behavior use to work in the previous version? -->\r\n<!-- ✍️--> No\r\n\r\n\r\n### Description\r\n\r\n<!-- ✍️--> Sometimes the route snapshot fragment is null and sometimes its undefined for the exact same route.

Similarly, we publish whitelabel UI's for our customers, which we also run protractor-driven acceptance tests against, and whose base-url's vary greatly.\r\n\r\nJust now, I noticed this message:\r\n```\r\nOption \"baseUrl\" is deprecated: Use \"baseUrl\" in the Protractor config file instead.\r\n```\r\nWhich I traced to the following entry in the protractor schematic.\r\n```\r\n    \"baseUrl\": {\r\n      \"type\": \"string\",\r\n      \"description\": \"Base URL for protractor to connect to.\",\r\n      \"x-deprecated\": \"Use \\\"baseUrl\\\" in the Protractor config file instead.\"\r\n    }\r\n```\r\nAs our `buildUrl` value is not known ahead of time, we cannot easily use the protractor config file; while we could attempt to inject it via some form of environment parameter, modifying environment parameters is more cumbersome than adding a commandline flag.\r\n\r\n### Describe the solution you'd like\r\nWe do not want this flag to be removed.

I was able to pass extra args with 1.7.X builds but with new CLI versions I can't simply because CLI is very restrictive. \r\n\r\n\r\n### Describe the solution you'd like\r\nDevelopers should be able to pass custom arguments to ng serve command. Classic example as follows. Our current project has so many API endpoints like DEV1, DEV2... SIT1, SIT2, SVP to PROD. So with previous NG CLI versions we had our custom proxy conf file which reads an argument like  endpoint and then proxy to the correct API endpoint. But with new limitation we are unable to do that.\r\nE.g. \r\n`ng serve --ssl true --proxy-config proxy.conf.js --endpoint sit1`\r\n\r\nproxy conf.\r\n\r\n```\r\nconst ENDPOINTS = {\r\n\tlocal: {\r\n\t\tendpoint: 'https://localhost:9443',\r\n\t\tmockEam: true\r\n\t},\r\n\tdev1: {\r\n\t\tendpoint: 'https:/dev.test.com.au',\r\n                autoRewrite: true,\r\n                changeOrigin: true,\r\n\t\tproxy: false\r\n\t},\r\n\tsit1: {\r\n\t\tendpoint: 'https://dev.test.com.au',\r\n                autoRewrite: true,\r\n                changeOrigin: true,\r\n                proxy: true\r\n\t},\r\n\tuat1: {\r\n\t\tendpoint: 'https://uat.test.com.au'\r\n\t},\r\n\tsvp1: {\r\n\t\tendpoint: 'https://svp.test.com.au',\r\n\t\tproxy: true\r\n\t}\r\n};\r\n```\r\n\r\n\r\n### Describe alternatives you've considered\r\nCan't think of any alternatives other than modify the endpoint manually every time which is a poor developer experience.\r\n","Url":"https://github.com/angular/angular-cli/issues/13937","RelatedDescription":"Closed issue \"Enable custom arguments in serve command\" (#13937)"},{"Id":"421974113","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2019-03-17T21:18:22","Actor":"clydin","Number":"13936","RawContent":null,"Title":"feat(@angular-devkit/build-angular): implement stable architect API for karma","State":"open","Body":"This is a continuation of the Angular builder refactoring following the introduction of the new stable architect builder API.\r\nAdditional refactoring and cleanup are possible.
