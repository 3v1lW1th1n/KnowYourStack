It works fine when animating from a known height to an unknown height though.\r\n\r\nFor example, this works correctly:\r\n```\r\nanimations: [\r\n    trigger('expandCollapse', [\r\n      transition('false => true', [\r\n        query('.category', [\r\n          style({ height: 0 })\r\n        ]),\r\n        query('.category', stagger('150ms', [\r\n          animate(\r\n              '600ms cubic-bezier(0.25, 0.8, 0.25, 1)',\r\n              style({ height: '*' })\r\n          )\r\n        ]), { optional: true })\r\n      ])\r\n    ])\r\n```\r\n\r\nBut this does not:\r\n```\r\nanimations: [\r\n    trigger('expandCollapse', [\r\n      transition('true => false', [\r\n        query('.category', stagger('-150ms', [\r\n          style({ height: '*' }),\r\n          animate(\r\n              '600ms cubic-bezier(0.25, 0.8, 0.25, 1)',\r\n              style({ height: 0 })\r\n          )\r\n        ]), { optional: true })\r\n      ])\r\n    ])\r\n```\r\n\r\n\r\n## 🔬 Minimal Reproduction\r\nhttps://stackblitz.com/edit/angular-unknown-height-query-animation-bug?file=src/app/app.component.ts\r\n\r\nIn this example, if you click the \"show\" button you will see it animate to an unknown height just fine. But, once it's expanded and you click the \"hide\" button you will see that it doesn't properly animate from an unknown height back to zero.\r\n","Url":"https://github.com/angular/angular/issues/31520","RelatedDescription":"Open issue \"Animation using query and stagger doesn't properly animate from height: '*'\" (#31520)"},{"Id":"466693201","IsPullRequest":false,"CreatedAt":"2019-07-11T22:14:55","Actor":"ankurgupta12","Number":"31505","RawContent":null,"Title":"Dynamically FormControl not binding","State":"closed","Body":"My code is following .\r\n\r\nin dynamic Form Builder Component is following.\r\n<button (click)=\"addItem()\">Add</button> \r\n<form (ngSubmit)=\"onSubmit(this.form.value)\" [formGroup]=\"form\" class=\"form-horizontal\">\r\n<div formArrayName=\"items\">\r\n<div *ngFor=\"let item of form.get('items').controls; let i=index\" [formGroupName]=\"i\" >\r\n<div *ngFor=\"let field of fields\">\r\n<label class=\"col-md-3 form-control-label\" [attr.for]=\"field.label\">\r\n{{field.label}}\r\n\r\n</label>\r\n<div class=\"col-md-9\" [ngSwitch]=\"field.type\">\r\n<textbox *ngSwitchCase=\"'text'\" [field]=\"field\" [form]=\"form\"></textbox>\r\n</div>\r\n</div>\r\n</div>\r\n</div>\r\n</div>\r\n</form>\r\n`,\r\n})\r\nexport class DynamicFormBuilderComponent implements OnInit {\r\n  // @Output() onSubmit = new EventEmitter();\r\n  @Input() fields;\r\n  form: FormGroup;\r\n  items: FormArray;\r\n  fieldsCtrls = {};\r\n  constructor(public fb: FormBuilder) { }\r\n  ngOnInit() {\r\n    for (let f of this.fields) {\r\n      this.fieldsCtrls[f.name] = new FormControl()\r\n    }\r\nconsole.log(this.fieldsCtrls);\r\n\r\n    this.form = new FormGroup({\r\n      \"items\": new FormArray([new FormGroup(this.fieldsCtrls)])\r\n    });\r\n    console.log('fieldsCtrls', this.form)\r\n    // this.form = new FormGroup(fieldsCtrls);\r\n  }\r\n\r\n\r\n  addItem = () => {\r\n    let fieldsCtrls = {};\r\n    for (let f of this.fields) {\r\n      fieldsCtrls[f.name] = new FormControl(f.value || '')\r\n    }\r\n    this.items = this.form.get('items') as FormArray;\r\n    this.items.push(new FormGroup(fieldsCtrls));\r\n    console.log(this.items);\r\n  }\r\n\r\n\r\n  onSubmit = (data) => {\r\n    console.log(\"===vlaue\", data);\r\n  }\r\n}\r\n\r\nTextBox component is following code .\r\n@Component({\r\n    selector: 'textbox',\r\n    template: `\r\n      <div [formGroup]=\"form\" >\r\n        <input [attr.type]=\"field.type\" class=\"form-control\" id=\"{{field.name}}\" name=\"{{field.name}}\" formControlName=\"{{field.name}}\">\r\n      </div> \r\n    `\r\n})\r\nexport class TextBoxComponent {\r\n    @Input() field;\r\n    @Input() form:FormGroup;\r\n    ngOnInit() {\r\n      console.log(this.field);\r\n    }\r\n    get isValid() { return this.form.controls[this.field.name].valid; }\r\n    get isDirty() { return this.form.controls[this.field.name].dirty; }\r\n  \r\n    constructor() {\r\n\r\n    }\r\n}\r\n\r\nIn appComponent.html\r\n<div class=\"col-sm-12\">\r\n  <div class=\"card\">\r\n    <div class=\"card-header\">Dynamic Forms</div>\r\n    <div class=\"card-body\">\r\n      <dynamic-form-builder [fields]=\"getFields()\"></dynamic-form-builder>\r\n    </div>\r\n  </div>\r\n</div>\r\n\r\nNow error is coming that Cannot find control with name: 'firstName' after adding more fields  also it is showing the same error.

There I have bindings on every component and at the top of the template I have this code:\r\n```\r\n<h2>\r\n    <span *ngIf=\"hasBasicInfo(); else missing\">\r\n      {{ form.value[basicInfoFormControlName][nameControlName] }}\r\n    </span>\r\n    <ng-template #missing>MISSING</ng-template>\r\n  </h2>\r\n```\r\nThis works perfectly fine until I changed one of subcomponents, which in template looked like this:\r\n```\r\n<st-classification-in-frameworks\r\n              [solution]=\"solution\"\r\n              [selectedSegments]=\"solution.segments\"\r\n              (segmentSelectionChange)=\"updateSolutionOnSegmentSelection($event)\"\r\n></st-classification-in-frameworks>\r\n```\r\nBasically I just deleted `[selectedSegments]=\"solution.segments\"` like and removed an `@Input()` in that component.\r\nAs soon as I do that I get error: `Cannot create property 'ngIf' on number 871548`\r\nIt complains exactly about that `ngIf` I mentioned above. I believe this is a bug in the core rendering(I am using Ivy), because for some reason `instance` in `setInputsForProperty` is evaluated as a number, and not only that, sometimes I am also getting boolean value. This appears to be pretty random, because when I remove else part from that `ngIf` it works again, or if I move it another place. I don't see how my code can be wrong to break it. But I also don't have knowledge of how Ivy works from inside to understand why this happens.\r\n\r\n\r\n## 🔬 Minimal Reproduction\r\nUnfortunately I was not able to reproduce this in any other setup, this issue seems to be pretty specific and quite random.\r\n<!--\r\nPlease create and share minimal reproduction of the issue starting with this template: https://stackblitz.com/fork/angular-issue-repro2\r\n-->\r\n\r\n<!--\r\nIf StackBlitz is not suitable for reproduction of your issue, please create a minimal GitHub repository with the reproduction of the issue.\r\nA good way to make a minimal reproduction is to create a new app via `ng new repro-app` and add the minimum possible code to show the problem. \r\nShare the link to the repo below along with step-by-step instructions to reproduce the problem, as well as expected and actual behavior.\r\n\r\nIssues that don't have enough info and can't be reproduced will be closed.\r\n\r\nYou can read more about issue submission guidelines here: https://github.com/angular/angular/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md#-submitting-an-issue\r\n-->\r\n\r\n## 🔥 Exception or Error\r\n<pre><code>\r\n<!-- If the issue is accompanied by an exception or an error, please share it below: -->\r\n<!-- ✍️-->\r\ncore.js:7187 ERROR TypeError: Cannot create property 'ngIf' on number '871548'\r\n    at setInputsForProperty (core.js:13500)\r\n    at elementPropertyInternal (core.js:12390)\r\n    at Module.ɵɵproperty (core.js:16528)\r\n    at SolutionComponent_Template (solution.component.html:3)\r\n    at executeTemplate (core.js:12007)\r\n    at checkView (core.js:13358)\r\n    at componentRefresh (core.js:13122)\r\n    at refreshChildComponents (core.js:11710)\r\n    at refreshDescendantViews (core.js:11616)\r\n    at renderComponentOrTemplate (core.js:11985)\r\n\r\n</code></pre>\r\n\r\n\r\n## 🌍  Your Environment\r\n\r\n**Angular Version:**\r\n<pre><code>\r\n<!-- run `ng version` and paste output below -->\r\n<!-- ✍️-->\r\nAngular CLI: 8.0.0\r\nNode: 10.16.0\r\nOS: darwin x64\r\nAngular: 8.0.0\r\n... animations, cdk, cli, common, compiler, compiler-cli, core\r\n... forms, language-service, platform-browser\r\n... platform-browser-dynamic, router\r\n\r\nPackage                           Version\r\n-----------------------------------------------------------\r\n@angular-devkit/architect         0.800.0\r\n@angular-devkit/build-angular     0.800.0\r\n@angular-devkit/build-optimizer   0.800.0\r\n@angular-devkit/build-webpack     0.800.0\r\n@angular-devkit/core              8.0.0\r\n@angular-devkit/schematics        8.0.0\r\n@ngtools/webpack                  8.0.0\r\n@schematics/angular               8.0.0\r\n@schematics/update                0.800.0\r\nrxjs                              6.5.2\r\ntypescript                        3.4.5\r\nwebpack                           4.30.0\r\n</code></pre>\r\n\r\n**Anything else relevant?**\r\n<!-- ✍️Is this a browser specific issue?

There are two sets of files to observe:\r\n\r\n- environment.ts and environment.prod.ts\r\n- index.html and index.prod.html\r\n\r\nFile \"angular.json\" has the appropriate \"fileReplacements\" for production build for the two sets of files. The HTML files differ in the `<h1>` tag which clearly indicates development/production. Also, the AppComponent merely reflects \"environment.production\".\r\n\r\n1. Run the app with \"ng serve\", both `<h1>` and AppComponent show \"development\" as expected.\r\n2. Run the app with \"ng serve --prod\", both `<h1>` and AppComponent show \"production\" as expected.\r\n3. Run the app with \"ng build --prod\" and run the app using e.g. \"serve\", the `<h1>` shows \"development\" while AppComponent shows \"production\". Clearly not as expected. Inspecting generated \"dist/index.html\" shows that the file was NOT replaced.\r\n\r\n## 🔥 Exception or Error\r\nThere is no error. If this feature is not supported as some people have indicated in issue #10881, then there should definitely be an error during build that the files are skipped/ignored. There is no indication that the HTML files are skipped.\r\n\r\nIt is strange that \"ng serve --prod\" behaves differently to \"ng build --prod\".\r\n\r\n## 🌍 Your Environment\r\n<pre><code>\r\nAngular CLI: 8.0.6\r\nNode: 10.16.0\r\nOS: win32 x64\r\nAngular: 8.0.3\r\n... animations, common, compiler, compiler-cli, core, forms\r\n... language-service, platform-browser, platform-browser-dynamic\r\n... router\r\n\r\nPackage                           Version\r\n-----------------------------------------------------------\r\n@angular-devkit/architect         0.800.6\r\n@angular-devkit/build-angular     0.800.6\r\n@angular-devkit/build-optimizer   0.800.6\r\n@angular-devkit/build-webpack     0.800.6\r\n@angular-devkit/core              8.0.6\r\n@angular-devkit/schematics        8.0.6\r\n@angular/cli                      8.0.6\r\n@ngtools/webpack                  8.0.6\r\n@schematics/angular               8.0.6\r\n@schematics/update                0.800.6\r\nrxjs                              6.4.0\r\ntypescript                        3.4.5\r\nwebpack                           4.30.0</code></pre>\r\n\r\n**Anything else relevant?**\r\nI have tried running \"ng update\" to get the latest and greatest but it did not work either.\r\n\r\n","Url":"https://github.com/angular/angular-cli/issues/15045","RelatedDescription":"Closed issue \"HTML files and fileReplacements work differently for \"ng serve --prod\" and \"ng build --prod\"\" (#15045)"},{"Id":"466734204","IsPullRequest":false,"CreatedAt":"2019-07-11T08:12:55","Actor":"LastDragon-ru","Number":"15046","RawContent":null,"Title":"`--prod` creates broken builds: ERROR TypeError: (0 , a.default) is not a function","State":"open","Body":"<!--🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅\r\n\r\nOh hi there! 😄\r\n\r\nTo expedite issue processing please search open and closed issues before submitting a new one.\r\nExisting issues often contain information about workarounds, resolution, or progress updates.\r\n\r\n🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅-->\r\n\r\n\r\n# 🐞 Bug report\r\n\r\n### Command (mark with an `x`)\r\n<!-- Can you pin-point the command or commands that are effected by this bug? -->\r\n<!-- ✍️edit: -->\r\n```\r\n- [ ] new\r\n- [x] build\r\n- [x] serve\r\n- [ ] test\r\n- [ ] e2e\r\n- [ ] generate\r\n- [ ] add\r\n- [ ] update\r\n- [ ] lint\r\n- [ ] xi18n\r\n- [ ] run\r\n- [ ] config\r\n- [ ] help\r\n- [ ] version\r\n- [ ] doc\r\n```\r\n\r\n### Description\r\n\r\nI want to use https://github.com/catamphetamine/libphonenumber-js with custom `metadata.json` in my angular app.\r\n\r\n```\r\nimport {formatIncompletePhoneNumber} from 'libphonenumber-js/custom';\r\nimport * as libphonenumber from 'libphonenumber-js/custom';\r\n```\r\n\r\nBoth imports work fine with `serve`/`build`, but in `--prod` mode app doesn't work:\r\n\r\n```\r\ncore.js.pre-build-optimizer.js:15724 ERROR TypeError: (0 , a.default) is not a function\r\n    at Object.e.default [as parsePhoneNumberFromString] (parsePhoneNumberFromString.js.pre-build-optimizer.js:22)\r\n```\r\n\r\n😞\r\n\r\n## 🔬 Minimal Reproduction\r\n\r\nI don't know how to enable `--prod`, but you can download and test it local (`ng serve --prod`).\r\n\r\nhttps://stackblitz.com/edit/angular-agupki\r\n\r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/1329824/61033608-e280d900-a3d4-11e9-9af1-0f94f5587d28.png)\r\n\r\n\r\n## 🔥 Exception or Error\r\n\r\n```\r\n12:03:30.268 main.793a46d7b91ecd8c4773.js:1 ERROR TypeError: (0 , i.default) is not a function\r\n    at u (main.793a46d7b91ecd8c4773.js:1)\r\n    at Object.t.default [as isValidNumber] (main.793a46d7b91ecd8c4773.js:1)\r\n    at e.test (main.793a46d7b91ecd8c4773.js:1)\r\n    at Object.updateRenderer (main.793a46d7b91ecd8c4773.js:1)\r\n    at Object.cu [as updateRenderer] (main.793a46d7b91ecd8c4773.js:1)\r\n    at Td (main.793a46d7b91ecd8c4773.js:1)\r\n    at Rd (main.793a46d7b91ecd8c4773.js:1)\r\n    at Dd (main.793a46d7b91ecd8c4773.js:1)\r\n    at Td (main.793a46d7b91ecd8c4773.js:1)\r\n    at gu (main.793a46d7b91ecd8c4773.js:1)\r\nVu @ main.793a46d7b91ecd8c4773.js:1\r\n12:03:30.268 main.793a46d7b91ecd8c4773.js:1 ERROR CONTEXT e\r\nVu @ main.793a46d7b91ecd8c4773.js:1\r\n12:03:30.268 main.793a46d7b91ecd8c4773.js:1 Angular is running in the development mode.
