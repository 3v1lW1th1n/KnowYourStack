But I've traced the issue to `tokensToFunction` from `path-to-regexp`. The issue seems to have been fixed in v3.1.0 due to [this pr](https://github.com/pillarjs/path-to-regexp/pull/191). You can check eg [`dist/vue-router.esm.js`](https://github.com/vuejs/vue-router/blob/dev/dist/vue-router.esm.js#L619) to see the RegExp does not set the `i` modifier\r\n\r\nThat makes this report more or less a fyi / request to upgrade `path-to-regexp` 😃 \r\n\r\nLocally the error is caused by a route similar to\r\n```\r\n  routes: [{\r\n      path: \"/:locale(en|pt-br)?/:source(.*)?\",\r\n      component: myComponent,\r\n    }],\r\n```\r\n\r\nwhich fails when you browse to e.g. `/pt-BR/path`:\r\n\r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/1067403/64534777-5af11100-d316-11e9-9225-f34616eee0fe.png)\r\n\r\n### What is expected?\r\nThat the token / param is matched case-insensitively\r\n\r\n### What is actually happening?\r\nIt doesnt, causing a missing param error\r\n\r\n<!-- generated by vue-issues.

This means that currently a Nuxt.js app will include two copies of that function, one from vue-router and one from Nuxt.js itself which increases the bundle size needlessly.\r\n\r\nAnother solution for the above could be that `vue-router` would expose the path-to-regexp methods like `tokensToFunction` method so Nuxt.js can use those, but using dependencies has more benefits ofc like quicker delivery of patches for `path-to-regexp`.\r\n\r\n### What does the proposed API look like?\r\nRevert: 76d83b6eb4af507763c5ee6f61a52ed9a7804572\r\n\r\n<!-- generated by vue-issues.

The router-view does not produce a console error or warning when it has been included in the template even though it has not been provided a component to render by the router.\r\n\r\n---\r\nThis issue has a lot of overlap with #2105, but this issue is focused on the developer experience rather than adding functionality to support the desired syntax. There are reasonable workarounds proposed in #2105, but they don't address the fact that developers who fall into this pattern have to spend time and effort debugging this undefined behavior due to the lack of feedback from the library. This deviates from the expectations established by the useful console warnings provided when using named routes incorrectly.\r\n\r\nSome solutions to this problem that were not explored in #2105 include:\r\n\r\n- Warning about router views with no component in the console\r\n- Adding more explicit requirements to the documentation. All router views must specify a component containing a router view to propagate rendering to child route components\r\n\r\n<!-- generated by vue-issues.

This allows the mutation functions to directly update the payload data rather than the state object.\r\n\r\nAs an example see [editTodo() in the todo demo](https://github.com/vuejs/vuex/blob/91f3e69ed9e290cf91f8885c6d5ae2c97fa7ab81/examples/todomvc/store/mutations.js#L17):\r\n\r\n```javascript\r\neditTodo (state, { todo, text = todo.text, done = todo.done }) {\r\n  todo.text = text\r\n  todo.done = done\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nThere are 2 downsides to this.\r\n\r\nThe first is that the function is mutating the payload and not the state. It is not clear here what is being mutated. We now need to traverse all around the app to find out.\r\n\r\nIf the payload was instead passed by value then updating the value would not actually do anything. All mutation functions would need to update the state object. This would make vuex stores more explicit and understandable as well as ensure there is a clear boundary between it and the app. \r\n\r\nThe second is that Vuex plugins cannot log the mutations to a server and replay them back later. Here is a pseudocode example:\r\n\r\n```javascript\r\n// replaying back mutation logs\r\nlet logs = await getLogsFromServer();\r\nfor (log in logs) {\r\n  // any editTodo mutations passed in below will not work\r\n  // as the mutation will update the \"log\" object instead of \r\n  // the actual todo in the state object\r\n  this.store.commit(log.type, log.payload);\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nI'm working on a plugin that does this (similar to [redux-vcr](https://github.com/joshwcomeau/redux-vcr)) and it would be great if there was a systematic guarantee that it would work with all Vuex stores. \r\n\r\n### What does the proposed API look like?\r\nExample - No changes needed\r\n```javascript\r\nmutations: {\r\n  // current: n is passed by reference\r\n  increment (state, n) { \r\n    state.count  = n\r\n  }\r\n}\r\n\r\nmutations: {\r\n  // proposed: n is passed by value\r\n  increment (state, n) { \r\n    state.count  = n\r\n  }\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nExample B - editTodo\r\n\r\n```javascript\r\nmutations: {\r\n  // current - can update payload\r\n  editTodo (state, { todo, text = todo.text, done = todo.done }) {\r\n    todo.text = text\r\n    todo.done = done\r\n  }\r\n}\r\n\r\nmutations: {\r\n  // proposed - with pass by value we \r\n  // must update the state object\r\n  editTodo (state, todo) {\r\n     const index = state.todos.findIndex(t => t.id === todo.id);\r\n     state.todos[index] = todo;\r\n  }\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\n<!-- generated by vue-issues.
