This one works fine on every situation (despite the performace issues that may arise when using large dataproviders)\r\n\r\nThe one on the right is a mat-select using virtual-scroll. This one has several issues. I will just describe one here which I believe it's not been filed yet.\r\n\r\nSteps to reproduce:\r\n\r\n1. Select an option from the mat-select on the Right.

I use custom directive to do that.\r\n\r\n#### What troubleshooting steps have you tried?\r\n\r\nI use a custom directive to manage zoom on my application layout to bind my user zoom settings. But, mat-select/mat-dialog/mat-menu overlay is out of body element, so overlay don't get css zoom. I have to use [panelClass] input to override size with static css class.\r\n\r\nI don't want to set panelClass attribute every time I need to use \"mat-overlay-component\". \r\n\r\nMaybe there is a better way to do that ?\r\n\r\nSame issue with mat-dialog\r\n\r\n#### Reproduction\r\n\r\nhttps://stackblitz.com/edit/angular-material-example-4wem1y\r\n  \r\n#### Environment\r\n\r\n- Angular: 8.0.0\r\n- CDK/Material: 8.0.0\r\n- Browser(s): chrome 75.0\r\n- Operating System: Windows \r\n","Url":"https://github.com/angular/components/issues/16342","RelatedDescription":"Open issue \"Zoom on overlay mat-components\" (#16342)"},{"Id":"458563487","IsPullRequest":false,"CreatedAt":"2019-06-20T12:45:34","Actor":"benneq","Number":"16340","RawContent":null,"Title":"Bottom Sheet with TemplateRef","State":"closed","Body":"#### Feature Description\r\n\r\nBottom Sheet should be able to display a TemplateRef.
