Great idea, guys. Thank you!\r\nI've read in the [ASP.NET blog](https://blogs.msdn.microsoft.com/webdev/2018/07/25/blazor-0-5-0-experimental-release-now-available/) the following: \r\n\r\n> Blazor 0.5.0 takes the out-of-process model for Blazor and streeeetches it over a network connection so that you can run Blazor on the server. With Blazor 0.5.0 you can run your Blazor components server-side on .NET Core while UI updates, event handling, and JavaScript interop calls are handled over a SignalR connection.\r\n\r\n \r\nThe problem is I can't find any documentation how this is supposed to work. Would you assist me where should I look for more details how to implement this. My scenario includes a background worker which using SignalR to add some items to the client. I wonder if this is possible at this state of the project, because a few lines above in the same post it is said: \r\n\r\n> For example, you might run Blazor in a Web Worker thread so that it runs separately from the UI thread. Events would get pushed from the UI thread to the Blazor worker thread, and Blazor would push UI updates to the UI thread as needed. This scenario isn't supported yet, but it's something Blazor was designed to handle.\r\n\r\n\r\nI honestly can't tell the difference of these two statements, so any help would be greatly appreciated.\r\nThanks and keep the good work going :)\r\nGeorgi","Url":"https://github.com/aspnet/Blazor/issues/1220","RelatedDescription":"Closed issue \"Is it possible to trigger UI changes from the server's background worker?\" (#1220)"},{"Id":"345434765","IsPullRequest":false,"CreatedAt":"2018-07-28T09:25:18","Actor":"uazo","Number":"1221","RawContent":null,"Title":"[Server side] memory leak: invalid disposed IdsEntry in OutOfProcessRenderBatch","State":"open","Body":"With server side Blazor, the out of process render returns invalid id values for disposing component and event handler.\r\n\r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/29201891/43355191-89886dce-9258-11e8-99f0-96dae0128397.png)\r\n","Url":"https://github.com/aspnet/Blazor/issues/1221","RelatedDescription":"Open issue \"[Server side] memory leak: invalid disposed IdsEntry in OutOfProcessRenderBatch\" (#1221)"},{"Id":"345393991","IsPullRequest":false,"CreatedAt":"2018-07-27T23:30:10","Actor":"Andrzej-W","Number":"1219","RawContent":null,"Title":"Experiment: Blazor Client vs Server performance","State":"open","Body":"Default Blazor application is relatively simple, but for those interested I have just published two versions:\r\n\r\nhttp://blazorserwer.azurewebsites.net/ (blazorserver name is already taken)\r\nhttp://blazorclient.azurewebsites.net/\r\n\r\nBoth applications are in the same S1 plan in Western Europe data centre. Blazor version 0.5.1.\r\n\r\nWhat is worth testing?\r\n1. Click on `Home` and `Counter` menu. In Blazor client version there is no internet transmission at all. In server version `click` is transmitted to the server and server responds with updated page. About 1.5 - 2 KB.\r\n2. You can also click on `Click me` button in `Counter` page. Yet again no transmission in client version and about 600 bytes in server version on every click.\r\n3. Select `Fetch data`. In client version data is transmitted from the server in JSON format - about 5 KB. In server version we receive 26 KB. I have increased number of items to 50.\r\n\r\nIn my opinion server version looks responsive. It is normal that some transmission is required in experiment number 1 and 2. **But I think that in experiment number 3 server version transmits to much data.** If I understand correctly server has to send whole table in HTML format. This table is very simple:\r\n```html\r\n    <table class=\"table\">\r\n        <thead>\r\n            <tr>\r\n                <th>Date</th>\r\n                <th>Temp.

When JS is sending back an array as return of of a method, the runtime just stops. Nothing happen. No errors, nothing.\r\n\r\nTo reproduce:\r\n\r\nOn a TS/JS:\r\n```typescript\r\n  public GetItem(myArray: any): any {\r\n    return myArray\r\n  };\r\n```\r\n\r\nOn C#:\r\nThat works:\r\n```csharp\r\n        public WeatherForecast[] GetItem(WeatherForecast[] myArray)\r\n        {\r\n            return ((IJSInProcessRuntime)JSRuntime.Current).Invoke<WeatherForecast[]>(\"GetItem\", myArray);\r\n        }\r\n```\r\n\r\nThat *doesn't* works:\r\n```csharp\r\n        public Task<WeatherForecast[]> GetItem(WeatherForecast[] myArray)\r\n        {\r\n            return JSRuntime.Current.InvokeAsync<WeatherForecast[]>(\"GetItem\", myArray);\r\n        }\r\n```\r\n\r\nIn other words...

And accessing the DOM remotely (when it will be implemented) will give performance problems certainty.\r\n\r\n- Does it work anywhere? **Yup**\r\nEureka!\r\n\r\n\r\nin the medium term, therefore, for the Blazor development of enterprise applications, the Server Mode is definitely to be preferred, at least until WASM will have access to the DOM (without js) and Mono will permit it, and always that the compiler in the meantime will have WASM targets (because current performance is really low when compared to javascript).\r\n\r\nBut the biggest problem with Server Mode is to interact with the DOM to create the interfaces, which is essential. Developing a new UI library with Blazor without javascript really means starting all over again (unless there are tools from ts to c #, do they exist?).\r\n\r\nCurrently with Blazor it is not possible to reuse ready-made UI libraries, developed in javascript, except for very complicated DOTNET-JS calls (just thinking about it I get a headache).\r\n\r\nWhat is missing is the ability to abstract the js portion of blazor making it extensible using typescript, to allow a dotnet side component (local or remote) to have associated a custom component in the javascript side.\r\n\r\nAt this address https://uazo.github.io/BlazorFX/StandaloneApp/ an application test that uses DevExpress components for rendering: the blazor side components are dotnet (without any reference to interop with js), while rendering is done from javascript elements (DevExtreme from the react version). The dotnet component and the javascript component talks through exchange of custom properties and events (like react). In effect, the glue is a middleware beetween blazor and react, simple to do because DevExtreme is not a native react library but the implementation is simple.\r\n\r\nSo what do you say? Have you ever thought about it? It could also be a temporary solution, which would not deny in future having even full dotnet components (as today for react, not all components are full react made)\r\n\r\nFor those who want the repo is available with all the changes to the base code of blazor (https://github.com/uazo/Blazor/tree/remove-custom-tag).","Url":"https://github.com/aspnet/Blazor/issues/1212","RelatedDescription":"Open issue \"Blazor Server and Client side and Javascript\" (#1212)"},{"Id":"345118349","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2018-07-27T07:22:04","Actor":"uazo","Number":"1209","RawContent":null,"Title":"fix @ChildContent in HtmlBlock codegen","State":"open","Body":"fix #1198 and I think also #1204, ref #1207","Url":"https://github.com/aspnet/Blazor/pull/1209","RelatedDescription":"Open PR \"fix @ChildContent in HtmlBlock codegen\" (#1209)"},{"Id":"345046058","IsPullRequest":false,"CreatedAt":"2018-07-27T00:12:49","Actor":"vertonghenb","Number":"1208","RawContent":null,"Title":"[Server Side] Add Support for cross Browser tab state per user","State":"closed","Body":"First of all the serversideblazor rocks, this is rather an enhancement.\r\n\r\nIn modern SPA's people tend to use the `localstorage `or cookies to store cross browser tab data for a user.

see if it worked. It didnt.\r\n\r\nLooking in the obj folder I see the Pages folder but the Alerts.g.i.cs and Alerts.g.cs are missing (as well as some others, but some are there). \r\n\r\nI removed everything from Alerts.cshtml so it now looks like so:\r\n\r\n```\r\n@page \"/alerts2\"\r\n\r\n<h1>Alerts</h1>\r\n```\r\n\r\nThe build output shows no error.\r\n\r\nHowever curiously, the error list does show:\r\n\r\n```\r\nError\tfatal-error\t(ESLint) ESLint encountered a parsing error.\tSample JavaScript Content Files\tC:\\Users\\cbraunstein\\source\\repos\\BlazorStrap\\src\\Sample\\Pages\\Alerts.cshtml\t1\tActive\r\n```\r\n\r\nWhich makes no sense since I don't have anything that file at the moment.\r\n\r\nNo sure how I can get a reproduction sample other than I can upload to my repo the current state of BlazorStrap","Url":"https://github.com/aspnet/Blazor/issues/1206","RelatedDescription":"Open issue \"Components (Pages) randomly not building in 0.5.0\" (#1206)"}],"ResultType":"GitHubIssue"}},"RunOn":"2018-07-31T05:30:03.1042849Z","RunDurationInMilliseconds":1203}
