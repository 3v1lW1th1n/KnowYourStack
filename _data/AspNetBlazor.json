Since we can use .NET Core on the server side now -which is proven to be performant and stable- we don't have to worry about the bugs, feature requests and release pace of the Mono team.

We do not have a product, we write system for clients ranging from WinForms systems that track 1,000,000 tyres leaving a warehouse each year, to websites that quote business insurance to insurance brokers, to system for managing large plastic bag manufacturers and giant moulding factories and many more things. \r\n\r\n**What all these projects have in common are: -**\r\n\r\n- \trelatively small user bases, between 25 to maybe 500 users in total per application, not all of which use the system at the same time\r\n- \tComplicated and often changeable data collection and validation requirements\r\n- \tinteraction with a SQL database, usually in azure. \r\n- \tuser identity and roles.\r\n- \tUser location within the UK so no more 500 miles from Cardiff or London data centres\r\n- \tA web based application of some sort, even if it is only a part of a larger collection of applications\r\n\r\nSo potential down sides mentioned by Steve, Latency, Server Workload etc. would not be a problem for us. \r\n\r\n**What we could gain**\r\n\r\n- Objects never leave server, so are kept up to date in one place and do not need to be passed around\r\n- Direct access to database \r\n- Direct access to active directory \r\n- \tBusiness logic, form validation etc all in one place, no need to part validate on the client and then revalidate on the server.\r\n- \tsingle upgrade point, no worrying about cached copies. \r\n- \tfull .net\r\n- \tload speed\r\n- \tchanges to business logic not needing to be sent to the client, or handled via an api.\r\n- \tNo sensitive data needed on the client\r\n- \tNo business logic on the client\r\n\r\nWhile I appreciate that for huge large scale global applications hosting the application on the server using your own compute is a negative, but for relatively small user base, enterprise applications this seems to me like having my cake and getting to eat it too. \r\n\r\nIf it was possible I would like to see all three options built out, however my thoughts on importance have changed. \r\n\r\nI started out seeing Blazor as a way I could replace angular or react etc. with a .net process which was really cool.\r\n\r\nBut the idea of having the option of running on the server or running like an installed application within electron allowing a multi-platform solution with access to local resources for the client compute option, these seem more compelling propositions than just removing the pain of having to code JavaScript (or even TypeScript) but still being limited by the browser manufacturers choices.\r\n\r\nI apologies if this turned into a bit of a ramble, but I just wanted to let you guys know just how excited this project has got me and for a programmer of 30+ years that is quite an achievement.\r\n\r\nThanks for all your hard work on this, just so you know I will be absolutely gutted if this does not get the go ahead in all 3 forms, **but can I have the server-side version first please.**\r\n","Url":"https://github.com/aspnet/Blazor/issues/1004","RelatedDescription":"Closed issue \"Blazor running c# on the server-side and in Electron - A Ramble \" (#1004)"},{"Id":"332554242","IsPullRequest":false,"CreatedAt":"2018-06-14T20:33:29","Actor":"vertonghenb","Number":"1005","RawContent":null,"Title":"[Interop] Pass Action<T> / Delegate in object","State":"open","Body":"I'm currently porting the Web Notifications API from JavaScript to Blazor see: [Blazor.Notifications](https://github.com/vertonghenb/Blazor.Notifications). \r\n\r\nTo do so I'm passing an object via interop and registering the `onClick` functions via the new features of the interop introduced in 0.4.0 to callback to C# functions.

Ex. where Template is [Tag]:\r\n\r\n```\r\n    <MyCustomComponent>  \r\n        <Template>  \r\n            ...\r\n        </Template>  \r\n    </MyCustomComponent>  \r\n```\r\n\r\nThis is subtly suggested in #404. A possible side-effect is that a property can be both [Parameter] and [Tag], allowing it to be used as a component attribute or child tag. Either way, the idea is that the contents, in-line or declarative, are assigned to the property.\r\n\r\nIn a declaration/usage, it should be an error to use the same [Parameter][Tag] property as both attribute and tag. Either one but not both, so that the ff. is an error:\r\n\r\n```\r\n    <MyCustomComponent MyParameterTag=...>  \r\n        <MyParameterTag>  \r\n            ...\r\n        </MyParameterTag>  \r\n    </MyCustomComponent>  \r\n```\r\n\r\nBecause MyParameterTag is used as both parameter and tag in this declaration, there is no way to know which content to keep.
