So if the user is on `/pages/foo`, only `Foo` should be highlighted. If the user is on `/pages/foo/bar`, only `Bar` should be highlighted. However, this page also has pagination that when selecting the 2nd page, navigates to `/pages/foo/bar?page=2`.\r\n\r\n### Context\r\nvue-router currently has the option to do an `exact` match of the path upon which the router will automatically add the class specified in the `linkExactActiveClass` option (which is `router-link-exact-active` by default).\r\n\r\nIn the above example, the exact match will match `/pages/foo/bar` but will not match `/pages/foo/bar?page=2` since it includes the query params in the comparison. However, if I don't use the `exact` match then both `Foo` and `Bar` will be both shown as `active`.\r\n\r\nMy solution has been to add a custom check to match only the path but would be nice for `vue-router` to have the option by default.\r\n\r\nThis request is for the ability to do an exact match but only on the path, not the whole URL, i.e. the `exactPath` match will ignore any query params in the URL. \r\n\r\n### What does the proposed API look like?\r\nThe current implementation of `exact` uses the `exact` directive to add the `router-link-exact-active` class.\r\n\r\nA proposed solution would be to add the `exact-path` directive which will in term add the `router-link-exact-path-active` class.\r\n\r\n<!-- generated by vue-issues.
