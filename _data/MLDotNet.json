About calling Fit more than once on Multiclass LightGBM trainer.","State":"open","Body":"Fixes #3878, by initializing the values of _`tlcNumClass` and `_numClass` everytime `Fit()` is called on a Multiclass LightGBM trainer. This is done under the assumption that trainers should behave as if they were stateless, and every call to `Fit()` should re-initialize those values.\r\n\r\nAs discussed offline with @yaeldekel , `_tlcNumClass` and `_numClass` hold the same value if there were no NaN labels on the dataset used for training. If there were NaN labels then `_tlcNumClass = _numClass - 1`. Mantaining both fields is necessary, because [here](https://github.com/dotnet/machinelearning/blob/aa5b3be14eeab1160dca2cc08561190141199f4f/src/Microsoft.ML.LightGbm/LightGbmMulticlassTrainer.cs#L219) NaN labels are replaced to be a new class, and then, [here](https://github.com/dotnet/machinelearning/blob/aa5b3be14eeab1160dca2cc08561190141199f4f/src/Microsoft.ML.LightGbm/LightGbmTrainerBase.cs#L620), when training the `WrappedLightGbmTraining` it is as if NaN labels were an extra class, but then [here](https://github.com/dotnet/machinelearning/blob/aa5b3be14eeab1160dca2cc08561190141199f4f/src/Microsoft.ML.LightGbm/LightGbmMulticlassTrainer.cs#L185), when creating the Predictors, only `_tlcNumClass` predictors are created. So, for example, if I have a dataset with 3 classes (0-2), but some rows have NaN values on their labels, then NaN values get converted to \"3\", `_numClass` is equal to \"4\" and `WrappedLightGbmTraining` trains as if there were truly 4 classes... but `_tlcNumClass` is equal to \"3\" and when creating the Predictors, only 3 predictors are created (one for each of the original classes ignoring the \"fake NaN class\").\r\n\r\nThe above wasn't documented in the code, but after doing some tests it seems that is how it is supposed to behave, and so I added some comments explaining this, as @yaeldekel  and I agree that the above isn't really clear directly from reading the code, and the names `_tlcNumClass` and `_numClass` are somewhat obscure.\r\n\r\nI also added a test.","Url":"https://github.com/dotnet/machinelearning/pull/4608","RelatedDescription":"Open PR \"Fixes #3878.
