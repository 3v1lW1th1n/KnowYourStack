Once I submit a valid response, I process the response and then I reset the FormGroup, but the required field is now red and asking for input.\r\n\r\nPS: There are a lot of related issues. In fact, there are so many, that I could not decide where to put this in. For Ex. #10999 was closed because of lack of use case, but I have given one here. Also in #15741,  it is additionally mentioned that this problem particularly comes to the fore in case of asynchronous operations, which in my case, is also coupled with a lot of '*ngIf' templates.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Describe the solution you'd like\r\n<!-- ✍️-->\r\nFormGroup could emit an event when it is resetting. and then the form group would subscribe to it inside ngOnInit(), and call resetForm() on itself every time the event is emitted.\r\n```\r\n**Add an event emitter which emits on every reset call**\r\nexport class FormGroup {\r\n   <rest of the implementation>\r\n\r\n    resetting: EventEmitter<any> = new EventEmitter();\r\n   ^^^might as well make it an @Output(), because that would be great\r\n\r\n    reset(value?: any, options?: {\r\n        onlySelf?: boolean;\r\n        emitEvent?: boolean;\r\n    }) {\r\n         this.resetting.emit();\r\n         <rest of the implementation of reset()>;\r\n    }\r\n}\r\n\r\n**Merge the directive below with the existing FormGroupDirective**\r\n@Directive({\r\n    selector: 'form[formGroup]'\r\n})\r\nexport class ProgrammaticResetDirective {\r\n    constructor(\r\n        private fgd: FormGroupDirective\r\n    ) {\r\n    }\r\n\r\n    private subscriptions: Subscription = new Subscription();\r\n\r\n    ngOnInit() {        \r\n        this.subscriptions.add(this.fgd.control.resetting.subscribe(() => {\r\n            this.fgd.resetForm();\r\n        }));\r\n    }\r\n\r\n    ngOnDestroy() {\r\n        this.subscriptions.unsubscribe();\r\n    }\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\n\r\n### Describe alternatives you've considered\r\n<!-- ✍️--> \r\nOne of the current workarounds is to take a ViewChild of the NgForm, like so\r\n```\r\n**In Template**\r\n<form [formGroup]=\"myFormGroup\" #myFGD=\"ngForm\">\r\n**In Component**\r\n@ViewChild('myFGD', {static: true}) myFormGroup_directive: NgForm;\r\n```\r\nand every time I reset the FormGroup, to call resetForm on the ViewChild. \r\nBut this is tedious in the sense that the programmer must introduce new variables both in the template and typescript, and remember to call resetForm on the directive along with reset on the FormGroup/\r\n","Url":"https://github.com/angular/angular/issues/30987","RelatedDescription":"Open issue \"Reset FormGroupDirective when FormGroup.reset() is called\" (#30987)"},{"Id":"454961433","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2019-06-12T00:39:36","Actor":"kyliau","Number":"30986","RawContent":null,"Title":"fix(language-service): Remove 'any' in getQuickInfoAtPosition","State":"open","Body":"## PR Checklist\r\nPlease check if your PR fulfills the following requirements:\r\n\r\n- [x] The commit message follows our guidelines: https://github.com/angular/angular/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md#commit\r\n- [ ] Tests for the changes have been added (for bug fixes / features)\r\n- [ ] Docs have been added / updated (for bug fixes / features)\r\n\r\n\r\n## PR Type\r\nWhat kind of change does this PR introduce?\r\n\r\n<!-- Please check the one that applies to this PR using \"x\". -->\r\n\r\n- [x] Bugfix\r\n- [ ] Feature\r\n- [ ] Code style update (formatting, local variables)\r\n- [ ] Refactoring (no functional changes, no api changes)\r\n- [ ] Build related changes\r\n- [ ] CI related changes\r\n- [ ] Documentation content changes\r\n- [ ] angular.io application / infrastructure changes\r\n- [ ] Other...

For my use, most commonly served images and webfonts are listed as `text/plain` in Chrome's dev tools Network tab instead of their correct types. Among other side effects is that when previewing the content in dev tools they're just shown as plain text gibberish of their actual binary contents.\r\n\r\nInterestingly enough, the resources seem to embed ok in the various pages of the site, e.g. images display as images and webfonts are used as webfonts instead of broken images or unloaded fonts. Don't know why the disparity between the two interfaces of the same browser.\r\n\r\n## 🔬 Minimal Reproduction\r\n\r\nCreate an Angular app, put an image that gets embedded and a webfont (woff or woff2 format should be fine here) to be used in an assets folder and reference them in a page or component. Then `ng serve` the app and view the results in the browser's dev tools.\r\n\r\n## 🌍 Your Environment\r\n<pre><code>\r\n\r\n     _                      _                 ____ _     ___\r\n    / \\   _ __   __ _ _   _| | __ _ _ __     / ___| |   |_ _|\r\n   / △ \\ | '_ \\ / _` | | | | |/ _` | '__|   | |   | |    | |\r\n  / ___ \\| | | | (_| | |_| | | (_| | |      | |___| |___ | |\r\n /_/   \\_\\_| |_|\\__, |\\__,_|_|\\__,_|_|       \\____|_____|___|\r\n                |___/\r\n\r\n\r\nAngular CLI: 7.3.8\r\nNode: 8.11.2\r\nOS: win32 x64\r\nAngular:\r\n...\r\n\r\nPackage                      Version\r\n------------------------------------------------------\r\n@angular-devkit/architect    0.13.8\r\n@angular-devkit/core         7.3.8\r\n@angular-devkit/schematics   7.3.8\r\n@schematics/angular          7.3.8\r\n@schematics/update           0.13.8\r\nrxjs                         6.3.3\r\ntypescript                   3.2.4\r\n</code></pre>\r\n\r\n**Anything else relevant?**\r\n<!-- ✍️Is this a browser specific issue?
