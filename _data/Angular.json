Currently, only the assets are downloaded and user still has to wait for data to be loaded while navigating throughout the application.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Proposal\r\nI think that solution can be as simple as exposing a parameter in `preloadingStrategy.preload` method, which is called in order to preload the route. This parameter could be set to false by default (which would make it a non-breaking change). Also, this would enable custom preloading strategies to be configured in a way that the different pages can determine if the resolvers should, or should not be ran.  In my opinion, it's desirable as some resolvers might depend on changes user does on current page. \r\n\r\n```typescript\r\nexport class CustomPreloadingStrategy implements PreloadingStrategy {\r\n  preload(route: Route, load: Function): Observable<any> {\r\n    // ...\r\n    return next(true);\r\n\r\n    // or more complex option\r\n    return next({ resolver1: true, resolver2: false });\r\n  }\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\n\r\n### Other alternatives I've considered\r\n- exposing an option while adding a resolver in Route config. It seems like it does not belong there as the user don't need to have any preloading strategy set, so the code will be unused. Also, resolvers don't really deal with preloading the routes, as it's the job of the preloading strategy.\r\n```typescript\r\nconst routes: Routes[] = [\r\n  {\r\n    path: 'route',\r\n    resolvers: {\r\n      resolver1: {\r\n        use: SomeResolver,\r\n        preload: true\r\n      }\r\n    }\r\n  }\r\n];\r\n```","Url":"https://github.com/angular/angular/issues/35313","RelatedDescription":"Open issue \"Add possibility to run resolvers when preloading routes\" (#35313)"},{"Id":"562805830","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2020-02-10T20:23:12","Actor":"jermowery","Number":"35311","RawContent":null,"Title":"fix(forms): Call setDisabledState in in reactive directives when appropriate","State":"open","Body":"When a CVA is added a form and that CVA implements setDisabledState the\r\nreactive form directives should call setDisabledState with true when the\r\nFormControl is disabled and false when it is enabled.

These work just fine when the application is loaded. However **sometimes**, if we reload the page on a deep route, then change the route to any \"parent\" route (by clicking on something) and then do a `router.navigate` of those mentioned above, sometimes, one of the commands passed to `navigate` gets \"duplicated\" on the target url.\r\n\r\nFor example, say I want:\r\n```typescript\r\n/// custromerId is a string\r\nthis.router.navigate([\"main\", \"customers\", customerId, \"profile\"]);\r\n```\r\n\r\nWhen this happens, I may end up with the router trying to navigate to: `/main/main/customers/<the-customer-id>/profile` (notice the duplicated `main`).\r\n\r\nOther times (not sure exactly when, or why, but seems to be consistent: meaning it's always the same \"command\" that gets duplicated), I could get: `/main/customers/customers/<the-customer-id>/profile`.\r\n\r\nI've enabled tracing on the router and it doesn't seem to be generating extra events: the `NavigateStart` event goes directly to that wrong URL with nothing in-between (it's not as if something was loading).\r\n\r\nNote that changing the `navigate` calls to `navigateByUrl` and constructing the whole URL itself works perfectly fine: it seems to be an issue with just `navigate`\r\n\r\nThis is the strangest part: this fails if I press F5 on say:\r\n- /main/something\r\n- Then navigate to:\r\n  - /main/otherthing _(works fine)_\r\n  - Then navigate to:\r\n    - /main/otherthing/something/something _(fails here with the strange duplication of one of the commands)_\r\n\r\nAfter that: it works just fine (reproducing the same steps without pressing F5, navigates correctly everywhere).\r\n\r\n**But only if I do it very quickly**... if I wait some time (say 5/10 seconds), it works correctly afterward. I've checked the timeline on the developer tools and everything seems loaded pretty quickly (even async and xhr requests), nothing seems changed on those 5/10 seconds that wouldn't happen on the first two seconds (when it fails).\r\n\r\nIt's also \"more or less\" consistent, however strangely random:\r\n- It happens almost always in Edge Chromium\r\n- Happens many times in Firefox\r\n- Happens many times in Chrome\r\n- Can't really get it to happen in Brave\r\n\r\nWe have been really scratching our heads with this, and trying to make a small reproduceable example but couldn't really get into it. The project is a bit large and a bit complicated to reproduce on a small scale, however, it used to work fine on 8.x and we didn't seem to find the problem on the 9-rc's (however nobody was looking for the problem, which was noticed a few days ago only, so it might reproduce on the rc's... or even on 8.x and nobody did notice during development).\r\n\r\nThe biggest change of course has been going to IVY and importing the routes lazily... but again, everything seems to work all the time except on the specific case (pressing F5 on an inner route, going back then navigating). The same code, same router traces, same everything.\r\n\r\nHas anyone suffered anything remotely related to this?\r\n\r\n## 🌍  Your Environment\r\n\r\n**Angular Version:**\r\n<pre><code>\r\nAngular CLI: 9.0.1\r\nNode: 12.14.1\r\nOS: win32 x64\r\n\r\nAngular: 9.0.0\r\n... animations, cdk, common, compiler, compiler-cli, core, forms\r\n... language-service, platform-browser, platform-browser-dynamic\r\n... router\r\nIvy Workspace: Yes\r\n\r\nPackage                           Version\r\n-----------------------------------------------------------\r\n@angular-devkit/architect         0.900.1\r\n@angular-devkit/build-angular     0.900.1\r\n@angular-devkit/build-optimizer   0.900.1\r\n@angular-devkit/build-webpack     0.900.1\r\n@angular-devkit/core              9.0.1\r\n@angular-devkit/schematics        9.0.1\r\n@angular/cli                      9.0.1\r\n@ngtools/webpack                  9.0.1\r\n@schematics/angular               9.0.1\r\n@schematics/update                0.900.1\r\nrxjs                              6.5.4\r\ntypescript                        3.6.4\r\nwebpack                           4.41.2\r\n</code></pre>","Url":"https://github.com/angular/angular/issues/35302","RelatedDescription":"Open issue \"Strange issue with router.navigate after upgrading to Angular 9\" (#35302)"},{"Id":"562697546","IsPullRequest":false,"CreatedAt":"2020-02-10T17:00:22","Actor":"DenysVuika","Number":"35301","RawContent":null,"Title":"Angular 9: unable to create dynamic module at runtime","State":"open","Body":"<!--🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅\r\n\r\nOh hi there!

This is a strongly opinionated choice which favors safety. It might break code which expected the previous typing.\r\n\r\nIt's also perfectly valid to keep the previous default of `EventEmitter<any>`.\r\n\r\nI find that using `<void>` is the safest alternative. It's more straightforward: `emit()` takes as argument exactly the type you specified in the template brackets, including no argument if you specified nothing. `<any>` is dangerous because the template argument may have been omitted by mistake and the user is unaware that the EventEmitter's data is not type checked.\r\n\r\nThe previous design was loose by default and let you opt-in strictness: defaults to `any`, allows more specific type to be provided. (noob friendly, but gets in the way of advanced users)\r\nThe new design is strict by default and lets you opt-out of strictness: defaults to `void`, but allows `any` to be specified. (ninja-friendly, but gets in the way of noobs).\r\n\r\nWhat to chose depends on who is the primary audience of angular. Either way it's a breaking change.\r\n\r\n## Does this PR introduce a breaking change?\r\n\r\n- [x] Yes\r\n- [ ] No\r\n\r\nIt's no longer possible to have an event emitter type which sometimes accepts arguments and sometimes not.

Minimal Reproduction\r\n\r\nA minimal reproduction repo is available here: https://github.com/FrancescoBorzi/angular-9-issue-reproduction\r\n\r\nI have 4 classes:\r\n\r\n```\r\nexport abstract class AbstractAComponent {\r\n  @Input() myInput: string;\r\n}\r\n```\r\n```\r\nexport abstract class AbstractBComponent extends AbstractAComponent {}\r\n```\r\n\r\n```\r\n@Component({\r\n  selector: 'app-one',\r\n  templateUrl: './one.component.html',\r\n  styleUrls: ['./one.component.scss']\r\n})\r\nexport class OneComponent extends AbstractAComponent {}\r\n```\r\n\r\n```\r\n@Component({\r\n  selector: 'app-two',\r\n  templateUrl: './two.component.html',\r\n  styleUrls: ['./two.component.scss']\r\n})\r\nexport class TwoComponent extends AbstractBComponent {}\r\n```\r\n\r\nThis is how I use them:\r\n\r\n```\r\n<app-one [myInput]=\"'value 1'\"></app-one>\r\n<app-two [myInput]=\"'value 2'\"></app-two>\r\n```\r\n\r\nIn a nutshell:\r\n- `@Input() myInput` is defined in `AbstractAComponent`\r\n- `OneComponent` directly extends `AbstractAComponent`\r\n- `TwoComponent` extends `AbstractBComponent` which extends  `AbstractAComponent`\r\n\r\nExpected behaviour:\r\n- both `OneComponent` and `TwoComponent` should have `@Input() myInput`\r\n\r\nCurrent behaviour:\r\n- looks like `TwoComponent` doesn't correctly inherit  `@Input() myInput`\r\n\r\n## 🔥 Exception or

I was getting errors about not being able to find my ambient types that were in that files. I noticed the tsconfig.app.json was updated to only compile the main.ts and the polyfills. Once I added the typings.d.ts explictly, it worked.\r\n\r\nYes, it's likely not a common scenario. But It might be good to include this scenario in the `ng update` process to v9. \r\n\r\nIt would be nice if the ng update process noticed if there was a typings file and added it to the config.\r\n\r\n### Command (mark with an `x`)\r\n<!-- Can you pin-point the command or commands that are relevant for this feature request? -->\r\n<!-- ✍️edit: -->\r\n- [ ] new\r\n- [ ] build\r\n- [ ] serve\r\n- [ ] test\r\n- [ ] e2e\r\n- [ ] generate\r\n- [ ] add\r\n- [x] update\r\n- [ ] lint\r\n- [ ] xi18n\r\n- [ ] run\r\n- [ ] config\r\n- [ ] help\r\n- [ ] version\r\n- [ ] doc\r\n","Url":"https://github.com/angular/angular-cli/issues/16923","RelatedDescription":"Open issue \"ng update should detect typings files and added it to the appropriate tsconfig file\" (#16923)"},{"Id":"562791010","IsPullRequest":false,"CreatedAt":"2020-02-10T19:56:16","Actor":"cyrilletuzi","Number":"16922","RawContent":null,"Title":"PWA failing with v9 i18n because of absolute paths in manifest.webmanifest","State":"open","Body":"# 🐞 Bug report\r\n\r\n### Command\r\n\r\n- [x] build\r\n- [x] xi18n\r\n\r\n### Is this a regression?\r\n\r\nNo, the issue seems to be there from a long time.\r\n\r\n### Description\r\n\r\nCurrently, the `manifest.webmanifest` generated with `ng add @angular/pwa` references absolute paths for `scope` and `start_url`.\r\n\r\nIt will work fine if the app is deployed in the root directory (ie. with `<base href=\"/\">`).\r\n\r\nBut it will fails if the app is deployed in a subdirectory (ie. with `<base href=\"/en/\">`), as absolute paths won't take base href into account.\r\n\r\nSuch base hrefs are the default scenario when using the new v9 `--localize` option (CLI will set a different base href for each locale), meaning PWA and v9 i18n don't work out of the box.\r\n\r\nAs paths in `manifest.webmanifest` are part of the `dist` build, ie. from the files impacted by base href, these paths should be relative and not absolute.\r\n\r\n\r\n## 🔬 Minimal Reproduction\r\n\r\n- create an app with v9, with translations\r\n- ng add @angular/pwa\r\n- ng build --prod --localize\r\n- deploy the app\r\n- do a Lighthouse audit in Chrome: PWA checks will fail, saying service worker can't be registered as it's out of scope\r\n\r\n## 🔥 Exception or Error\r\n\r\nThe service worker won't cache the app files.\r\n\r\n## 🌍 Your Environment\r\n<pre><code>\r\nAngular CLI: 9.0.1\r\nNode: 12.14.1\r\nOS: darwin x64\r\n\r\nAngular: 9.0.0\r\n... animations, cdk, common, compiler, compiler-cli, core, forms\r\n... language-service, localize, material, platform-browser\r\n... platform-browser-dynamic, router, service-worker\r\nIvy Workspace: Yes\r\n\r\nPackage                            Version\r\n------------------------------------------------------------\r\n@angular-devkit/architect          0.900.1\r\n@angular-devkit/build-angular      0.900.1\r\n@angular-devkit/build-ng-packagr   0.900.1\r\n@angular-devkit/build-optimizer    0.900.1\r\n@angular-devkit/build-webpack      0.900.1\r\n@angular-devkit/core               9.0.1\r\n@angular-devkit/schematics         9.0.1\r\n@angular/cli                       9.0.1\r\n@ngtools/webpack                   9.0.1\r\n@schematics/angular                9.0.1\r\n@schematics/update                 0.900.1\r\nng-packagr                         9.0.0\r\nrxjs                               6.5.4\r\ntypescript                         3.7.5\r\nwebpack                            4.41.2\r\n</code></pre>\r\n\r\n**Anything else relevant?**\r\n2 fixes possible for `scope` and `start_url`:\r\n- easy: use a relative path `./`\r\n- safer but more complicated: add base href\r\n\r\nSimilar to #16390 ","Url":"https://github.com/angular/angular-cli/issues/16922","RelatedDescription":"Open issue \"PWA failing with v9 i18n because of absolute paths in manifest.webmanifest\" (#16922)"},{"Id":"562636956","IsPullRequest":false,"CreatedAt":"2020-02-10T15:27:49","Actor":"kmaraz","Number":"16919","RawContent":null,"Title":"Live reloading doen't work properly with AngularCompilerPlugin since version 9","State":"open","Body":"# 🐞 Bug report\r\n\r\n### Command (mark with an `x`)\r\nI use custom webpack configuration (I have migrated from AngularJs a two months ago).\r\n\r\n### Is this a regression?\r\nYes, the previous version in which this bug was not present was: 8.3.25\r\n\r\n### Description\r\nLive reloading does not work in nested files.

Create a new project with the latest Angular v8 & Angular CLI v8 release.\r\n2. Add the file replacement config & files like above.\r\n3. Run `ng build --prod`. File replacement works now.\r\n4. Update to Angular & Angular CLI 9 (run `ng update @angular/core @angular/cli`)\r\n5. Run `ng build --prod` again.

Here's my use case and \"investigation\".\r\n\r\nI'm using Sentry for crash-tracking and for production builds I generate source maps and upload them directly to sentry. After switching to v9, all the resolved stack traces were wrong (ie. resolved methods are something else then they should be) - it's all garbage. After going back-and-forth, I've discovered that everything works fine if I disable `optimization` flag.\r\n\r\nSo I've created a simple project (`ng new`), add a small piece of code (button + onclick handler) and generated a production build with `optimization` enabled (`ng build --prod --source-map`). I've then decoded the map file using `@bengourley/source-map-decoder` and compared mapping with the actual minified js file.

However, the Angular Protractor Builder currently does not recognize the `grep` or `invertGrep` options, so in order to take advantage of this useful feature, developers had to find a way around the builder.\r\n\r\n# Solution\r\n I added these two options to the Protractor Builder JSON schema, as well as made sure they got passed to the Protractor runner correctly. I also needed to add these options to the top-level Angular CLI schema to satisfy `angular.json`.\r\n\r\n# Notes\r\n1. Because the Protractor config expects these options nested under a `jasmineNodeOpts` object, I had to use an additional interface to the one that is generated by `schema.json`.

I based my code on the following example:\r\n```\r\n<div class=\"example-container\">\r\n  <mat-form-field appearance=\"fill\">\r\n    <mat-label>Enter your email</mat-label>\r\n    <input matInput placeholder=\"pat@example.com\" [formControl]=\"email\" required>\r\n    <mat-error *ngIf=\"email.invalid\">{{getErrorMessage()}}</mat-error>\r\n  </mat-form-field>\r\n</div>\r\n```\r\nAs many, I thought at first that it was possible to use `<mat-error>` for its aesthetics only and that using a `FormControl` was optional. But apparently, `<mat-error>` shows up only if there is a `FormControl` used at some point, and if that `FormControl` is in an error state. The docs also state that:\r\n\r\n> If a form field can have more than one error state, it is up to the consumer to toggle which messages should be displayed. This can be done with CSS, `ngIf` or `ngSwitch`.\r\n\r\nWhich means, if I got that right, that `*ngIf` is more of an **additional** condition deciding if `<mat-error>` is displayed and has no effect if the `FormControl` isn't already in an error state. According to my tests, this seems to be the case. If I am right, I think this line is incredibly misleading:\r\n```\r\n<mat-error *ngIf=\"email.invalid\">{{getErrorMessage()}}</mat-error>\r\n```\r\nBecause that `*ngIf=\"email.invalid\"` does not dictate if the `<mat-error>` element is displayed (something anyone sane thinks it does at first sight), nor does it have any interesting effect in this example since `email.invalid` seems to always be true if the `<mat-error>` element is displayed. During my tests, having `*ngIf=\"email.invalid\"` or not did not make any difference.\r\n\r\nConsequently, I suggest:\r\n\r\n- that `*ngIf=\"email.invalid\"` is removed from the aforementioned example,\r\n- that `<mat-error>`'s dependency on using a `FormControl` is explicitly mentioned in the docs\r\n- and that, maybe, another example showing how the `*ngIf` is used to handle several error messages **in the template** (instead of using `getErrorMessage()` in the component's TS file) is added.\r\n\r\n**Affected documentation page:** https://material.angular.io/components/form-field/overview#error-messages\r\n","Url":"https://github.com/angular/components/issues/18430","RelatedDescription":"Open issue \"Misleading *ngIf attribute in <mat-error> example?\" (#18430)"}],"ResultType":"GitHubIssue"}},"RunOn":"2020-02-11T05:30:05.510715Z","RunDurationInMilliseconds":3238}
