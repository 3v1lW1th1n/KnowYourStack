Per @jgthms suggestion in https://github.com/jgthms/bulma/pull/2416 these enhancements have been placed behind a flag which is false by default, so there should be no change for existing users.\r\n\r\n<!-- Bugfix? Reference that issue as well. -->\r\n\r\n### Proposed solution\r\n\r\n<!-- Which specific problem does this PR solve and how?  -->\r\nSee description.\r\n<!-- If it fixes a particular Issue, add \"Fixes #ISSUE_NUMBER\" in your title -->\r\n\r\n### Tradeoffs\r\n\r\n<!-- What are the drawbacks of this solution? Are there alternative ones? -->\r\n<!-- Think of performance, build time, usability, complexity, couplingâ€¦) -->\r\nThe main tradeoff is whether these styles should be applied by default, as some users do not want to have to override these styles once in place. I believe that placing this enhancement behind a flag eliminates this issue.\r\n\r\n### Testing Done\r\n\r\nDid a test builds with the flag off and on. Verified that no additional css is rendered when the flag is off, and the expected css is rendered when it is on.\r\n\r\n<!-- BEFORE SUBMITTING YOUR PR, MAKE SURE TO FOLLOW THESE STEPS: -->\r\n<!-- 1.

Add HTML snippet for all the hero under navbars called `navbar_hero_filler_html` \r\n    - **Along with that** I noticed a lot of reuse of the same navbar items so I moved those into another \r\nHTML snippet called `navbar_items_html`\r\n5.
