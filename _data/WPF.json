You can learn more about the full scope of the release from the .NET blog linked [here](https://devblogs.microsoft.com/dotnet/announcing-net-core-3-0//).  \r\n\r\nThe WPF team has been working over the last year to port the WPF codebase from .NET Framework to .NET Core with a focus on ensuring that .NET Framework compatibility and ease of porting were maintained.   Working on GitHub was a new experience to many of us but the community has been great and we really want to thank all of you that have been actively engaged in making this a reality.  Whether it's been building and porting WPF apps via the multiple Previews shipped to those that have been submitting issues and actively commenting.  We wanted to give a special recognition to some of our most active contributors: @weltkante, @onovotny, @lindexi, @dotMorten, @AndreyAkinshin, @thomasclaudiushuber, @Youssef1313, @walterv, @AlexChuev, @WilliamAntonRohm-  THANKS for all your help in helping us ship this product!\r\n\r\nWith that said, here is a recap of the work done to date to ship WPF on .NET Core 3:\r\n\r\n* Building for .NET Core required large infrastructure changes to being able to build and ship WPF.  As we shared back in [April](https://github.com/dotnet/wpf/issues/607), we spent the first three months of the year on-boarding to the Arcade based build infrastructure which then allowed us to work across our internal and external repos. \r\n* Porting the WPF code from .NET Framework required us to overcome various environmental and technical differences that are unique to .NET Core 3.  The team had to port and modify key test cases to ensure app compatibility with .NET Framework. Additionally, the team identified various changes to different elements of the broader .NET Code base, like modifying System.IO.Packaging to ensure that WPF ran smoothly and providing feedback & PRs to the CoreFX codebase. \r\n* Open Sourcing all managed binaries, as stated in our [May](https://github.com/dotnet/wpf/issues/738) and [August](https://github.com/dotnet/wpf/issues/1731) updates, the team open sourced most of the WPF code base, we are still not done but we've open sourced the vast majority of the code base for this 3.0 release. \r\n* In addition to porting, we also incorporated a few features, like building and open sourcing the XAML Compiler in PresentationBuildTasks and enabling App.Local functionality.\r\n\r\nNow that .NET Core 3.0 is available our focus shifts to **.NET Core 3.1** with an emphasis on ensuring that 3.1 is as stable as possible given that it is an [LTS](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/platform/support/policy/dotnet-core) release.  We are also working on open sourcing the remaining Native binaries in our roadmap and doing planning for .NET 5.   \r\n\r\nThanks again for your engagement, we look forward to seeing all the great WPF applications that will be built on .NET Core.  \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n","Url":"https://github.com/dotnet/wpf/issues/1936","RelatedDescription":"Open issue \"Announcing WPF on .NET Core 3.0\" (#1936)"},{"Id":"496795024","IsPullRequest":false,"CreatedAt":"2019-09-22T15:31:59","Actor":"MrLongBz","Number":"1935","RawContent":null,"Title":"help me！！Why is it wrong instead of warning?","State":"open","Body":"* .NET Core Version: (e.g. 3.0 Preview1, or daily build number, use `dotnet --info`)\r\n* Windows version: (`winver`)\r\n* Does the bug reproduce also in WPF for .NET Framework 4.8?: Yes/No\r\n* Is this bug related specifically to tooling in Visual Studio (e.g. XAML Designer, Code editing, etc...)?
