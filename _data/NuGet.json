And then when setting up the IIS server, I have to use the same shared folder \\\\\\\\some-server-NUGET02\\nugetlibrary in Physical path:. If I use the local folder (to which the shared folder is pointing to i.e. D:\\Websites\\nugetlibrary), the site does not start. Looks like the publish path has to match the Physical path: in IIS Basic Settings. Is this true and how can I configure Physical path: to be D:\\Websites\\nugetlibrary? Note: this is not causing any issues - I prefer to use D:\\Websites\\nugetlibrary as opposed to \\\\\\\\some-server-NUGET02\\nugetlibrary. \r\n\r\nOne more thing. After I upload packages, the packages count in the main front page is not reflected and also the packages don't appear in the Packages tab or search. I ran Lucene index but that does not help. However, after restarting the server, the count is fine. I see the same issue when running NuGet Gallery locally on my machine.

Create Framework console project (old-style csproj) in VS with new git repo, build.\r\n1. `nbgv install`. This dotnet global tool for GitVersioning drops a Directory.Build.props file and a version.json file in the solution dir. The props file has a `PackageReference` to the nbgv NuGet package, which is responsible for inserting version info into the exe at build time.\r\n1. Delete the version attributes from AssemblyInfo.cs, and commit changes.\r\n1. Build solution in VS -- no version info embedded\r\n1. Rebuild solution in VS -- no version info\r\n1. Close and reopen solution\r\n1. Build solution in VS -- no version info\r\n1. Rebuild solution in VS -- version info!\r\n\r\nIt appears that VS takes stock of the build situation when a solution is first opened and then caches that information, so that in 4 and 5 above it's not aware of the props file that was added in 2 and doesn't fetch the nbgv NuGet package. After a close and reopen, VS is aware of the file, but the build in 7 doesn't do anything because the obj dir is up to date, so VS doesn't think anything is needed. But a rebuild at that point (or by deleting obj and building) gets VS to download the NuGet package referenced in the props file.\r\n\r\nI've packaged up a little sample in two files so that you don't have to have nbgv installed yourself. \r\n\r\n1. Unzip the ConsoleApp1.zip file, open it in VS, and build.\r\n1. Unzip the nbgv.zip file and drop those two files into your solution dir. \r\n1.
