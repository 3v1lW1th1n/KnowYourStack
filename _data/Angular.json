Why there are many apps? We're discussing one app I thought? Or is it the other apps that use the shared lazy-loaded files that will get broken? There has gotta be more than one sentence here instead of a single one above... Probably not too much to not over-burden the general discussion, but something that will provide an example of a dangerous situation\r\nThanks!\r\n\r\n## üî¨ Minimal Reproduction\r\n\r\n### What's the affected URL?**\r\nhttps://angular.io/guide/service-worker-communications\r\n\r\n### Reproduction Steps**\r\n<!-- If applicable please list the steps to take to reproduce the issue -->\r\n<!-- ‚úçÔ∏èedit:-->\r\n\r\n### Expected vs Actual Behavior**\r\n<!-- If applicable please describe the difference between the expected and actual behavior after following the repro steps. -->\r\n<!-- ‚úçÔ∏èedit:-->\r\n\r\n\r\n## üì∑Screenshot\r\n<!-- Often a screenshot can help to capture the issue better than a long description. -->\r\n<!-- ‚úçÔ∏èupload a screenshot:-->\r\n\r\n\r\n## üî• Exception or Error\r\n<pre><code>\r\n<!-- If the issue is accompanied by an exception or an error, please share it below: -->\r\n<!-- ‚úçÔ∏è-->\r\n\r\n</code></pre>\r\n\r\n\r\n## üåç  Your Environment\r\n\r\n### Browser info\r\n<!-- ‚úçÔ∏èIs this a browser specific issue?

I just stumbled upon it.\r\n\r\n### Description\r\nThe app shows two side by side instances of router-outlet. One is primary, the other one is secondary. The two links (show and hide) navigate to the secondary outlet only. \"Show\" navigates to OtherComponent while \"hide\" navigates to 'null' effectively clearing the router-outlet. Both use [routerLink] to achieve this result. This is working fine.\r\n\r\nWhen a link from within OtherComponent is activated (which also features a [routerLink] navigating the secondary outlet to 'null') clicking the link does not work. Furthermore, as router tracing is enabled upon clicking the link in OtherComponent, no routing information is shown and no errors are displayed either. As if the [routerLink] attribute never existed.\r\n\r\nBut to make sure OtherComponent is still working, it is also included in HelloComponent's template. Clicking on a link from OtherComponent instantiated by HelloComponent **works** as expected.\r\n\r\nConclusion: clearing a secondary outlet from a component currently active in a secondary outlet does not work. I do not see a reason why this would not work. If this is a bad thing to do, one would at least expect A) a router error in the console or B) any other error either of which would let me know that I am doing something wrong.\r\n\r\n## üî¨ Minimal Reproduction\r\nhttps://stackblitz.com/edit/angular-spzbc3\r\n\r\n## üî• Exception or Error\r\nNo related errors.\r\n\r\n## üåç  Your Environment\r\n\r\n**Angular Version:**\r\n<pre><code>\r\nAngular CLI: 9.1.2\r\nNode: 12.16.2\r\nOS: win32 x64\r\n\r\nAngular: 9.1.2\r\n... animations, cli, common, compiler, compiler-cli, core, forms\r\n... language-service, localize, platform-browser\r\n... platform-browser-dynamic, platform-server, router\r\nIvy Workspace: Yes\r\n\r\nPackage                           Version\r\n-----------------------------------------------------------\r\n@angular-devkit/architect         0.901.2\r\n@angular-devkit/build-angular     0.901.2\r\n@angular-devkit/build-optimizer   0.901.2\r\n@angular-devkit/build-webpack     0.901.2\r\n@angular-devkit/core              9.1.2\r\n@angular-devkit/schematics        9.1.2\r\n@angular/cdk                      9.2.1\r\n@ngtools/webpack                  9.1.2\r\n@schematics/angular               9.1.2\r\n@schematics/update                0.901.2\r\nrxjs                              6.5.5\r\ntypescript                        3.8.3\r\nwebpack                           4.42.0\r\n</code></pre>\r\n\r\n","Url":"https://github.com/angular/angular/issues/36766","RelatedDescription":"Open issue \"Navigating to named router-outlet with 'null' does not work from within named router-outlet\" (#36766)"},{"Id":"604870973","IsPullRequest":false,"CreatedAt":"2020-04-22T15:57:46","Actor":"LilTwo","Number":"36765","RawContent":null,"Title":"provide valueChangesWithSource event in AbstractControl to distinguish the event from different sources","State":"open","Body":"# üöÄ feature request\r\n\r\n### Relevant Package\r\n@angular/forms\r\n\r\n\r\n### Description\r\nIn` valueChanges` we have no way to know who trigger the event, by view or by `setValue` `patchValue`, but sometimes we want to handle the event differently depends on the source.\r\n\r\n### Describe the solution you'd like\r\nprovide an observable `valueChangesWithSource` whose type is `Observable<{value: any, source: 'model'|'view'>`. when the value is changed by setValue/patchValue, `source = model`, otherwise `source=view`\r\n\r\n\r\n### Describe alternatives you've considered\r\nIt turns out that FormControl has an attribute: `_pendingChange`, this flag will only be true when updating from view to model.\r\nYou can read this flag from the control to know if this event is trigger by user, note that this flag is undefined until the first view to model update.\r\n\r\nexample: https://stackblitz.com/edit/angular-8-reactive-form-chmfdr?file=src/app/app.component.ts\r\n","Url":"https://github.com/angular/angular/issues/36765","RelatedDescription":"Open issue \"provide valueChangesWithSource event in AbstractControl to distinguish the event from different sources\" (#36765)"},{"Id":"604848790","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2020-04-22T15:27:36","Actor":"Platonn","Number":"36764","RawContent":null,"Title":"docs(routing): fix typo 'containa' to 'contains'","State":"open","Body":"closes #36763\r\n\r\n## PR Checklist\r\nPlease check if your PR fulfills the following requirements:\r\n\r\n- [x] The commit message follows our guidelines: https://github.com/angular/angular/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md#commit\r\n- [x] Tests for the changes have been added (for bug fixes / features)\r\n- [x] Docs have been added / updated (for bug fixes / features)\r\n\r\n\r\n## PR Type\r\nWhat kind of change does this PR introduce?\r\n\r\n<!-- Please check the one that applies to this PR using \"x\". -->\r\n\r\n- [ ] Bugfix\r\n- [ ] Feature\r\n- [ ] Code style update (formatting, local variables)\r\n- [ ] Refactoring (no functional changes, no api changes)\r\n- [ ] Build related changes\r\n- [ ] CI related changes\r\n- [x] Documentation content changes\r\n- [ ] angular.io application / infrastructure changes\r\n- [ ] Other...

But if `optimization: true`, `ngDoCheck` is _not_ consistently called after the `ngClass` input changes, causing the `ngClass` instance to not apply the provided config to the element.\r\n\r\nThe usage of `[ngClass]` in my case is sloppy as the attribute expression (IE: `[ngClass]=buttonStyle`) is a _getter_ that returns a _new object_ on each invocation. After updating the component implementation such that the value `buttonStyle` only changes when necessary (and is no longer a getter), the problem I'm dealing with goes away entirely. Despite this, I'm looking to understand why the original getter pattern wasn't broken in ViewEngine/ng8, but it now breaks in Ivy/ng9. I can't find information in any Ivy/ng9 upgrade guide or notes that points out why the previous `getter` approach is suddenly being handled differently. I'm concerned about other potential breaks that can occur as a result of upgrading.\r\n\r\nUltimately I'm looking to understand why `[ngClass]` `ngDoCheck` is called consistently when `ngDevMode: true`, but is _not_ consistently called when `ngDevMode: false` when using Ivy. I'm used to angular throwing exceptions in dev mode if a feature is misused, but considering no warnings or exceptions occur in dev mode in this case, I'd expect this to work consistently between dev and prod configurations.\r\n\r\n\r\n## üî¨ Minimal Reproduction\r\n<!--\r\nPlease create and share minimal reproduction of the issue starting with this template: https://stackblitz.com/fork/angular-issue-repro2\r\n-->\r\n<!-- ‚úçÔ∏è-->\r\n\r\n(I do not yet know how to have the dev server run in prod mode on stackblitz, so in order to use this repro, you'll need to set `ngDevMode = false` manually in the console, and click \"Start editing\" to trigger the click handler and force cd.

We still set the ngDevMode = false for it\r\n> // to remove dev code, and ngI18nClosureMode to remove Closure compiler i18n code\r\n\r\nThe reason being that, when `buildOptions.platform == 'server'` is `true`, the following object is passed to the `TerserPlugin` `compress` option:\r\n\r\n```\r\n{\r\n  ecma: terserEcma,\r\n  global_defs: angularGlobalDefinitions,\r\n  keep_fnames: true,\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nHowever, according to the TerserPlugin's [docs](https://github.com/terser/terser#compress-options), most `compress` flags default to `true`, so this effectively causes the server code to be minified.\r\n\r\nIn addition, unsetting the `scripts` optimizations in `angular.json` causes other side effects, namely `ngDevMode` no longer being explicitly set to `false`, causing the server code to run in dev mode by default.\r\n\r\n```\r\n\"optimization\": {\r\n  \"scripts\": false,\r\n  \"styles\": true\r\n},\r\n```\r\n\r\nOne workaround is to set the `NG_BUILD_DEBUG_OPTIMIZE` flag, which does turn off `compress`, but my concern is that it would get removed & renamed at some point since it's undocumented.\r\n\r\nI think `compress`  should be set to `false` for server builds, as per the code comment currently reads, as working with minified code on the server is a pain. It would cause server-side bundles to jump in size, e.g. for my (fairly large) app is goes from 20 MB (with `optimization: true`) to 32 MB (with `optimization: true` but `compress: false`), but is definitely worth it IMO.\r\n\r\nI can look into drafting a PR if you guys agree with that.\r\n\r\n## üî¨ Minimal Reproduction\r\n\r\n<pre><code>\r\n$ npm install -g @angular/cli@latest\r\n$ ng new ssr-minify-test\r\n$ cd ssr-minify-test/\r\n$ ng add @nguniversal/express-engine\r\n$ npm run build:ssr\r\n</code></pre>\r\n\r\nManually inspect `dist/ssr-minify-test/server/main.js` -> code is minified / unreadable\r\n\r\n## üåç Your Environment\r\n<pre><code>\r\n\r\n     _                      _                 ____ _     ___\r\n    / \\   _ __   __ _ _   _| | __ _ _ __     / ___| |   |_ _|\r\n   / ‚ñ≥ \\ | '_ \\ / _` | | | | |/ _` | '__|   | |   | |    | |\r\n  / ___ \\| | | | (_| | |_| | | (_| | |      | |___| |___ | |\r\n /_/   \\_\\_| |_|\\__, |\\__,_|_|\\__,_|_|       \\____|_____|___|\r\n                |___/\r\n\r\n\r\nAngular CLI: 9.1.1\r\nNode: 12.4.0\r\nOS: darwin x64\r\n\r\nAngular:\r\n...\r\nIvy Workspace:\r\n\r\nPackage                      Version\r\n------------------------------------------------------\r\n@angular-devkit/architect    0.901.1\r\n@angular-devkit/core         9.1.1\r\n@angular-devkit/schematics   9.1.1\r\n@schematics/angular          9.1.1\r\n@schematics/update           0.901.1\r\nrxjs                         6.5.4\r\n</code></pre>","Url":"https://github.com/angular/angular-cli/issues/17517","RelatedDescription":"Open issue \"Server bundles are minified by default\" (#17517)"},{"Id":"603904252","IsPullRequest":false,"CreatedAt":"2020-04-21T11:12:16","Actor":"ybarbaria","Number":"17516","RawContent":null,"Title":"Angular ng build prod convert all percent opacity to 1%  ","State":"closed","Body":"# üêû bug report\r\n\r\n### Affected Package\r\nThe issue is caused by the cssnano package \r\nrelated to https://github.com/cssnano/cssnano/pull/881\r\n\r\n\r\n### Is this a regression?\r\nI don't know I never used percent for opacity since today.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Description\r\nI have some class where I defined some opacity by percent like this one : \r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/5574663/79817846-70650800-83da-11ea-90ce-3d12c70b2748.png)\r\nAfter using the `ng build --prod` my style become : \r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/5574663/79817881-8f639a00-83da-11ea-865b-b9d88db1802b.png)\r\n\r\n## üåç  Your Environment\r\n\r\n**Angular Version:**\r\n<pre><code>\r\nAngular CLI: 9.1.1\r\nNode: 12.14.1\r\nOS: win32 x64\r\n\r\nAngular: 9.1.2\r\n... animations, common, compiler, compiler-cli, core, forms\r\n... language-service, platform-browser, platform-browser-dynamic\r\n... router, service-worker\r\nIvy Workspace: Yes\r\n\r\nPackage                           Version\r\n-----------------------------------------------------------\r\n@angular-devkit/architect         0.901.1\r\n@angular-devkit/build-angular     0.901.1\r\n@angular-devkit/build-optimizer   0.901.1\r\n@angular-devkit/build-webpack     0.901.1\r\n@angular-devkit/core              9.1.1\r\n@angular-devkit/schematics        9.1.1\r\n@angular/cdk                      9.1.0\r\n@angular/cli                      9.1.1\r\n@angular/flex-layout              9.0.0-beta.29\r\n@angular/material                 9.1.0\r\n@ngtools/webpack                  9.1.1\r\n@schematics/angular               9.1.1\r\n@schematics/update                0.901.1\r\nrxjs                              6.5.4\r\ntypescript                        3.7.5\r\nwebpack                           4.42.0\r\n</code></pre>\r\n\r\n\r\n","Url":"https://github.com/angular/angular-cli/issues/17516","RelatedDescription":"Closed issue \"Angular ng build prod convert all percent opacity to 1%  \" (#17516)"},{"Id":"603454811","IsPullRequest":false,"CreatedAt":"2020-04-21T07:35:13","Actor":"indraraj26","Number":"17513","RawContent":null,"Title":"ng new should pickup my structure","State":"closed","Body":"Hi Team,\r\n\r\nIs there any way to modify ng new to pick up my structure so that when other developer will start any project they will have same core structure.\r\n\r\nI have feature module with some sort of basic component in it like @core, @auth @shared that should generate automatically.
