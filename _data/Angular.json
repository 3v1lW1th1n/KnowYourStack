This commit removes `TestBed.deprecatedOverrideProvider`\r\naltogether. Any usages of `TestBed.deprecatedOverrideProvider`\r\nshould be replaced with `TestBed.overrideProvider`.

Since we have switched to es2015 in 661a57d9e, we now need the fesm2015 bundles. As a result, the initial ngcc run is redundant and ngcc runs again during each build (to process the fesm2015 bundles). Since there are 5 concurrent builds, we often end up with multiple ngcc instances processing the same package and trying to write to the same directories at the same time, causing a `file already exists` error\r\n\r\nThis commit fixes it by pre-processing the fesm2015 bundles, so there is no need to re-run ngcc during each concurrent build.\r\n\r\nFixes #30577.\r\n","Url":"https://github.com/angular/angular/pull/30593","RelatedDescription":"Closed or merged PR \"ci(docs-infra): fix `test_docs_examples_ivy` job\" (#30593)"},{"Id":"446775149","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2019-05-21T19:00:41","Actor":"BioPhoton","Number":"30596","RawContent":null,"Title":"docs: add Michael Hladky to GDE resources v2","State":"open","Body":"## PR Type\r\nWhat kind of change does this PR introduce?\r\n\r\n- [ ] Bugfix\r\n- [ ] Feature\r\n- [ ] Code style update (formatting, local variables)\r\n- [ ] Refactoring (no functional changes, no api changes)\r\n- [ ] Build related changes\r\n- [ ] CI related changes\r\n- [x] Documentation content changes\r\n- [ ] angular.io application / infrastructure changes\r\n- [ ] Other...

This causes an exception when the following file is executed in NodeJS since DOM APIs are not available. We mock most of the DOM APIs with `domino` but providing these mocks globally so that such failures can be avoided is not common right now.\r\n\r\nBuilding the project **with tsickle** fixes the problem automatically as decorators are downleveled into a static field while `tsickle` also discards the type reference to `HTMLElement` (as it is not relevant for Angular).\r\n\r\n```js\r\nMyDirective.propDecorators = {\r\n  triggerElement: [{ type: core_1.Input }]\r\n};\r\n```\r\n\r\nTL;DR: \r\n\r\n1) Everything currently works as expected within the CLI since it provides optimizations that removes the decorators anyway when using AOT mode or build-optimizer.\r\n2) It becomes an issue if a project is not built with the CLI / and does not use build-optimizer. Previously tsickle was part of the NGC workflow **by default**.. so it now causes unexpected failures. Needs documentation? See: https://github.com/angular/angular/commit/29761ea5f8e4bae68442236f4a0abc1666487a35\r\n\r\n**How is Angular Bazel affected?**\r\n\r\nWith Bazel it is not possible to opt-in for tsickle's decorator downleveling. Tsickle can be enabled by passing the `bazelOptions: {tsickle: true}`, but that comes with more tsickle transformations which aren't desired. e.g. type imports are rewritten to `goog.requireType`.\r\n\r\n## 🔬 Minimal Reproduction\r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/devversion/ngc-without-tsickle\r\n\r\n## 🔥 Exception or Error\r\n<pre><code>__metadata(\"design:type\", HTMLElement)\r\n                                  ^\r\nReferenceError: HTMLElement is not defined\r\n</code></pre>\r\n\r\n\r\n## 🌍  Your Environment\r\n\r\n**Angular Version:**\r\n<pre><code>Latest: 8.0.0-rc.4</code></pre>\r\n\r\n**Anything else relevant?**\r\n\r\n","Url":"https://github.com/angular/angular/issues/30586","RelatedDescription":"Open issue \"Libraries sometimes depend on tsickle decorator downleveling\" (#30586)"},{"Id":"446496865","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2019-05-21T08:56:29","Actor":"alan-agius4","Number":"30585","RawContent":null,"Title":"test: improve language service tests performance","State":"open","Body":"With this change we reduce the amount of IO operations.

work because the \"bundleOptimizer: true\" option would just overwrite the whole thing. (Given the nature of the config I'm not expecting that this would be possible anytime, hence this proposal:) If I'd to disable that, I'd need to re-implement the whole thing just to change one option. And when I do it naively with a simple setup it straight up fails. (Probably because ng8 now builds both legacy and modern bundles and would require different setups, as I've seen that in this repo where the default config is assembled. But I have no way differentiating that in a custom config file.)\r\n\r\n### Describe the solution you'd like\r\n\r\nAdd a terserOptions config option -- which accepts an object -- into the project's angular.json config (under architect.build.configurations.production). And merge it into the default terserOptions object if exists.

If the name of the class is minified,  these persistent, serialized objects would not be cross-compatible between dev and prod builds. Also there's no guarantee that between different prod versions these minified class names wouldn't change over time.\r\n\r\n","Url":"https://github.com/angular/angular-cli/issues/14487","RelatedDescription":"Closed issue \"Pass extra terser options through the angular.json\" (#14487)"},{"Id":"446731263","IsPullRequest":false,"CreatedAt":"2019-05-21T17:11:00","Actor":"StephenFluin","Number":"14486","RawContent":null,"Title":"Analytics opt-in missing from RC4","State":"open","Body":"\r\n# 🐞 Bug report\r\n\r\n### Command (mark with an `x`)\r\n(all commands)\r\n\r\n### Is this a regression?\r\nWorked in beta period.\r\n\r\n### Description\r\n\r\nInstalling and running CLI 8.0.0-rc.4 does not trigger analytics opt-in.\r\n\r\n## 🔬 Minimal Reproduction\r\nSetup new machine.

This option stores type and DI token information so that the runtime JIT compiler can inject the proper provider.  This option is not needed for AOT compilation and the metadata is indirectly stripped from the output due to all Angular decorators being removed during the compilation process.\r\n\r\nUnfortunately, the `emitDecoratorMetadata` option does not support forward references (or more generally circular dependencies) within ES2015+ output due to the TypeScript compiler transforming the metadata into a direct reference of the yet to be defined class.  This results in a runtime TDZ error.  This is a known limitation of the `emitDecoratorMetadata` option ([reference](https://github.com/microsoft/TypeScript/issues/27519)).  This situation is not unique to Angular and can occur in any TypeScript code.  As it is marked as a design limitation, it is considered that it cannot be fixed within the current architecture of TypeScript.\r\n\r\nAs a result, the change in this PR removes the need for the use of the option by storing the DI information in a static property function via the use of the tsickle `ctorParameters` transformation.  By leveraging the existing functionality, no changes to the framework code is necessary.  Also, minimal new code is required within the CLI, as the relevant tsickle code can be extracted and used with several local modifications.\r\n\r\nFor forward references to function in ES2015+, the `emitDecoratorMetadata` option must be disabled based on the current implementation.  To support both the option and forward references, the metadata generated by TypeScript would need to be altered to remove the type information that would trigger a TDZ error.  However, by doing so the metadata information is no longer useful to Angular and technically incorrect as it will not contain the information from the source code as described by the option.\r\n\r\nCloses: #14424","Url":"https://github.com/angular/angular-cli/pull/14473","RelatedDescription":"Open PR \"fix(@ngtools/webpack): downlevel constructor parameter type information\" (#14473)"},{"Id":"445860536","IsPullRequest":false,"CreatedAt":"2019-05-19T20:26:19","Actor":"farlock85","Number":"14472","RawContent":null,"Title":"Can't select project when doing ng update","State":"open","Body":"# 🐞 Bug report\r\n\r\n### Command (mark with an `x`)\r\n<!-- Can you pin-point the command or commands that are effected by this bug? -->\r\n<!-- ✍️edit: -->\r\n```\r\n- [ ] new\r\n- [ ] build\r\n- [ ] serve\r\n- [ ] test\r\n- [ ] e2e\r\n- [ ] generate\r\n- [ ] add\r\n- [x] update\r\n- [ ] lint\r\n- [ ] xi18n\r\n- [ ] run\r\n- [ ] config\r\n- [ ] help\r\n- [ ] version\r\n- [ ] doc\r\n```\r\n\r\n### Description\r\n\r\nWhen running ng update --all --force is will only update the package.json in the root of the Angular project, but will skip your projects in the `projects` folder.

This might make the CDK authors' lives easier, but it is completely contrary to the philosophy of a useful development kit, which should be open to extensibility and unforeseen use-cases, not reflexively hostile to them.\r\n\r\nThe PR makes a start by marking the private fields and methods of CdkTable protected, so they can be accessed and override in a subclass.","Url":"https://github.com/angular/components/pull/16069","RelatedDescription":"Closed or merged PR \"Make cdk-table extensible\" (#16069)"},{"Id":"446102268","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2019-05-20T21:22:22","Actor":"devversion","Number":"16064","RawContent":null,"Title":"build: no longer use deprecated api in sass_bundle rule","State":"closed","Body":"Switches away from deprecated Bazel API that now needs to be enabled\r\nexplcitly within Bazel 0.24.0 (`incompatible_disallow_old_style_args_add`)","Url":"https://github.com/angular/components/pull/16064","RelatedDescription":"Closed or merged PR \"build: no longer use deprecated api in sass_bundle rule\" (#16064)"},{"Id":"446251051","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2019-05-20T20:56:35","Actor":"devversion","Number":"16071","RawContent":null,"Title":"build: fine-grain dependencies for mdc prototypes","State":"closed","Body":"Currently all mdc prototype secondary entry-points specify\r\nall CDK and Material Bazel targets as dependencies.
