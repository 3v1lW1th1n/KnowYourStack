Here's a little demo:\r\n\r\nhttps://codesandbox.io/s/vue-routing-example-b1t5d\r\n\r\nYou see that there's a slight delay before the route component gets rendered. It gets quite apparent when you have a `beforeEach` navigation guard that delays the route to be rendered. The 'blinking' effect between the blank page and the rendered component is undesirable and I am trying to improve it.\r\n\r\nI tried using [async component](https://vuejs.org/v2/guide/components-dynamic-async.html#Async-Components) to no avail, and it turned out that the cause was when the router is initialized, it is validating an [initial route](https://github.com/vuejs/vue-router/blob/v3.0.6/src/util/route.js#L52), and it is rendering an empty node since there is [no match](https://github.com/vuejs/vue-router/blob/v3.0.6/src/components/view.js#L51). This explains the blank page/element that I was facing.\r\n\r\nMy proposal is to render the children instead of an empty node, so that there is something to be rendered before the route component takes place. This applies to any kinds of route mismatches though. I made a little example and an e2e test to demonstrate the change.\r\n\r\nAlso, I did [search](https://github.com/vuejs/vue-router/issues?q=is%3Aissue+placeholder) through the issues but none of it seemed to mention this problem (could be very specific to the problem I'm facing, or maybe I missed it, CMIIW), so if this isn't exactly what Vue Router is aiming for, I understand, but maybe you could suggest a solution for me 😅. But if this is good enough, that would be so great, though I'm not sure if I'm doing the e2e test right.\r\n\r\nAnyhow, let me know!

I have created an application with a large number of components and modules and therefore a large number of namespaced getters. Every time such a getter is invoked the makeLocalGetters function is called iterating trough all the getters in the store just to create the gettersProxy object. This is overkill for ssr performance and is being flagged as a CPU consuming process in the node profiler. \r\nI have managed to double the number of requests per second my ssr app can handle just by using memoization on the gettersProxy object creation. I think this is really impacting performance.\r\n\r\n### What is expected?\r\nNamespaced getters invokation not to be inefficient with large numbers of getters/modules\r\n\r\n### What is actually happening?\r\nA lot of hits to makeLocalGetters making performance go down\r\n\r\n<!-- generated by vue-issues.
