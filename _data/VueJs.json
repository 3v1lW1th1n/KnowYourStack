Why not make a way to create a non-ui Vue instance? \r\n\r\nI personally haven't been able to understand why Vue (reactivity) makes so much sense for a view layer, and MobX (reactivity) makes so much sense for a store layer, yet Mobx is typically used on React (not reactive), and Vuex (reactive, but vastly different design when Mobx is so similar to Vue) is used for Vue. The mismatch creates a loss of symmetry when there seems to be a clear path towards a unified reactive view   store system. Not just unified in that they use the same framework, but unified in that they are matching concepts with matching APIs. \r\n\r\nAs it is, you can use Mobx with Vue, but then you are dealing with two different reactive APIs, which again kills the symmetry and consistency.\r\n\r\nI do get that a store layer is out of scope of Vue, which is meant to be a view layer - however if it was possible to create a clean non-ui Vue instance then it creates a base object which can be expanded on in a separate project.\r\n\r\n### What does the proposed API look like?\r\n```javascript\r\nnew Vue({\r\n  ui: false,\r\n  data: {}\r\n});\r\n\r\n// or optionally, create a lower level object which is used both by Vue instances internally and by a store\r\nnew VData({\r\n data: {}\r\n});\r\n```\r\n\r\n<!-- generated by vue-issues.

Create a component that uses a render function to return some parent element with `this.$scopedSlots.default({})` as the children.\r\n2. Create an instance of that component that passes multiple elements to the scoped slot and see `this.$scopedSlots.default({})` return an array.\r\n3. Create an instance of that component that passes a single element to the scoped slot and see `this.$scopedSlots.default({})` return a VNode, **not an array with a single VNode in it**.\r\n\r\n### What is expected?\r\n`this.$scopedSlots.default({})` should always return an array of VNodes, even if there's only one VNode in the array.\r\n\r\nThis is how `this.$slots.default` behaves.\r\n\r\n### What is actually happening?\r\n`this.$scopedSlots.default({})` returns mixed types: an array when there are multiple elements in the slot, or a direct VNode instance if there is only a single child.\r\n\r\n---\r\nThis is inconsistent with how regular slots behave in render functions, and means any render function component rendering scoped slots as children needs to type check the result of invoking the slot to decide if it needs to be wrapped in an array:\r\n\r\n```js\r\nrender(h) {\r\n  const children = this.$scopedSlots.default({})\r\n  return h('div', {}, Array.isArray(children) ? children : [children])\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nContrast that with regular slots where it is always safe to pass the slot as a child because it is always an array:\r\n\r\n```js\r\nrender(h) {\r\n  return h('div', {}, this.$slots.default)\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nIt's a bummer because although this is pretty easy to classify as a bug, it would be a breaking change for a lot of people using scoped slots to write components that use the default scoped slot as their root element:\r\n\r\n```js\r\nrender() {\r\n  return this.$scopedSlots.default({ someDataThisComponentIsResponsibleFor })\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nIf this bug were fixed, anyone with a component like that would need to re-write it like this:\r\n\r\n```js\r\nrender() {\r\n  return this.$scopedSlots.default({ someDataThisComponentIsResponsibleFor })[0]\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nIf this isn't a bug and is by design, I'd love to better understand the reasoning!\r\n\r\n<!-- generated by vue-issues.

An example of this is using Vue as a frontend for Wordpress, but allowing wordpress to dictate the url structure.\r\n\r\nSo for example\r\n\r\nwould have a route that looks like:\r\n```\r\n{\r\n      name: 'post',\r\n      path: '/:permalink([0-9] [/][0-9] [/][\\\\S] )',\r\n      component: StandardArticle\r\n}\r\n```\r\nand a page would have a route that looks like:\r\n```\r\n{\r\n     name: 'page',\r\n     path: '/:permalink*',\r\n     component: StandardPage\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nThis would mean a post url would look like\r\n/2018/04/some-post\r\nand a page would look like\r\n/some-page\r\n\r\nThe regular expressions work but when you actually try to use them it would look like \r\n/2018%2F04%2Fsome-post\r\nfor the post route, page route would look fine since it does not have a / normally\r\n\r\nI see this is an option in path-to-regex but the option is not forwarded to vue-router. This means that if a path would have a / it would be urlencoded by path-to-regex and makes it seemingly impossible to get around (at least I have not found a way around it).\r\n\r\nThis would have additional benefits of, for instance being able to not urlencode but instead change / with _ or even encode it to base64 or something.\r\n\r\n### What does the proposed API look like?\r\nIt would just be passing the second parameter of path to regexp's compile function to the route.\r\n```\r\n{\r\n     name: 'post',\r\n     path: '/:permalink([0-9] [/][0-9] [/][\\\\S] )',\r\n     compile: {\r\n         encode: (value, token) => value\r\n     },\r\n     component: StandardArticle\r\n},\r\n```\r\nhttps://github.com/pillarjs/path-to-regexp#compile-reverse-path-to-regexp\r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/vuejs/vue-router/blob/dev/src/util/params.js\r\non line 20 is where it would need to be passed in some way, `{ pretty: true }` is where the encoding can be changed.\r\n\r\n<!-- generated by vue-issues.

In the actions below, I use the library `axios` to make http request, and I return it as a promise:\r\n\r\n```ts\r\n    const actions = {    \r\n      getCurrentSession(context: Context) {\r\n        return axios.get(\"http://localhost:3000/sessions/current\")\r\n          .then((res) => {\r\n            commitSharedFiles(context, res.data.shared_files);\r\n          })\r\n          .catch((e: string) => {\r\n            console.error(e);\r\n          });\r\n      }\r\n    };\r\n    \r\n    // export action\r\n    export const dispatchGetSharedFiles = dispatch(actions.getCurrentSession);\r\n\r\n    // commit\r\n    export const commitSharedFiles = commit(mutations.setSharedFileList);\r\n    \r\n    // mutations to the state tree\r\n    const mutations = {\r\n      setSharedFileList(state: State, sharedFiles: StoreState.DirFile[]) {\r\n        state.sharedFileList = sharedFiles;\r\n      }\r\n    };\r\n```\r\nBecause of the asynchronous nature of the actions, I have to resolve the promise before retrieving the fetched list of files from the store/state tree:\r\n```ts\r\n    // this is called in the mounted() life cycle method:\r\n    Store.dispatchGetSharedFiles(this.$store).then(res => {\r\n                this.sharedFiles = Store.readSharedFilesList(this.$store);\r\n    });\r\n```\r\nThis works, but I think it is very convoluted to resolve the promise and then get the data. Is there a better way to use async actions in Vuex? thanks\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n### What does the proposed API look like?\r\nno idea\r\n\r\n<!-- generated by vue-issues.

I consider this a leaking abstraction because the components should not control store internals. It would be helpful to have such method as a part of action context object (also, a namespaced version would be very good to have) because more often than not such dynamic activity is strongly tied to API querying (otherwise, why would one not register modules in before?).\r\n\r\nMy end user experience which led to this proposal is trying to build a page, which would show multiple collections of items filtered by various conditions (an app marketplace, to be exact).
