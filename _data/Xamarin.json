Under\r\nnormal \"name mangling\" conventions, `generator` binds this as an\r\n`Android.OS.Build.Serial` property.\r\n\r\n[0]: https://developer.android.com/reference/android/os/Build.html#getSerial()\r\n\r\nThere's just one \"minor\" problem with this: there is *also* an\r\n[`android.os.Build.SERIAL`][1] field, since API-9, which `generator`\r\n*also* binds as an `Android.OS.Build.Serial` property.\r\n\r\n[1]: https://developer.android.com/reference/android/os/Build.html#SERIAL\r\n\r\nThus, a question: given the Java code:\r\n\r\n```java\r\npublic class Build {\r\n\tpublic static String SERIAL = \"UNKNOWN\";\r\n\tpublci static String getSerial() {/* ... */ }\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nWhat will `generator` do?\r\n\r\nAnswer: the wrong thing: the field is *ignored*, and the\r\n`Build.getSerial()` method is used for the `Build.Serial` property.\r\n\r\nThis is problematic. *The managed API has not changed* -- pre-API-26\r\nand post-API-26 both have a string `Build.Serial` property --\r\nbut the *behavior* of the method has changed from reading the value of\r\na static field, to invoking a static method.\r\n\r\nA static method that only exists on devices running API-26 and later.\r\n\r\nMeaning:\r\n\r\n 1. Create a new Xamarin.Android app.\r\n 2. Set `$(TargetFrameworkVersion)` to v8.0, and\r\n    `//uses-sdk/@android:minSdkVersion` to 11 within\r\n\t\t`AndroidManifest.xml`.\r\n 3. Within e.g. `MainActivity.OnCreate()`, reference the\r\n    `Android.OS.Build.Serial` property.\r\n 4. Build the app, and run on e.g. an Android 7.1 device.\r\n\r\nExpected result: it works!\r\n\r\nActual result: not so much:\r\n\r\n\tJava.Lang.NoSuchMethodError: no static method \"Landroid/os/Build;.getSerial()Ljava/lang/String;\"\r\n\r\n@atsushieno has determined that this is the only such behavioral\r\nbreakage introduced by API-26. His\r\n[referenced metadata fixup changes][2] patch lists all the fields\r\nwhich are currently being ignored by the `Mono.Android` build process.\r\n\r\n[2]: https://bugzilla.xamarin.com/attachment.cgi?id=25276\r\n\r\nIn the interest of expediency (and getting this merged into d15-4),\r\ninclude *only* the metadata changes that impact `Build.getSerial()`,\r\nand force it to be bound as a `Build.GetSerial()` method. This\r\n\"un-hides\" the `Build.Serial` binding of the `Build.SERIAL` field,\r\nrestoring semantic compatibility.\r\n\r\nThe remaining of the metadata fixup changes should be merged\r\nseparately."},{"Id":"6704360023","Type":"PullRequestEvent","CreatedAt":"2017-10-11T19:26:57","Actor":"jonpryor","Repository":"xamarin/xamarin-android","Organization":"xamarin","RawContent":null,"RelatedAction":"merged","RelatedUrl":"https://github.com/xamarin/xamarin-android/pull/926","RelatedDescription":"Merged pull request \"[bcl-tests] fixes for compilation on Windows\" (#926) at xamarin/xamarin-android","RelatedBody":"Context:\r\nhttps://devdiv.visualstudio.com/DevDiv/_build/index?buildId=1047263\r\n\r\nThere are a couple fixes to get the BCL tests (and\r\nXamarin.Android-Tests.sln) compiling on Windows.\r\n\r\nThe `SystemUnzip` task is passing some file paths to\r\n`Directory.EnumerateFiles`.

From\r\ncommit d1d9820a:\r\n\r\n> Why are some tests Debug-only and some aren't?\r\n\r\nThe answer: time, primarily. Why run tests multiple times, when they\r\ncan be potentially time-consuming?\r\n\r\nWhile tests can be slow, they're not always *that* slow -- except for\r\n`Xamarin.Android.Build.Tests` and the BCL tests -- and even there,\r\nprogram behavior can alter between Debug and Release configurations.\r\nSee in particular commit 0077d151, in which the BCL tests are run only\r\nin the Debug configuration because tests *failed* when run in the\r\nRelease configuration.\r\n\r\nThe desire, then, is to run *all* tests in both Debug and Release\r\nconfigurations. Yes, it'll take longer! So what! (Within reason:\r\n`Xamarin.Android.Build.Tests` should only be run once!)\r\n\r\nHowever, this raises two problems:\r\n\r\n 1. Filename collisions\r\n 2. Jenkins unit test display\r\n\r\nUntil now, all tests wrote files into a filename that didn't include\r\nthe Configuration, e.g. `TestResult-Mono.Android_Tests.xml`. If we did\r\nrun these tests twice, the second test invocation would overwrite the\r\nfirst test invocation. This isn't desirable.\r\n\r\nThen there's the display on Jenkins: if we did have e.g.\r\n`TestResult-Mono.Android_Tests-Debug.xml`\tand\r\n`TestResult-Mono.Android_Tests-Release.xml`, how will Jenkins display\r\nthat information? I haven't tested, but I would assume that one of two\r\nthings will occur, assuming reasonable Jenkins behavior:\r\n\r\n 1. Each test will be listed twice, e.g.\r\n\r\n        ApplicationContextIsApp\r\n        ApplicationContextIsApp\r\n\r\n 2. They'll be \"merged\" into a single entry.\r\n\r\nNeither of these behaviors is desirable: if Debug passes but Release\r\nfails, we need to be able to differentiate between them. Neither of\r\nthese possible renderings allows us to tell which configuration fails.\r\n\r\nSolve both of these problems by introducing a new `<RenameTestCases/>`\r\ntask. This task takes three values of importance:\r\n\r\n\t<RenameTestCases\r\n\t    Suffix=\"SUFFIX\"\r\n\t    SourceFiles=\"SOURCE\"\r\n\t    DestinationFiles=\"DESTINATION\"\r\n\t/>\r\n\r\nThe `<RenameTestCases/>` task will read in `SOURCE`, and if `SOURCE`\r\nis an XML file which we determine is NUnit2-formatted XML (root\r\nelement of `<test-case/>`), we will update every `//test-case/@name`\r\nvalue so that it ends with `SUFFIX`. The updated XML is then written\r\nto `DESTINATION`, and `SOURCE` is deleted.\r\n\r\nThus, if we have a Debug-configuration\r\n`TestResult-Mono.Android_Tests.xml` file with XML fragment:\r\n\r\n```xml\r\n<test-case\r\n    name=\"Mono.Android_Tests, Android.AppTests.ApplicationTest.ApplicationContextIsApp\"\r\n    ...\r\n/>\r\n```\r\n\r\nthen `<RenameTestCases/>` will create the file\r\n`TestResult-Mono.Android_Tests-Debug.xml` file with XML fragment:\r\n\r\n```xml\r\n<test-case\r\n    name=\"Mono.Android_Tests, Android.AppTests.ApplicationTest.ApplicationContextIsApp (Debug)\"\r\n    ...\r\n/>\r\n```\r\n\r\nThis allows us to run tests in both Debug and Release configurations\r\nwhile not inadvertently overwriting the `TestResults*.xml` files that\r\nJenkins reads, and ensuring that the Jenkins test result output is\r\nrendered in a meaningfully useful fashion.\r\n\r\nTODO: Update the Jenkins Configuration page so that tests are run\r\nseparately in the Release configuration:\r\n\r\n\tmake run-all-tests CONFIGURATION=Release V=1 || exit 1"}],"ResultType":"GitHubEvent"},"Forms":{"Events":[],"ResultType":"GitHubEvent"},"Macios":{"Events":[{"Id":"6705998028","Type":"PullRequestEvent","CreatedAt":"2017-10-12T04:06:20","Actor":"dalexsoto","Repository":"xamarin/xamarin-macios","Organization":"xamarin","RawContent":null,"RelatedAction":"opened","RelatedUrl":"https://github.com/xamarin/xamarin-macios/pull/2878","RelatedDescription":"Opened pull request \"Bump MAX_MONO_VERSION to 5.4.99\" (#2878) at xamarin/xamarin-macios","RelatedBody":"Current stable mono is Mono 5.4.0.201 (2017-06/71277e78f6e) (64-bit)"},{"Id":"6705969731","Type":"PullRequestEvent","CreatedAt":"2017-10-12T03:54:09","Actor":"dalexsoto","Repository":"xamarin/xamarin-macios","Organization":"xamarin","RawContent":null,"RelatedAction":"opened","RelatedUrl":"https://github.com/xamarin/xamarin-macios/pull/2877","RelatedDescription":"Opened pull request \"[NetworkExtension] Update binding from Xcode 9 Beta 1 to Stable\" (#2877) at xamarin/xamarin-macios","RelatedBody":"Also found some minor issues on the macOS side of older API\r\nchecking xtro, fixed all of them in XAMCORE_4_0.\r\n\r\n```\r\n!unknown-field!
