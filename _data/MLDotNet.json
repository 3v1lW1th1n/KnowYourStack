This other problem is related to Resnet18, and is independent of the problem here fixed. Solving any of these two problems actually solve this issue, but perhaps the issue shall remain open until both problems are fixed.\r\n\r\n### The solution\r\n- I changed the way NormalizerTransformers are saved and loaded, so that it included the information of the dimensions of the vector it has as input. This changes maintain backward compatibility in that it is still possible to load models that were saved with previous binary format . But notice that the original problem described in the issue will persist for models that were saved before the changes made in this PR... it would be necessary to save the model with the updated save method in order to avoid that specific problem when working with multidimensional vectors.\r\n\r\n- I added a 3 test cases: one reproducing a very similar problem as in the original issue, another that tests a simplified version of the original problem, and another that checks that backward compatibility is still maintained.","Url":"https://github.com/dotnet/machinelearning/pull/4321","RelatedDescription":"Open PR \"Addresses #4226 .
