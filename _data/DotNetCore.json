While this is still work in progress, we'd like to give you an update on where we are.\r\n\r\nSo far, we've identified the following repos:\r\n\r\n* dotnet/**runtime**\r\n\t- Will contain [coreclr](https://github.com/dotnet/coreclr), [corefx](https://github.com/dotnet/corefx), [core-setup](https://github.com/dotnet/core-setup), [aspnet/Extensions](https://github.com/aspnet/Extensions),\r\n\tand some of [mono/mono](https://github.com/mono/mono)\r\n* [dotnet/**sdk**](https://github.com/dotnet/sdk)\r\n\t- Will contain [toolset](https://github.com/dotnet/toolset), [sdk](https://github.com/dotnet/sdk), [cli](https://github.com/dotnet/cli)\r\n* dotnet/**installer**\r\n\t- Renamed from [core-sdk](https://github.com/dotnet/core-sdk)\r\n* dotnet/**aspnetcore**\r\n\t- Moved from [aspnet/AspNetCore](https://github.com/aspnet/AspNetCore) and will also contain [aspnet/AspNetCore-Tooling](https://github.com/aspnet/AspNetCore-Tooling)\r\n* dotnet/**efcore**\r\n\t- Moved from [aspnet/EntityFrameworkCore](https://github.com/aspnet/EntityFrameworkCore)\r\n* [dotnet/**winforms**](https://github.com/dotnet/winforms)\r\n\t- Unchanged, but listed for clarify\r\n* [dotnet/**wpf**](https://github.com/dotnet/wpf)\r\n\t- Unchanged, but listed for clarify\r\n\r\n### Name changes\r\n\r\nYou might notice that we changed our mind on naming from our [earlier announcement][ann]. Based on your feedback, we decided to go with **dotnet/runtime** instead of **dotnet/platform** and **dotnet/sdk** instead of **dotnet/cli**.\r\n\r\nSeveral people pointed out that the previous names weren't relatable to how we talk about the product, for example on download pages. So, we decided to match the product distributions as the primary design point for the new names. We generally refer to the bits you need to run your app as *the runtime* and the bits you need to build apps as *the SDK*. This also matches the naming chosen by other platforms.\r\n\r\n### New repos can't be used for .NET Core 3.x or earlier\r\n\r\nThe consolidated repositories are going to be about .NET 5 and going forward. It will not be possible to build .NET Core 3.1 or earlier from these repositories. As such, only the master branch from each of the repositories will be brought forward. There will be no porting of the individual release branches in the source repositories.\r\n\r\n### Personal names and email addresses\r\n\r\nSince we're planning on rebasing the history in the merged repositories, we can map your name and email address to new values as well. We primarily do this to support our friends in the LGBTQ+ community who have changed their names to reflect their identities. However, anybody is welcome to use this to change their email and name.\r\n\r\nWhatever your reason might be: we value your contributions and we hope this small gesture makes your life a little bit better. So if you changed your name/email – or simply prefer us to use different values – please [submit a request](mailto:dotnet@microsoft.com&subject=.NET%20repo%20consolidation%3A%20request%20for%20name%20change&body=Hey%2C%20%0A%0AI%E2%80%99d%20like%20to%20change%20my%20email%2Fdisplay%20name%20in%20the%20consolidated%20repo%20from%20%0A%0A%20%20%20%20%20%20%20%20My%20Old%20Name%20%3Cold.me%40example.org%3E%20%0A%0Ato%20%0A%0A%20%20%20%20%20%20%20%20My%20New%20Name%20%3Cnew.me%40example.org%3E%20%0A%0AThanks%21%20%0A).\r\n\r\n### More is coming\r\n\r\nWe'll share more updates in the upcoming months.

'`, so here is my current solution\r\n```cs\r\n[DllImport(\"kernel32\", CharSet = CharSet.Unicode)]\r\npublic static extern IntPtr LoadLibrary(string fileName);\r\n  \r\n[DllImport(\"kernel32\", CharSet = CharSet.Ansi)]\r\npublic static extern IntPtr GetProcAddress(IntPtr module, string procName);\r\n\r\n...\r\n\r\nvar x = (Func<uint, uint, int>)GetDelegateForFunctionPointerFix(GetProcAddress(LoadLibrary(\"kernel32.dll\"), \"Beep\"), typeof(Func<uint, uint, int>));\r\nx(440, 1000);\r\n```\r\n\r\nSo basically, all I want to change is in [Marshal.cs](https://github.com/dotnet/corefx/blob/d58a51f911efb3c98beca21b6cf08cc703424fdf/src/Common/src/CoreLib/System/Runtime/InteropServices/Marshal.cs#L871 from `if (t.IsGenericType)` to `t.IsGenericType && !t.IsConstructedGenericType`\r\n\r\nMy current solution:\r\n```cs\r\nprivate static Func<IntPtr, Type, Delegate> GetDelegateForFunctionPointerInternalPointer;\r\npublic static Delegate GetDelegateForFunctionPointerFix(IntPtr ptr, Type t)\r\n{\r\n    //Validate the parameters (modified from https://referencesource.microsoft.com/#mscorlib/system/runtime/interopservices/marshal.cs)\r\n    if (ptr == IntPtr.Zero)\r\n    {\r\n        throw new ArgumentNullException(nameof(ptr));\r\n    }\r\n\r\n    if (t is null)\r\n    {\r\n        throw new ArgumentNullException(nameof(t));\r\n    }\r\n\t\r\n    //skip the IsRuntimeImplemented check as IsRuntimeImplemented is not visible and I cannot be bothered\r\n\t\r\n    if (t.IsGenericType && !t.IsConstructedGenericType)\r\n    {\r\n        throw new ArgumentException(\"The specified Type must not be an open generic type definition.\", nameof(t));\r\n    }\r\n\r\n    Type? c = t.BaseType;\r\n    if (c != typeof(Delegate) && c != typeof(MulticastDelegate))\r\n    {\r\n        throw new ArgumentException(\"Type must derive from Delegate or MulticastDelegate.\", nameof(t));\r\n    }\r\n\t\r\n    if (GetDelegateForFunctionPointerInternalPointer is null)\r\n    {\r\n        GetDelegateForFunctionPointerInternalPointer = (Func<IntPtr, Type, Delegate>)typeof(Marshal).GetMethod(\"GetDelegateForFunctionPointerInternal\", BindingFlags.Static | BindingFlags.NonPublic).MakeDelegate(null);\r\n    }\r\n\r\n    return GetDelegateForFunctionPointerInternalPointer(ptr, t);\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nTested on .NET Core 3.0 on Windows 10 x64 (running as AnyCPU though).\r\nIf there are any issues/problems with this idea,

types which have all parameters set","State":"closed","Body":"When you call `Marshal.GetDelegateForFunctionPointer(IntPtr, Type)`, it does a series of checks to ensure your parameters are valid and make sense (see [Marshal.cs](https://github.com/dotnet/corefx/blob/d58a51f911efb3c98beca21b6cf08cc703424fdf/src/Common/src/CoreLib/System/Runtime/InteropServices/Marshal.cs#L857)).\r\nBut one of these checks does not make complete sense, the check I am talking about is:\r\n```cs\r\nif (t.IsGenericType)\r\n{\r\n    throw new ArgumentException(SR.Argument_NeedNonGenericType, nameof(t));\r\n}\r\n```\r\nMy problem with this check is that the code should work on constructed generic types (eg. `Action<int>` instead of `Action<T>`), and it does if you write some code that directly uses `GetDelegateForFunctionPointerInternal(IntPtr, Type)` (shown at the bottom of this issue), but the public member `GetDelegateForFunctionPointer(IntPtr, Type)` does not allow it as it checks if it is a generic type.\r\n\r\nHere is what the check should be:\r\n```cs\r\nif (t.IsGenericType && !t.IsConstructedGenericType)\r\n{\r\n    throw new ArgumentException(SR.Argument_NeedNonGenericType, nameof(t));\r\n}\r\n```\r\nThe reason this is annoying to me is that I have some code that needs to be able to dynamically load a native function with a delegate specified on the go and they are always either a `Func` or an `Action` (usually with generic parameters); I cannot do this without either using my workaround which could break if `GetDelegateForFunctionPointerInternal` is renamed or the suggested change to Marshal.cs.\r\n\r\nHere is some sample code that should work:\r\n```cs\r\n[DllImport(\"kernel32\", CharSet = CharSet.Unicode)]\r\npublic static extern IntPtr LoadLibrary(string fileName);\r\n  \r\n[DllImport(\"kernel32\", CharSet = CharSet.Ansi)]\r\npublic static extern IntPtr GetProcAddress(IntPtr module, string procName);\r\n\r\n...\r\n\r\nvar x = Marshal.GetDelegateForFunctionPointer<Func<uint, uint, int>>(GetProcAddress(LoadLibrary(\"kernel32.dll\"), \"Beep\"));\r\nx(440, 1000);\r\n```\r\nBut it throws the following error: `System.ArgumentException: 'The specified Type must not be a generic type definition. '`, so here is my current solution\r\n```cs\r\n[DllImport(\"kernel32\", CharSet = CharSet.Unicode)]\r\npublic static extern IntPtr LoadLibrary(string fileName);\r\n  \r\n[DllImport(\"kernel32\", CharSet = CharSet.Ansi)]\r\npublic static extern IntPtr GetProcAddress(IntPtr module, string procName);\r\n\r\n...\r\n\r\nvar x = (Func<uint, uint, int>)GetDelegateForFunctionPointerFix(GetProcAddress(LoadLibrary(\"kernel32.dll\"), \"Beep\"), typeof(Func<uint, uint, int>));\r\nx(440, 1000);\r\n```\r\n\r\nSo basically, all I want to change is in [Marshal.cs](https://github.com/dotnet/corefx/blob/d58a51f911efb3c98beca21b6cf08cc703424fdf/src/Common/src/CoreLib/System/Runtime/InteropServices/Marshal.cs#L871 from `if (t.IsGenericType)` to `t.IsGenericType && !t.IsConstructedGenericType`\r\n\r\nMy current solution:\r\n```cs\r\nprivate static Func<IntPtr, Type, Delegate> GetDelegateForFunctionPointerInternalPointer;\r\npublic static Delegate GetDelegateForFunctionPointerFix(IntPtr ptr, Type t)\r\n{\r\n    //Validate the parameters (modified from https://referencesource.microsoft.com/#mscorlib/system/runtime/interopservices/marshal.cs)\r\n    if (ptr == IntPtr.Zero)\r\n    {\r\n        throw new ArgumentNullException(nameof(ptr));\r\n    }\r\n\r\n    if (t is null)\r\n    {\r\n        throw new ArgumentNullException(nameof(t));\r\n    }\r\n\t\r\n    //skip the IsRuntimeImplemented check as IsRuntimeImplemented is not visible and I cannot be bothered\r\n\t\r\n    if (t.IsGenericType && !t.IsConstructedGenericType)\r\n    {\r\n        throw new ArgumentException(\"The specified Type must not be an open generic type definition.\", nameof(t));\r\n    }\r\n\r\n    Type? c = t.BaseType;\r\n    if (c != typeof(Delegate) && c != typeof(MulticastDelegate))\r\n    {\r\n        throw new ArgumentException(\"Type must derive from Delegate or MulticastDelegate.\", nameof(t));\r\n    }\r\n\t\r\n    if (GetDelegateForFunctionPointerInternalPointer is null)\r\n    {\r\n        GetDelegateForFunctionPointerInternalPointer = (Func<IntPtr, Type, Delegate>)typeof(Marshal).GetMethod(\"GetDelegateForFunctionPointerInternal\", BindingFlags.Static | BindingFlags.NonPublic).MakeDelegate(null);\r\n    }\r\n\r\n    return GetDelegateForFunctionPointerInternalPointer(ptr, t);\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nTested on .NET Core 3.0 on Windows 10 x64 (running as AnyCPU though).\r\nIf there are any issues/problems with this idea, please let me know!","Url":"https://github.com/dotnet/coreclr/issues/27168","RelatedDescription":"Closed issue \"GetDelegateForFunctionPointer should allow generic types which have all parameters set\" (#27168)"},{"Id":"506290192","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2019-10-13T08:11:52","Actor":"mikedn","Number":"27170","RawContent":null,"Title":"[WIP] Cleanup LowerBlockStore","State":"open","Body":"Extracted from #27035\r\n\r\nFixes #27169","Url":"https://github.com/dotnet/coreclr/pull/27170","RelatedDescription":"Open PR \"[WIP] Cleanup LowerBlockStore\" (#27170)"},{"Id":"506287973","IsPullRequest":false,"CreatedAt":"2019-10-13T07:46:27","Actor":"mikedn","Number":"27169","RawContent":null,"Title":"initblk incorrectly handles 0 fill on ARM64","State":"open","Body":"The fill values passed to initblk is supposed to be a byte but ARM64 block store lowering fails to mask the upper bytes resulting in incorrect initialization:\r\n```\r\nldloca V_0\r\nldc.i4 0x11100\r\nldc.i4 15\r\ninitblk\r\n```\r\ngenerates:\r\n```asm\r\n52822000          movz    w0, #0x1100\r\n72A00020          movk    w0, #1 LSL #16\r\n9101C3A1          add     x1, fp, #112  // [V05 loc0]\r\nF9000020          str     x0, [x1]     ; stores 0x0000000000011100\r\nB9000820          str     w0, [x1,#8]  ; stores 0x00011100\r\n79001820          strh    w0, [x1,#12] ; stores 0x1100\r\n39003820          strb    w0, [x1,#14] ; stores 0x00\r\n```\r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/dotnet/coreclr/pull/27035#discussion_r331629601","Url":"https://github.com/dotnet/coreclr/issues/27169","RelatedDescription":"Open issue \"initblk incorrectly handles 0 fill on ARM64\" (#27169)"},{"Id":"506259815","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2019-10-13T01:23:57","Actor":"EgorBo","Number":"27167","RawContent":null,"Title":"Expand BBJ_RETURN blocks with bool conditions","State":"open","Body":"This PR consists of:\r\n1) Recognize `GT_NE` early in the `importer.cpp` (roslyn replaces `x!=0` with `(uint)x>0` and it messes up some optimizations) - [jit-diff](https://gist.github.com/EgorBo/e741488f563ac44f5322a3d2fda5bfa0)\r\n2) Don't replace with `GT_NE` if `GT_ARR_LENGTH` is around - it removes a bound check for [this case](https://sharplab.io/#v2:EYLgxg9gTgpgtADwGwBYA0AXEBDAzgWwB8ABAJgEYBYAKGIGYACMhgYQYG8aHuGuf6m5JAwCWAOwwMAchAwB1aAGtxAcwAU4jAG0Aug2xQo2AJ4BKDnx48RAMwZq1AV02mDR4wDoAMjDEqMABYMAHwMAAymllbRxADs+oYmWmE6ANxRVnHh6dRWAL5Rhbn8jMRCohIMClDKfhoSugnu5pzF0aJ2amEMADz2zhKuiZ4+foGRbe388W5JKTlTTPFhCzwF1HlAA).

Ubuntu server with net core 3","State":"open","Body":"We have a shell script that runs our .net core 3 integration tests on a Ubuntu server: it was running just fine, but since upgrading to .net core 3 it has stopped working.\r\n\r\nIt still works on OSX and in WSL using net core 3 (and the equivalent .bat file works on Windows). \r\n\r\nI have reinstalled .net core 3 on the server but to no effect.\r\n\r\nThere are two problems, which are detailed below:\r\n\r\n1. Calling `dotnet test` from a shell script fails with a permissions error in net core 3, but when calling it from the command line it will run - however..\r\n2. Parameters to `dotnet test` are somehow mangled when running from the command line.\r\n\r\n## Permissions error\r\n\r\nThe shell script is just this:\r\n\r\n```bash\r\n# this works just fine\r\ngit pull\r\n\r\n# run the project which gets the repo path, CDs to the test project folder, \r\n# and runs the tests, passing along any parameters as a test filter\r\ndotnet run --project TestRunner/TestRunner.csproj $@ \r\n\r\n# run the project which analyzes the test results and generates a results page\r\ndotnet run --project TestResultAnalyzer/TestResultAnalyzer/TestResultAnalyzer.csproj \r\n```\r\n\r\nThe first issue is a permissions error calling `dotnet test` from the script: this is the diagnostic output of the TestRunner project:\r\n\r\n```\r\nCurrent directory: /home/username/code/codename/src/API/App/App.Tests\r\nTest command:\r\ndotnet test --filter skeleton -l:trx;LogFileName=App_Test_Run_2019-10-10-11-40.trx -r /home/username/code/codename/src/API/TestRuns/App\r\nStarting process\r\n```\r\nAnd this is the error which occurs when starting the process:\r\n\r\n> Unhandled exception. System.ComponentModel.Win32Exception (13): Permission denied\r\n   at System.Diagnostics.Process.ForkAndExecProcess(String filename, String[] argv, String[] envp, String cwd, Boolean redirectStdin, Boolean redirectStdout, Boolean redirectStderr, Boolean setCredentials, UInt32 userId, UInt32 groupId, UInt32[] groups, Int32& stdinFd, Int32& stdoutFd, Int32& stderrFd, Boolean usesTerminal, Boolean throwOnNoExec)\r\n   at System.Diagnostics.Process.StartCore(ProcessStartInfo startInfo)\r\n   at System.Diagnostics.Process.Start()\r\n   at TestRunner.Program.Main(String[] args) in /home/username/code/codename/src/Misc/TestRunner/Program.cs:line 77\r\n   \r\nAnd this is the code:\r\n\r\n```cs\r\nprocess = new Process {\r\n\tStartInfo = {\r\n\t\tArguments = $\"test {arguments} -l:trx;LogFileName={testRunName}.trx -r {testResultFolder}\",\r\n\t\tFileName = \"dotnet\",\r\n\t\tUseShellExecute = false\r\n\t}\r\n};\r\n                      \r\nvar commandDebug = $\"{process.StartInfo.FileName} {process.StartInfo.Arguments}\";\r\n\r\nConsole.WriteLine(\"Test command\");\r\nConsole.WriteLine(commandDebug);\r\nConsole.WriteLine(\"Starting process\");\r\nprocess.Start(); // boom\r\n```\r\n   \r\nSo, my first issue is:\r\n\r\nWhy is calling `dotnet test` from a shell script resulting in a permissions error, when calling it from the command line does not?\r\n\r\n## Test parameter mangling\r\n\r\nAnd that leads to my second issue.\r\n\r\nIf I run the above from the command line (note we are using NUnit as the test runner)\r\n\r\n`dotnet test --filter skeleton -l:trx;LogFileName=App_Test_Run_2019-10-10-11-40.trx -r /home/username/code/codename/src/API/TestRuns/App`\r\n\r\nThen the tests run, but I get this error message:\r\n\r\n> -r: command not found\r\n\r\nAs per [the documentation](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/core/tools/dotnet-test), `-r` specifies the location of the test output file:\r\n \r\n> Directory in which to find the binaries to run.\r\n> -r|--results-directory <PATH>\r\n\r\nAnd indeed the file is not put in the right place, it ends out here, instead of in the `TestRuns/App` folder as specified:\r\n\r\n> /home/username/code/codename/src/API/App/App.Tests/TestResults/_servername_2019-10-10_11_46_36.trx\r\n\r\nAnd thus the analyzer can't find it, as it's not in the right place.\r\n\r\nNow as I said above, this exact same code works in Windows, OSX and WSL and worked on Ubuntu with net core 2.2 - but on the Ubuntu server it Just. Will. Not. Work. with net core 3.\r\n\r\nSo the second issue is:\r\n\r\nWhy is this test syntax not working on Ubuntu under net core 3?\r\n\r\nSupplementary info:\r\n\r\n#### Output of `dotnet --info`\r\n\r\n```\r\n.NET Core SDK (reflecting any global.json):\r\n Version:   3.0.100\r\n Commit:    04339c3a26\r\n\r\nRuntime Environment:\r\n OS Name:     ubuntu\r\n OS Version:  18.04\r\n OS Platform: Linux\r\n RID:         ubuntu.18.04-x64\r\n Base Path:   /snap/dotnet-sdk/49/sdk/3.0.100/\r\n\r\nHost (useful for support):\r\n  Version: 3.0.0\r\n  Commit:  7d57652f33\r\n\r\n.NET Core SDKs installed:\r\n  3.0.100 [/snap/dotnet-sdk/49/sdk]\r\n\r\n.NET Core runtimes installed:\r\n  Microsoft.AspNetCore.App 3.0.0 [/snap/dotnet-sdk/49/shared/Microsoft.AspNetCore.App]\r\n  Microsoft.NETCore.App 3.0.0 [/snap/dotnet-sdk/49/shared/Microsoft.NETCore.App]\r\n```\r\n  \r\n#### Package references in the test project\r\n\r\n```xml\r\n<ItemGroup>\r\n  <PackageReference Include=\"FluentAssertions\" Version=\"5.9.0\" />\r\n  <PackageReference Include=\"JetBrains.DotMemoryUnit\" Version=\"3.0.20171219.105559\" />\r\n  <PackageReference Include=\"nunit\" Version=\"3.12.0\" />\r\n  <PackageReference Include=\"NUnit.ConsoleRunner\" Version=\"3.10.0\" />\r\n  <PackageReference Include=\"NUnit3TestAdapter\" Version=\"3.15.1\" />\r\n  <PackageReference Include=\"Microsoft.NET.Test.Sdk\" Version=\"16.3.0\" />\r\n</ItemGroup>\r\n```  \r\n\r\n### Server culture\r\n\r\nThe server culture is en-US-POSIX (which hates humans and their puny case-sensitivity, but I digress..)\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n","Url":"https://github.com/dotnet/cli/issues/12860","RelatedDescription":"Open issue \"Calling dotnet test from a shell script fails on Ubuntu server with net core 3\" (#12860)"},{"Id":"505334552","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2019-10-10T15:13:36","Actor":"mmitche","Number":"12859","RawContent":null,"Title":"Switch to correct SHA2 cert (#12855)","State":"closed","Body":"SHA1 certs were deprecated and removed from ESRP.

They perform an `dotnet sln add` in the order `B.csproj` and `A.csproj`.\r\n\r\nWhen they go to merge this change they now have a conflict that needs to be resolved, whereas if there had been some deterministic sort order you'd give your merging tool a better chance to resolve this (and at very least allow the human using the tool a clearer picture of what happened).\r\n\r\nOur scenarios are obviously much more complex (due to the deep dependency tree) but the above is a simple illustration.\r\n\r\nThe below commands will simulate this:\r\n\r\n```\r\ndotnet new sln -n Common\r\ndotnet new sln -n Common2\r\ndotnet new console -n A\r\ndotnet new console -n B\r\ndotnet sln Common.sln add A\\A.csproj\r\ndotnet sln Common.sln add B\\B.csproj\r\ndotnet sln Common2.sln add B\\B.csproj\r\ndotnet sln Common2.sln add A\\A.csproj\r\n```\r\n\r\nTry comparing `Common2.sln` to `Common.sln` (simulating a branch merge).\r\n\r\n## Expected  behavior\r\nA deterministic sort to Solution files. The sort really doesn't matter so long as it is deterministic across files (you sort both sides before committing/comparing).\r\n\r\n## Actual behavior\r\n`dotnet sln add` will perform appending operations (this is the same behavior in Visual Studio). A long time ago there was a UserVoice (and before that a Connect) issue to ask for this feature as well within Visual Studio.\r\n\r\n## Environment data\r\n`dotnet --info` output:\r\n\r\n```\r\n.NET Core SDK (reflecting any global.json):\r\n Version:   2.1.507\r\n Commit:    e8520940d7\r\n\r\nRuntime Environment:\r\n OS Name:     Windows\r\n OS Version:  10.0.18362\r\n OS Platform: Windows\r\n RID:         win10-x64\r\n Base Path:   C:\\Program Files\\dotnet\\sdk\\2.1.507\\\r\n\r\nHost (useful for support):\r\n  Version: 2.1.11\r\n  Commit:  d6a5616240\r\n\r\n.NET Core SDKs installed:\r\n  2.0.2 [C:\\Program Files\\dotnet\\sdk]\r\n  2.1.400 [C:\\Program Files\\dotnet\\sdk]\r\n  2.1.403 [C:\\Program Files\\dotnet\\sdk]\r\n  2.1.502 [C:\\Program Files\\dotnet\\sdk]\r\n  2.1.505 [C:\\Program Files\\dotnet\\sdk]\r\n  2.1.507 [C:\\Program Files\\dotnet\\sdk]\r\n\r\n.NET Core runtimes installed:\r\n  Microsoft.AspNetCore.All 2.1.2 [C:\\Program Files\\dotnet\\shared\\Microsoft.AspNetCore.All]\r\n  Microsoft.AspNetCore.All 2.1.5 [C:\\Program Files\\dotnet\\shared\\Microsoft.AspNetCore.All]\r\n  Microsoft.AspNetCore.All 2.1.6 [C:\\Program Files\\dotnet\\shared\\Microsoft.AspNetCore.All]\r\n  Microsoft.AspNetCore.All 2.1.9 [C:\\Program Files\\dotnet\\shared\\Microsoft.AspNetCore.All]\r\n  Microsoft.AspNetCore.All 2.1.11 [C:\\Program Files\\dotnet\\shared\\Microsoft.AspNetCore.All]\r\n  Microsoft.AspNetCore.App 2.1.2 [C:\\Program Files\\dotnet\\shared\\Microsoft.AspNetCore.App]\r\n  Microsoft.AspNetCore.App 2.1.5 [C:\\Program Files\\dotnet\\shared\\Microsoft.AspNetCore.App]\r\n  Microsoft.AspNetCore.App 2.1.6 [C:\\Program Files\\dotnet\\shared\\Microsoft.AspNetCore.App]\r\n  Microsoft.AspNetCore.App 2.1.9 [C:\\Program Files\\dotnet\\shared\\Microsoft.AspNetCore.App]\r\n  Microsoft.AspNetCore.App 2.1.11 [C:\\Program Files\\dotnet\\shared\\Microsoft.AspNetCore.App]\r\n  Microsoft.NETCore.App 2.0.0 [C:\\Program Files\\dotnet\\shared\\Microsoft.NETCore.App]\r\n  Microsoft.NETCore.App 2.1.2 [C:\\Program Files\\dotnet\\shared\\Microsoft.NETCore.App]\r\n  Microsoft.NETCore.App 2.1.5 [C:\\Program Files\\dotnet\\shared\\Microsoft.NETCore.App]\r\n  Microsoft.NETCore.App 2.1.6 [C:\\Program Files\\dotnet\\shared\\Microsoft.NETCore.App]\r\n  Microsoft.NETCore.App 2.1.9 [C:\\Program Files\\dotnet\\shared\\Microsoft.NETCore.App]\r\n  Microsoft.NETCore.App 2.1.11 [C:\\Program Files\\dotnet\\shared\\Microsoft.NETCore.App]\r\n```\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n","Url":"https://github.com/dotnet/cli/issues/12858","RelatedDescription":"Open issue \"Consdering Adding dotnet sln sort\" (#12858)"},{"Id":"505284649","IsPullRequest":false,"CreatedAt":"2019-10-10T14:46:32","Actor":"benmccallum","Number":"12857","RawContent":null,"Title":"dotnet publish can't find resource files","State":"closed","Body":"In a docker container I'm trying to do a `dotnet publish` on one of my projects, but the build says a resource file that needs to be embedded can't be found.

I've been digging and trying to understand for weeks where the issue/limitation is to our problem, figured this would be the most suitable place to ask. We are not sure if this is a limitation with the frameworks, or the platform, or due to our limited knowledge, or a combination of all. But things are very confusing right now, and we just need proper guidance on what direction to take.\r\n\r\n### **Background** 💡 \r\nWe are creating a small, cross-platform (win & macos), desktop application that will act as a websocket server running only on localhost (https). This application is a bridge between our web applications and the local machine hardware (e.g. printers). In order to provide a secure connection, `SslStream` requires a `X509Certificate2` class with a `PrivateKey`.\r\n\r\nThe idea is to let the app itself generate a self-signed certificate with private key and use that to start the secure websocket service. After the certificate has been generated for the first time, we store it in the local certificate store and reuse it when the app restarts. \r\n\r\n### **Project structure & frameworks** 📦 \r\nThis is how our solution is defined. `SharedProject` is a shared lib referenced by both `AppWin` & `AppMac`. The Win & Mac projects are startup-projects for their respective platform. \r\n```\r\nOurApp.sln\r\n  |---- SharedProject (netstandard2.1)\r\n        Creates & runs the websocket service, generates certificate (win), communicates with local hardware, ect\r\n\r\n  |---- AppWin (netcore3.0)\r\n        Startup project for Windows platform. Contains platform-specific code, if any.\r\n\r\n  |---- AppMac (Xamarin.Mac)\r\n        Startup project for macOS platform. Contains platform-specific code (generates certificate).\r\n```\r\n\r\n### **How it runs** 🏃 \r\nIn our `SharedProject` we have a class taking care of certificate generation and storing. The idea was that both the Win & Mac platforms could use this to manage the certificates. It uses the `X509Certificate2` & `CertificateRequest` provided by the framework. Plus the `X509Store` to save and retrieve the certificate.\r\n\r\n**Windows** ✔️ \r\nOn Windows there are no issues. With minimum amount of code we are able to generate a self-signed certificate with private-key, store it, and run the service with it. Also re-using the certificate when the app restarts by retrieving the certificate works very well. The `X509Store` returns the certificate with the _private key_, and we can easily use it with our `SslStream`. \r\n\r\n**macOS** ❌ \r\nThings are not so clear here... We could not use the above mentioned shared class to manage certificates (that works just fine on Windows):\r\n* First issue was that we got a `PlatformNotSupportedException` when the application was trying to use the `CertificateRequest`. \r\n* Second \"issue\" was that the `X509Store` did not store or retrieve certificates from the macOS keychain, but instead it uses some local mono certificate-store that the browsers do not see (at least in our tests). And it only stored the certificate (.cer) not the private-key that was included in the `X509Certificate2` object. Plus it seemed difficult to \"Trust\" the stored certificate.\r\n\r\nSo we created a separate class to take care of certificate management for macOS inside the `AppMac (Xamarin.Mac)` project. By using `BouncyCastle` we generated an identical self-signed certificate with private-key and used that to run our secure websocket service:\r\n\r\n* When launching our Secure Websocket service on macOS, the certificate used here is automatically added to the local macOS login keychain. For us this is great, since we could not use `X509Store` to add it there in the first place.\r\n* The only way we could retrieve the certificate from the keychain was to use the `SecKeyChain` class and query for it. Thankfully the `SecCertificate` object has a `ToX509Certificate2()` function. But that still left us without the `PrivateKey` that is needed by `SslStream`. \r\n* We also tried using `SecKeyChain.FindIdentity` to retrieve both, but even tho it is easy to convert `SecCertificate` to `X509Certificate2`, there seems to be no way to convert a `SecKey` to something useful like `RSA` or `RSACryptoServiceProvider` or something that can be embedded to the `X509Certificate2`\r\n\r\n### What to do? 😭 \r\nWe are pretty much stuck when it comes to the macOS platform. There seems to be no way for us to retrieve our own X509Certificate2 with the private-key embedded. Not sure if this is because we are using Xamarin.Mac & netstandard2.1, perhaps things are easier on netcore3? But still, Xamarin & mono have been around for a long time, there should be a way for us to do this today. Must be something we are missing here and would appreciate if someone could guide us.

This allows the consumers to deal with `AccessViolationException`s with the `try-catch`/`try-finally` clause and either swallow or log the exception instead of `FailFast`ing. However, I personally have not seen legitimate use of the attribute but to work around crashes caused by flaky libraries or unsafe codes, and swallowing exceptions in such case can introduce a security risk.\r\n\r\n[Furthermore, there was a decision to disable the handling mechanisms of corrupted state exceptions in .NET Core.](https://github.com/dotnet/coreclr/issues/9045#issuecomment-290159433)\r\n\r\n> Handling of corrupted state exceptions is set of low-level desktop features that tried to make it possible to write managed code for what would be best written in plain C. We have abandoned this direction and not included features from this set in .NET Core whenever we had opportunity to do so. Constrained Execution Regions (CERs) or stack overflow handling are other features in this set. None of them are in .NET Core, so we are differing in this area from desktop in general. Also, the different features in this set are tied together e.g. if you really want to write robust handler for corrupted exceptions, you would need CERs for that in desktop, so it does not make sense to pick and choose them in isolation. \r\n\r\nGiven that this attribute does not work anymore on .NET Core & it is inherently dangerous to use this attribute to handle such exceptions in the first place, I think the attribute should be obsoleted or hidden from the IDE to discourage the use of it. At the moment, it does not appear that this incompatibility is not so widely known (Searching on Bing/Google or looking at MS docs barely give any information about the state of the attribute on .NET Core). I believe that either of those options would effectively discourage the use of the type.","Url":"https://github.com/dotnet/corefx/issues/41755","RelatedDescription":"Open issue \"Consider marking HandleProcessCorruptedStateExceptionsAttribute as obsolete/hidden\" (#41755)"},{"Id":"506304210","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2019-10-13T10:29:38","Actor":"eugenesmlv","Number":"41754","RawContent":null,"Title":"Add tests to verify that JSON deserializer doesn't do any multiplication or addition on the string length","State":"open","Body":"Fixes #41687\r\n\r\nUnfortuntately, I'm unable to run these tests locally due to OutOfMemoryException.\r\n\r\ncc @steveharter @ahsonkhan","Url":"https://github.com/dotnet/corefx/pull/41754","RelatedDescription":"Open PR \"Add tests to verify that JSON deserializer doesn't do any multiplication or addition on the string length\" (#41754)"},{"Id":"506289765","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2019-10-13T08:07:21","Actor":"svick","Number":"41753","RawContent":null,"Title":"Cache polymorphic properties","State":"open","Body":"Fixes https://github.com/dotnet/corefx/issues/41638.\r\n\r\nWhen a polymorphic property (i.e. one whose type is `object`) is serialized, its `JsonPropertyInfo` is created every time, based on the runtime type of the property. This is a problem, because it means accessing the property will JIT compile the `Get` delegate every time, which takes a lot of time.\r\n\r\nThis PR changes that, by caching the `JsonPropertyInfo` for each encountered runtime type. This should be an okay thing to do, since most polymorphic properties should only use a small number of types.\r\n\r\nOne case where this could cause an issue is if doing this prevents the type from unloading. But, as far as I can tell, that is already a problem with System.Text.Json, and one that can be solved by switching the instance of `JsonSerializerOptions` that's used.\r\n\r\nAfter [adding a benchmark for this case](https://github.com/svick/performance/commit/7ffcc2c) the results of comparing System.Text.Json.Serialization microbenchmarks show clear improvement (up to 68x) for the new

This works with .NET Framework because ClientWebSocket under the covers on netfx establishes its connection with WebRequest, but on .NET Core it uses different mechanisms.  In fact, with netstandard2.0 APIs, there is no way to specify that ClientWebSocket should use the default proxy.  This breaks such libraries in environments such as those in enterprises where proxies are common and configured implicitly for everyone on the network.\r\n\r\nIn .NET Core 3.0 we added HttpClient.DefaultProxy, which implements IWebProxy and serves as a full cross-platform implementation for the default proxy.  The change is to make WebRequest.DefaultWebProxy return it, rather than just returning a dummy singleton used only for its reference identity.\r\n\r\n## Customer Impact\r\n\r\nLibraries like the Azure AMQP library don't work in enterprise environments, or any environments where default proxies are needed.\r\n\r\n## Regression?\r\n\r\nYes, from .NET Framework.\r\n\r\n## Testing\r\n\r\nAll existing tests, plus a new test.\r\n\r\n## Risk\r\n\r\nOur automated testing around proxies isn't great; this change, however, isn't changing any logic to do with actual proxy resolution or discovery, just using the same class in more places.

the current English language culture uses a different number format","State":"open","Body":"When running the included tests on my Windows 10 machine, which has its display language set to English (United States) and its regional settings set to English (Sweden) (en-SE), four of the five tests in the `PerformanceTrackerServiceTests` class fail with the message \"System.InvalidOperationException : Sequence contains no elements\".\r\n\r\nDigging a bit deeper shows that the cause of the exception is a section of code in the `PerformanceTrackerServiceTests.CreateMatrix()` method which tries to parse numeric values like `7.0` as doubles and fails to do so because the en-SE culture has its decimal separator set to a comma and not a period.\r\n\r\nThe format provider used to parse the numbers is resolved via `EnsureEnglishUICulture.PreferredOrNull`, which returns null if `CultureInfo.CurrentUICulture.Name` starts with \"en\" and `CultureInfo.InvariantCulture` otherwise. The intention seems to be to always try to fall back to the current culture if it appears to be a common English language culture like en-US or en-UK that have a lot of formatting settings in common, but this doesn't always work when the current culture is en-SE or some other less common culture.\r\n\r\nI have fixed this issue locally by simply forcing the use of `CultureInfo.InvariantCulture` when parsing the numeric values in these particular tests, but I think it could also be worth looking into `EnsureEnglishUICulture.PreferredOrNull` and maybe restricting it to a strict subset of English language cultures that are known to work. Let me know if you would like me to submit my proposed changes as a pull request.","Url":"https://github.com/dotnet/roslyn/issues/39248","RelatedDescription":"Open issue \"Tests in PerformanceTrackerServiceTests fail when the current English language culture uses a different number format\" (#39248)"},{"Id":"506099354","IsPullRequest":false,"CreatedAt":"2019-10-11T23:49:19","Actor":"jnm2","Number":"39243","RawContent":null,"Title":"'Generate Equals' does not annotate Equals(T) to allow nulls and causes CS8604","State":"open","Body":"**Version Used**: 16.4p1\r\n\r\nIn .NET Core 3.0, `IEquatable.Equals` is annotated to accept a nullable parameter:\r\n\r\n```cs\r\n    public interface IEquatable<T>\r\n    {\r\n        bool Equals([AllowNull] T other);\r\n    }\r\n```\r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/dotnet/coreclr/blob/v3.0.0/src/System.Private.CoreLib/shared/System/IEquatable.cs#L11\r\n\r\nBut on earlier versions of .NET Core, on .NET Standard, and on .NET Framework, in a project where NRTs are enabled, `IEquatable<>.Equals` does not have this attribute.

As .net core should have the same issue on other posix systems I checked there and noticed that the jit engine has an option to inject gc probes.

The task `AssignTargetPath` is used to generate a `TargetPath` (see [here](https://github.com/microsoft/msbuild/blob/vs16.3/src/Tasks/AssignTargetPath.cs)) which generates the correct one on `NonTransformed.ps1` but not `Test.ps1`.  **UPDATE** From tracing the 2.2 build, I can see it is the same in 2.2 so this is fine.\r\n\r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/1478003/66257667-fd74a680-e793-11e9-9b07-28edda0a4a23.png)\r\n\r\nI can't figure out where `Test.ps1` is being dropped but later on I clearly see `NonTransformed.ps1` alone in the copy task:\r\n\r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/1478003/66257561-c94cb600-e792-11e9-8f5d-f8bd7aed22e6.png)\r\n\r\nMy output dir afterwards:\r\n\r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/1478003/66258015-0e271b80-e798-11e9-919b-c90d8b39c2bf.png)\r\n\r\nExact same build but with `SDK 2.2.402`:\r\n\r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/1478003/66258002-e46df480-e797-11e9-9d34-cdae57598bac.png)\r\n\r\nI've included my 2.2 and 3.0 binlogs here for comparison:\r\n\r\n[msbuild-binlogs.zip](https://github.com/dotnet/sdk/files/3693524/msbuild-binlogs.zip)\r\n\r\n\r\n","Url":"https://github.com/dotnet/sdk/issues/3719","RelatedDescription":"Open issue \"*.pp contentFiles not copied to output directory in 3.0 SDK\" (#3719)"},{"Id":"502925465","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2019-10-05T13:52:03","Actor":"dotnet-maestro[bot]","Number":"3717","RawContent":null,"Title":"[release/3.1.1xx] Update dependencies from dotnet/core-setup","State":"closed","Body":"This pull request updates the following dependencies\r\n\r\n[marker]: <> (Begin:e0b7e874-2dc6-462b-dd42-08d72a4caef5)\r\n## From https://github.com/dotnet/core-setup\r\n- **Build**: 20191004.20\r\n- **Date Produced**: 10/5/2019 7:26 AM\r\n- **Commit**: 45f675b1acc38eaea182bf6ef284d1b13141d134\r\n- **Branch**: refs/heads/release/3.1\r\n- **Updates**:\r\n  - **Microsoft.NET.HostModel** -> 3.1.0-preview1.19504.20\r\n\r\n[marker]: <> (End:e0b7e874-2dc6-462b-dd42-08d72a4caef5)\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n","Url":"https://github.com/dotnet/sdk/pull/3717","RelatedDescription":"Closed or merged PR \"[release/3.1.1xx] Update dependencies from dotnet/core-setup\" (#3717)"},{"Id":"502911797","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2019-10-05T06:45:22","Actor":"dotnet-maestro[bot]","Number":"3716","RawContent":null,"Title":"[release/3.1.1xx] Update dependencies from dotnet/core-setup","State":"closed","Body":"This pull request updates the following dependencies\r\n\r\n[marker]: <> (Begin:e0b7e874-2dc6-462b-dd42-08d72a4caef5)\r\n## From https://github.com/dotnet/core-setup\r\n- **Build**: 20191004.15\r\n- **Date Produced**: 10/5/2019 2:41 AM\r\n- **Commit**: ea8a25eb0679dc4d940623688189885086286adc\r\n- **Branch**: refs/heads/release/3.1\r\n- **Updates**:\r\n  - **Microsoft.NET.HostModel** -> 3.1.0-preview1.19504.15\r\n\r\n[marker]: <> (End:e0b7e874-2dc6-462b-dd42-08d72a4caef5)\r\n\r\n","Url":"https://github.com/dotnet/sdk/pull/3716","RelatedDescription":"Closed or merged PR \"[release/3.1.1xx] Update dependencies from dotnet/core-setup\" (#3716)"},{"Id":"504235087","IsPullRequest":false,"CreatedAt":"2019-09-30T15:55:55","Actor":"genifycom","Number":"3728","RawContent":null,"Title":"How to debug \"GenerateBundle\" task failed unexpectedly","State":"open","Body":"# Issue Title\r\n\r\ndotnet publish xxx.csproj -r win-x64 -c Release /p:PublishSingleFile=true\r\n\r\ngives me the following:\r\n\r\nC:\\Program Files\\dotnet\\sdk\\3.0.100\\Sdks\\Microsoft.NET.Sdk\\targets\\Microsoft.NET.Publish.targets(809,5): error MSB4018: The \"GenerateBundle\" task failed unexpectedly.

While this is still work in progress, we'd like to give you an update on where we are.\r\n\r\nSo far, we've identified the following repos:\r\n\r\n* dotnet/**runtime**\r\n\t- Will contain [coreclr](https://github.com/dotnet/coreclr), [corefx](https://github.com/dotnet/corefx), [core-setup](https://github.com/dotnet/core-setup), [aspnet/Extensions](https://github.com/aspnet/Extensions), and some of [mono/mono](https://github.com/mono/mono)\r\n* [dotnet/**sdk**](https://github.com/dotnet/sdk)\r\n\t- Will contain [toolset](https://github.com/dotnet/toolset), [sdk](https://github.com/dotnet/sdk), [cli](https://github.com/dotnet/cli)\r\n* dotnet/**installer**\r\n\t- Renamed from [core-sdk](https://github.com/dotnet/core-sdk)\r\n* dotnet/**aspnetcore**\r\n\t- Moved from [aspnet/AspNetCore](https://github.com/aspnet/AspNetCore) and will also contain [aspnet/AspNetCore-Tooling](https://github.com/aspnet/AspNetCore-Tooling)\r\n* dotnet/**efcore**\r\n\t- Moved from [aspnet/EntityFrameworkCore](https://github.com/aspnet/EntityFrameworkCore)\r\n* [dotnet/**winforms**](https://github.com/dotnet/winforms)\r\n\t- Unchanged, but listed for clarity \r\n* [dotnet/**wpf**](https://github.com/dotnet/wpf)\r\n\t- Unchanged, but listed for clarity\r\n\r\n### Name changes\r\n\r\nYou might notice that we changed our mind on naming from our [earlier announcement][ann]. Based on your feedback, we decided to go with **dotnet/runtime** instead of **dotnet/platform** and **dotnet/sdk** instead of **dotnet/cli**.\r\n\r\nSeveral people pointed out that the previous names weren't relatable to how we talk about the product, for example on download pages. So, we decided to match the product distributions as the primary design point for the new names. We generally refer to the bits you need to run your app as *the runtime* and the bits you need to build apps as *the SDK*. This also matches the naming chosen by other platforms.\r\n\r\n### New repos can't be used for .NET Core 3.x or earlier\r\n\r\nThe consolidated repositories are going to be about .NET 5 and going forward. It will not be possible to build .NET Core 3.1 or earlier from these repositories. As such, only the master branch from each of the repositories will be brought forward. There will be no porting of the individual release branches in the source repositories.\r\n\r\n### Personal names and email addresses\r\n\r\nSince we're planning on rebasing the history in the merged repositories, we can map your name and email address to new values as well.

However, this separation has led to a variety of complications for contributors and maintainers alike.  For example:\r\n- **Confusion about where issues should be opened.**  It’s not always clear in which repo an issue should be reported, complicated by the fact that some implementations actually span repositories (e.g. a type might be exposed through a reference assembly and have its tests in corefx but actually be implemented in System.Private.CoreLib in coreclr).\r\n- **Difficulty sharing source.**  System.Private.CoreLib is intricately connected to the rest of the runtime, and thus has lived with the runtime code.  That, however, means that although corefx has been intended as the place to share as much core library code as possible across any underlying runtime, we’ve needed to keep a significant body of code in System.Private.CoreLib, which then has meant it’s needed to be “mirrored” to each runtime repo (coreclr, corert, mono) that needs to consume it as source; similarly, corefx has similarly required access to much of that source, for example to use the same interop DllImports that are employed elsewhere in the runtimes.  The automatic mirror that shares this source needs to be maintained, and even when it has been, it’s often led to lag.  It’s also complicated developer processes, where to validate a change in one repo generally requires manually mirroring the code to other local repos in order to validate the change and ensure merging into one repo won’t break the others.\r\n- **PRs spanning multiple repos.**  Because the runtime, CoreLib, and the core libraries are all intricately linked, changing runtime behaviors, adding new APIs, or changing various build processes (e.g. improving static analysis) often requires multiple PRs carefully staged across time and multiple repos.  For example, to add a new method to a type like Dictionary<>, a developer must first make the source changes in her local coreclr repo and the test and reference assembly changes in her local corefx repo.  When satisfied with the fix, the developer must submit a PR to coreclr as well as a PR to corefx, the latter of which will fail.  Eventually the coreclr PR will be merged, and the changes will mirror to the other runtimes that also require the update.  Eventually those mirror PRs will be merged, and builds will be created containing the fix for each runtime.  At some point later those builds will be consumed into the corefx repo, after which point the original corefx PR can be re-validated and eventually merged.  That’s the best case; things get more complicated in situations where there are bidirectional dependencies.\r\n- **Building an installable runtime.** Self-hosting a custom built .NET requires intricate knowledge of how all the repos work and interact.  A developer can’t just clone a single repo, make a desired change, and easily produce an installer.\r\n- **Consistency.**  One goal we had for more fine-grained repos was to enable isolation and independence for teams working within each repo’s confines, but this has led to non-trivial duplication of effort on things like build systems and CI, and then the resulting lack of consistency as each system ends up diverging from the others.\r\n\r\nThe issues go beyond the runtime.  For example, the ASP.NET maintainers and community did a great job in the past year or so consolidating from ~55 repos down to ~5 repos, but that’s still more repos than is desirable, leading to similar issues as cited above for the runtime.  On top of that, these ASP.NET repositories are in the aspnet GitHub org, which adds an additional set of issues, for example:\r\n- **Complications moving issues between repos.**  If a developer opens an issue in aspnet/aspnetcore and it’s determined that the cause of the issue is actually in dotnet/corefx, there is no GitHub mechanism to enable easily moving that issue across the aspnet to dotnet organizational boundary.\r\n- **Permissions.** Each organization’s permissions end up needing to be managed and maintained separately.\r\n\r\nThe issues extend into tooling as well.  For example, we currently have multiple repositories that all logically make up the dotnet CLI, but actually creating a working installer spans multiple repos.\r\n\r\n### Plan\r\n\r\nTo address these issues, we’re planning to make some changes to our repository structure:\r\n- **dotnet/platform.**  We plan to combine dotnet/coreclr, dotnet/corefx, dotnet/corert, dotnet/core-setup, and the relevant portions of mono/mono into a new dotnet/platform repo.  Everything needed to build and produce the Microsoft.NETCore.App shared framework will be in this repo.  We will no longer suffer from the complications of source mirroring.  Features like changing runtime behavior or adding an API will no longer require a complicated dance across multiple repos.  Etc.\r\n- **dotnet/aspnetcore.**  We plan to move the existing aspnet/aspnetcore repository into the dotnet organization.  Along with that, we aim to combine a variety of the other aspnet repositories into aspnetcore, such as aspnet/blazor.  Whether repos like entityframeworkcore remain separate or combined remains an open question.  A goal is that, just as dotnet/platform will be responsible for the creation of Microsoft.NETCore.App, dotnet/aspnetcore will be responsible for the creation of Microsoft.AspNETCore.App.\r\n- **dotnet/cli.**  We plan to combine dotnet/toolset and dotnet/sdk into the dotnet/cli repo.\r\n\r\n### FAQ\r\n\r\n#### Why are we merging repos?\r\n\r\nWe believe we can significantly improve several aspects of .NET on GitHub by combining repos, benefiting both maintainers and contributors.  These improvements will manifest in a variety of ways, such as in better issue management, much easier models of contribution, and easier and faster ways to build and install the resulting bits.\r\n\r\n####  What will happen to the aspnet org?\r\n\r\nThe aspnet org as a separate entity is legacy and artificial.  In time we hope to absorb it into the dotnet org and sunset the aspnet org.\r\n\r\n#### Will the coreclr and corefx repos go away?\r\n\r\nWith the help of GitHub, we plan to migrate all issues from these repos to the new dotnet/platform repo, and then lock down creation of additional issues, such that the repos will no longer be used for issue management.  We will also inhibit the creation of PRs to the master branch, which will effectively become an archive for read-only review of history.  In this sense, these repos will be archived, and no active development will happen with them.  However, we plan to continue servicing previous .NET Core releases out of these repos, so the various release branches (e.g. release/2.1, release/3.0, etc.) will continue to see (limited) activity.\r\n\r\n#### Will the mono repo go away?\r\n\r\nNo. mono/mono contains the source for the full mono stack and will continue to live on happily.  We will simply be moving the managed source associated with System.Private.CoreLib and copying the relatively small amount of source that makes up the native mono runtime to dotnet/platform.  We may choose to then use some mirroring technology to keep the runtime copy in sync (this will, however, not suffer from the same mirroring issues we currently experience, as we would not be mirroring between two components required to build the same binaries), or we may choose to let them diverge and manually sync only those changes deemed relevant to both implementations.\r\n\r\n#### Will the corert repo go away?\r\n\r\nYes.  We plan to retire/archive the corert repo.  Some of the technology in the corert repo will be migrated to the master branch of dotnet/platform, where it will be productized as part of .NET.  Other portions of the corert repo will be migrated to feature branches of dotnet/platform, where the experimentation can continue.  In this way, we will use feature branches to continue experimenting with the corert technology, while making it easier to share portions with its shipping counterpart and also graduate functionality into master if/when it’s ready.\r\n\r\n#### Does this mean there will be a single repo for all of .NET?\r\n\r\nNo.  We will be reducing the number of repos that contribute to .NET, but currently we do not believe that going all the way down to one is the right answer.\r\n\r\n#### Doesn’t this mean that issue and PR tracking will now be overwhelming?\r\n\r\nIt is already the case that the vast majority of issues in a given repo are not relevant to any individual developer, and with several thousand open issues in each repo and on the order of a hundred open PRs in each, we already need systems (e.g. labels) to successfully manage issues and PRs.  As such, we don’t believe the merging will have a significant impact on this aspect of developer productivity.  If it turns out to have an unexpectedly large negative impact, we will work with the community to find ways to mitigate the problem.  However, there are already a multitude of successful open source projects on GitHub with at least an order of magnitude more issues.\r\n\r\n#### What will happen to existing issues?\r\n\r\nWith the help of GitHub functionality, we plan to migrate all issues from old repos (e.g. dotnet/coreclr, dotnet/corefx) to the new repos (e.g. dotnet/platform).  We may also use this as a forcing function to revisit stale issues and either close those that are no longer relevant or reinvigorate those that are demanding of more immediate attention.\r\n\r\n#### What about git history?\r\n\r\nIn general, we plan to keep history, such that history from each constituent repo will be a part of the new repo.  However, we have made some mistakes in the past (e.g. large binaries, multitudes of automated PRs for flowing bits and source between repos, etc.), and we plan to rewrite history to correct those mistakes wherever possible and impactful.  Some rough calculations suggest this could end up significantly reducing the size of the repos as well as the time it takes to clone, which should not only help developers approaching the project but also CI.  This will end up meaning that SHAs may be different in the new repo than they were in the old repo; as previously mentioned, however, any references to the old SHAs in the old repos will continue to work, as those repos will remain accessible.\r\n\r\n#### Will I still show up in the contributor list due to previous contributions?\r\n\r\nYes.  We plan to merge all such history.\r\n\r\n#### Will this break debugging with SourceLink?\r\n\r\nNo.  The existing repos will continue to be accessible, and commit SHAs there will remain unchanged.\r\n\r\n#### Might plans change?\r\n\r\nSure.  Part of the goal of posting this announcement is to hear from you, hear about additional benefits you're excited about, and hear about additional concerns we may not have considered.  We will include such ideas in our planning and course correct as necessary.\r\n\r\n## Discussion\r\n\r\nTo discuss these plans, please comment on the corresponding issue at https://github.com/dotnet/coreclr/issues/26175.\r\n","Url":"https://github.com/dotnet/announcements/issues/119","RelatedDescription":"Open issue \"Consolidating .NET GitHub repos\" (#119)"},{"Id":"470434872","IsPullRequest":false,"CreatedAt":"2019-07-19T16:54:02","Actor":"richlander","Number":"118","RawContent":null,"Title":".NET Core master branches have switched to \"5.0\"","State":"open","Body":"# .NET Core master branches have switched to \"5.0\"\r\n\r\nVarious .NET Core repos have switched their `master` branches to \"5.0\", and will use 3.x branches for 3.0 and 3.1 projects. This is very similar to how we approached 2.x and 3.0 projects. As context, `master` branches produced 3.0 builds for the entire period of the 2.2 project.\r\n\r\nAt present, this change is only relevant if you contribute to .NET Core repositories. Otherwise, we recommend that you wait for the 5.0 Preview releases before installing this new version.\r\n\r\n## Discussion\r\nPlease share your thoughts on this change and see what others are saying at:\r\n\r\n[dotnet/core #3059](https://github.com/dotnet/core/issues/3059)\r\n\r\n## Details\r\n\r\nThe following repos have moved their master branches to \"5.0\":\r\n\r\n- [dotnet/coreclr](https://github.com/dotnet/coreclr)\r\n- [dotnet/corefx](https://github.com/dotnet/corefx)\r\n- [dotnet/core-setup](https://github.com/dotnet/core-setup)\r\n\r\nYou can see that [5.0 .NET Core Runtime builds](https://github.com/dotnet/core-setup#daily-builds) are now being built and published at dotnet/core-setup.\r\n\r\nIn large part, we switched `master` to 5.0 to enable to the community to contribute changes. As the .NET Core 3.0 released has progressed, we've had to increase scrutiny on the changes we will accept. Now that we've permanently branched for 3.0, we can accept a much broader set of changes. Please consider that to be an open invitation!\r\n\r\nNotably, [dotnet/core-sdk](https://github.com/dotnet/core-sdk) is not yet producing 5.0 builds. We expect that the dotnet/core-sdk master branch will continue as a 3.0 branch for 2-3 months while we finish up the .NET Core 3.0 project.\r\n\r\nAt present, there is no developer experience for 5.0. We are waiting on the dotnet/core-sdk repo to switch to 5.0. Switching your project file to target `netcoreapp5.0` won't do anything useful.

We plan on shipping with a fully documented API surface and sample code.\r\n* Virtually everyone found the key type relatively quickly\r\n    - Some people were confused when types were static, rather than something that one can new up\r\n    - **[Action]** None. This is by-design as we try to reduce the number of allocations.\r\n* Virtually everyone had trouble selecting the correct method on\r\n  `JsonSerializer`\r\n    - We chose a very complicated naming convention\r\n    - **[Action]** We simplified it by using names that people in the study told us were looking for.\r\n* Most of our error messages were well received because they told people what\r\n  the problem is & how they can fix them.\r\n    - One error message was unclear because we reported an unexpected character when we could have reported that we didn't expect a comment.\r\n    - **[Action]** We've reworded the error message.\r\n    - We had one error message that was generated by a lower layer and provided an action item that doesn't make sense when people receive it when using the higher layer component.\r\n    - **[Action]** We've reworded the error message to be more generic so it makes sense for both kind of consumers.\r\n* Virtually everyone used the new Roslyn completion feature which will also show\r\n  types from namespaces not imported yet.\r\n    - However, virtually nobody realized that they were doing it.\r\n    - This caused confusion when people found other APIs that happen to include Json in them, specifically the old data contract serialization.\r\n    - **[Action]** Talk to the Roslyn IDE team to see if this something more people will run into. This could prove to be especially problematic for technologies that share type names (e.g. `UserControl` in WinForms and WPF) and both are referenced by the project.\r\n* Optional parameters and `async`/`await` are usability cliffs\r\n    - Many were confused by optional parameters and tried to pass them in, even though they didn't have to.\r\n    - **[Action]** Talk to the Roslyn IDE team to see if we can visualize them better in VS.\r\n    - **[Action]** Try to avoid heavy use of optional parameters for mainline APIs.\r\n    - Async is a very steep cliff. People have no idea what to do in their code to make async work. While IntelliSense shows the usage by prefixing it with await, people didn't notice that.\r\n    - **[Action]** Unclear; this is a broader issue.\r\n* Virtually nobody used F1 to get help for APIs\r\n    - *Surprise*. I expected more people to use <kbd>F1</kbd>.\r\n* Virtually everyone used F12 to explore the API (\"metadata view\")\r\n    - *Surprise*.

These files, along with the top level [releases-index.json](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dotnet/core/master/release-notes/releases-index.json), are becoming increasingly important .NET Core release assets. These files, one for each major.minor channel, are relied upon by many to detect when updates for .NET Core are available, discover security update details and other uses.\r\n\r\nChanges are sometimes necessary, and the growing dependencies require that we treat compatibility of the schema with the utmost care. This announcement describes an addition to the releases.json schema.\r\n\r\n## SDK Versions and Visual Studio\r\n\r\nBecause of current .NET Core SDK product construction dependencies, there is a hard link between the Runtime, SDK, toolset (compilers, MSBuild, NuGet, and other components), and Visual Studio. Simplistically, this means that when anything updates, everything updates. The unfortunate result of this linking is that multiple versions of the SDK are released with each monthly update for each supported versions of Visual Studio. For example, the May Update for .NET Core 2.2 included the 2.2.5 runtime, 2.2.107 SDK for Visual Studio 2017 and 2.2.204 for Visual Studio 2019 and yet another pair of SDK versions for .NET Core 2.1. An example of this is the [2.2.5 Release Notes](https://github.com/dotnet/core/blob/master/release-notes/2.2/2.2.5/2.2.5.md). \r\n\r\nThis is a confusing situation and we are working to mitigate the need to release multiple SDKs with .NET Core 3.0. The need for multiple SDK versions will persist for 2.1 LTS.\r\n\r\n## Adding the SDKS array\r\n\r\nTo appropriately model multiple SDKs per release, we are adding an SDKs array to releases.json, which will contain SDK objects. The top-level SDK object will represent the highest versioned SDK for a given update. Using the previous 2.2.5 update example, SDK 2.2.204 is in the top SDK object as well as duplicated in the SDKS array. All other applicable 2.2* SDK objects are included in the SDKS array. The SDK objects within the array will carry specific Visual Studio compatibility and version inclusion information to provide appropriate context.\r\n\r\nHere is an example of the new array based on the upcoming July update.\r\nAgain, this will be additive and the previous SDK object will include the highest SDK version for the release.\r\n\r\n```json\r\n{\r\n    \"sdk\": {\r\n        \"version\": \"2.2.301\",\r\n        \"version-display\": \"2.2.301\",\r\n        \"runtime-version\": \"2.2.6\",\r\n        \"vs-version\": \"16.1.3\",\r\n        \"vs-support\": \"Visual Studio 2019 (v16.1)\",\r\n        \"csharp-version\": \"7.3\",\r\n        \"fsharp-version\": \"4.5\",\r\n        \"vb-version\": null,\r\n        \"files\": []\r\n    },\r\n    \"sdks\": [\r\n        {\r\n            \"version\": \"2.2.301\",\r\n            \"version-display\": \"2.2.301\",\r\n            \"runtime-version\": \"2.2.6\",\r\n            \"vs-version\": \"16.1.3\",\r\n            \"vs-support\": \"Visual Studio 2019 (v16.1)\",\r\n            \"csharp-version\": \"7.3\",\r\n            \"fsharp-version\": \"4.5\",\r\n            \"vb-version\": null,\r\n            \"files\": []\r\n        },\r\n        {\r\n          \"version\": \"2.2.205\",\r\n          \"version-display\": \"2.2.205\",\r\n          \"runtime-version\": \"2.2.6\",\r\n          \"vs-version\": \"16.0.5\",\r\n          \"vs-support\": \"Visual Studio 2019 (v16.0)\",\r\n          \"csharp-version\": \"7.3\",\r\n          \"fsharp-version\": \"4.5\",\r\n          \"vb-version\": null,\r\n          \"files\": []\r\n        }\r\n    ]\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\n## vs-version and the Runtime\r\n\r\nThe same version of the runtime is included in multiple versions of Visual Studio. To account for this, the vs-version field is being updated to a comma-delimited string. The string will represent all versions of Visual Studio which first include the particular .NET Core update. Again, an example from the upcoming July Update.\r\n\r\n```json\r\n\"runtime\": {\r\n        \"version\": \"2.2.6\",\r\n        \"version-display\": \"2.2.6\",\r\n        \"vs-version\": \"15.9.13, 16.1.3, 16.2.0\",\r\n```\r\n\r\nThe same `vs-versions` changes will be seen in the `aspnetcore-runtime` object.\r\n\r\n## Future Enhancements\r\n\r\nThere are other improvements to the schema which have been suggested by the community which we are evaluating. Generally, theses enhancements are additive and should not represent compatibility compromises for existing parsers and similar announcements will be published ahead of any changes.\r\n\r\n","Url":"https://github.com/dotnet/announcements/issues/116","RelatedDescription":"Open issue \"Updates to releases.json (.NET Core release metadata)\" (#116)"},{"Id":"444065225","IsPullRequest":false,"CreatedAt":"2019-05-14T18:38:23","Actor":"TaraOverfield","Number":"114","RawContent":null,"Title":"May 2019 .NET Updates","State":"open","Body":"# May 2019 .NET Updates\r\n\r\nThe following .NET updates were released in May 2019.

Either target .NET Core 2.1 or lower, or use a version of the .NET SDK that supports .NET Core 2.2.`\r\n\r\nIf you downloaded the .NET Core SDK 2.2 between April 2 and April 12, 2019, the main [.NET downloads page](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/download/) included only 2.2.2nn. Starting April 12th, a new button marked \"Compatible with Visual Studio 2017\" is provided to target 2.2.1nn. If you downloaded 2.2 prior to this date, and you use Visual Studio 2017, install the compatible version.\r\n\r\n### Visual Studio 2017 can't target .NET Core 2.1\r\n\r\nIf you receive this error message in Visual Studio 2017:\r\n\r\n`The current .NET SDK does not support targeting .NET Core 2.1. Either target .NET Core 2.0 or lower, or use a version of the .NET SDK that supports .NET Core 2.1.`\r\n\r\nThis problem most often occurs because you manually uninstall the 2.1.5nn version. Simply reinstall it from the [.NET Core 2.1 downloads page](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/download/dotnet-core/2.1).\r\n\r\n## More information\r\n\r\nHere is the draft of an article we are preparing for .NET Core documentation:\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n## Solving Problems with .NET Core SDK Selection in Visual Studio\r\n\r\nYou may have .NET Core SDKs on your machine and still have problems with Visual Studio finding an appropriate one. This article explains why this happens and how you can fix your installation.\r\n\r\nWhen Visual Studio can't find an appropriate version of the .NET Core SDK, you'll receive an error message. This may appear in the Error pane as NETSDK1045:\r\n\r\n\"The current .NET SDK does not support targeting .NET Core 2...\"\r\n\r\nYou can check what .NET Core SDKs you have on your machine with the following command:\r\n\r\n```bash\r\ndotnet --list-sdks\r\n```\r\n\r\nUnless you have a global.json file, when you use `dotnet` from the command line, the latest .NET Core SDK is used.\r\n\r\n> [TIP!] \r\n> Open a command prompt and try to build with `dotnet build`. If the command line build works, but Visual Studio doesn't suggestions in this article may help.\r\n\r\nThe last two digits of the .NET Core SDK version numbers are in the format are a patch number, which is represented by `nn` in this article because we will continue to service them to include the latest runtimes. To find out more, vist the [Overview of how .NET Core is versioned page](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/core/versions/).\r\n\r\n## Fixes for Common Problems\r\n\r\n### Visual Studio 2017 can't target .NET Core 2.2\r\n\r\nIf you receive the error message in Visual Studio 2017:\r\n\r\n`The current .NET SDK does not support targeting .NET Core 2.2… Either target .NET Core 2.1 or lower, or use a version of the .NET SDK that supports .NET Core 2.2.`\r\n\r\nUse `dotnet --list-sdks` to ensure you have .NET Core SDK 2.2.1nn. As an example, 2.2.106 would be a valid entry.\r\n\r\nIf you downloaded the .NET Core SDK 2.2 after April 2, 2019, version 2.2.2nn (such as 2.2.203) is listed first and is the highest version available. However, Visual Studio 2017 requires 2.2.1nn (such as 2.2.106). .NET Core SDK 2.2.2nn works with Visual Studio 2019. Visual Studio 2017 and Visual Studio 2019 can be installed side by side, but this requires both .NET Core SDK 2.2.1nn and .NET Core SDK 2.2.2nn to develop .NET Core 2.2 applications.\r\n\r\nTo download .NET Core SDK 2.2.2nn, visit the [.NET downloads page](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/download/dotnet-core/2.2).\r\n\r\n### Visual Studio 2017 can't target .NET Core 2.1\r\n\r\nIf you receive this error message in Visual Studio 2017:\r\n\r\n`The current .NET SDK does not support targeting .NET Core 2.1. Either target .NET Core 2.0 or lower, or use a version of the .NET SDK that supports .NET Core 2.1.`\r\n\r\nUse `dotnet --list-sdks` to ensure you have .NET Core SDK 2.1.5nn. As an example, 2.1.505 would be a valid entry. \r\n\r\nThis problem occurs of you manually uninstall the 2.1.5nn version.\r\n\r\nThe Visual Studio 2019 installation will not remove this file and Visual Studio 2017 will continue to work side by side.\r\n\r\nTo reinstall .NET Core SDK 2.1.5nn, visit the [.NET downloads page](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/download/dotnet-core/2.1).\r\n\r\n### Visual Studio 2019 can't target .NET Core 3.0 Preview\r\n\r\nIf you receive this error message in Visual Studio 2019:\r\n\r\n`The current .NET SDK does not support targeting .NET Core 2.1. Either target .NET Core 2.0 or lower, or use a version of the .NET SDK that supports .NET Core 2.1.`\r\n\r\nUse `dotnet --list-sdks` to ensure you have .NET Core SDK 3.0.100-preview... As an example, SDK 3.0.100-preview3-010431 would be a valid entry.\r\n\r\nTo install .NET Core SDK 3.0.1nn preview, visit the [.NET downloads page](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/download/dotnet-core/3.0).\r\n\r\nIn Visual Studio, go to `Tools\\Options\\Projects and Solutions\\.NET Core` and check the box `Use Previews of the .NET Core SDK`.\r\n\r\n> [NOTE!]\r\n> This option will be moving to `Tools\\Options\\Environment` and renamed `Preview Features` in Visual Studio 2019 version 16.1 Preview 2.\r\n\r\nIf you are targeting .NET Core 3.0 preview, the [C# language version will be C# 8.0 Preview by default](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/visualstudio/releases/2019/release-notes#csharp-defaults) allowing you to use new C# features.\r\n\r\n## Understand the relationship between .NET Core SDKs and Visual Studio build tools\r\n\r\nVisual Studio has its own copies of tools like MSBuild, NuGet and the compilers. If you install the .NET Core workload, it also installs the .NET Core SDK which has versions of these tools and provides tasks and targets. These two versions are built from the same repositories, but target .NET Framework and .NET Core respectively. \r\n\r\nWhen you build a .NET Core project in Visual Studio, it uses Visual Studio's copy of MSBuild, but the tasks and targets are supplied from the selected version of the .NET Core SDK. \r\n\r\nWhen you upgrade the .NET Core SDK, you get new tasks and targets. These new tasks and targets may contain features that are not supported by older versions of MSBuild. Like all of the .NET Core SDK, MSBuild is backwards compatible. It is not forwards compatible.\r\n\r\nThis generally works well, but requires a guarantee that the tasks and targets work with the MSBuild version. To ensure this, each .NET Core SDK indicates an MSBuild version range that is used by Visual Studio to determine compatibility. Versions of the .NET Core SDK that have a higher MSBuild identifier than expected are ignored by Visual Studio. In the normal case, this simply means you use the tasks and targets that were installed with your version of Visual Studio.\r\n\r\nBecause of this, you may have many versions of the .NET Core SDK on your machine and Visual Studio still fail to find one it considers appropriate. This is compounded by a poor error message, which we cannot fully correct because it is from the old version of the .NET Core SDK on your machine. Confusion is also compounded by a complex non-linear release matrix that makes it difficult to predict the right .NET Core SDK to select. We are working to improve all this. \r\n\r\n## The Visual Studio / .NET Core SDK support matrix\r\n\r\nThe last two digits of the .NET Core SDK version number are a patch number, which are represented by a `nn` in this table. You can learn more about .NET Core SDK and .NET Core Runtime versioning at the [Overview of how .NET Core is versioned page](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/core/versions/).\r\n\r\nThe following table shows which Visual Studio versions and .NET Core SDKs are compatible and how they are acquired if you are working with Visual Studio. \r\n\r\n| .NET Core SDK | .NET Core Runtime | Compatible Visual Studio | MSBuild | Notes                                     |\r\n|---------------|-------------------|--------------------------|---------|-------------------------------------------|\r\n| 2.1.5nn       | 2.1               | 2017                     | 15      | Installed as part of VS 2017 version 15.9 |\r\n| 2.1.6nn       | 2.1               | 2019                     | 16      | Installed as part of VS 2019              |\r\n| 2.2.1nn       | 2.2               | 2017                     | 15      | Installed manually                        |\r\n| 2.2.2nn       | 2.2               | 2019                     | 16      | Installed as part of VS 2019              |\r\n| 3.0.1nn       | 3.0 (Preview)     | 2019                     | 16      | Installed manually                        |\r\n\r\nVisual Studio 2017 cannot work with .NET Core SDK 2.1.6nn or 2.2.2nn.\r\n\r\nTo find out more about removing older versions of the .NET Core Runtime and .NET Core SDK, visit the [How to remove the .NET Core Runtime and SDK page](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/core/versions/remove-runtime-sdk-versions?tabs=macos).\r\n\r\nTo download the .NET Core SDK, visit the [.NET downloads page](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/download/dotnet-core).","Url":"https://github.com/dotnet/announcements/issues/108","RelatedDescription":"Open issue \".NET Core SDK 2.2.2nn and 2.1.6nn do not work with Visual Studio 2017\" (#108)"},{"Id":"432081093","IsPullRequest":false,"CreatedAt":"2019-04-11T15:16:43","Actor":"KathleenDollard","Number":"107","RawContent":null,"Title":"Limit DotNetCliToolReference Tools to .NET Core 2.2 and Below","State":"open","Body":"# Limit DotNetCliToolReference Tools to .NET Core 2.2 and Below\r\n\r\n.NET Core 3 takes the next step in the .NET Core tool strategy with local tools.

DotNetCliToolReference tools can be used in projects targeting .NET Core 3.0, but the tools themselves should target .NET Core 2.2 or below.\r\n\r\n## Discussion\r\n\r\nPlease share your thoughts on this change and see what others are saying at:\r\n\r\n[dotnet/sdk #3115](https://github.com/dotnet/sdk/issues/3115)\r\n\r\n## Details\r\n\r\nThe suggested approach going forward is to to use [.NET Core Local Tools](https://aka.ms/local-tools) when you want a tool that is specific to a project or repository. At the same time we are removing the need to access local tools by the verbose `dotnet tool run <toolname>` that was present in earlier previews. You can now access local tools via `dotnet <toolname>`.\r\n\r\nDotNetCliToolReference tools have a flaw in how their dependencies are restored which can create [difficult to diagnose bugs when running these tools](https://github.com/NuGet/Home/issues/5067). This issue would occur much more frequently if targeting .NET Core 3.0 was allowed. Restricting tools to target only .NET Core 2.2 and below means existing scenarios to continue to work (as well as they previously did), regardless of the framework version targeted by the project or the current .NET Core SDK. \r\n\r\nThe new .NET Core tool strategy avoids this flaw in restore strategy and offers other benefits, like the ability to author one type of tool and install it in different ways depending on project and user needs.\r\n\r\nWe look forward to your feedback on .NET Core Local Tools, and on challenges you face moving away from DotNetCliToolReference tools. \r\n\r\n[dotnet/sdk #3057](https://github.com/dotnet/sdk/pull/3057)","Url":"https://github.com/dotnet/announcements/issues/107","RelatedDescription":"Open issue \"Limit DotNetCliToolReference Tools to .NET Core 2.2 and Below\" (#107)"},{"Id":"431012407","IsPullRequest":false,"CreatedAt":"2019-04-09T14:51:18","Actor":"MichaelSimons","Number":"106","RawContent":null,"Title":".NET Core SDK container images now contain the Visual Studio 2019 toolset","State":"open","Body":"# .NET Core SDK container images now contain the Visual Studio 2019 toolset\r\n\r\n.NET Core SDK container images now include Visual Studio 2019 tools.

This will reduce the number of SDKs that are installed on programmer machines.\r\n\r\nFeature bands of the SDK are defined like 3.0.1nn. [Find out more about SDK version numbers](https://docs.microsoft.com/dotnet/core/versions/#versioning-details).\r\n\r\nThis means when .NET Core SDK 3.0.101 becomes available and is installed, .NET Core SDK 3.0.100 will be removed from the machine if it exists. When .NET Core SDK 3.0.200 becomes available and is installed on the same machine, .NET Core SDK versions like 3.0.101 will not be removed but stay side by side with 3.0.200.\r\n\r\nThis approach supports use of `global.json` which will roll forward across patch versions, but not feature bands of the SDK. Thus, upgrading via the SDK installer will not result in errors due to a missing SDK. Feature bands also align with side by side Visual Studio installations for those users that install SDKs for Visual Studio use. For example, Visual Studio 15.9 uses .NET Core SDK 2.2.500 but does not support .NET Core SDK 2.2.600.\r\n\r\nFind out how to [remove other .NET Core SDK versions here.](https://docs.microsoft.com/dotnet/core/versions/remove-runtime-sdk-versions).","Url":"https://github.com/dotnet/announcements/issues/102","RelatedDescription":"Open issue \"SDK Installers will remove previous patch versions\" (#102)"},{"Id":"410971363","IsPullRequest":false,"CreatedAt":"2019-02-15T22:24:40","Actor":"richlander","Number":"101","RawContent":null,"Title":"Publishing .NET Core images to Microsoft Container Registry (MCR)","State":"open","Body":"# Publishing .NET Core images to Microsoft Container Registry (MCR)\r\n\r\nMicrosoft teams are now publishing container images to the [Microsoft Container Registry](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/blog/microsoft-syndicates-container-catalog/). There are two primary reasons for this change:\r\n\r\n* Syndicate Microsoft-provided container images to multiple registries, like Docker Hub and Red Hat.\r\n* Use Microsoft Azure as a global CDN for delivering Microsoft-provided container images.\r\n\r\nYou will use and see MCR as a storage back-end for Microsoft images. The primary way you learn about Microsoft container images and tags will be through a registry, which for most users will continue to be Docker Hub. Most of the experience you've had browsing for .NET Core container images will continue unchanged with this new model. The Docker Hub URLs you've used for Microsoft repos will continue to work, and forward to updated locations on Docker Hub. Existing Docker Hub will images will be maintained as-is.\r\n\r\nSee [.NET Core Container Images now Published to Microsoft Container Registry](https://devblogs.microsoft.com/dotnet/net-core-container-images-now-published-to-microsoft-container-registry/) for the most updated information on our use of MCR.\r\n\r\n## Discussion\r\nPlease share your thoughts on this change and see what others are saying at:\r\n\r\n* [dotnet-docker #935](https://github.com/dotnet/dotnet-docker/issues/935)\r\n\r\n## Starting with .NET Core nightly repo\r\n\r\nOn the .NET team, we started our [transition to MCR](https://github.com/dotnet/dotnet-docker/issues/745) with the .NET Core \"nightly\" repo. [dotnet-nightly](dockerhub.com/r/microsoft/dotnet-nightly) is now hosted on MCR and syndicated to Docker Hub. We started with the nightly repo in order to discover and fix any challenges we found with this new model before we move our higher-traffic primary container repository.\r\n\r\nWe will start publishing [dotnet](dockerhub.com/r/microsoft/dotnet) to MCR a bit later, in either February or March. This issue will be updated when that happens.\r\n\r\n## Repo Split\r\n\r\nThe [.NET Core repo](https://hub.docker.com/r/microsoft/dotnet) currently includes 4 major categories of tags: \r\n\r\n* `sdk`\r\n* `aspnetcore-runtime`\r\n* `runtime` \r\n* `runtime-deps`\r\n\r\nProviding all of the tags in one place has helped with discoverability but made for a repo with an enormous README that can be challenging to navigate and consume. It is large enough that we exceeded Docker Hub README limits and had to artificially make it smaller.\r\n\r\nGoing forward, we will provide a repo for each of the tag categories listed above. We'll also provide a \"product repo\" that will hierarchicaly group all of our repos together. This will satisfy discoverability needs so that it will be easy to find the tags you want.\r\n\r\nYou can already see this experience with [microsoft-dotnet-core-nightly](https://hub.docker.com/_/microsoft-dotnet-core-nightly). There are now multiple repos for our nightly builds:\r\n\r\n* [.NET Core Nightly product repo](https://hub.docker.com/_/microsoft-dotnet-core-nightly)\r\n* [.NET Core SDK Nightly repo](https://hub.docker.com/_/microsoft-dotnet-core-nightly-sdk/)\r\n* [.NET Core ASP.NET Core Nightly repo](https://hub.docker.com/_/microsoft-dotnet-core-nightly-aspnet/)\r\n* [.NET Core Runtime Nightly repo](https://hub.docker.com/_/microsoft-dotnet-core-nightly-runtime/)\r\n* [.NET Core Runtime-deps Nightly repo](https://hub.docker.com/_/microsoft-dotnet-core-nightly-runtime-deps/)\r\n\r\nThe same split will exist for the non-nightly stable repo (currently hosted at  [microsoft/dotnet](https://hub.docker.com/r/microsoft/dotnet)) when we start publishing it to MCR and syndicating it back to DockerHub.\r\n\r\n## Changes to registry URL\r\n\r\nThe biggest change is that your Dockerfiles need to be updated to point to the MCR registry in order get access to new .NET Core container tags. The same change is required for scripts or human operations that pull images via `docker pull`.\r\n\r\nThe following example shows the registry path, repo and tag for the .NET Core 2.2 \"Nightly\" SDK on MCR:\r\n\r\n```console\r\nmcr.microsoft.com/dotnet/core-nightly/sdk:2.2\r\n```\r\n\r\nAs comparison, the following repo and tag have been used to date for the .NET Core 2.2 \"Nightly\" SDK on Docker Hub:\r\n\r\n```console\r\nmicrosoft/dotnet-nightly:2.2-sdk\r\n```\r\n\r\nThe new repo URL is provided at each of the news repos. For example, the new .NET Core SDK \"nightly\" repo provides a box on the right where you can copy and paste the correct MCR-based repo syntax that you can use for `docker pull` or in `FROM` statements in your Dockerfiles.\r\n\r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/2608468/52811702-95c5eb80-304a-11e9-8de8-e6ea1f4b4d75.png)\r\n\r\n## Servicing existing Docker Hub tags\r\n\r\nWe will continue to service existing non-version-specific or floating tags on Docker Hub while the associated .NET Core version is supported. For example the `microsoft/dotnet:2.1-sdk` tag is a floating tag that will continue to be serviced for the lifetime of .NET Core 2.1. You can continue using floating tags without issue.\r\n\r\nIf you use non-floating tags, like `microsoft/dotnet:2.1.504-sdk-alpine`, then you will need to update your Dockerfile to use a new non-floating tag. No new non-floating tags will be published to `microsoft/dotnet` and `microsoft/dotnet-nightly` after we fully transition to MCR.\r\n\r\n.NET Core 3.0 Preview 3 and later will only be made available on MCR.\r\n\r\n## Microsoft is a Verified Publisher\r\n\r\nUntil now, Microsoft-provided container images were considered \"community images\". As part of this change, we are re-classifying Microsoft as a \"verified publisher\" on Docker Hub. This designation should make it clearer that .NET and other Microsoft-provided images are coming from a verified source. There clearly was that expectation previously, but Docker is now making that clearer in the Docker Hub pages they host for Microsoft.\r\n\r\nWe will provide official vulnerability scanning Microsoft-provided images as a second phase of this transition.","Url":"https://github.com/dotnet/announcements/issues/101","RelatedDescription":"Open issue \"Publishing .NET Core images to Microsoft Container Registry (MCR)\" (#101)"},{"Id":"410784442","IsPullRequest":false,"CreatedAt":"2019-02-15T14:06:29","Actor":"TaraOverfield","Number":"100","RawContent":null,"Title":"RESOLVED: Advisory on February 2019 Security update for Windows 10 update 1809","State":"open","Body":"<strong><em>Final Update 2/19/19 @1:30 PM (PST)</em></strong><em>: This </em><em>advisory is now resolved with no action needed from Microsoft Customers.

This policy only applies for the container images that we publish.\r\n\r\n## Discussion\r\nPlease share your thoughts on this change and see what others are saying at:\r\n\r\n* [dotnet-docker #933](https://github.com/dotnet/dotnet-docker/issues/933)\r\n\r\n## Policy\r\n\r\nWe intend to establish the following policy for supporting Alpine with .NET Core container images:\r\n\r\n* Support new Alpine versions within 60 days of release (hopefully much less).\r\n* Support n-1 Alpine versions for 3 months after we support a new Alpine version.\r\n\r\nNote: The [.NET Core support policy](https://github.com/dotnet/core/blob/master/os-lifecycle-policy.md) may be broader. This policy is specific to the container images we produce.\r\n\r\n## Plans\r\n\r\nWe're in the process of [fixing issues required to support Alpine 3.9](https://github.com/dotnet/dotnet-docker/issues/921). We expect that these issues will be resolved in February and that we'll be able to provide support for Alpine 3.9 in March.\r\n\r\nWe will produce Alpine 3.9 images for .NET Core 2.1, 2.2 and 3.0. Assuming we publish 3.9 images in March, we'll stop producing and supporting Alpine 3.7 and 3.8 images after June (2019).\r\n\r\n## Using Alpine-based .NET Core images\r\n\r\nWe produce a variety of Alpine-based images. You can either depend on a specific Alpine version, like with `microsoft/dotnet:2.2-sdk-alpine3.8` or opt to use the latest Alpine image we have to offer, like with `microsoft/dotnet:2.2-sdk-alpine`. Either are good choices. It is just a question of whether you want to make a conscious decision to move to later Alpine releases.\r\n\r\n## Support for ARM32?\r\n\r\nWe produce Alpine images for x64 (and ARM64, shortly). The [Alpine 3.9 announcement](https://twitter.com/alpinelinux/status/1090416212822110214) made mention of support for ARM32v7. We would like to enable .NET Core [Alpine-based images on ARM32](https://github.com/gliderlabs/docker-alpine/issues/463#issuecomment-460530395). We are patiently waiting for that to happen.
