But then the flag becomes required.\r\n\r\n### Verbose Logs\r\n```cmd\r\n> nuget restore -verbosity detailed\r\nNuGet Version: 4.3.0.4406\r\nRestoring NuGet packages for solution C:\\projects\\MyExampleProject\\MyExampleProject.sln.\r\nObject reference not set to an instance of an object.\r\nSystem.NullReferenceException: Object reference not set to an instance of an object.\r\n   at NuGet.CommandLine.MsBuildUtility.<>c__DisplayClass22_0.<GetToolsetFromPath>b__0(MsBuildToolset t)\r\n   at System.Linq.Enumerable.FirstOrDefault[TSource](IEnumerable`1 source, Func`2 predicate)\r\n   at NuGet.CommandLine.MsBuildUtility.GetToolsetFromPath(String msBuildPath, IEnumerable`1 installedToolsets)\r\n   at NuGet.CommandLine.MsBuildUtility.GetMsBuildDirectoryInternal(String userVersion, IConsole console, IEnumerable`1 installedToolsets, Func`1 getMsBuildPathInPathVar)\r\n   at NuGet.CommandLine.MsBuildUtility.GetMsBuildDirectory(String userVersion, IConsole console)\r\n   at System.Lazy`1.CreateValue()\r\n   at System.Lazy`1.LazyInitValue()\r\n   at NuGet.CommandLine.RestoreCommand.ProcessSolutionFile(String solutionFileFullPath, PackageRestoreInputs restoreInputs)\r\n   at NuGet.CommandLine.RestoreCommand.<DetermineRestoreInputsAsync>d__42.MoveNext()\r\n--- End of stack trace from previous location where exception was thrown ---\r\n   at System.Runtime.ExceptionServices.ExceptionDispatchInfo.Throw()\r\n   at System.Runtime.CompilerServices.TaskAwaiter.HandleNonSuccessAndDebuggerNotification(Task task)\r\n   at NuGet.CommandLine.RestoreCommand.<ExecuteCommandAsync>d__34.MoveNext()\r\n\r\n>\r\n```\r\n### Sample Project\r\n[Download the sample app](https://www.dropbox.com/s/161dposz9v4dm2v/WebApplication1.zip?dl=0) or just create a simple MVC Web Application in VS (or any project that happens to have a `*.sln` file. This might have something to do with it? I created a MVC app from scratch using Visual Studio on a different computer, copied it over to the server in question and attempted the nuget restore on it... it failed.\r\n\r\nSimply, having both the VS Test Agent and the VS Build Tools installed on the same machine renders the `nuget restore` command faulty. Uninstall one or the other (preferably VS Test Agent) will allow the `nuget restore` command to run as expected. I do not have any full edition of VS installed (this is a BuildServer running TeamCity 10.x). \r\n\r\nIt isn't favorable or entirely possible to inject the `-MSBuildVersion 15.3` value wherever I'm using `nuget restore`. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"},{"Id":"6565293774","Type":"WatchEvent","CreatedAt":"2017-09-08T07:41:04","Actor":"capadong","Repository":"NuGet/Home","Organization":"NuGet","RawContent":null,"RelatedAction":"started","RelatedUrl":null,"RelatedDescription":"Starred NuGet/Home","RelatedBody":null},{"Id":"6564680459","Type":"IssueCommentEvent","CreatedAt":"2017-09-08T03:23:33","Actor":"sbespalov","Repository":"NuGet/Home","Organization":"NuGet","RawContent":null,"RelatedAction":"created","RelatedUrl":"https://github.com/NuGet/Home/issues/5831#issuecomment-327988990","RelatedDescription":"Commented on issue \"`nuget push` sends empty package content in case of Basic Authentication used on server\" (#5831) at NuGet/Home","RelatedBody":"Seems that `PUSH` is not working now for v4.3 using latest `mono` version (it was worked with previous mono version I have), but it's still working for v3.4.4\r\n\r\nClient console log for v4.3:\r\n```\r\n$ mono nuget_4-3-0.exe push ./Org.Carlspring.Strongbox.Examples.Nuget.Mono.1.0.0.nupkg -verbosity detailed -Source strongbox -ConfigFile ./.nuget/NuGet.config\r\nNuGet Version: 4.3.0.4406\r\nPushing Org.Carlspring.Strongbox.Examples.Nuget.Mono.1.0.0.nupkg to 'http://localhost:8080/strongbox/storages/nuget-common-storage/nuget-releases'...\r\n  PUT http://localhost:8080/strongbox/storages/nuget-common-storage/nuget-releases/\r\nAn error was encountered when fetching 'PUT http://localhost:8080/strongbox/storages/nuget-common-storage/nuget-releases/'.
