factory(exports, __webpack_require__(/*! rxjs */ \"../../node_modules/rxjs/index.js\"), __webpack_require__(/*! rxjs/operators */ \"../../node_modules/rxjs/operators/index.js\"), __webpack_require__(/*! @angular/fire */ \"../../node_modules/@angular/fire/bundles/core.umd.js\"), __webpack_require__(/*! @angular/core */ \"../../node_modules/@angular/core/bundles/core.umd.js\"), __webpack_require__(/*! @angular/common */ \"../../node_modules/@angular/common/bundles/common.umd.js\"), __webpack_require__(/*! firebase/app */ \"../../node_modules/firebase/app/dist/index.cjs.js\"), __webpack_require__(/*! firebase/firestore */ \"../../node_modules/firebase/firestore/dist/index.cjs.js\"),__webpack_require__(/*! @angular/core */ \"../../node_modules/@angular/core/bundles/core.umd.js\")) :\r\n    undefined;\r\n}(this, (function (exports,rxjs,operators,fire,core,common,firebase,…µngcc0) { 'use strict';\r\n```\r\nI was debugging this code for awhile to try and figure out what is going on until I realized that the call to the factory() function is sending in more input params (9) than there is actually in the function definition (8). he function has exports,rxjs,operators,fire,core,common,firebase,…µngcc0 which is 8 params, but here is what the factory is sending in:\r\n```js\r\n1. exports\r\n2. __webpack_require__(/*! rxjs */ \"../../node_modules/rxjs/index.js\")\r\n3. __webpack_require__( \"../../node_modules/rxjs/operators/index.js\")\r\n4. __webpack_require__( \"../../node_modules/@angular/fire/bundles/core.umd.js\")\r\n5. __webpack_require__( \"../../node_modules/@angular/core/bundles/core.umd.js\")\r\n6. __webpack_require__(\"../../node_modules/@angular/common/bundles/common.umd.js\")\r\n7. __webpack_require__(\"../../node_modules/firebase/app/dist/index.cjs.js\")\r\n8. __webpack_require__(\"../../node_modules/firebase/firestore/dist/index.cjs.js\")\r\n9. __webpack_require__(/*! @angular/core */ \"../../node_modules/@angular/core/bundles/core.umd.js\")\r\n```\r\n\r\nWhen you look at the original UMD for Firestore, this starts to make sense because you can see there is an extra param there as well:\r\n```js\r\n(function (global, factory) {\r\n    typeof exports === 'object' && typeof module !== 'undefined' ? factory(exports, require('rxjs'), require('rxjs/operators'), require('@angular/fire'), require('@angular/core'), require('@angular/common'), require('firebase/app'), require('firebase/firestore')) :\r\n    typeof define === 'function' && define.amd ? define(['exports', 'rxjs', 'rxjs/operators', '@angular/fire', '@angular/core', '@angular/common', 'firebase/app', 'firebase/firestore'], factory) :\r\n    (factory((global.angularfire2 = global.angularfire2 || {}, global.angularfire2.firestore = {}),global.rxjs,global.rxjs.operators,global.angularfire2,global.ng.core,global.ng.common,global.firebase));\r\n}(this, (function (exports,rxjs,operators,fire,core,common,firebase) { 'use strict';\r\n```\r\n\r\nYou can see here that `require('firebase/firestore')` is at the end of the `factory()` call, but there is no param for that. So, in the original UMD there is no harm because that extra param isn't used. But, ngcc must be adding an extra param without checking for this.\r\n\r\nSo, I believe at least part of the fix is figuring out why the normal Firestore UMD has that references to /firebase/firestore even though it is not being used.\r\n\r\n## üåç  Your Environment\r\n\r\n**Angular Version:** 9.0.0-rc.7\r\n\r\nFrom https://github.com/angular/angularfire/issues/2280\r\n\r\n//cc @jeffwhelpley","Url":"https://github.com/angular/angular/issues/34653","RelatedDescription":"Open issue \"NGCC: generates broken UMD for @angular/fire/forestore\" (#34653)"},{"Id":"545967616","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2020-01-06T22:13:49","Actor":"JoostK","Number":"34652","RawContent":null,"Title":"fix(ngcc): do not attempt compilation when analysis fails","State":"open","Body":"In #34288, ngtsc was refactored to separate the result of the analysis\r\nand resolve phase for more granular incremental rebuilds.

We deployed it months ago without any problem running ng build --configuration=production. We have IIS 10 (below I added it's configuration).\r\nNow, every time we need to do an update, we delete all deployed files and we copy new ones in site root. After this operation we start getting problems. Site doesn't load, we get black page with some errors (errors are described below)\r\nThis happens only in production environment. We have another server where we deploy app for testing before deploy to production, and here we have no problem. The difference between two environments is only the presence of a CDN in production one.\r\nAfter every deploy in production we also invalidate entire CDN cache.\r\n\r\n2.\r\nThis problem occurs in production but also on developer server where we don't have CDN. When we deploy an update (deleting all files in site root and then copying there new ones, we expect new version is loaded when user open site. Service workers should understand a new version has been deployed comparing its version with the new one through ngsw.json file, and finally \"install\" the correct version.\r\nThis happens only if a user delete browser cache or if user do a ctrl + f5. This doesn't happens with a simple page refresh.

As a result, it exists in a subdirectory. Since many tools (such as `ng`) expect the project to be the working directory, I often use the pattern `(cd path/to/subproject/ && run some tool)`. The subshell means I'm returned back to my original directory.\r\n\r\nThis pattern does not play well with `ng version` and `ng update`.

My mistake here was running `ng version` in the root of my monorepo, rather than the Angular project. After noticing this I tried:\r\n\r\n```shell\r\n$ (cd services/ng-frontend/ && ng version)\r\n     _                      _                 ____ _     ___\r\n    / \\   _ __   __ _ _   _| | __ _ _ __     / ___| |   |_ _|\r\n   / ‚ñ≥ \\ | '_ \\ / _` | | | | |/ _` | '__|   | |   | |    | |\r\n  / ___ \\| | | | (_| | |_| | | (_| | |      | |___| |___ | |\r\n /_/   \\_\\_| |_|\\__, |\\__,_|_|\\__,_|_|       \\____|_____|___|\r\n                |___/\r\n    \r\n\r\nAngular CLI: 9.0.0-rc.7\r\nNode: 13.5.0\r\nOS: linux x64\r\n\r\nAngular: 9.0.0-rc.7\r\n... animations, cli, common, compiler, compiler-cli, core, forms\r\n... language-service, platform-browser, platform-browser-dynamic\r\n... router\r\nIvy Workspace: Yes\r\n\r\nPackage                           Version\r\n-----------------------------------------------------------\r\n@angular-devkit/architect         0.900.0-rc.7\r\n@angular-devkit/build-angular     0.900.0-rc.7\r\n@angular-devkit/build-optimizer   0.900.0-rc.7\r\n@angular-devkit/build-webpack     0.900.0-rc.7\r\n@angular-devkit/core              9.0.0-rc.7\r\n@angular-devkit/schematics        9.0.0-rc.7\r\n@ngtools/webpack                  9.0.0-rc.7\r\n@schematics/angular               9.0.0-rc.7\r\n@schematics/update                0.900.0-rc.7\r\nrxjs                              6.5.4\r\ntypescript                        3.6.4\r\nwebpack                           4.41.2\r\n```\r\n\r\nWhich is what I expected post-update.\r\n\r\nIMHO this dichotomy is confusing. When the user is in an Angular project, it lists versions of that project. When outside an Angular project, it lists the global versions and it is very easy to look at the wrong one.\r\n\r\nI'm not sure what the ideal solution to this problem would be. There could be two different commands, such as an `ng global-version` and `ng project-version`, but this might add too much additional complexity to be worth it. Maybe the output could simply be updated to be more clear? Such as having some big red text saying \"No Angular project detected at $PWD\"?\r\n","Url":"https://github.com/angular/angular-cli/issues/16549","RelatedDescription":"Open issue \"Running `ng version` outside an Angular project has confusing output\" (#16549)"},{"Id":"545328113","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2020-01-04T20:19:46","Actor":"renovate[bot]","Number":"16548","RawContent":null,"Title":"build: update rollup to version 1.28.0","State":"open","Body":"This PR contains the following updates:\n\n| Package | Type | Update | Change |\n|---|---|---|---|\n| [rollup](https://togithub.com/rollup/rollup) | dependencies | minor | [`1.27.14` -> `1.28.0`](https://renovatebot.com/diffs/npm/rollup/1.27.14/1.28.0) |\n\n---\n\n### Release Notes\n\n<details>\n<summary>rollup/rollup</summary>\n\n### [`v1.28.0`](https://togithub.com/rollup/rollup/blob/master/CHANGELOG.md#&#8203;1280)\n\n[Compare Source](https://togithub.com/rollup/rollup/compare/v1.27.14...v1.28.0)\n\n_2020-01-04_\n\n##### Features\n\n-   Allow piping in stdin via the command line interface ([#&#8203;3312](https://togithub.com/rollup/rollup/issues/3312), [#&#8203;3290](https://togithub.com/rollup/rollup/issues/3290))\n-   Allow plugins to mark modules as having syntheticNamedExports for e.g. better CJS interoperability ([#&#8203;3295](https://togithub.com/rollup/rollup/issues/3295))\n-   Ignore variable reassignments in dead code when tree-shaking to remove more unneeded code ([#&#8203;3212](https://togithub.com/rollup/rollup/issues/3212))\n\n##### Bug Fixes\n\n-   Properly respect tree-shaken code when generating sourcemaps ([#&#8203;3318](https://togithub.com/rollup/rollup/issues/3318))\n\n##### Pull Requests\n\n-   [#&#8203;3212](https://togithub.com/rollup/rollup/pull/3212): Handle assignments in dead code ([@&#8203;tjenkinson](https://togithub.com/tjenkinson))\n-   [#&#8203;3290](https://togithub.com/rollup/rollup/pull/3290): Implement stdin input with optional \"-\" as the file name ([@&#8203;kzc](https://togithub.com/kzc))\n-   [#&#8203;3295](https://togithub.com/rollup/rollup/pull/3295): Add syntheticNamedExports ([@&#8203;manucorporat](https://togithub.com/manucorporat))\n-   [#&#8203;3300](https://togithub.com/rollup/rollup/pull/3300): Add note about setting `types` in tsconfig file ([@&#8203;tjenkinson](https://togithub.com/tjenkinson))\n-   [#&#8203;3303](https://togithub.com/rollup/rollup/pull/3303): Use ! to assert not-null in TypeScript ([@&#8203;NotWoods](https://togithub.com/NotWoods))\n-   [#&#8203;3312](https://togithub.com/rollup/rollup/pull/3312): Implement stdin input ([@&#8203;lukastaegert](https://togithub.com/lukastaegert))\n-   [#&#8203;3318](https://togithub.com/rollup/rollup/pull/3318): Update magic-string and other dependencies ([@&#8203;lukastaegert](https://togithub.com/lukastaegert))\n\n</details>\n\n---\n\n### Renovate configuration\n\n:date: **Schedule**: \"after 10pm every weekday,before 4am every weekday,every weekend\" in timezone America/Tijuana.\n\n:vertical_traffic_light: **Automerge**: Disabled by config.

What I want is simple - remove a bunch of \"this.logger.info\" statements from the production build. Try as I might to convince uglify-js & co to do this, I failed (this was all so easy in closure-compiler... sigh). So the solution was to use string-replace-loader to just replace those statements with 0's before anything else happened. While this is not perfect, it works for us.\r\n\r\nHowever starting with Angular 9 (with Ivy enabled, in case it matters), this no longer works as before. I have to flip the order of the loaders, and then it works fine again. I believe this points to a deeper issue though, hence this report.\r\n\r\n## üî¨ Minimal Reproduction\r\n\r\nIn the prod build (which inherits some common thing), we have:\r\n\r\n<pre><code>\r\ncommonConfig.module.rules.push({ test: /\\.ts$/, use: [\r\n  {\r\n    loader: '@ngtools/webpack'\r\n  },\r\n  {\r\n    loader: 'string-replace-loader',\r\n    options: {\r\n      search: 'this\\\\.logger\\\\.(trace|debug|info)\\\\s*\\\\([^()]*\\\\)\\s*;',\r\n      replace: '0;',\r\n      flags: 'sg',\r\n    }\r\n  }\r\n] })\r\n</code></pre>\r\n\r\nThis works fine with Angular 8.1.2, but I have to flip the order of those two loaders for Angular 9.0.0.rc-7. If I flip the order with Angular 8, I end up with a bunch of _0's, because there's some transform that has already converted this -> _this (presumably tsc, invoked by @ngtools/webpack). However in Angular 9.0.0.rc-7, the string-replace-loader ends up doing nothing, all the logs are in the resulting output.

Feature targeting for \"density\" mixins. We don't want to include the default density in the non-partial files. We want to maintain the component-specific density styles in separate partial files.\r\n   * MDC inconsistently includes the default density in the `without-ripple` mixins \r\n   * We need to have a dedicated density mixin anyway, so that developers can override density per component. Hence it would make sense to have a single place for the density per component.\r\n2. Ripples which do not have a hard-coded radius. We can achieve this by using `border-radius` on the ripple container. `MatRipple` will automatically calculate the needed radius.\r\n   * We use this pattern in a few non-MDC based components.. but the calculation is **flawed**. This is because it looks for the furthest edge in the ripple container, but does not respect the border radius. Hence ripple animations appear faster than configured.\r\n3. Ways to add custom density calculations. We do not always use building blocks provided by MDC (e.g. tabs-bar). This seems to be already possible with the current MDC density package.\r\n\r\nThis prototype intends a single partial file for density and color styles (potentially also typography; though typography styles are minimal most of the time). \r\n\r\n* The density and color styles are combined in the component `theme` mixin. That way, developers have the possibility to overwrite density on a per-component basis (without repeating unrelated styles).\r\n* The component theme includes density because by default, density styles are not included in the component styles. Density needs to be configurable and cannot be part of non-partial Sass files.\r\n* Allows developers to configure the default density without needing to add additional CSS overrides that activate the desired default density.\r\n\r\nWe include density in the `theme` to avoid breaking changes where developers need to manually setup default density styles for components. Instead, only setting up a theme is required. Though, we still provide _all_ the flexibility to fine-grain overwrite density or to simply specify a default scale for all components.\r\n\r\nOpen question:\r\n\r\n* How does density play together with typography?\r\n   * Based on the Material Design specification, density for text can be handled by adjusting the line height for individual lines. This seems to not fall into the \"density scale\" pattern, so it seems to be something that needs to be fine-grained by developers if typographic density is desired. Fortunately we provide ways to configure the typography, so we should be covered, but need documentation IMO.\r\n   * Typographic density does not correlate with \"component density\"\r\n\r\nPrototype demo: https://angular-components-test.firebaseapp.com/","Url":"https://github.com/angular/components/pull/18096","RelatedDescription":"Open PR \"[prototype] feat: add support for density scaling in MDC based components\" (#18096)"},{"Id":"545014196","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2020-01-03T14:24:59","Actor":"crisbeto","Number":"18095","RawContent":null,"Title":"fix(chips): avoid accidental form submits when pressing remove button","State":"open","Body":"Sets a `type` on chip remove button so that parent forms don't get submitted by accident.","Url":"https://github.com/angular/components/pull/18095","RelatedDescription":"Open PR \"fix(chips): avoid accidental form submits when pressing remove button\" (#18095)"},{"Id":"544991827","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2020-01-03T13:24:19","Actor":"crisbeto","Number":"18094","RawContent":null,"Title":"fix(datepicker): re-render calendar when locale changes","State":"open","Body":"Fixes the different calendar views not being re-rendered when the locale is changed.
