I am trying to build my own collection of reusable, somewhat opinionated Vue.js, but isolated and standalone components, based on Bulma. It's awesome, except for one small rock that flips the cart.\r\n\r\nThe question/RFC is whether the maintainers would accept a PR that splits `elements/button` into two files - `elements/button` and `elements/buttons`, where the names of those files are a subject to change as it will likely be a requirement to keep a `elements/button` file that imoprts both for compatibility reasons.\r\n\r\nThis way the final payload of a project using such a set of individual components will be much smaller due to the lack of redundant CSS, without having to import the whole library. Having to work alongside another library or framework that is already there makes it even worse without proper isolation between the two.\r\n\r\nExample below.\r\n\r\nEDIT: Probably a better idea to do `elements/button/button.sass` and `elements/button/buttons.sass` where both are being imported by `elements/button.sass` and compatibility is no-issue\r\n\r\nPS The same applies to `form/input-textarea.sass`. Here I imagine the shared SASS in a file, and another two files are created: `form/input.sass`, `form/textarea.sass`, where each of them extends the shared set of rules. Possibly checkbox/radio, but may not be necessary, depending on the use-case.\r\n\r\nWhat do you think?\r\n\r\n### Steps to Reproduce\r\n\r\nFor example, I have Button.vue and Buttons.vue, for a single button and a group of buttons.\r\nThe issue with that is that importing the sass like so\r\n\r\n```scss\r\n@import '~bulma/sass/utilities/all';\r\n@import '~bulma/sass/elements/button';\r\n```\r\n\r\nper-se is alright and works, but the styles in `elements/button` are for both `.button` and `.buttons`.\r\n\r\nI am heavily relying on Vue.js's scoped attribute on style tags, and the result is that the css produced for `Button.vue` has the CSS for `.buttons`, which will never match any element as it's scoped for tue Button component, which will never display a button group.\r\n\r\nThen `Buttons.vue` imports `elements/button` and gets unnecessary styles for `.button`.\r\n\r\n### Expected behavior\r\n\r\nimporting a single SASS file should only provide styles for a single component, ie either a button, or a group of buttons, but not both\r\n\r\n### Actual behavior\r\n\r\n`elements/button` has styles for both a button and a group of buttons\r\n","Url":"https://github.com/jgthms/bulma/issues/2889","RelatedDescription":"Open issue \"split CSS files by component, rather than by concern\" (#2889)"},{"Id":"587933977","IsPullRequest":false,"CreatedAt":"2020-03-25T19:22:00","Actor":"nainardev","Number":"2888","RawContent":null,"Title":"Copyright year in LICENSE is 2019","State":"open","Body":"<!-- PLEASE READ THE FOLLOWING INSTRUCTIONS -->\r\n\r\n<!-- Choose one of the following: -->\r\nThis is about **Bulma | the Docs**.\r\n\r\n<!-- Is it about Bulma or about the Docs? -->\r\n<!-- Is it a bug/feature/question or do you need help? -->\r\n<!-- If it's a bug, is it a browser bug? -->\r\n\r\n### Overview of the problem\r\n\r\n<!-- UNCOMMENT THE APPROPRIATE LINES -->\r\n\r\n<!-- This is about the Bulma **CSS framework** -->\r\n<!-- This is about the Bulma **Docs** -->\r\n<!-- I'm using Bulma **version** [x.x.x] -->\r\n<!-- My **browser** is: -->\r\n<!-- This is a **Sass** issue: I'm using version [x.x.x] -->\r\n<!-- I am sure this issue is **not a duplicate**? -->\r\n\r\n### Description\r\n\r\n<!-- Description of the bug, enhancement, or question -->\r\n\r\n### Steps to Reproduce\r\n\r\n<!--\r\n1.
