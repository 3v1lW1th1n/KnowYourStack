We don't re-implement stacks over and over in different ways. No matter how simple they are.\r\n2. As stacks _could_ have memory pressure implications, centralizing all of our stack use through one type will make tracking our stack usage throughout the codebase easier, and may help track down those issues when/if they arise.\r\n3.

However, this seems to cause massive lag issues in some cases. \r\n\r\nA temporary workaround I have found is to change the functions to arrow function variables since they don't have a separate this context and therefore do not need to be bound to this since it is handled automatically. However, I believe this to be just that, a workaround. It seems to indicate a bigger issue within Angular possibly having to do with change detection. \r\n\r\nHere is a link to a video showing the two stackblitz's below using @swimlane/ngx-charts library as the components that need the functions passed to them: https://youtu.be/oFjfBCJ9gpA\r\n\r\n\r\n## üî¨ Minimal Reproduction\r\n**Buggy version:** https://stackblitz.com/edit/ngx-charts-axistickformatting-buggy-version\r\n**Workaround version:** https://stackblitz.com/edit/ngx-charts-axistickformatting-fixed?file=src%2Fapp%2Fapp.component.ts\r\n\r\n\r\n## üåç  Your Environment\r\n\r\n**Angular Version:**\r\n<pre><code>\r\nAngular CLI: 7.3.6\r\nNode: 10.15.3\r\nOS: win32 x64\r\nAngular: 7.2.9\r\n... animations, common, compiler, compiler-cli, core, forms\r\n... language-service, platform-browser, platform-browser-dynamic\r\n... router\r\n\r\nPackage                           Version\r\n-----------------------------------------------------------\r\n@angular-devkit/architect         0.12.2\r\n@angular-devkit/build-angular     0.12.2\r\n@angular-devkit/build-optimizer   0.12.2\r\n@angular-devkit/build-webpack     0.12.2\r\n@angular-devkit/core              7.2.2\r\n@angular-devkit/schematics        7.3.6\r\n@angular/cdk                      7.3.4\r\n@angular/cli                      7.3.6\r\n@angular/material                 7.3.4\r\n@ngtools/webpack                  7.2.2\r\n@schematics/angular               7.3.6\r\n@schematics/update                0.13.6\r\nrxjs                              6.4.0\r\ntypescript                        3.2.4\r\nwebpack                           4.28.4\r\n</code></pre>\r\n\r\n**Anything else relevant?**\r\nThere is an issues on the @swimlane/ngx-charts github which shows this happening to other people as well along with the temporary workaround, but I figured this might indicate a larger Angular issue and that I should submit it here.

Inside of this block with ngForm I have another wrapper with *ngIf directive. I have 2 inputs: type text and type checkbox in some container with *ngIf. Input type=text is dynamically required. It is required when checkbox is checked and otherwise. Inside ngForm wrapper, but outside of *ngIf wrapper I have 2 buttons: one button is native HTML button and another button is native button wrapped into my custom component. This component contains only native HTML button and it has disabled binding on it. Disabled binding applies as disabled attribute binding to native HTML button in it. Both native button and custom component button have absolutely same `disabled` binding.\r\n\r\nCommon logic: buttons must be disabled when form is invalid and they must be enabled when form is invalid.\r\n\r\nWhat I have: when I press checkbox form becomes invalid and native HTML button with disabled binding becomes disabled. But my custom button with disabled binding is not disabled. Also I have `ExpressionChangedAfterItHasBeenCheckedError` error in console in dev mode.\r\n\r\n## üî¨ Minimal Reproduction\r\n<!--\r\nPlease create and share minimal reproduction of the issue starting with this template: https://stackblitz.com/fork/angular-issue-repro2\r\n-->\r\n<!-- ‚úçÔ∏è--> [Stackblitz example](https://stackblitz.com/edit/angular-2cpkeo)\r\n\r\n1.

If so, please mention it below. -->\r\n\r\nThoughts about structural directives: Structural directives are compiled to `ng-template` with directives. We figured out that it is not problem with structural directives. Structural directives are copiled to ng-templates. I also added raw `ng-template` example to my tag. So it is not problem with ngIf/ngSwitch/ngForOf or any my project-specific structural directive. Looks like it is problem with `ng-template`.\r\n\r\nWhat I noticed: when I use `ng-template` when `@angular/compiler` creates `ngfactory` for my component for some reasons it create not 1 factory function but more functions. For some reasons `required` binding is in one factory, but buttons binding are in another factory (there are 2 \"change detection\" functions in each factory). So approximate flow is:\r\n\r\n1. Call first \"change detection\" function from \"first\" ngfactory (with binding to native HTML button)\r\n2. Call \"change detection\" function for required binding and change state of the form. \r\n3. Call second \"change detection\" function from ngfactory from point 1 (\"first\" ngfactory).\r\n\r\nState of the form is changed in change detection cycle (at point 2) and when we reach point 3 we get another value from absolutely same binding. Because form state changed only at 2 point.\r\n\r\nAbout error in console: In dev mode we have special check. After real change detection we have one more cycle to check if any bindings change their values. So in 1 point we got different values for `disabled` expressions (because form state changed in 1 change detection cycle). Thats why we get this error. \r\n\r\nI can write more verbose if you need.

In order to do this cleanly, and without namespace conflicts/races, we give each of these applications their own base-href, as follows:\r\n\r\n```\r\nng build\r\n    --configuration=staging\r\n    --output-path=./dist-e2e\r\n    --base-href=/ci-cd-draft-build-${JOB_NUMBER}/\r\n```\r\n\r\nThis is then uploaded to S3, and tested as follows:\r\n```\r\nng e2e --baseUrl=https://<s3-bucket>/ci-cd-draft-build-${JOB_NUMBER}/\r\n```\r\nWe also use these draft builds to perform Beta feature usability tests, product demos, and a variety of other activities that are greatly enhanced by having a fully functioning UI. Similarly, we publish whitelabel UI's for our customers, which we also run protractor-driven acceptance tests against, and whose base-url's vary greatly.\r\n\r\nJust now, I noticed this message:\r\n```\r\nOption \"baseUrl\" is deprecated: Use \"baseUrl\" in the Protractor config file instead.\r\n```\r\nWhich I traced to the following entry in the protractor schematic.\r\n```\r\n    \"baseUrl\": {\r\n      \"type\": \"string\",\r\n      \"description\": \"Base URL for protractor to connect to.\",\r\n      \"x-deprecated\": \"Use \\\"baseUrl\\\" in the Protractor config file instead.\"\r\n    }\r\n```\r\nAs our `buildUrl` value is not known ahead of time, we cannot easily use the protractor config file; while we could attempt to inject it via some form of environment parameter, modifying environment parameters is more cumbersome than adding a commandline flag.\r\n\r\n### Describe the solution you'd like\r\nWe do not want this flag to be removed. It's not harming anyone, why is it being removed?\r\n\r\n### Describe alternatives you've considered\r\nWriting a configuration file for CI/CD, for every customer, environment, and build target we have.

`compilerOptions`\r\n\r\nbut the latter refer to `lib-ssr/out-tsc` as tsc output so you may consider changing the `outDir` to `../dist/out-tsc/app-server` so that it refer `lib-ssr/dist/out-tsc` as it

I was able to pass extra args with 1.7.X builds but with new CLI versions I can't simply because CLI is very restrictive. \r\n\r\n\r\n### Describe the solution you'd like\r\nDevelopers should be able to pass custom arguments to ng serve command. Classic example as follows. Our current project has so many API endpoints like DEV1, DEV2... SIT1, SIT2, SVP to PROD. So with previous NG CLI versions we had our custom proxy conf file which reads an argument like  endpoint and then proxy to the correct API endpoint. But with new limitation we are unable to do that.\r\nE.g. \r\n`ng serve --ssl true --proxy-config proxy.conf.js --endpoint sit1`\r\n\r\nproxy conf.\r\n\r\n```\r\nconst ENDPOINTS = {\r\n\tlocal: {\r\n\t\tendpoint: 'https://localhost:9443',\r\n\t\tmockEam: true\r\n\t},\r\n\tdev1: {\r\n\t\tendpoint: 'https:/dev.test.com.au',\r\n                autoRewrite: true,\r\n                changeOrigin: true,\r\n\t\tproxy: false\r\n\t},\r\n\tsit1: {\r\n\t\tendpoint: 'https://dev.test.com.au',\r\n                autoRewrite: true,\r\n                changeOrigin: true,\r\n                proxy: true\r\n\t},\r\n\tuat1: {\r\n\t\tendpoint: 'https://uat.test.com.au'\r\n\t},\r\n\tsvp1: {\r\n\t\tendpoint: 'https://svp.test.com.au',\r\n\t\tproxy: true\r\n\t}\r\n};\r\n```\r\n\r\n\r\n### Describe alternatives you've considered\r\nCan't think of any alternatives other than modify the endpoint manually every time which is a poor developer experience.\r\n","Url":"https://github.com/angular/angular-cli/issues/13937","RelatedDescription":"Closed issue \"Enable custom arguments in serve command\" (#13937)"},{"Id":"421974113","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2019-03-17T21:18:22","Actor":"clydin","Number":"13936","RawContent":null,"Title":"feat(@angular-devkit/build-angular): implement stable architect API for karma","State":"open","Body":"This is a continuation of the Angular builder refactoring following the introduction of the new stable architect builder API.\r\nAdditional refactoring and cleanup are possible.
