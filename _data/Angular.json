This sounds reasonable at first glance.\r\n\r\nThough it becomes problematic if we have top-level re-exports (as specified in the Angular package format). e.g.\r\n\r\n```\r\n| @angular/cdk/ \r\n| -- tree/\r\n| -- -- package.json\r\n| -- -- tree_public_index.d.ts\r\n| -- -- tree_public_index.metadata.json\r\n|\r\n| tree.d.ts // re-exports from ./tree/tree_public_index.d.ts\r\n| tree.metadata.json // re-exports from ./tree/tree_public_index.metadata.json\r\n```\r\n\r\nNow if someone externally imports a component from `@angular/cdk/tree`, it will match the `tree.d.ts` file in the package root. Meaning that `ngfactory` files etc. are generated **next** to that file.\r\n\r\nBut if something references a component of `cdk/tree` through the `cdk/tree/tree_public_index.d.ts` file (which can happen for imports within the entry-point itself; or if NGC creates a factory that imports a symbol from there).\r\n\r\n\r\nIn those cases. NGC assumes that the `ngfactory` is generated within the secondary-entry point folder (`cdk/tree/tree_public_index.ngfactory.js`), but the factory already got generated at a different location (next to `tree.d.ts`). Ultimately it ends with a path resolution failure.\r\n\r\n## 🔬 Minimal Reproduction\r\n\r\nDidn't spend time creating a minimal reproduction, but can try if that is desired. Note that most of the APF packaging tools out there do either not generate top-level re-exports, or just reference the top-level typings file in the entry-point definition. For example:\r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/angular/material2-builds/blob/master/expansion/package.json#L3\r\n\r\n**Anything else relevant?**\r\n\r\nUnless I miss something, we should be able to just remove the metadata and typing re-exports for secondary entry-points. They don't seem to provide any value.","Url":"https://github.com/angular/angular/issues/32651","RelatedDescription":"Open issue \"bazel: ng_package rule generates invalid secondary entry-point definitions\" (#32651)"},{"Id":"493011223","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2019-09-12T20:23:39","Actor":"devversion","Number":"32650","RawContent":null,"Title":"feat(bazel): support specifying flat module entry-point","State":"open","Body":"Currently when building packages with the `ng_module` bazel\r\nrule, it's not possible to select which source file should\r\nbe used as entry-point for the flat module bundle. This is\r\ndifferent to non-Bazel where developers have full control\r\nover the entry-point as they can just specify a single file\r\nin the `tsconfig#files` option which will then be picked up.\r\n\r\nWith Bazel, all specified source files (within the `srcs`\r\nattribute) are explicitly included in the generated tsconfig\r\nfiles.. making it impossible to select a specific file as\r\nentry-point. Previously a workaround solution was tried to\r\nsolve this. The logic tried to determine the entry-point by\r\nlooking for files called `index.ts`. This is not sufficient\r\nas most of the time the flat module bundle *should* be\r\ncalled \"index\". This causes a conflict as the entry-point\r\nas well as the bundle output have the same file path/name.\r\n\r\nIn the components repository, we want to generate the\r\nflat module bundle with the name \"index\", and the\r\nentry-point should be the \"public-api.ts\" file. This is\r\nwhat we currently _can_ control with plain NGC.. but not\r\nwith Bazel.. hence the proposed change here.\r\n\r\n**Note**: This is a proposal.

I then spent the next two hours resolving peer dependency conflicts by upgrading all the packages to their latest versions, and then downgrading a couple that were too new for peer dependencies.\r\n\r\n## 🔬 Minimal Reproduction\r\n\r\n### What's the affected URL?**\r\nhttps://angular.io/start\r\n\r\n### Reproduction Steps**\r\n1. Open the [StackBlitz Angular Example app](https://angular.io/generated/live-examples/getting-started-v0/stackblitz.html) that's referenced [here](https://angular.io/start#create-a-new-project).\r\n1. Click the download button below the Share button.\r\n1. Extract the downloaded zip archive\r\n1. Open the extracted folder in your terminal app\r\n1. Run `npm install`\r\n1. Run `npm audit fix`\r\n1. Run `npm run build`\r\n\r\n### Expected vs Actual Behavior**\r\nI expect the build to pass, but it fails due to a missing Build class.\r\n\r\n## 🌍  Your Environment\r\nWindows 10 Home v1903\r\nWindows Susbsystem for Linux running Ubuntu v18.04.3 LTS\r\nNode v10.16.3\r\nnpm v6.9.0\r\n\r\n### Anything else relevant?\r\nI have my code on github here: https://github.com/carlin-q-scott/angular-kvsbvb\r\n","Url":"https://github.com/angular/angular/issues/32629","RelatedDescription":"Open issue \"Getting Started example app doesn't build locally\" (#32629)"},{"Id":"492506387","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2019-09-11T23:02:31","Actor":"matsko","Number":"32628","RawContent":null,"Title":"refactor(ivy): remove styling state storage and introduce direct style writing","State":"open","Body":"just g3 testing this out","Url":"https://github.com/angular/angular/pull/32628","RelatedDescription":"Open PR \"refactor(ivy): remove styling state storage and introduce direct style writing\" (#32628)"},{"Id":"492498402","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2019-09-11T22:39:12","Actor":"hamza-bouzekri","Number":"32627","RawContent":null,"Title":"added new file called style2 javascript extension","State":"closed","Body":"hello sir please check out these changes from my local repository i still wait you to your feedback.","Url":"https://github.com/angular/angular/pull/32627","RelatedDescription":"Closed or merged PR \"added new file called style2 javascript extension\" (#32627)"},{"Id":"492936809","IsPullRequest":false,"CreatedAt":"2019-09-10T09:41:10","Actor":"AndreySy4","Number":"32641","RawContent":null,"Title":"Misprint in the documentation","State":"open","Body":"#### Bug, feature request, or proposal:\r\nMisprint in the documentation https://angular.io/guide/typescript-configuration\r\nOn example code \"tsconfig.json\" block \"compilerOptions\" declarate 2 times","Url":"https://github.com/angular/angular/issues/32641","RelatedDescription":"Open issue \"Misprint in the documentation\" (#32641)"}],"ResultType":"GitHubIssue"},"AngularCli-Issues":{"Issues":[{"Id":"493141776","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2019-09-13T05:24:51","Actor":"alan-agius4","Number":"15594","RawContent":null,"Title":"feat(@schematics/angular): add node types to universal tsconfig","State":"open","Body":"By default we disable types inclusion in tsconfig.app.json which this tsconfig extends from","Url":"https://github.com/angular/angular-cli/pull/15594","RelatedDescription":"Open PR \"feat(@schematics/angular): add node types to universal tsconfig\" (#15594)"},{"Id":"493141681","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2019-09-13T05:24:24","Actor":"alan-agius4","Number":"15593","RawContent":null,"Title":"ci: enable renovate lockFileMaintenance","State":"open","Body":"See: https://docs.renovatebot.com/configuration-options/#lockfilemaintenance","Url":"https://github.com/angular/angular-cli/pull/15593","RelatedDescription":"Open PR \"ci: enable renovate lockFileMaintenance\" (#15593)"},{"Id":"493140523","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2019-09-13T05:19:12","Actor":"renovate-bot","Number":"15592","RawContent":null,"Title":"build: update webpack-subresource-integrity to version 1.3.3","State":"open","Body":"This PR contains the following updates:\n\n| Package | Type | Update | Change |\n|---|---|---|---|\n| [webpack-subresource-integrity](https://togithub.com/waysact/webpack-subresource-integrity) | dependencies | minor | [`1.1.0-rc.6` -> `1.3.3`](https://renovatebot.com/diffs/npm/webpack-subresource-integrity/1.1.0-rc.6/1.3.3) |\n\n---\n\n### Release Notes\n\n<details>\n<summary>waysact/webpack-subresource-integrity</summary>\n\n### [`v1.3.3`](https://togithub.com/waysact/webpack-subresource-integrity/releases/v1.3.3)\n\n[Compare Source](https://togithub.com/waysact/webpack-subresource-integrity/compare/v1.3.2...v1.3.3)\n\n-   Fix source maps in projects with code splitting ([#&#8203;113](https://togithub.com/waysact/webpack-subresource-integrity/issues/113))\n-   Documentation tweaks:\n    -

It is possible to switch between the themes without reloading the app. For this each theme has an own style file where the 3rd party dependencies are imported wrapped by a class to use their SCSS variables and to style the elements (e.g. the buttons) without overwriting each statement of the 3rd party style files where a color is already set. In addition, there are specific styles of the website divided in several files (base.scss, print.scss, ...). All of them are imported in a single file named `portal.scss` that is included in the angunar.json. The imports are wrapped by a style statement to create a higher priority of the website styles than the styles of the 3rd party libraries without using `!important`.\r\n\r\nEverything works fine using `ng serve` (no errors, no warnings). But building or serving the app with `--prod` generates several warnings that a unexpected bracket is at line xyz.\r\n\r\nI've created a small [example](https://github.com/riede/AngularScssImportFails) to reproduce the behaviour.

Pretty much like the [example](https://angular.io/guide/cli-builder#schedule-and-run) in angular.io website although instead of defining `command` and `args` options I'd like the user to type (or define in a target) the options as she or he were executing the command directly. \r\n\r\n### Describe the solution you'd like\r\nAccording to json-schema's draft, [it is possible](https://json-schema.org/understanding-json-schema/reference/object.html#pattern-properties) to combine `properties`, `propertiesPatterns` and `additionalProperties` to define a schema that allows any property and even control the allowed types.\r\n\r\nCurrently, the cli only considers `boolean` as the possible type of the property `additionalProperties`. \r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/angular/angular-cli/blob/fe8666073b4f357d4614bf90ac39225980ebe24c/packages/angular/cli/models/architect-command.ts#L244\r\n\r\nI'd suggest to make changes in https://github.com/angular/angular-cli/blob/fe8666073b4f357d4614bf90ac39225980ebe24c/packages/angular/cli/utilities/json-schema.ts#L136 to consider an object as possible value of the property `additionalProperties` and parse the options not included in the `properties` object using its value as definition. \r\n\r\nSo, if I create a builder with a schema as follows:\r\n\r\n```\r\n {\r\n  \"$schema\": \"http://json-schema.org/schema\",\r\n  \"title\": \"My builder\",\r\n  \"description\": \"Executes a command\",\r\n  \"type\": \"object\",\r\n  \"additionalProperties\": {\r\n    \"type\": \"string\"\r\n  },\r\n  \"properties\": {\r\n    \"command\": {\r\n      \"type\": \"string\",\r\n      \"description\": \"Command to be executed\"\r\n    }\r\n  },\r\n  \"required\": [\r\n    \"command\"\r\n  ],\r\n  \"definitions\": {\r\n  }\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nAnd I pass the following options to the method `parseJsonSchemaToOptions`:\r\n\r\n```\r\n['--command', 'my-script', '--foo', 'bar']\r\n```\r\n\r\nThe method returns the following array:\r\n\r\n```\r\n[\r\n {\r\n   \"name\": \"command\",\r\n   \"type\": \"string\",\r\n   \"required\": true,\r\n   \"hidden\": false\r\n }\r\n]\r\n``` \r\n\r\nIgnoring the option `--foo`. \r\n\r\nIn my option when additionalProperties is an object it should use its value to define the rest of properties returning the following array:\r\n\r\n```\r\n[\r\n {\r\n   \"name\": \"command\",\r\n   \"type\": \"string\",\r\n   \"required\": true,\r\n   \"hidden\": false\r\n },\r\n {\r\n   \"name\": \"foo\",\r\n   \"type\": \"string\",\r\n   \"required\": false,\r\n   \"hidden\": false\r\n]\r\n``` \r\n\r\n### Describe alternatives you've considered\r\nIf the property `additionalProperties` is set `true` the options not defined explicitly are \"stashed\" in a property with the name \"--\" and therefore builders can access to them. \r\n\r\nHowever, this is not an intuitive workaround and requires the developers to parse these options (split them when using `=` or pair them when using them separately).\r\n","Url":"https://github.com/angular/angular-cli/issues/15565","RelatedDescription":"Open issue \"support option passthrough (additionalProperties) in schematics and builders\" (#15565)"},{"Id":"491500602","IsPullRequest":false,"CreatedAt":"2019-09-10T10:07:24","Actor":"mohitrakhade20","Number":"15563","RawContent":null,"Title":"Issue while creating projects","State":"closed","Body":"<!--🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅\r\n\r\nOh hi there! 😄\r\n\r\nTo expedite issue processing please search open and closed issues before submitting a new one.\r\nExisting issues often contain information about workarounds, resolution, or progress updates.\r\n\r\n🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅-->\r\n\r\n\r\n# 🐞 Bug report\r\nI have created a project and having this issue \r\n\r\n### Command (mark with an `x`)\r\n<!-- Can you pin-point the command or commands that are effected by this bug?

In my stackblitz posted below I have 3 controls in a mat step (step 1). I have a custom validation check on 'start date' and 'end date'. The custom validator checks to make sure start date does not exceed 'end date'. There is also a 'required' validator attached to 'end date'. When I click on the header to go to step 2 all the other controls show that they are empty except for 'end date'. I suppose I wanted to start troubleshooting at the most basic level. My initial question is: does 'linear' mode also trigger the display of errors when they are attached to a custom ErrorSateMatcher? In my real world app clicking on the 'next' button behaves the same way. In my stackblitz the 'next' button works for some reason.\r\n\r\n#### What troubleshooting steps have you tried?\r\n\r\nBy default when clicking 'next' in the mat step component the controls are checked for validity and errors are displayed. However I have noticed that my custom controls do not display the errors even when the validity is checked. \r\n\r\n#### Reproduction\r\n\r\nhttps://stackblitz.com/edit/angular-cumv75?file=app/stepper-overview-example.html\r\n\r\n#### Environment\r\n\r\n- Angular: @angular/core@6.1.10\r\n- CDK/Material: 6.4.7\r\n- Browser(s): Chrome \r\n- Operating System (e.g. Windows, macOS, Ubuntu): Windows 10]","Url":"https://github.com/angular/components/issues/17056","RelatedDescription":"Open issue \"mat-errors that are tied to a custom ErrorStateMatcher aren't triggered when clicking next on mat-horizontal-stepper component\" (#17056)"},{"Id":"492371566","IsPullRequest":false,"CreatedAt":"2019-09-11T17:33:10","Actor":"cromefire","Number":"17055","RawContent":null,"Title":"'active' is not a valid property of <a>","State":"open","Body":"#### Reproduction\r\n\r\nStackBlitz is unusable for me\r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/cromefire/active-tab-link\r\n \r\n \r\n#### Expected Behavior\r\n\r\n```html\r\n<nav mat-tab-nav-bar>\r\n    <a mat-tab-link [active]=\"true\">Tab</a>\r\n</nav>\r\n```\r\n\r\nShould result in an active tab\r\n\r\n#### Actual Behavior\r\n\r\n```\r\nERROR in src/app/app.component.html(21,21): error TS8002: 'active' is not a valid property of <a>.\r\n```\r\n\r\n#### Environment\r\n\r\n- Angular: `9.0.0-next.5`\r\n- CDK/Material: `8.2.0`\r\n- Browser(s): N/A\r\n- Operating System (e.g. Windows, macOS, Ubuntu): `Ubuntu 18.04`\r\n","Url":"https://github.com/angular/components/issues/17055","RelatedDescription":"Open issue \"'active' is not a valid property of <a>\" (#17055)"},{"Id":"492354281","IsPullRequest":false,"CreatedAt":"2019-09-11T16:55:20","Actor":"alator21","Number":"17054","RawContent":null,"Title":"Dropzone which doesn't sort or move","State":"open","Body":"Is it possible to create something like this https://i.imgur.com/W3Vfbh9.mp4 with CDK drag/drop?\r\nI need a draggable element and a dropzone where it doesn't get sorted or move.\r\n","Url":"https://github.com/angular/components/issues/17054","RelatedDescription":"Open issue \"Dropzone which doesn't sort or move\" (#17054)"},{"Id":"492340813","IsPullRequest":false,"CreatedAt":"2019-09-11T16:29:38","Actor":"iget-master","Number":"17053","RawContent":null,"Title":"(Development) Following DEV_ENVIRONMENT.md don't work","State":"closed","Body":"### What are you trying to do?\r\n\r\nI'm trying to contribute with this package, but when setting up the environment as described on DEV_ENVIRONMENT.md, it don't work for a few reasons.\r\n\r\n1.

Choose a date with the date picker, for example 10th of September 2019. With my locale ('sv'), the selected date will be '2019-09-09T22:00:00.000Z' as presented in the page after selection.\r\n2. Manually enter a date, for example 9th of September 2019. In my test I typed in 2019-09-09 and the selected date became '2019-09-09T00:00:00.000Z'\r\n \r\n \r\n#### Expected Behavior\r\n\r\nI was expecting that I would get the same selected date no matter selection method. \r\n\r\n\r\n#### Actual Behavior\r\n\r\nSelecting a date via date picker resulted in a correct UTC-formatted date. But the manually entered date was not correct. It seems like the manually entered is expected to be entered in UTC, not in my current locale.\r\n\r\n\r\n#### Environment\r\n\r\n- Angular: 8.2.5\r\n- CDK/Material: 8.1.4\r\n- Browser(s): Firefox, Chrome\r\n- Operating System (e.g. Windows, macOS, Ubuntu): Windows\r\n","Url":"https://github.com/angular/components/issues/17045","RelatedDescription":"Closed issue \"Datepicker dates and manually entered dates differs\" (#17045)"},{"Id":"492189016","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2019-09-11T11:51:17","Actor":"devversion","Number":"17046","RawContent":null,"Title":"build: switch to release output from bazel","State":"open","Body":"","Url":"https://github.com/angular/components/pull/17046","RelatedDescription":"Open PR \"build: switch to release output from bazel\" (#17046)"},{"Id":"491988046","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2019-09-11T02:48:03","Actor":"joebnc","Number":"17044","RawContent":null,"Title":"allow enable/disable for previous/next buttons.","State":"open","Body":"","Url":"https://github.com/angular/components/pull/17044","RelatedDescription":"Open PR \"allow enable/disable for previous/next buttons.\" (#17044)"},{"Id":"491948748","IsPullRequest":false,"CreatedAt":"2019-09-10T23:47:08","Actor":"zehavibarak","Number":"17042","RawContent":null,"Title":"Mac Safari DragEvent","State":"open","Body":"#### Reproduction\r\n\r\nThe following lines cause an error on OSX/IOS Safari:\r\n`export class MyComponent{\r\n@HostListener('dragenter', ['$event'])\r\n  handleEnter(event: DragEvent) {\r\n    event.preventDefault();\r\n  }\r\n}`\r\n\r\nReceiving 'ReferenceError: Can't find variable: DragEvent'.\r\n\r\nThe line above compile add line `z8e(\"design:paramtypes\",[DragEvent])`, which cause the error.\r\n \r\n#### Environment\r\n\r\n- Angular: 8.2.5\r\n- CDK/Material: 8.2.0\r\n- Browser(s): Safari\r\n- Operating System: macOS, IOS (IPhone)\r\n","Url":"https://github.com/angular/components/issues/17042","RelatedDescription":"Open issue \"Mac Safari DragEvent\" (#17042)"},{"Id":"491933361","IsPullRequest":false,"CreatedAt":"2019-09-10T22:44:59","Actor":"robert-king","Number":"17041","RawContent":null,"Title":"mat-tab-nav-bar can break scrolling?","State":"open","Body":"#### Reproduction\r\n\r\nSteps to reproduce:\r\nunable to reproduce as the arrows dont show up even with latest package.json deps: https://stackblitz.com/edit/components-issue-djptud \r\n\r\nhowever this is how it happens reproduce:\r\non chrome, open dev-tools and set device to mobile (e.g. iphone).\r\nOn mat-tab-nav-bar, if you have too many tabs to fit, left and right arrows appear. if you hold down touch the right arrow, it goes across to the rightmost tab, after this, scrolling is broken for the entire app on every page, you cant scroll. \r\n\r\n```\r\n<nav mat-tab-nav-bar>\r\n    <a mat-tab-link\r\n       *ngFor=\"let child of childList.list; let idx=index\"\r\n       [routerLink]=\"idx\"\r\n       routerLinkActive #rla=\"routerLinkActive\"\r\n       [active]=\"rla.isActive\">\r\n      {{child.firstName}} {{child.lastName}}\r\n    </a>\r\n  </nav>\r\n```\r\n\r\nonly way i found to fix scrolling is to close the browser tab and reopen the app. (refreshing doesnt fix)\r\n \r\n- Angular: 8.2.5\r\n- CDK/Material:  8.1.4\r\n- Browser(s): chrome\r\n- Operating System (e.g. Windows, macOS, Ubuntu): mac, running iphone mode in devtools\r\n\r\n\r\n<img width=\"367\" alt=\"Screen Shot 2019-09-11 at 10 40 20 AM\" src=\"https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/793016/64655608-e1c1fd00-d480-11e9-8c80-0ab294b7eac6.png\">\r\n<img width=\"333\" alt=\"Screen Shot 2019-09-11 at 10 43 09 AM\" src=\"https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/793016/64655646-fbfbdb00-d480-11e9-8c4a-85e28ed9aba7.png\">\r\n","Url":"https://github.com/angular/components/issues/17041","RelatedDescription":"Open issue \"mat-tab-nav-bar can break scrolling?\" (#17041)"}],"ResultType":"GitHubIssue"}},"RunOn":"2019-09-13T05:30:07.798212Z","RunDurationInMilliseconds":3253}
