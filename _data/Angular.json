As far as I have found, the difference and reasoning is explained here: https://github.com/angular/angular/blob/7.2.0/packages/http/src/url_search_params.ts#L55 (By the way, some part of this comment could be migrated from this deprecated `URLSearchParams` class to its replacement `HttpParams`).\r\n\r\n> By default, `QueryEncoder` encodes keys and values of parameters using `encodeURIComponent`, and then un-encodes certain characters that are allowed to be part of the query according to IETF RFC 3986: https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc3986.\r\n>\r\n> These are the characters that are not encoded: `! $ \\' ( ) * + , ; A 9 - . _ ~ ? /`\r\n>\r\n> If the set of allowed query characters is not acceptable for a particular backend, `QueryEncoder` can be subclassed and provided as the 2nd argument to URLSearchParams.\r\n\r\nIn this issue, it is not \"a particular backend\", it is actually the angular router which does not handle well the question mark character if it is not encoded. If I override the  `encodeValue` of `HttpUrlEncodingCodec` to really use `encodeURIComponent`, the router is working as expected.\r\n\r\nPlease fix the router to support these query params in `Router.navigateByUrl`. Otherwise change the `HttpUrlEncodingCodec` to encode the question mark as well to make it consistent across the code of the framework.\r\n\r\n## üî¨ Minimal Reproduction\r\n<!--\r\nPlease create and share minimal reproduction of the issue starting with this template: https://stackblitz.com/fork/angular-issue-repro2\r\n-->\r\nhttps://stackblitz.com/edit/angular-74yems?file=src%2Fapp%2Fapp.component.ts\r\n\r\n## üåç  Your Environment\r\n\r\nhttps://stackblitz.com/edit/angular-74yems?file=package.json\r\n","Url":"https://github.com/angular/angular/issues/28154","RelatedDescription":"Open issue \"Router.navigateByUrl does not support question mark \"encoded\" by HttpUrlEncodingCodec\" (#28154)"},{"Id":"399369465","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2019-01-15T14:28:12","Actor":"pkozlowski-opensource","Number":"28152","RawContent":null,"Title":"Root cause analysis for the remaining projection tests","State":"open","Body":"_Only review 2 last commits!_.\r\n\r\nThis PR builds on top of #27849 that fixes an issue with nodes matching against CSS class selectors.\r\n\r\nThere are 2 commits in this PR:\r\n- fix that make sure that we _unlink_ nodes (`.next` property) when we re-distribute those nodes amongst different projection buckets - this fixes 3 existing tests;\r\n- a root cause analysis for the one remaining test (see commit message for more details).","Url":"https://github.com/angular/angular/pull/28152","RelatedDescription":"Open PR \"Root cause analysis for the remaining projection tests\" (#28152)"},{"Id":"399168009","IsPullRequest":false,"CreatedAt":"2019-01-15T02:59:40","Actor":"jsmarsch","Number":"28147","RawContent":null,"Title":"docs: Improve Parameters walkthrough in Fundamentals | Routing and Navigation","State":"open","Body":"Following through the instructions to build the heros app in the Fundamentals | Routing and Navigation section.

I've spent 4 days trying to figure out what the problem is, but all I can tell is that it comes from CommonModule being imported into the module. If I remove that, everything builds fine. In the real-world usage, the components are more complex, but I've been able to create an example in the following repo: https://github.com/trickeyone/angular-error-test\r\n\r\nIt consists of a single component and a single module. The example doesn't have any tests or anything, but the original project that I encountered the issue in has a demo/tests/etc. The demo builds fine. The tests run fine. It's only when I go to build the library that the error happens.\r\n\r\n### Mention any other details that might be useful\r\n<!-- Please include a link to the repo if this is related to an OSS project. -->\r\n","Url":"https://github.com/angular/angular-cli/issues/13440","RelatedDescription":"Closed issue \"Including CommonModule causes build to break\" (#13440)"},{"Id":"398794858","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2019-01-14T22:18:34","Actor":"alan-agius4","Number":"13432","RawContent":null,"Title":"build: update `webpack` and `postcss`","State":"closed","Body":"Update `webpack` to `4.28.4` and `postcss` to `7.0.11`","Url":"https://github.com/angular/angular-cli/pull/13432","RelatedDescription":"Closed or merged PR \"build: update `webpack` and `postcss`\" (#13432)"},{"Id":"399070296","IsPullRequest":false,"CreatedAt":"2019-01-14T21:25:52","Actor":"kolkov","Number":"13438","RawContent":null,"Title":"Automagic reload for clients after deploy with Angular Cli","State":"closed","Body":"Hi!\r\nAccording this article [Automagic reload for clients after deploy with Angular 4](https://blog.nodeswat.com/automagic-reload-for-clients-after-deploy-with-angular-4-8440c9fdd96c) mayby more good solution that `angular cli` create `version.json` file for us automatic when new version was builded?\r\nThanks!","Url":"https://github.com/angular/angular-cli/issues/13438","RelatedDescription":"Closed issue \"Automagic reload for clients after deploy with Angular Cli\" (#13438)"},{"Id":"398775092","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2019-01-14T19:08:21","Actor":"alan-agius4","Number":"13431","RawContent":null,"Title":"fix(@angular-devkit/build-angular): `vendorSourceMap` not being recognized w‚Ä¶","State":"closed","Body":"‚Ä¶hen passed directly\r\n\r\nFixes #13414","Url":"https://github.com/angular/angular-cli/pull/13431","RelatedDescription":"Closed or merged PR \"fix(@angular-devkit/build-angular): `vendorSourceMap` not being recognized w‚Ä¶\" (#13431)"},{"Id":"398766310","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2019-01-14T19:07:50","Actor":"alan-agius4","Number":"13430","RawContent":null,"Title":"fix(@angular-devkit/build-angular): only show production warning when‚Ä¶","State":"closed","Body":"‚Ä¶ having either styles on scripts optimization turn on\r\n\r\nFixes #13415","Url":"https://github.com/angular/angular-cli/pull/13430","RelatedDescription":"Closed or merged PR \"fix(@angular-devkit/build-angular): only show production warning when‚Ä¶\" (#13430)"},{"Id":"398670204","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2019-01-14T19:06:56","Actor":"cexbrayat","Number":"13427","RawContent":null,"Title":"feat(@schematics/angular): activate recommended tslint rules","State":"closed","Body":"PR https://github.com/angular/angular-cli/pull/13213 made `tslint.json` extend `tslint:recommended`.\r\nAs a first step, we deactivated explicitely all rules that were in the recommended set but were not in the old `tslint.json` file to keep the exact same configuration.\r\n\r\nThis PR activates a few of the recommended rules that were explicitely deactiviated, making te confoguration closer to the recommended one, and shorter.

It is a glob/pattern that specifies which specs should be included in the build. \r\n\r\nCommand:\r\n `ng test --spec=app/services/auth*`\r\n\r\nWhen karma is already running, selected spec can be updated by running following command: \r\n`ng test --spec=app/login* --spec-update`\r\n\r\nFew rules are applied to the pattern to make certain things possible:\r\n* `.spec.ts` is added automatically if missing (less typing)\r\n* if it ends with `*.ts` and doesn't have `.spec.ts`, extension will be replaced with `.spec.ts`\r\n* if path starts at root, source root directory will be trimmed. So that you could use relative file path from editor to make custom tasks to run the command\r\n\r\n\r\nBehind the scenes a new `test.generated.ts` is saved next to original `test.ts` which instead of using `require.context` imports all matching files. This gives quite a big boost in the project at work (at least 10s on each iterative build!)\r\n\r\nFixes #3603\r\n\r\nMotivation: It is a pain in a big application to wait until entire app is rebuilt just to run single `fit` block. Takes almost a minute with 4000+ tests and barely works when code coverage is enabled. \r\n\r\nMissing: docs(?)\r\n\r\nExample tasks for vscode:\r\n````\r\n{\r\n  // See https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkId=733558\r\n  // for the documentation about the tasks.json format\r\n  \"version\": \"2.0.0\",\r\n  \"tasks\": [\r\n    {\r\n      \"type\": \"shell\",\r\n      \"label\": \"test selected spec\",\r\n      \"command\": \"node_modules/.bin/ng\",\r\n      \"args\": [\r\n        \"test\",\r\n        \"--spec\",\r\n        \"${relativeFile}\"\r\n      ],\r\n      \"problemMatcher\": []\r\n    },\r\n    {\r\n      \"type\": \"shell\",\r\n      \"label\": \"switch selected spec\",\r\n      \"command\": \"node_modules/.bin/ng\",\r\n      \"args\": [\r\n        \"test\",\r\n        \"--spec\",\r\n        \"${relativeFile}\",\r\n        \"--spec-update\"\r\n      ],\r\n      \"problemMatcher\": [],\r\n      \"isBackground\": true\r\n    }\r\n  ]\r\n}\r\n````\r\n\r\nPS.

It's an easy step to forget when someone adds a new component, or renames them, or moves them to a different subdirectory. Using index.ts files you can get them all exported to a top-level directory, and then iterate over the import to get them all added to your module. This works fine for development but when I run a prod build it thinks I've never imported the components, even though they clearly are. As near as I can tell the only reason for this is that the names don't show up as an explicit import in the file itself.\r\n\r\nI've done some console logging and confirmed that the output of this method is identical to if I just statically add them to the declarations array. There are no stray elements getting in, and every component is listed. \r\n\r\nI assume I'm missing some understanding of how the aot compilation handles index files and how that impacts this approach.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Mention any other details that might be useful\r\nThis approach only seems to fail for components inside prod/aot builds. For non-prod/aot builds it works fine, for adding services to the module's providers it works, for importing ngrx effects it works. \r\n","Url":"https://github.com/angular/angular-cli/issues/13416","RelatedDescription":"Closed issue \"Dynamic component imports/declarations in prod builds\" (#13416)"}],"ResultType":"GitHubIssue"},"material2-Issues":{"Issues":[{"Id":"399566855","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2019-01-16T03:41:39","Actor":"crisbeto","Number":"14844","RawContent":null,"Title":"chore(tabs): update api goldens","State":"closed","Body":"Fixes the tabs API goldens not being up to date.
