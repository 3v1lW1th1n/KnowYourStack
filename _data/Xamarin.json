The list view creates new cells but keeps a reference to cells that are no longer needed, thus creating a memory leak.\r\nIn our production case, this causes an app to crash with OOM after 3 days of intensive use.\r\n\r\nThe code that ultimately needs to run to remove the owning reference from the list to the cell is https://github.com/xamarin/Xamarin.Forms/blob/471e9f81250e777fe194a764270bfda70a1e4dfe/Xamarin.Forms.Core/Cells/Cell.cs#L183-L187 - event handlers on `RealParent` must be unsubscribed at some point.\r\n\r\nThe creation stack trace dotMemory shows for the retaining event handlers is `SetCell()` at (https://github.com/xamarin/Xamarin.Forms/blob/471e9f81250e777fe194a764270bfda70a1e4dfe/Xamarin.Forms.Platform.UAP/CellControl.cs#L334-L336) being called via `MeasureOverride()`.\r\n\r\nThe issue can be reproduced by creating a ListView using ViewCell in data templates. See linked issues for repro projects.\r\n\r\nCurrently, a workaround is possible by subclassing the cell and nulling the `.Parent` property on disappearing: https://gist.github.com/dasMulli/64d0e3627ea2e982f56b5ca8209a681f\r\n\r\n### Issues Resolved ### \r\n\r\n- fixes #3065\r\n- fixes #3339\r\n\r\nMay also help #5451 though part of this may be a duplicate of the above.\r\n\r\n### API Changes ###\r\n \r\n None\r\n\r\n### Platforms Affected ### \r\n\r\n- UWP\r\n\r\n### Behavioral/Visual Changes ###\r\n<!-- Describe any changes that may change how a user's app behaves or appears when upgrading to this version of the codebase. -->\r\n\r\nWhen a view is disappearing (after OnDisappearing event), it's Parent property will no longer reference the parent list and the cell may be garbage collected.\r\n\r\n### Before/After Screenshots ### \r\n\r\nNot applicable\r\n\r\n### Testing Procedure ###\r\n\r\nTested the change using our application and the included gallery application. Please let me know other needed tests (!).\r\n\r\nThe testing for the memory issue was performed using dotMemory by creating a ListView binding to an observable collection of pseudo elements, using a ViewCell with a Label as template. After a bit of rapid scrolling around, the number of ViewCells after a forced GC was in excess (>480) of the number of collection items (70). After the change, only around 30 view cells stayed in memory after GC (depending on the window size).\r\n\r\n### PR Checklist ###\r\n\r\n- [ ] Has automated tests : ⚠️ no I do not know how to properly test this change\r\n- [x] Rebased on top of the target branch at time of PR\r\n- [x] Changes adhere to coding standard: ⚠️ please correct me if this change does not adhere to the coding standard\r\n\r\n⚠️ First time contributor to Xamarin.Forms, please review with care.
