The default vue-cli setup creates several supporting .vue scripts. For instance, open the Chrome devtools and ctrl p for \"App.vue\" in a new project. The top entry is the correct Vue file, the others aren't.\r\n\r\n![](https://memes.peet.io/img/Screen%20Shot%202020-01-17%20at%2011.47.46%20AM.png)\r\n\r\nFrom the VS Code perspective, the user might ask us to set a breakpoint in a Vue file. We know which file the breakpoint is attached to on disk, and we need to figure out which loaded file that breakpoint gets mapped to. However, because all these paths are quite similar and all (in the context of a generic web app) possibly the file we want, we end up putting the breakpoint in the wrong file and breaking in the incorrect place. And often the supporting scripts evaluate before the 'real' script does, so we can't, for example, wait and pick the best match from the possible candidates.\r\n\r\n### What does the proposed API look like?\r\nThe simplest solution would be to prefix the supporting files with some path like `__vue__`, or something along those lines. This would prevent the paths from incorrectly mapping to files that exist on disk.\r\n\r\n<!-- generated by vue-issues.

Unfortunately, I can’t even suggest how this bug is related to the instantiation of a new vue, maybe this is a coincidence\r\n\r\nI think this can be fixed by adding \"e.target.contains (e.currentTarget)\" to the conditions specified in https://github.com/vuejs/vue/blob/dev/dist/vue.esm.js#L7549 but I don’t know if this will not affect performance\r\n\r\n<!-- generated by vue-issues.

I've found the exact lines in vue-router source code where it rejects with `undefined`.\r\n\r\n### What is expected?\r\nPromise rejections contain error object or do not reject.\r\n\r\n### What is actually happening?\r\nConsole is flooded with \"Non-Error promise rejection captured with value: undefined\". We receive huge amount of Sentry issues automatically caught as `UnhandledRejection`\r\n\r\n---\r\nThe `History.confirmTransition` method calls the function `abort()` (stack trace shows this exact line https://github.com/vuejs/vue-router/blob/fc42d9cf8e1d381b885c9af37003198dce6f1161/src/history/base.js#L163 ) which in turn calls `onAbort(err)` (stack trace shows this exact line https://github.com/vuejs/vue-router/blob/fc42d9cf8e1d381b885c9af37003198dce6f1161/src/history/base.js#L117 ) within the `transitionTo` method (stack trace shows this exact line: https://github.com/vuejs/vue-router/blob/fc42d9cf8e1d381b885c9af37003198dce6f1161/src/history/base.js#L88 )\r\n\r\n The `onAbort` then calls `reject(err)` (as Promise rejection), but the `err` is undefined (because `abort()`).\r\n\r\nI assume, that the rejection should never happen.\r\n\r\nTo my very limited knowledge this line:\r\n```js\r\nonAbort && onAbort(err)\r\n```\r\nshould be replaced with this:\r\n```js\r\nerr && onAbort && onAbort(err)\r\n```\r\n\r\n<!-- generated by vue-issues.
