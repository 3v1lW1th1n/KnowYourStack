B targets multiple frameworks and includes `C` as a private dependency. `C.dll` is not versioned at the nuget nor assembly level.\n\nHere is what `B.csproj` looks like:\n\n```xml\n  <PropertyGroup>\n    <TargetFrameworks>netstandard2.0;net461;netcoreapp2.2</TargetFrameworks>\n    <TargetsForTfmSpecificBuildOutput>$(TargetsForTfmSpecificBuildOutput);IncludeP2PAssets</TargetsForTfmSpecificBuildOutput>\n  </PropertyGroup>\n\n<ProjectReference Include=\"..\\C\\C.csproj\" PrivateAssets=\"All\" />\n\n<Target Name=\"IncludeP2PAssets\">\n    <ItemGroup>\n      <BuildOutputInPackage Include=\"$(OutputPath)C.dll\" />\n    </ItemGroup>\n  </Target>\n```\n\nIn the web application project (`A`) we installed `B` using the newer `PackageReference` format even though it's in an older csproj format:\n\n```xml\n<?xml version=\"1.0\" encoding=\"utf-8\"?>\n<Project ToolsVersion=\"12.0\" DefaultTargets=\"Build\" xmlns=\"http://schemas.microsoft.com/developer/msbuild/2003\">\n   <!-- other old csproj format stuff skipped -->\n  <PropertyGroup>\n    <RestoreProjectStyle>PackageReference</RestoreProjectStyle>\n    <SkipValidatePackageReferences>true</SkipValidatePackageReferences>\n    <RuntimeIdentifiers>win</RuntimeIdentifiers>\n  </PropertyGroup>\n  <ItemGroup>\n    <PackageReference Include=\"B\" Version=\"1.0.0.0\" />\n   </ItemGroup>\n</Project>\n```\nOn Visual Studio 16.2.5, all references seem to be resolved correctly (proven by decompiler). The .NET Standard version of `C.dll` is published at runtime.\n\nOn Visual Studio 16.3.0, however, the .NET Framework 4.6.1 version of `C.dll` is published at runtime and it is of a very old version, leading to `MissingMethodException`. The strange thing is this doesn't have any compile-time errors, only runtime errors.\n\nCan you please fix this behavior change from 16.2.5 to 16.3.0?\n\n---\n### Original Comments\n\n#### Visual Studio Feedback System on 9/26/2019, 00:30 AM: \n\n<p>We have directed your feedback to the appropriate engineering team for further evaluation.

Try to minimize how much signing work we do in the process.\r\n\r\n### Implement `dotnet verify`\r\nHot on the tail of signature verification will be the `dotnet verify` command, which should be released pretty soon after overall verification ships. As part of this task, we should do design work on **both** `dotnet verify` and `dotnet sign` to make sure the commands have a good, complementary UX, even though we won't be shipping `dotnet sign` yet.\r\n\r\n### Implement `dotnet sign`\r\nThis is the final, big epic that will involve re-enabling all the signing tests and making sure they all pass. Again, the tests should stop relying on calling verification code and should simply be checks against static, pre-generated signed data."},{"Id":"11326634768","Type":"IssuesEvent","CreatedAt":"2020-01-21T18:05:48","Actor":"kartheekp-ms","Repository":"NuGet/Home","Organization":"NuGet","RawContent":null,"RelatedAction":"closed","RelatedUrl":"https://github.com/NuGet/Home/issues/9054","RelatedDescription":"Closed issue \"Insertion of 5.5.0-preview2.6382\" (#9054) at NuGet/Home","RelatedBody":"* [x] VS for insertion into rel/d16.5 branch https://devdiv.visualstudio.com/DevDiv/_git/VS/pullrequest/223075\r\n* [x] VS for insertion into master branchhttps://devdiv.visualstudio.com/DevDiv/_git/VS/pullrequest/223078\r\n* [ ] dotnet CLI"},{"Id":"11326444045","Type":"IssuesEvent","CreatedAt":"2020-01-21T17:41:20","Actor":"zivkan","Repository":"NuGet/Home","Organization":"NuGet","RawContent":null,"RelatedAction":"opened","RelatedUrl":"https://github.com/NuGet/Home/issues/9075","RelatedDescription":"Opened issue \"Undo dotnet-install workaround\" (#9075) at NuGet/Home","RelatedBody":"`dotnet-install.ps1` was failing on CI because the script does not work with the zip file it downloaded and extracted.
