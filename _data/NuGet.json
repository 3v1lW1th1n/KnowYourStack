If the DEBUG version of the project has NOT been built, then the above message is returned. As in why, when trying to pack a RELEASE version of the project, is MSBuild looking for a DEBUG .dll to scan and for that matter, why is MSBuild involved at all? I didn't request a build here (THERE IS NO \"-Build\" in the command line), just a pack of what should be an already-existing (and it does) RELEASE .dll.\r\n\r\n2. If the DEBUG version DOES exists, I get the following from the same exact command line:\r\nNuGet Version: 4.6.2.5055\r\nAttempting to build package from 'Cmn.csproj'.\r\nMSBuild auto-detection: using msbuild version '15.7.179.6572' from 'C:\\Program Files (x86)\\Microsoft Visual Studio\\2017\\Enterprise\\MSBuild\\15.0\\bin'.

Don't know why. Is this where the mysterious \"BasePath\" option might help? I wouldn't know because the definition and explanation given by both the application and the documentation are worse then useless - they don't TELL me anything. Just for kicks, I added a complete path to the release directory of the project, same error.\r\n\r\nAgain, why is MSBuild involved here at all as I did not request a build and why is the DEBUG version being referenced? I can tell because my AssemblyInfo.cs linked file (see below) has the debug information version extension \"FredWasHere\" as a version suffix, but again, I'm ASKING FOR A RELEASE pack, NOT a DEBUG!\r\n\r\nAnd...why is the pack command looking in the \\bin\\Debug folder?!\r\n\r\nHere is the content of my AssemblyInfo.cs and following, the SolutionAssemblyInfo.cs linked files:\r\n\r\nThis error occurs regardless of the existence of a corresponding .nuspec file.\r\n\r\n--AssemblyInfo.cs:\r\n\r\nusing System.Reflection;\r\nusing System.Runtime.InteropServices;\r\n\r\n// General Information about an assembly is controlled through the following\r\n// set of attributes.

One will notice, however, that even this script is invoked only in Release mode. Nothing should happen in Debug mode. But the problem persists if the resulting command line is called straight from a command prompt. Makes no difference if spawned from within the handler or from the command line, nuget.exe still does not do what I need it to do.\r\n\r\nI'm really hoping that it's something dumb that I have/have not done and that the fix is an easy one. But, given what I've seen in the documentation, it won't be.\r\n\r\nJust as a final note, this is a show-stopper for me. I cannot progress with my development until this is fixed. I have a library with some 88+ packages that all need to live in NuGet.Servers for the rest of the Supreme Court to access for development, plus a gadget that needs to go into production in a month for advanced db development that I now cannot work on.

Until we are able to scale to handle the large submission rate, in the short-term, we plan to reduce the rate limits for package pushes or deletes (unlist) per user.\r\n\r\nThe current [documented rate limits](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/nuget/api/rate-limits#package-push-and-unlist) will be updated to the following new limits once implemented. This change will go live, **soon** (within a week or two):\r\n\r\n## Package Push and Unlist\r\n\r\n| API | Limit Type | Limit Value | API usecase | \r\n|:---|:---|:---|:--- |\r\n**PUT** `/api/v2/package` | API Key | ~~100 / minute~~ **250 / hour** | Upload a new NuGet package (version) via v2 push endpoint \r\n**DELETE** `/api/v2/package/{id}/{version}` | API Key | ~~100 / minute~~ **50 / hour** | Unlist a NuGet package (version) via v2 endpoint \r\n"},{"Id":"7609421920","Type":"IssuesEvent","CreatedAt":"2018-05-01T00:22:40","Actor":"anangaur","Repository":"NuGet/Announcements","Organization":"NuGet","RawContent":null,"RelatedAction":"opened","RelatedUrl":"https://github.com/NuGet/Announcements/issues/23","RelatedDescription":"Opened issue \"NuGet cross plat authentication plugin\" (#23) at NuGet/Announcements","RelatedBody":"The **NuGet cross plat authentication plugin** feature spec is ready for **review**:\r\n\r\n|Spec wiki|Discussion issue|\r\n|----------|------------------|\r\n|[NuGet cross plat authentication plugin ](https://github.com/NuGet/Home/wiki/NuGet-cross-plat-authentication-plugin)|https://github.com/NuGet/NuGetGallery/issues/6486|\r\n"}],"ResultType":"GitHubEvent"},"Twitter":{"ResultType":"TwitterTimeline","Tweets":[{"Id":"991449575062843392","CreatedAt":"2018-05-01T22:49:33+00:00","UserScreenname":"nuget","Text":"https://t.co/TH03e5wc8Z is now a part of the .NET Foundation -&gt; https://t.co/baw4tKizWE","Source":"<a href=\"http://twitter.com\" rel=\"nofollow\">Twitter Web Client</a>","RetweetCount":41,"FavoriteCount":14,"RawContent":null},{"Id":"986337261858902016","CreatedAt":"2018-04-17T20:15:03+00:00","UserScreenname":"nuget","Text":"https://t.co/F9kiKfdOWi is experiencing connectivity issues from Europe.
