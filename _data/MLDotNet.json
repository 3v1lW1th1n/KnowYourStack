{"Data":{"GitHub":{"Issues":[{"Id":"411305306","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2019-02-18T05:15:43","Actor":"stephentoub","Number":"2595","RawContent":null,"Title":"Use custom BlockingQueue to significantly improve F5 perf with SDCA without caching","State":"open","Body":"When the StochasticDualCoordinateAscent trainer is used without AppendCacheCheckpoint, the algorithm makes many, many passes over the input data.  Each of these passes currently results in a LineReader getting created, which in turns spins up a variety of constructs that incur overhead.  That’s something to be addressed in the TextLoader design in general, but the matter is made significantly worse when a debugger is attached because several of the constructs that get spun up are orders of magnitude more expensive when a debugger is involved, namely threads and exceptions.\r\n\r\nI previously put up several PRs to help defray these costs:\r\n- https://github.com/dotnet/machinelearning/pull/2152 has been merged and removed a bunch of threads getting created in this situation\r\n- https://github.com/dotnet/machinelearning/pull/2138 has been merged and removed a bunch of exceptions getting thrown\r\n- https://github.com/dotnet/machinelearning/pull/2579 is still pending and further removes additional exceptions\r\n\r\nThese changes, in particular the first two, helped to take the Iris multi-class classification demo (without using AppendCacheCheckpoint(mlContext)) from appx “forever” when the debugger was attached to ~230 seconds on my machine.\r\n\r\nHowever, even after these changes there are still many exceptions getting thrown in this situation.  Whereas those mentioned PRs helped to remove overheads directly incurred by the ML libraries, there’s a significant source of exceptions that’s coming indirectly, via use of BlockingCollection, due to a mismatch between how it’s implemented and how it’s being used in TextLoader in ML.NET.  BlockingCollection was implemented under the assumption that you don’t frequently create and destroy them; as such, its CompleteAdding method was implemented on top of cancellation, such that if CompleteAdding is called while one or more threads are blocked waiting for data to arrive, internally there will be an OperationCanceledException thrown and subsequently eaten by those threads (https://github.com/dotnet/corefx/issues/34602).  When there’s just a few of these, it’s not ideal but also not problematic.  However, ML.NET’s usage in this situation is tipping the scales.  In the Iris multi-class classification demo, for example, when caching isn’t used (e.g. no call to .AppendCacheCheckpoint(mlContext)), tens of thousands of TextLoaders get created, each of which creates a BlockingCollection, and each of which uses CompleteAdding to tear down communication between the single producer reading and publishing lines from the file, and the one or more consumers taking those lines.  The net result is thousands upon thousands of 1st-chance exceptions.  The Iris demo app has a training file with only ~120 lines of data, and yet even after all of the aforementioned PRs, this demo app is incurring on average on my machine on the order of ~60,000 1st-chance exceptions!\r\n\r\nThis results in numbers like the following for the Iris demo:\r\n- With debugger attached: **“Training time: 228 seconds”**\r\n- Without debugger attached:  **“Training time: 8 seconds”**\r\n\r\nThis PR addresses almost all of the remaining exceptions by replacing the usage of BlockingCollection with an alternative implementation that’s not nearly as feature rich but that doesn't rely on cancellation to implement CompleteAdding.  This implementation can be used until either TextLoader is rearchitected to avoid all of these overheads in the first place, or until this implementation issue in BlockingCollection itself is addressed.\r\n\r\nWith this PR in place, the numbers on my machine drop to the following:\r\n- With debugger attached: **“Training time: 30 seconds”**\r\n- Without debugger attached: **“Training time: 5 seconds”**\r\n\r\nThat’s an ~33% improvement when the debugger isn’t attached, but an ~7.5x improvement when the debugger is attached.\r\n\r\ncc: @CESARDELATORRE, @TomFinley, @eerhardt, @asthana86 \r\nContributes to https://github.com/dotnet/machinelearning/issues/2099","Url":"https://github.com/dotnet/machinelearning/pull/2595","RelatedDescription":"Open PR \"Use custom BlockingQueue to significantly improve F5 perf with SDCA without caching\" (#2595)"},{"Id":"411278686","IsPullRequest":false,"CreatedAt":"2019-02-18T02:43:09","Actor":"tjluyao","Number":"2594","RawContent":null,"Title":"user defined loss function","State":"open","Body":"How to declare/use user defined loss function in RegressionMetrics ?

Maybe we could start writing a flag into a \"pipeline\" model file to tell if it is supposed to be a Pipeline or not...? If we don't see that flag, then for sure the exception from `ModelLoadContext.LoadModel` above should be thrown.\r\n\r\n@TomFinley @Ivanidzo4ka - Thoughts?","Url":"https://github.com/dotnet/machinelearning/issues/2567","RelatedDescription":"Open issue \"Bad exception experience loading a model\" (#2567)"},{"Id":"410790856","IsPullRequest":false,"CreatedAt":"2019-02-15T14:21:58","Actor":"DevLob-zz","Number":"2566","RawContent":null,"Title":"Exception on create predictor on release ","State":"open","Body":"### System information\r\n\r\n- **OS version/distro**: Virtual Machine W10\r\n- **.NET Version (eg., dotnet --info)**: 4.6.1\r\n\r\n### Issue\r\n\r\n- **What did you do?** i call a method to generate a zip file model\r\n- **What happened?** through exception when deploy on the server but when i was on the debug mode it never crash\r\n- **What did you expect?**\r\nit should work.  is there is any missing dll \r\n\r\n\r\n### Source code / logs\r\n\r\n> Framework Version: v4.0.30319\r\nDescription: The process was terminated due to an unhandled exception.\r\nException Info: System.MissingMethodException\r\n   at Microsoft.ML.Training.TrainerUtils.CreatePredicate(Microsoft.ML.Data.RoleMappedData, Microsoft.ML.Training.CursOpt, System.Collections.Generic.IEnumerable`1<Int32>)\r\n   at Microsoft.ML.Trainers.FastTree.DataConverter+MemImpl.MakeBoundariesAndCheckLabels(Int64 ByRef, Int64 ByRef)\r\n   at Microsoft.ML.Trainers.FastTree.DataConverter+MemImpl..ctor(Microsoft.ML.Data.RoleMappedData, Microsoft.ML.IHost, Double[][], Single, Boolean, Boolean, Microsoft.ML.PredictionKind, Int32[], Boolean)\r\n   at Microsoft.ML.Trainers.FastTree.DataConverter.Create(Microsoft.ML.Data.RoleMappedData, Microsoft.ML.IHost, Int32, Single, Boolean, Boolean, Int32, Microsoft.ML.PredictionKind, Microsoft.ML.Trainers.FastTree.IParallelTraining, Int32[], Boolean)\r\n   at Microsoft.ML.Trainers.FastTree.ExamplesToFastTreeBins.FindBinsAndReturnDataset(Microsoft.ML.Data.RoleMappedData, Microsoft.ML.PredictionKind, Microsoft.ML.Trainers.FastTree.IParallelTraining, Int32[], Boolean)\r\n   at Microsoft.ML.Trainers.FastTree.FastTreeTrainerBase`3[[System.__Canon, mscorlib, Version=4.0.0.0, Culture=neutral, PublicKeyToken=b77a5c561934e089],[System.__Canon, mscorlib, Version=4.0.0.0, Culture=neutral, PublicKeyToken=b77a5c561934e089],[System.__Canon, mscorlib, Version=4.0.0.0, Culture=neutral, PublicKeyToken=b77a5c561934e089]].ConvertData(Microsoft.ML.Data.RoleMappedData)\r\n   at Microsoft.ML.Trainers.FastTree.FastTreeBinaryClassificationTrainer.TrainModelCore(Microsoft.ML.TrainContext)\r\n   at Microsoft.ML.Training.TrainerEstimatorBase`2[[System.__Canon, mscorlib, Version=4.0.0.0, Culture=neutral, PublicKeyToken=b77a5c561934e089],[System.__Canon, mscorlib, Version=4.0.0.0, Culture=neutral, PublicKeyToken=b77a5c561934e089]].TrainTransformer(Microsoft.Data.DataView.IDataView, Microsoft.Data.DataView.IDataView, Microsoft.ML.IPredictor)\r\n   at Microsoft.ML.Data.EstimatorChain`1[[System.__Canon, mscorlib, Version=4.0.0.0, Culture=neutral, PublicKeyToken=b77a5c561934e089]].Fit(Microsoft.Data.DataView.IDataView)\r\n   at CommonLookPDFAutoTagger.ML.Train.MLModelGenerator.BuildArtifactTrainEvaluateAndSaveModel(CommonLook_PDF_AutoTagger.DataLayer.MLTrainersType, System.Collections.Generic.List`1<CommonLook_PDF_AutoTagger.DataLayer.LK_MLFeatures>)\r\n   at CLAIModelGenerator.MainViewModel.Generate()\r\n\r\n\r\nPlease paste or attach the code or logs or traces that would be helpful to diagnose the issue you are reporting.\r\n","Url":"https://github.com/dotnet/machinelearning/issues/2566","RelatedDescription":"Open issue \"Exception on create predictor on release \" (#2566)"}],"ResultType":"GitHubIssue"}},"RunOn":"2019-02-18T05:30:48.3218863Z","RunDurationInMilliseconds":647}
