Therefore, it would be desirable to be able to support multiple hashes in a single identity database, and transparently re-encrypt users' passwords as they login if a more secure hash function is available.\r\n\r\nA newer hash function may mean a new algorithm (e.g. Argon2), or simply more iterations / different configuration parameters for the algorithm already in use.\r\n\r\nA possible implementation would be:\r\n\r\n1.  ASPNet the identity `UserManager` has a `PasswordHashers` property added, which is a list of `IPasswordHasher` objects in order of ascending secure-ness called `PasswordHashers`. The existing `PasswordHasher` property is changed to retrieve the last item in the list, and is made read-only, so that newly stored passwords use the latest hash function.\r\n\r\n2. The  list index of the `PasswordHasher` that was used for a particular user is stored in a property of the `TUser` object called `PasswordHashVersion` \r\n\r\n3. During the authentication process, if the password check is successful, but the `PasswordHashVersion` value indicates it was not hashed using the current hasher, re-hash the password using the current `UserManager.PasswordHasher` and update the hash and version stored in the `TUser` object.\r\n\r\nThis would mean, over time, users still using the application would have their password encryption level upgraded and it would not be stuck at the quality of hashing algorithm available in the year they signed up. Users who no longer user the application would be stuck with the older password hashes. However, administrators could query the database to report on the number of users with legacy hashes, and contact them to request they sign-in to retain their account.\r\n\r\n"},{"Id":"6736032757","Type":"IssuesEvent","CreatedAt":"2017-10-19T01:13:36","Actor":"ajcvickers","Repository":"aspnet/Identity","Organization":"aspnet","RawContent":null,"RelatedAction":"closed","RelatedUrl":"https://github.com/aspnet/Identity/issues/1290","RelatedDescription":"Closed issue \"Shadow properties are introduced while configuring Identity schema manually\" (#1290) at aspnet/Identity","RelatedBody":"I am trying to change the schema of `AspNetUserRoles` table because I have two other fields `FieldA` and `FieldB` and I want both of these fields to be primary keys.\r\n\r\nWhen I do something like this:\r\n\r\n```C#\r\n builder.Entity<ApplicationUserRole>(b =>\r\n            {\r\n                b.HasKey(r => new { r.UserId, r.RoleId, r.FieldA, r.FieldB });\r\n            });\r\n```\r\n\r\nIt configures the primary keys but doesn't remove the default Unique Constraint that is on `UserId` and `RoleId`.

The Microsoft.AspNetCore.Authentication.WsFederation 2.0.0-preview1 package is available at https://www.nuget.org/packages/Microsoft.AspNetCore.Authentication.WsFederation/. This is a standalone preview that targets netstandard2.0 and should work with existing ASP.NET Core 2.0.0 applications (.NET Core 2.0 or .NET 4.6.1). A non-preview ASP.NET Core 2.0.0 compatible package will follow once we’ve addressed your feedback.\r\n \r\nThe code is available at https://github.com/aspnet/security/tree/rel/2.0.0-ws-preview1 and issues can be filed at https://github.com/aspnet/security/issues. Please give us a 👍 from the reactions menu on the linked discussion post if you have successfully used this component and are ready for the final release.\r\n \r\nThis component is a port from Microsoft.Owin.Security.WsFederation and uses many of the same mechanics. It has also been updated to integrate with ASP.NET Core 2.0’s authentication model. See the samples below.\r\n \r\nAside from updating the usage pattern to match ASP.NET Core, there are also some functional changes to be aware of.\r\nA.\tThis component no longer checks every form post request for sign-in messages by default. Sign-in callbacks are restricted to the \"/signin-wsfed\" path by default. The CallbackPath can be changed to the application root “/” used by some auth providers if you also enable SkipUnrecognizedRequests to allow sharing that request path with other components.\r\nB.\tThis component no longer allows unsolicited logins by default. That WsFederation protocol feature is susceptible to XSRF attacks. See the AllowUnsolicitedLogins option to opt into that feature if your application requires it.\r\n\r\nSee https://github.com/aspnet/Security/issues/1473 for discussion.\r\n \r\nSamples:\r\n \r\nFor applications only using WsFederation (similar to using OpenIdConnect):\r\n \r\n        public void ConfigureServices(IServiceCollection services)\r\n        {\r\n            services.AddAuthentication(sharedOptions =>\r\n            {\r\n                sharedOptions.DefaultScheme = CookieAuthenticationDefaults.AuthenticationScheme;\r\n                sharedOptions.DefaultSignInScheme = CookieAuthenticationDefaults.AuthenticationScheme;\r\n                sharedOptions.DefaultChallengeScheme = WsFederationDefaults.AuthenticationScheme;\r\n            })\r\n            .AddWsFederation(options =>\r\n            {\r\n                options.Wtrealm = Configuration[\"wsfed:realm\"];\r\n                options.MetadataAddress = Configuration[\"wsfed:metadata\"];\r\n            })\r\n            .AddCookie();\r\n        }\r\n \r\n        public void Configure(IApplicationBuilder app)\r\n        {\r\n           app.UseAuthentication();\r\n \r\n                         // …\r\n        }\r\n \r\nFor applications using WsFederation with Identity:\r\n \r\n            services.AddAuthentication()\r\n                .AddWsFederation(options =>\r\n                {\r\n                    options.Wtrealm = Configuration[\"wsfed:realm\"];\r\n                    options.MetadataAddress = Configuration[\"wsfed:metadata\"];\r\n                });\r\n"},{"Id":"6585749309","Type":"IssuesEvent","CreatedAt":"2017-09-13T14:57:15","Actor":"davidfowl","Repository":"aspnet/Announcements","Organization":"aspnet","RawContent":null,"RelatedAction":"closed","RelatedUrl":"https://github.com/aspnet/Announcements/issues/270","RelatedDescription":"Closed issue \"Model does not serialize to the camelCase by default\" (#270) at aspnet/Announcements","RelatedBody":"I am returning a data of the IEnumerable type as a Model of View.
