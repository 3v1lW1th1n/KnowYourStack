Alpine is much smaller than Debian, which we have used for the .NET Core base image to date. There have been many requests for an Alpine image. We are pleased to make it available. Please check out [.NET Core Docker Alpine Production Sample (Preview)](https://github.com/dotnet/dotnet-docker-samples/blob/master/dotnetapp-prod-alpine-preview/README.md) to see examples of using this image.\r\n\r\nWe have added two new images:\r\n\r\n- `2.1-runtime-alpine`\r\n- `2.1-runtime-deps-alpine`\r\n\r\nAlpine support is part of the .NET Core 2.1 release. .NET Core 2.1 images are currently provided at the [microsoft/dotnet-nightly](https://hub.docker.com/r/microsoft/dotnet-nightly/) repo, including the new Alpine images. .NET Core 2.1 images will be promoted to the [microsoft/dotnet](https://hub.docker.com/r/microsoft/dotnet/) repo when .NET Core 2.1 is shipped as a Preview, expected to be early 2018.\r\n\r\n## Discussion\r\n\r\nPlease share your thoughts on this change and see what others are saying at:\r\n\r\n* [dotnet/dotnet-docker-nightly #500](https://github.com/dotnet/dotnet-docker-nightly/issues/500)\r\n\r\n## Details\r\n\r\n* [dotnet/dotnet-docker-nightly #480](https://github.com/dotnet/dotnet-docker-nightly/pull/480)\r\n* [dotnet/announcements #20](https://github.com/dotnet/announcements/issues/20)\r\n* [dotnet/dotnet-docker-samples #94](https://github.com/dotnet/dotnet-docker-samples/pull/94)\r\n\r\nThe primary goal of Alpine is very small deployments. We have been considering various design decisions to make .NET Core Alpine base images as small as possible to align with that. In this first iteration, we enabled [.NET Core 2.0 Globalization Invariant Mode](https://github.com/dotnet/announcements/issues/20) in order to reduce the default size of the image. This change reduced the image by ~30MB. You can see the reduction in size for .NET Core images relative to Debian in the following table.\r\n\r\n|2.1 Image|Debian|Alpine|\r\n|-----    |------|------|\r\n|`-deps`   |153MB (68MB compressed) |13.8 MB (6MB compressed)|\r\n|`-runtime`|222MB (96MB compressed) |82.5 (34MB compressed)|\r\n\r\nNote: The compressed size is what you will see in a [registry](https://hub.docker.com/r/microsoft/dotnet-nightly/tags/) and is the wire-size cost.\r\n\r\nWe are also considering saving more space by native-compiling fewer assemblies. .NET Core runtime assemblies are native-compiled with the [crossgen tool](https://github.com/dotnet/coreclr/blob/master/Documentation/building/crossgen.md) in the [Ready2Run format](https://github.com/dotnet/coreclr/blob/master/Documentation/botr/readytorun-overview.md). Native-compiled code delivers superior startup performance but at the cost of 2-3x larger files. We have the opportunity to compile less, skipping compiling assemblies in part or in whole. We believe that we can save at least another 10MB through compiling less without a material drop in performance. For scenarios that value size over startup or where wire cost is significant, it may be valuable to aggressively reduce the number/% of compilation.\r\n\r\nAlpine images are only available for .NET Core 2.1. At the current time, only Runtime images are available. We intend to offer SDK images at a later date.\r\n\r\nUse cases that cannot tolerate Globalization invariant mode can reset the `DOTNET_SYSTEM_GLOBALIZATION_INVARIANT` environment variable and install the ICU package. Please check out [.NET Core Docker Alpine Production Sample (Preview)](https://github.com/dotnet/dotnet-docker-samples/blob/master/dotnetapp-prod-alpine-preview/README.md) to see examples of using this image with and without Globalization Invariant Mode enabled.\r\n\r\n## Call to Action\r\n\r\nPlease test your workloads with the new Alpine image. In particular, we want to know if enabling .NET Core Globalization Invariant Mode is acceptable/appreciated.\r\n"},{"Id":"6854176970","Type":"IssuesEvent","CreatedAt":"2017-11-14T18:00:49","Actor":"blowdart","Repository":"dotnet/announcements","Organization":"dotnet","RawContent":null,"RelatedAction":"reopened","RelatedUrl":"https://github.com/dotnet/announcements/issues/44","RelatedDescription":"Reopened issue \"Microsoft Security Advisory CVE-2017-11770 : Malformed Certificate can cause Denial of Service\" (#44) at dotnet/announcements","RelatedBody":"# Microsoft Security Advisory CVE-2017-11770 \r\n## Malformed Certificate can cause Denial of Service\r\n### Executive Summary \r\n\r\nMicrosoft is releasing this security advisory to provide information about a vulnerability in the public versions of .NET Core 1.0 and 1.1, and 2.0. This advisory also provides guidance on what developers can do to update their applications correctly.\r\n\r\nMicrosoft is aware of a security vulnerability in the public version of .NET Core where a malformed certificate or other ASN.1 formatted data could lead to a denial of service via an infinite loop on Linux and macOS.\r\n\r\nSystem administrators are advised to update their .NET Core runtimes to versions 1.0.8, 1.1.5 and 2.0.1. Developers are advised to update their .NET Core SDK to version 2.0.3 or 1.1.5.\r\n### Discussion\r\n\r\nPlease use **** TODO: FILL IN ISSUE LINK *** for discussion of this advisory.\r\n\r\n### Mitigation Factors\r\n.NET Core applications running on Windows are not affected by this vulnerability. \r\n\r\n## Affected Software\r\nThe vulnerabilities affect any Microsoft .NET Core project if it uses any of affected runtime versions listed blow and is running on Linux.\r\n\r\nPlatform  | Runtime Version | Fixed runtime version\r\n----------------|----------------| -------------------------\r\nLinux | 1.0.0, 1.0.1, 1.0.2, 1.0.3, 1.0.4, 1.0.5, 1.0.7<br />1.1.0, 1.1.1, 1.1.2, 1.1.4<br />2.0.0 |  1.0.8<br />1.1.5<br />2.0.1\r\nmacOS | 1.0.0, 1.0.1, 1.0.2, 1.0.3, 1.0.4, 1.0.5, 1.0.7<br />1.1.0, 1.1.1, 1.1.2, 1.1.4 |  1.0.8<br />1.1.5\r\n\r\n### Advisory FAQ\r\n#### How do I know if I am affected?\r\n\r\nAny application running against .NET Core 1.0.7 or lower, or 1.1.2 or lower, or 2.0.0 is affected. The default version of the .NET core runtime can be listed by running `dotnet --info`, which should produce output in the form of \r\n\r\n```\r\n.NET Command Line Tools (2.0.2)\r\n\r\nProduct Information:\r\n Version:            2.0.2\r\n Commit SHA-1 hash:  a04b4bf512\r\n\r\nRuntime Environment:\r\n OS Name:     Windows\r\n OS Version:  10.0.16299\r\n OS Platform: Windows\r\n RID:         win10-x64\r\n Base Path:   C:\\Program Files\\dotnet\\sdk\\2.0.2\\\r\n\r\nMicrosoft .NET Core Shared Framework Host\r\n\r\n  Version  : 2.0.0\r\n  Build    : e8b8861ac7faf042c87a5c2f9f2d04c98b69f28d\r\n\r\n```\r\n\r\nAs this only displays the latest version of the runtime installed it may hide the fact that you have a vulnerable runtime. A complete list of runtimes can be discovered by performing a directory listing in the install root directories. By default these are\r\n\r\n| Operating System          | Location          |\r\n|---------------------------|-------------------|\r\n| macOS | /usr/local/share/dotnet/shared/Microsoft.NETCore.App/       |\r\n| Supported Linux platforms | /usr/share/dotnet/shared/Microsoft.NETCore.App/       |\r\n\r\nEach runtime version is installed in its own directory, where the directory name is the version number. If you do not have a directory for 1.0.8, 1.1.5 or 2.0.1 then any applications targeting .NET Core will be vulnerable.\r\n\r\n#### How do I fix my affected application?\r\nApplications can be fixed by installing the latest runtimes or SDKs. Typically application servers only install a runtime package, developer machines install SDKs. Installers for the runtimes can be downloaded from the [Runtime and SDK download archive](https://github.com/dotnet/core/blob/master/release-notes/download-archive.md). Version 1.1.5 will also install version 1.0.8 of the runtime.\r\n\r\nIf you have built a [self-contained application](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/core/deploying/#self-contained-deployments-scd) you must install the new runtime and SDK, recompile your application and redeploy.\r\n\r\n## Other Information\r\n### Reporting Security Issues\r\n\r\nIf you have found a potential security issue in .NET Core, please email details to secure@microsoft.com. Reports may qualify for the .NET Core Bug Bounty. Details of the .NET Core Bug Bounty including Terms and Conditions are at [https://aka.ms/corebounty](https://aka.ms/corebounty).\r\n\r\n### Support\r\nYou can ask questions about this issue on GitHub in the .NET Core or ASP.NET Core organizations. These are located at https://github.com/dotnet/ and https://github.com/aspnet/. The Announcements repo for each product (https://github.com/dotnet/Announcements and https://github.com/aspnet/Announcements) will contain this bulletin as an issue and will include a link to a discussion issue where you can ask questions.\r\n\r\n### What if the update breaks my application?\r\nAn application can be pinned to a previous version of the runtime by editing the [application.runtime.config](https://github.com/dotnet/cli/blob/ede74b6be1406ba0c086b6d5fc1a5d4eacff1f01/Documentation/specs/runtime-configuration-file.md#appnameruntimeconfigjson) file for that application and editing the framework version and setting `rollForward` to `false`. This should be treated as a temporary measure and the application updated to work with the patched versions of the framework.\r\n\r\nNote that this file is optional, you may need to create it for each application alongside the executable.\r\n\r\n### Acknowledgments\r\n\r\nThanks to Bachraty Gergely for reporting this issue.\r\n\r\n### External

There are a few things to note about this PR, though:\r\n\r\n1. _This code is totally untested at this time._ I have neither written unit tests (because I have no idea how to write unit tests for this), nor tested it informally (because I don't know how to force override the SDK bundled with MSBuild/VS). Any pointers on either of these topics will be appreciated.\r\n2. As currently written this PR does not apply heuristics to determine whether or not a `*.resx` file should have its code-behind generated. In particular, localized `*.resx` files (`*.en-US.resx`, `*.fr-FR.resx`, etc) will result in multiple identical code-behinds being generated, causing double-definition errors during compile. Any pointers on a good way to avoid this would also be appreciated.\r\n3. Currently `*.resx` code-behind files will be generated before the `Compile` target runs. I am unsure if this is the correct extensibility point for this task. Also, code-behind files will not be generated during design-time builds; the project must be manually built by the user for code-behind files to be updated. I did this because I don't know a good way to rerun the generator target immediately after these files change using only MSBuild (and not any project-system code).\r\n\r\nAgain, please don't merge this until I have worked the bugs out and written some unit tests.
