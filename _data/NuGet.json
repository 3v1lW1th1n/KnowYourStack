Until we are able to scale to handle the large submission rate, in the short-term, we plan to reduce the rate limits for package pushes or deletes (unlist) per user.\r\n\r\nThe current [documented rate limits](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/nuget/api/rate-limits#package-push-and-unlist) will be updated to the following new limits once implemented. This change will go live, **soon** (within a week or two):\r\n\r\n## Package Push and Unlist\r\n\r\n| API | Limit Type | Limit Value | API usecase | \r\n|:---|:---|:---|:--- |\r\n**PUT** `/api/v2/package` | API Key | ~~100 / minute~~ **250 / hour** | Upload a new NuGet package (version) via v2 push endpoint \r\n**DELETE** `/api/v2/package/{id}/{version}` | API Key | ~~100 / minute~~ **50 / hour** | Unlist a NuGet package (version) via v2 endpoint \r\n"},{"Id":"7609421920","Type":"IssuesEvent","CreatedAt":"2018-05-01T00:22:40","Actor":"anangaur","Repository":"NuGet/Announcements","Organization":"NuGet","RawContent":null,"RelatedAction":"opened","RelatedUrl":"https://github.com/NuGet/Announcements/issues/23","RelatedDescription":"Opened issue \"NuGet cross plat authentication plugin\" (#23) at NuGet/Announcements","RelatedBody":"The **NuGet cross plat authentication plugin** feature spec is ready for **review**:\r\n\r\n|Spec wiki|Discussion issue|\r\n|----------|------------------|\r\n|[NuGet cross plat authentication plugin ](https://github.com/NuGet/Home/wiki/NuGet-cross-plat-authentication-plugin)|https://github.com/NuGet/NuGetGallery/issues/6486|\r\n"}],"ResultType":"GitHubEvent"},"Twitter":{"ResultType":"TwitterTimeline","Tweets":[{"Id":"991449575062843392","CreatedAt":"2018-05-01T22:49:33+00:00","UserScreenname":"nuget","Text":"https://t.co/TH03e5wc8Z is now a part of the .NET Foundation -&gt; https://t.co/baw4tKizWE","Source":"<a href=\"http://twitter.com\" rel=\"nofollow\">Twitter Web Client</a>","RetweetCount":41,"FavoriteCount":14,"RawContent":null},{"Id":"986337261858902016","CreatedAt":"2018-04-17T20:15:03+00:00","UserScreenname":"nuget","Text":"https://t.co/F9kiKfdOWi is experiencing connectivity issues from Europe.
