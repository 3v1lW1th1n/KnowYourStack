However, to me it's very unfortunate, that a Blazor project is so tightly integrated into it's ASP-like infrastructure, as well as Razor templates.\n\nIt would be nice to have a stripped-down version of Blazor (something like Console App template for .NET Core) which looks like a Rust STDWEB project and allows to either create a wasm library, which can be integrated via the generated convenience .js file, or avoid everything else all together, allowing your program main function to be an entry point to the whole app, allowing access to HTML5 apis.\n\nIn my opinion, such a template will allow to greatly increase the amount of use cases for Blazor and C# as a web language all together.\n\nFurther integration with bundlers like Parcel will allow to make lightweight mixed projects possible.\n\nHowever, maybe I am missing something and there is an undocumented way of using CoreRT or Mono tools to do it.

The following code works when adding the scripts manually to index.html.\r\n\r\nEx:\r\n\r\n```\r\n// FooHandler.js\r\nfunction doFoo() { alert(\"Foo Triggered\") }\r\nexport { doFoo };\r\n```\r\n```\r\n// FooInterop.js\r\nimport { doFoo } from './FooHandler.js';\r\nwindow.myNamespace = {\r\n    foo: doFoo\r\n}\r\n```\r\n```\r\n<!-- index.html -->\r\n<script src=\"./FooInterop.js\" type=\"module\"></script>\r\n```\r\n\r\nThe problem arises when you attempt this from a Blazor Component Library. Since the `<script>` tags are automagically added to index.html, there is no way to denote that they require the `type\\module` attribute.\r\n\r\nThe following line fails because it is added by the framework and misses the required `type\\module` attribute.\r\n```\r\n<script src=\"_content/DownloadComponents/FooInterop.js\">\r\n```\r\nIn addition, any js files in the folder are also added. In the case of modules, and when using modules, they are not necessary to have.\r\n\r\n```\r\n<!-- Foo Handler is not needed because it's already imported via FooInterop -->\r\n<script src=\"_content/DownloadComponents/FooHandler.js\">\r\n<script src=\"_content/DownloadComponents/FooInterop.js\">\r\n```\r\n\r\nThis approach may be a bit forward thinking since most JS devs use some sort of bundle tool like Webpack. However, modules are now recognized by the browser, so why not embrace it?","Url":"https://github.com/aspnet/Blazor/issues/1258","RelatedDescription":"Open issue \"Allow for <script type=\"module\"... in component libraries.\" (#1258)"},{"Id":"347539957","IsPullRequest":false,"CreatedAt":"2018-08-04T00:00:12","Actor":"Lupusa87","Number":"1254","RawContent":null,"Title":"How to force component to render after parameter change","State":"closed","Body":"You can check [repo](https://github.com/Lupusa87/Issue1254) with is created for this issue\r\nAlso 1 min [video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3O3yhAPcCrM) demonstration.\r\n\r\nMy component has parameter k, based on this k value I generate component body overriding BuildRenderTree method.\r\n\r\nFor example:\r\nif k = 2 result will be:\r\n```\r\n<p>1</p>\r\n<p>2</p>\r\n```\r\n\r\nif k = 3 result will be:\r\n```\r\n<p>1</p>\r\n<p>2</p>\r\n<p>3</p>\r\n```\r\n\r\n\r\nIf I change k parameter with is binded to parent page variable, I can't get updated UI because BuildRenderTree method not fires.\r\nI have slider to change k,  new Parameter is receiving on setparameters method but rendering not gets invoked.\r\n\r\n\r\n ```\r\n    <div>\r\n        <component1 bind-k=\"@CurrValue\" />\r\n        <input type=\"range\" min=\"1\" max=\"100\"  bind=\"@CurrValue\"/>\r\n    </div>\r\n\r\n@functions\r\n{\r\n    int CurrValue = 75;\r\n}\r\n\r\n```\r\n\r\n\r\n```\r\n public class component1  : BlazorComponent\r\n    {\r\n     \r\n        [Parameter]\r\n        public int k { get;
