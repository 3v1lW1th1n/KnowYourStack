Place a `nuget.config` in a source code repository or empty folder. \r\n   \r\n    Example:\r\n\r\n   ```xml\r\n   <?xml version=\"1.0\" encoding=\"utf-8\"?>\r\n   <configuration>\r\n     <packageSources>\r\n       <clear />\r\n       <add key=\"Feed1\" value=\"http://example.com/feed1\" />\r\n     </packageSources>\r\n   </configuration>\r\n   ````\r\n\r\n2. Add the credentials for \"Feed1\" to `%APPDATA%\\NuGet\\NuGet.config`. \r\n\r\n    Example (I used `ClearTextPassword` for the example but the behavior is the same when using an encrypted password):\r\n\r\n   ```xml\r\n   <?xml version=\"1.0\" encoding=\"utf-8\"?>\r\n   <configuration>\r\n     <packageSources>\r\n       <add key=\"nuget.org\" value=\"https://api.nuget.org/v3/index.json\" protocolVersion=\"3\" />\r\n     </packageSources>\r\n     <packageSourceCredentials>\r\n       <Feed1>\r\n         <add key=\"Username\" value=\"USERNAME\" />\r\n         <add key=\"ClearTextPassword\" value=\"PASSWORD\" />\r\n       </Feed1>\r\n     </packageSourceCredentials>\r\n   </configuration>\r\n   ```\r\n\r\n3. Run `nuget restore` or `nuget install` in the repository. NuGet combines the feed url and credentials from the different config files and succeeds to download packages.\r\n4. Run `nuget sources add -name Feed2 -source http://example.com/feed1` from a directory outside the repository so NuGet does not load the repository-config file.\r\n5. Inspect `%APPDATA%\\NuGet\\NuGet.config`. As expected, the source \"Feed2\" was added.\r\n    However, the credentials for Feed1 are no longer present in the config file:\r\n\r\nExpected:\r\n\r\n```xml\r\n<?xml version=\"1.0\" encoding=\"utf-8\"?>\r\n<configuration>\r\n  <packageSources>\r\n    <add key=\"nuget.org\" value=\"https://api.nuget.org/v3/index.json\" protocolVersion=\"3\" />\r\n    <add key=\"Feed2\" value=\"http://example.com/feed2\" />\r\n  </packageSources>\r\n  <packageSourceCredentials>\r\n    <Feed1>\r\n      <add key=\"Username\" value=\"USERNAME\" />\r\n      <add key=\"ClearTextPassword\" value=\"PASSWORD\" />\r\n    </Feed1>\r\n  </packageSourceCredentials>\r\n</configuration>\r\n```\r\n\r\nActual:\r\n\r\n```xml\r\n<?xml version=\"1.0\" encoding=\"utf-8\"?>\r\n<configuration>\r\n  <packageSources>\r\n    <add key=\"nuget.org\" value=\"https://api.nuget.org/v3/index.json\" protocolVersion=\"3\" />\r\n    <add key=\"Feed2\" value=\"http://example.com/feed2\" />\r\n  </packageSources>\r\n</configuration>\r\n```"},{"Id":"8446161829","Type":"IssuesEvent","CreatedAt":"2018-10-19T00:59:58","Actor":"puhovalexey","Repository":"NuGet/Home","Organization":"NuGet","RawContent":null,"RelatedAction":"opened","RelatedUrl":"https://github.com/NuGet/Home/issues/7413","RelatedDescription":"Opened issue \"nuget restore treats url source as a local path if runtime, packages and combination of local path and url as sources are used\" (#7413) at NuGet/Home","RelatedBody":"Nuget appends nuget source url to the current work dir and treats it as a local folder instead of url when I pass runtime, packages and two sources: one local path + one url\r\n\r\nWhen I remove packages or runtime or both it starts to work\r\n\r\n--------------\r\ndotnet --info:\r\n.NET Core SDK (reflecting any global.json):\r\n Version:   2.1.403\r\n Commit:    04e15494b6\r\n\r\nRuntime Environment:\r\n OS Name:     Windows\r\n OS Version:  10.0.17134\r\n OS Platform: Windows\r\n RID:         win10-x64\r\n Base Path:   C:\\Program Files\\dotnet\\sdk\\2.1.403\\\r\n\r\nHost (useful for support):\r\n  Version: 2.1.5\r\n  Commit:  290303f510\r\n\r\n---------------\r\nRepro:\r\n1. dotnet new console\r\n2. dotnet publish -r win-x64 --packages nuget --source ./ --source https://api.nuget.org/v3/index.json\r\n\r\nError:\r\n`C:\\Program Files\\dotnet\\sdk\\2.1.403\\NuGet.targets(114,5): error : The local source 'C:\\Workspace\\test\\https:\\api.nuget.org\\v3\\index.json' doesn't exist.

They appear to be using their own NuGet.config files with proxy settings and not relying on the APPDATA NuGet.config.\r\n\r\n- Putting the proxy settings into the NuGet.config in AppData works and the restore operation can complete. However, there are other operations that fail so this can't be the resolution.\r\n\r\n\r\n## Environment data\r\n`dotnet --info` output:\r\n\r\nC:\\>dotnet --info\r\n.NET Command Line Tools (2.1.4)\r\n\r\nProduct Information:\r\n Version:            2.1.4\r\n Commit SHA-1 hash:  5e8add2190\r\n\r\nRuntime Environment:\r\n OS Name:     Windows\r\n OS Version:  6.3.9600\r\n OS Platform: Windows\r\n RID:         win81-x64\r\n Base Path:   C:\\Program Files\\dotnet\\sdk\\2.1.4\\\r\n\r\nMicrosoft .NET Core Shared Framework Host\r\n\r\n  Version  : 2.0.6\r\n  Build    : 74b1c703813c8910df5b96f304b0f2b78cdf194d\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\n\n_Copied from original issue: dotnet/cli#9587_"},{"Id":"8446009371","Type":"IssuesEvent","CreatedAt":"2018-10-19T00:05:38","Actor":"PatoBeltran","Repository":"NuGet/Home","Organization":"NuGet","RawContent":null,"RelatedAction":"closed","RelatedUrl":"https://github.com/NuGet/Home/issues/7231","RelatedDescription":"Closed issue \"msbuild restore problem on feed with apiKey\" (#7231) at NuGet/Home","RelatedBody":"Hi,\r\nwe have nuget.config with 3 feed \r\n1) nuget.org\r\n2) ravendb ci\r\n3) a private one protected with apiKey\r\nusing msbuild target restore version 15.8 installed via visual studio tools in a build machine.\r\n\r\nAs you can see from the error \r\n\r\n> error NU1101: Unable to find package Onit.OnWms.Messages.
