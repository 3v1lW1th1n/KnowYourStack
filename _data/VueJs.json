It seems that there is still a reliance on the click event in order to set the state.\r\n\r\n### What is expected?\r\nI would expect the checkbox to be checked if the `v-model` value is set to `true`, regardless of how the checkbox arrived at that state - by something else setting it to true, or by the click handler setting it.\r\n\r\n### What is actually happening?\r\nThe click binding having `.prevent` on it stops the checkbox from receiving it's checked state, even when the `v-model` value is true\r\n\r\n---\r\nThe reason why I haven't just used a setter in the computed is because the setter doesn't get given the click event, so I can determine whether or not shift was being held at the point of clicking the checkbox.\r\n\r\n<!-- generated by vue-issues.

The components simply receive the props and they are not aware they come from the URL.\r\n\r\nI think it would be useful if we could decouple the components from the router-view, just the way we decouple them from the URL.\r\nI think being able to map the router-view attributes to the desired component props is more appropriate and lets our components expose the interface they need to expose, rather than the interface imposed by the router-view.\r\n\r\nI think the right place for solving this problem is the route's function mode props.\r\n\r\n### What does the proposed API look like?\r\nThe router view passes down a couple of parameters as usual:\r\n\r\n    <router-view :param1=\"value1\" :param2=\"value2\"></router-view>\r\n\r\nThe function maps the props both from the route's URL and also the `router-view` attributes.\r\nIt can also resolve conflict names between URL parameters and view parameters and determine which parameter is more important in each case.\r\n\r\n    {\r\n      path: '/test',\r\n      component: Test,\r\n      props: (route, view) => {\r\n        return {\r\n          query: route.query.q\r\n          paramA: view.attrs.param1,\r\n          paramB: view.attrs.param2 || route.query.param2\r\n        }\r\n      }\r\n    } \r\n\r\nI have done some tests with the router's code and it seems to work fine.\r\n\r\nI would like to have some feedback from the community. It is a fairly simple change.
