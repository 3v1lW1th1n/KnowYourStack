would want the browser to be able to do for me.\r\n\r\nOne of those things is execute some stuff on the network by using the `System.Net.NetworkInformation` namespace.\r\nSo I've added the Nuget Package to the Blazor project and simply used it in the default scaffolded blazor project:\r\n```\r\n@using System.Net.NetworkInformation;\r\n@using System;\r\n\r\n\r\n@page \"/counter\"\r\n\r\n<h1>Counter</h1>\r\n\r\n<p>Current count: @currentCount</p>\r\n\r\n<button class=\"btn btn-primary\" onclick=\"@IncrementCount\">Click me</button>\r\n\r\n@functions {\r\n    int currentCount = 0;\r\n\r\n    void IncrementCount()\r\n    {\r\n        var test =  NetworkInterface.GetAllNetworkInterfaces();\r\n        System.Console.WriteLine(test);\r\n    }\r\n}\r\n```\r\nProblem is when I click the button, the next exception is thrown and I see this in the browser console:\r\n```\r\nblazor.webassembly.js:1 Uncaught (in promise) Error:

Lets say you have this sequence of components deriving from each other:\r\n\r\nModal -> DialogBox -> MyPersonalDialogBox\r\n\r\nSo DialogBox wants to put the child content of MyPersonalDialogBox inside a DIV, with a title bar on top and buttons on the bottom. Modal wants to put DialogBox's content inside himself so that he can present that content modally.\r\n\r\nObviously we can use containment instead of derivation, and have that working fine, so DialogBox USES a modal component, and my dialog box USES a DialogBox component. But ultimately that's not how OO should work. My dialog box 'is a' dialog box which 'is a' modal component, and we want to have virtual methods that can be called from baser classes up to more derived classes, and helper methods that can accept any modal component or any dialog box and so forth.\r\n\r\nBut I can't figure out how to deal with the layered child content when doing it this way.

For this, I create a component to wrap my `RenderFragment` and render it via an instance of the `BrowserRenderer`. The problem is that I cannot pass the concrete `RenderFragment` to the component rendered by the `BrowserRenderer`.

This is because (1) we're moving most of our repos into the central one, and (2) we've committed to ship the Razor Components programming model in ASP.NET Core 3.0.\r\n\r\nFor more info about what we've announced will ship in 3.0, see [this blog post](https://blogs.msdn.microsoft.com/webdev/2018/10/02/blazor-0-6-0-experimental-release-now-available/#razor-components-to-ship-with-asp-net-core-in-net-core-3-0). TLDR: server-side Blazor ships in 3.0 and gets the name \"Razor Components\", while client-side (WebAssembly) Blazor remains experimental to give more time to make the underlying runtime truly production grade.\r\n\r\n### Migration steps\r\n\r\n1. **Reorganise all the files <-- this PR**\r\n2. Rename projects/packages/namespaces\r\n3. Obtain Mono binaries from some new external package instead of hosting them here\r\n4. Actually move the code into the mondo-repo\r\n5.

It's just a vast amount of moving files, tracking down all their references to each other, and updating all those references. The output from the build system should be unchanged.\r\n\r\nThe reason I separated the \"reorganise files\" step from \"rename content\" (e.g., namespaces) is because it's the \"reorganise\" step that causes all the unreadable noise in the Git diffs. Also, the \"reorganise\" step is nearly impossible to reconcile with unrelated changes, so until this is merged, we can't make any other changes in the repo.\r\n\r\nSo, @rynowak @javiercn @pranavkm @danroth27 @mkArtakMSFT: **please don't commit any other changes to the Blazor repo until this PR is merged**.
