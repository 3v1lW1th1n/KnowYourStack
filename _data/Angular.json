It would be nice to be able to create a tree from a [glob pattern](https://docs.python.org/2/library/glob.html) url.\r\n\r\nMy use case was moving a `package.json` file from one directory to another by using a schematics \"factory\".\r\n\r\n```ts\r\nexport function movePackage( _options: Options ): Rule {\r\n  return ( _host: Tree, _context: SchematicContext ) => {\r\n    return mergeWith( apply( url( 'path/to/app/root' ), [\r\n      filter( ( path: Path ) => {\r\n        // This will visit and check EVERY file in the directory\r\n        return path === '/package.json';\r\n      } ),\r\n      move( '.', 'some/destination/path' ),\r\n    ] ) );\r\n  };\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\n```ts\r\nexport function movePackage( _options: Options ): Rule {\r\n  return ( _host: Tree, _context: SchematicContext ) => {\r\n    return mergeWith( apply( url( 'path/to/app/root/*.json' ), [\r\n      filter( ( path: Path ) => {\r\n        // This will visit only .json files in the top level of the directory\r\n        return path === '/package.json';\r\n      } ),\r\n      move( '.', 'some/destination/path' ),\r\n    ] ) );\r\n  };\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nThe difference is that you are able to pass the `url` function a glob path to build a tree only based on the files that match that pattern. Then I could filter on a subset of files, rather than having schematics look through every file, including `node_modules` just to move the file(s) I want.\r\n```diff\r\nexport function movePackage( _options: Options ): Rule {\r\n  return ( _host: Tree, _context: SchematicContext ) => {\r\n-    return mergeWith( apply( url( 'path/to/app/root' ), [\r\n+    return mergeWith( apply( url( 'path/to/app/root/*.json' ), [\r\n      filter( ( path: Path ) =>  path === '/package.json' ),\r\n      move( '.', 'some/destination/path' ),\r\n    ] ) );\r\n  };\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nCurrently, the `url` function calls the `createSourceFromUrl` method which ignores any glob path and creates a new null host tree. `createSourceFromUrl` could be refactored to return a tree of files only for a given glob path.\r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/angular/angular-cli/blob/c5de8e3b0e5c1499a0a17da0208297cd82b36095/packages/angular_devkit/schematics/src/rules/url.ts#L12-L16\r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/angular/angular-cli/blob/c5de8e3b0e5c1499a0a17da0208297cd82b36095/packages/angular_devkit/schematics/tools/file-system-engine-host-base.ts#L269-L283\r\n\r\n> Through my research of this implementation I was unable to find any other way of achieving this. If someone has an idea other than this implementation that is currently supported, I would love to be enlightened.
