This article explains why this happens and how you can fix your installation.\r\n\r\nWhen Visual Studio can't find an appropriate version of the .NET Core SDK, you'll receive an error message. This may appear in the Error pane as NETSDK1045:\r\n\r\n\"The current .NET SDK does not support targeting .NET Core 2...\"\r\n\r\nYou can check what .NET Core SDKs you have on your machine with the following command:\r\n\r\n```bash\r\ndotnet --list-sdks\r\n```\r\n\r\nUnless you have a global.json file, when you use `dotnet` from the command line, the latest .NET Core SDK is used.\r\n\r\n> [TIP!] \r\n> Open a command prompt and try to build with `dotnet build`. If the command line build works, but Visual Studio doesn't suggestions in this article may help.\r\n\r\nThe last two digits of the .NET Core SDK version numbers are in the format are a patch number, which is represented by `nn` in this article because we will continue to service them to include the latest runtimes. To find out more, vist the [Overview of how .NET Core is versioned page](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/core/versions/).\r\n\r\n## Fixes for Common Problems\r\n\r\n### Visual Studio 2017 can't target .NET Core 2.2\r\n\r\nIf you receive the error message in Visual Studio 2017:\r\n\r\n`The current .NET SDK does not support targeting .NET Core 2.2… Either target .NET Core 2.1 or lower, or use a version of the .NET SDK that supports .NET Core 2.2.`\r\n\r\nUse `dotnet --list-sdks` to ensure you have .NET Core SDK 2.2.1nn. As an example, 2.2.106 would be a valid entry.\r\n\r\nIf you downloaded the .NET Core SDK 2.2 after April 2, 2019, version 2.2.2nn (such as 2.2.203) is listed first and is the highest version available. However, Visual Studio 2017 requires 2.2.1nn (such as 2.2.106). .NET Core SDK 2.2.2nn works with Visual Studio 2019. Visual Studio 2017 and Visual Studio 2019 can be installed side by side, but this requires both .NET Core SDK 2.2.1nn and .NET Core SDK 2.2.2nn to develop .NET Core 2.2 applications.\r\n\r\nTo download .NET Core SDK 2.2.2nn, visit the [.NET downloads page](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/download/dotnet-core/2.2).\r\n\r\n### Visual Studio 2017 can't target .NET Core 2.1\r\n\r\nIf you receive this error message in Visual Studio 2017:\r\n\r\n`The current .NET SDK does not support targeting .NET Core 2.1. Either target .NET Core 2.0 or lower, or use a version of the .NET SDK that supports .NET Core 2.1.`\r\n\r\nUse `dotnet --list-sdks` to ensure you have .NET Core SDK 2.1.5nn. As an example, 2.1.505 would be a valid entry. \r\n\r\nThis problem occurs of you manually uninstall the 2.1.5nn version.\r\n\r\nThe Visual Studio 2019 installation will not remove this file and Visual Studio 2017 will continue to work side by side.\r\n\r\nTo reinstall .NET Core SDK 2.1.5nn, visit the [.NET downloads page](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/download/dotnet-core/2.1).\r\n\r\n### Visual Studio 2019 can't target .NET Core 3.0 Preview\r\n\r\nIf you receive this error message in Visual Studio 2019:\r\n\r\n`The current .NET SDK does not support targeting .NET Core 2.1. Either target .NET Core 2.0 or lower, or use a version of the .NET SDK that supports .NET Core 2.1.`\r\n\r\nUse `dotnet --list-sdks` to ensure you have .NET Core SDK 3.0.100-preview... As an example, SDK 3.0.100-preview3-010431 would be a valid entry.\r\n\r\nTo install .NET Core SDK 3.0.1nn preview, visit the [.NET downloads page](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/download/dotnet-core/3.0).\r\n\r\nIn Visual Studio, go to `Tools\\Options\\Projects and Solutions\\.NET Core` and check the box `Use Previews of the .NET Core SDK`.\r\n\r\n> [NOTE!]\r\n> This option will be moving to `Tools\\Options\\Environment` and renamed `Preview Features` in Visual Studio 2019 version 16.1 Preview 2.\r\n\r\nIf you are targeting .NET Core 3.0 preview, the [C# language version will be C# 8.0 Preview by default](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/visualstudio/releases/2019/release-notes#csharp-defaults) allowing you to use new C# features.\r\n\r\n## Understand the relationship between .NET Core SDKs and Visual Studio build tools\r\n\r\nVisual Studio has its own copies of tools like MSBuild, NuGet and the compilers. If you install the .NET Core workload, it also installs the .NET Core SDK which has versions of these tools and provides tasks and targets. These two versions are built from the same repositories, but target .NET Framework and .NET Core respectively. \r\n\r\nWhen you build a .NET Core project in Visual Studio, it uses Visual Studio's copy of MSBuild, but the tasks and targets are supplied from the selected version of the .NET Core SDK. \r\n\r\nWhen you upgrade the .NET Core SDK, you get new tasks and targets. These new tasks and targets may contain features that are not supported by older versions of MSBuild. Like all of the .NET Core SDK, MSBuild is backwards compatible. It is not forwards compatible.\r\n\r\nThis generally works well, but requires a guarantee that the tasks and targets work with the MSBuild version. To ensure this, each .NET Core SDK indicates an MSBuild version range that is used by Visual Studio to determine compatibility. Versions of the .NET Core SDK that have a higher MSBuild identifier than expected are ignored by Visual Studio. In the normal case, this simply means you use the tasks and targets that were installed with your version of Visual Studio.\r\n\r\nBecause of this, you may have many versions of the .NET Core SDK on your machine and Visual Studio still fail to find one it considers appropriate. This is compounded by a poor error message, which we cannot fully correct because it is from the old version of the .NET Core SDK on your machine. Confusion is also compounded by a complex non-linear release matrix that makes it difficult to predict the right .NET Core SDK to select. We are working to improve all this. \r\n\r\n## The Visual Studio / .NET Core SDK support matrix\r\n\r\nThe last two digits of the .NET Core SDK version number are a patch number, which are represented by a `nn` in this table. You can learn more about .NET Core SDK and .NET Core Runtime versioning at the [Overview of how .NET Core is versioned page](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/core/versions/).\r\n\r\nThe following table shows which Visual Studio versions and .NET Core SDKs are compatible and how they are acquired if you are working with Visual Studio. \r\n\r\n| .NET Core SDK | .NET Core Runtime | Compatible Visual Studio | MSBuild | Notes                                     |\r\n|---------------|-------------------|--------------------------|---------|-------------------------------------------|\r\n| 2.1.5nn       | 2.1               | 2017                     | 15      | Installed as part of VS 2017 version 15.9 |\r\n| 2.1.6nn       | 2.1               | 2019                     | 16      | Installed as part of VS 2019              |\r\n| 2.2.1nn       | 2.2               | 2017                     | 15      | Installed manually                        |\r\n| 2.2.2nn       | 2.2               | 2019                     | 16      | Installed as part of VS 2019              |\r\n| 3.0.1nn       | 3.0 (Preview)     | 2019                     | 16      | Installed manually                        |\r\n\r\nVisual Studio 2017 cannot work with .NET Core SDK 2.1.6nn or 2.2.2nn.\r\n\r\nTo find out more about removing older versions of the .NET Core Runtime and .NET Core SDK, visit the [How to remove the .NET Core Runtime and SDK page](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/core/versions/remove-runtime-sdk-versions?tabs=macos).\r\n\r\nTo download the .NET Core SDK, visit the [.NET downloads page](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/download/dotnet-core)."},{"Id":"9425046734","Type":"IssuesEvent","CreatedAt":"2019-04-11T15:16:44","Actor":"KathleenDollard","Repository":"dotnet/announcements","Organization":"dotnet","RawContent":null,"RelatedAction":"opened","RelatedUrl":"https://github.com/dotnet/announcements/issues/107","RelatedDescription":"Opened issue \"Limit DotNetCliToolReference Tools to .NET Core 2.2 and Below\" (#107) at dotnet/announcements","RelatedBody":".NET Core 3 takes the next step in the .NET Core tool strategy with local tools. As part of this process, starting in Preview 4 DotNetCliToolReference tools will be restricted to targeting .NET Core 2.2 and below. DotNetCliToolReference tools can be used in projects targeting .NET Core 3.0, but the tools themselves should target .NET Core 2.2 or below.\r\n\r\nThe suggested approach going forward is to to use [.NET Core Local Tools](need link) when you want a tool that is specific to a project or repository. At the same time we are removing the need to access local tools by the verbose `dotnet tool run <toolname>` that was present in earlier previews. You can now access local tools via `dotnet <toolname>`.\r\n\r\nDotNetCliToolReference tools have a flaw in how their dependencies are restored which can create [difficult to diagnose bugs when running these tools](https://github.com/NuGet/Home/issues/5067). This issue would occur much more frequently if targeting .NET Core 3.0 was allowed. Restricting tools to target only .NET Core 2.2 and below means existing scenarios to continue to work (as well as they previously did), regardless of the framework version targeted by the project or the current .NET Core SDK. \r\n\r\nThe new .NET Core tool strategy avoids this flaw in restore strategy and offers other benefits, like the ability to author one type of tool and install it in different ways depending on project and user needs.\r\n\r\nWe look forward to your feedback on .NET Core Local Tools, and on challenges you face moving away from DotNetCliToolReference tools.

Very efficient but somewhat lacking for some types of analysis\r\n\r\nThis issue is there to introduce a third mode which is somewhere in between the Full and Basic.\r\n\r\nThe goal of this middle ground mode is to provide everything basic profiling provides and the most important aspect of the full profiling capability which is the ability to track objects after a GC moves them.\r\n\r\nIn fact, coupled with an additional Profiler API (https://github.com/dotnet/coreclr/issues/24155), the Full GC profiling capability can be emulated by the profiler if it is so chooses at the cost of additional complexity on the profiler side.\r\n\r\nSummarily, this mode will enable the `MovedReferences2` profiler callback to be called for compacting garbage collections, but skip `SurvivedReferences2` for non-compatcing garbage collections."},{"Id":"9514345598","Type":"IssuesEvent","CreatedAt":"2019-04-25T23:57:57","Actor":"noahfalk","Repository":"dotnet/coreclr","Organization":"dotnet","RawContent":null,"RelatedAction":"reopened","RelatedUrl":"https://github.com/dotnet/coreclr/issues/24155","RelatedDescription":"Reopened

[ICorProfilerCallback::ObjectReferences](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/framework/unmanaged-api/profiling/icorprofilercallback-objectreferences-method) which is called after a GC is

In fact, with this API you could implement the aforementioned expensive callback that already exists in the profiling API. So this customization is a welcome addition to the Profiler API.\r\n\r\nThe signature would be:\r\n\r\n`GetObjectReferences(ObjectID objectId, ULONG32 cNumReferences, ULONG32 *pcNumReferences, ObjectID references[])`\r\n\r\nPassing 0 for `cNumReferences` will fill do a traversal for this object and fill up `pcNumReferences`. A subsequent call with the `cNumReferences` parameter set to the value returned in the first call (`pcNumReferences`) will expect an appropriately allocated array of `ObjectID`s to fill the data in.\r\n\r\nA point of discussion could be if field offsets should be included.

The benefit of using pre-serialized data is that we don't need to create live-objects during the resource writing phase.  This will enable us to fix https://github.com/Microsoft/msbuild/issues/2221 in a source comaptible way.\r\n\r\nMSBuild will adopt the new BinaryResourceWriter to pass through resource data from resx directly to resources, rather than reading the resx, creating live objects, and directly serializing those.\r\n\r\nThe Writer is designed in such a way that it only requires the new reader when any of the new-pass-through formats are used.  Otherwise it will write the .resources in a format that is compatible with the existing built-in ResourceReader.\r\n\r\nThe writer must target `netstandard` so that it can be used by MSBuild when building from visual studio.  The reader targets `netstandard` so that it other frameworks might benefit from this improved resource build process, but it is a secondary requirement.\r\n\r\nSince these new types are largely just an extension of the existing ResourceWriter and ResourceReader functionality I unsealed the base types and added the minimal amount of virtuals to enable this.  To benefit from the same code-sharing I made the `netstandard` implementation carry a copy of the base ResourceReader and ResourceWriter types.  I have hidden this derivation from the reference assemblies since it cannot be made universally (types are sealed in `netstandard2.0`) and it's not particularly useful as an \"is a\" relationship.\r\n\r\nI did investigate trying to implement this functionality by wrapping the existing ResourceReader/ResourceWriter types (and wrapping their format) but I couldn't do so cleanly without duplicating a resourceId to type-table map in the outer format.  This would bloat the resources considerably and add quite a lot of complexity, so I avoided it.\r\n\r\nThis is currently in draft.

invalid, i.e. using new DiagnosticSource with corefx 2.1 and 2.2 will be invalid in these cases.\r\n\r\nBy default, when a tracing system does not do special configuration that forces new format, there are not backward-compatibility issues.\r\n\r\nBut when tracing system configures Activity to break backward compatibility and force new format, causing the above issue, becomes responsible to implement backward compatibility on its own.\r\n\r\nThis means a tracing system will need to inject Request-Id header in the correct format (if it wants to preserve backward-compatibility).\r\n"},{"Id":"9514880077","Type":"IssuesEvent","CreatedAt":"2019-04-26T02:41:41","Actor":"AriNuer","Repository":"dotnet/corefx","Organization":"dotnet","RawContent":null,"RelatedAction":"opened","RelatedUrl":"https://github.com/dotnet/corefx/issues/37212","RelatedDescription":"Opened

can write code like this:\r\n````\r\nif(int.TryParse(data, out var Number)){\r\n  ...\r\n} else {\r\n Number = -1;\r\n}\r\n````\r\n\r\nHowever, this is clunky as I have to have an additional leg on my IF statement and it obfusicates that my intent is \"I want -1 to be the default value for Number\".\r\n\r\nInstead, I would like to be able to write code like this:\r\n````\r\nif(int.TryParse(data, out var Number = -1)){\r\n  ...\r\n}\r\n````\r\n\r\nIn order to accomplish that, a few changes need to be made to both C# and the CoreCLR.\r\n1.  Out parameters should be evaluated to see if it makes sense for them to be converted to ref parameters.\r\n2.  \"out var...\" should also be able to instantiate \"ref var\" parameters.\r\n\r\nWith .NET Core 3.0 actively being worked on, now would be a great time to bring in this small change that would have a great quality of life improvement.\r\n","Url":"https://github.com/dotnet/coreclr/issues/24243","RelatedDescription":"Closed issue \"Allow default values in many \"Out-Var\" scenarios\" (#24243)"},{"Id":"437201563","IsPullRequest":false,"CreatedAt":"2019-04-25T13:32:06","Actor":"RussKeldorph","Number":"24247","RawContent":null,"Title":"Official build fails restoring IBCMerge package","State":"open","Body":"  Restoring packages for F:\\workspace\\_work\\1\\s\\src\\.nuget\\optdata\\ibcmerge.csproj...\r\nF:\\workspace\\_work\\1\\s\\src\\.nuget\\optdata\\ibcmerge.csproj : error NU1101: Unable to find package microsoft.dotnet.ibcmerge.

All of that doesn't work with .NET Core. I previously mentioned this and at the time it looked like there was already work underway to make this work in 3.0, with no fixes scheduled for 2.x.  I talked about this in a [blog post here](https://weblog.west-wind.com/posts/2019/Jan/22/COM-Object-Access-and-dynamic-in-NET-Core-2x).  The original discussion I referenced that mentioned fixes for 3.0 where in https://github.com/dotnet/corefx/issues/32630.\r\n\r\nBut now we're in 3.0 Preview and it's still not working.\r\n\r\nHere's what I am doing:\r\n\r\n```cs\r\n// Get the JavaScript Ace Editor Instance\r\ndynamic doc = WebBrowser.Document;\r\n\r\n// fails\r\ndynamic window = doc.parentWindow;\r\n```\r\n\r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/1374013/56702418-9a88ca80-669f-11e9-993b-1280b5c1a050.png)\r\n\r\nReplacing the code with manual reflection does work:\r\n\r\n```\r\n// this does\r\nobject window = ReflectionUtils.GetPropertyCom(doc, \"parentWindow\");\r\n```\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n### Status\r\nThere were previous issues open on this some time ago and at the time the word was that .NET Core 3.0 was going to fix this.  It's not working on 2.x either at the time the call was won't fix for 2.x but will fix for 3.0.\r\n\r\nApparently it's not fixed in 3.0.\r\n\r\nIs there any definite word on whether this will get addressed?\r\n\r\nFor me this is pretty big blocker in this app. I have tons of interop calls, and using dynamic is a key language feature that makes this code much more manageable (and also more performant due dynamic's internal caching etc) than using Reflection. \r\n\r\nFWIW I already have an abstraction layer around the Editor/COM interop calls, but dynamic is such a core feature that it never occurred to me to abstract that further. I think if you want decent Windows Desktop support dynamic really should be working with COM objects.\r\n\r\n\r\nUsing latest .NET Core 3.0 Preview 4 SDK.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n","Url":"https://github.com/dotnet/coreclr/issues/24246","RelatedDescription":"Open issue \"Status of Dynamic against COM objects not working?\" (#24246)"}],"ResultType":"GitHubIssue"},"CLI-Issues":{"Issues":[{"Id":"437472738","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2019-04-26T02:33:09","Actor":"dotnet-maestro[bot]","Number":"11255","RawContent":null,"Title":"[release/3.0.1xx] Update dependencies from dotnet/sdk","State":"open","Body":"This pull request updates the following dependencies\r\n\r\n## From https://github.com/dotnet/sdk\r\n- **Build**: 20190425.2\r\n- **Date Produced**: 4/26/2019 2:32 AM\r\n- **Commit**: 7af4517bbcf17b000889c1077ef5976f2b6350ea\r\n- **Branch**: refs/heads/release/3.0.1xx\r\n- **Updates**:\r\n  - **Microsoft.NET.Sdk** -> 3.0.100-preview5.19225.2\r\n\r\n","Url":"https://github.com/dotnet/cli/pull/11255","RelatedDescription":"Open PR \"[release/3.0.1xx] Update dependencies from dotnet/sdk\" (#11255)"},{"Id":"437461461","IsPullRequest":false,"CreatedAt":"2019-04-26T01:32:06","Actor":"RyanHill-MSFT","Number":"11254","RawContent":null,"Title":"dotnet build doesn't produce mountable ZIP file","State":"open","Body":"## Steps to reproduce\r\nSee https://github.com/fnbk/world/blob/master/README.md.

However, after more discussion, it is believed we can simplify this split to allow more code to be shared, where applicable.\r\n\r\nWe should also take into consideration that ARM exposes their CPU feature detection in a drastically different way from x86. For example, it can only be accessed from Kernel mode; and so most OS expose a call through which you can determine which features are available. Additionally, they tend to use multiple bits for various features, rather than a single bit per ISA.\r\n\r\n### Initial Design\r\n\r\nThe initial design was such that we would have two namespaces each with their respective ISAs exposed. Intrinsics that supported all 10 initial primitive types would be exposed as generic.\r\n\r\n```csharp\r\nnamespace System.Runtime.Intrinsics.Arm.Arm32\r\n{\r\n    public static class Base\r\n    {\r\n        public static bool IsSupported { get; }\r\n\r\n        // Intrinsics that exist on all ARM32 chips\r\n    }\r\n\r\n    public static class <Isa>\r\n    {\r\n        public static bool IsSupported { get; }\r\n\r\n        // Intrinsics that exist on ARM32 chips with <Isa>\r\n    }\r\n}\r\n\r\nnamespace System.Runtime.Intrinsics.Arm.Arm64\r\n{\r\n    public static class Base\r\n    {\r\n        public static bool IsSupported { get; }\r\n\r\n        // Intrinsics that exist on all ARM64 chips\r\n    }\r\n\r\n    public static class Simd\r\n    {\r\n        public static bool IsSupported { get; }\r\n\r\n        // Intrinsics that exist on ARM64 chips with AdvSimd == 0b0000\r\n    }\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\n### Update after x86 Work\r\n\r\nWhile working on the x86 intrinsics, we made several design decisions that were later weighed and decided to be taken for Arm as well. We also decided to make a few changes to try and improve general usage.\r\n\r\nThe primary changes included moving the classes into single namespace (differentiating with a prefix), exploding the types to no longer be generic, and following a class hierarchy for hierarchical ISAs.\r\n\r\nThis was done with consideration for future expansion, that multiple architectures would be simultaneously imported, and to make a clear distinction of the ISA to underlying CPU checks for consistency.\r\n\r\n```csharp\r\nnamespace System.Runtime.Intrinsics.Arm\r\n{\r\n    public abstract class A32Base\r\n    {\r\n        public static bool IsSupported { get; }\r\n\r\n        // Intrinsics that exist on all ARM32 chips\r\n    }\r\n\r\n    public abstract class A32<Isa>\r\n    {\r\n        public static bool IsSupported { get; }\r\n\r\n        // Intrinsics that exist on ARM32 chips with <Isa>\r\n    }\r\n\r\n    public abstract class A64Base\r\n    {\r\n        public static bool IsSupported { get; }\r\n\r\n        // Intrinsics that exist on all ARM64 chips\r\n    }\r\n\r\n    public abstract class A64AdvSimd0\r\n    {\r\n        public static bool IsSupported { get; }\r\n\r\n        // Intrinsics that exist on ARM64 chips with AdvSimd == 0b0000\r\n    }\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\n### Proposed Changes\r\n\r\nHowever, after further discussion with developer's from ARM, it is believed we can improve this still.\r\nWe would again be building off changes that were made for x86 but also trying to make the APIs more user friendly and taking into account how they are commonly used today (such as in C/C++).\r\n\r\nNamely, this is taking advantage of the fact that, even though ARM64 is a redesign and distinct architecture (rather than an architectural extension like `x64` vs `x86`), it is still a logical extension in a lot of ways.\r\n\r\nFor example, ARM32 and ARM64 both support essentially the same `AdvSimd` instructions (`NEON on ARM32` and `AdvSIMD on ARM64`) and even though Arm64 may support some additional types it still supports much of the same baseline from a higher level perspective (the operations, the parameters, the return types, and the behaviors).\r\n\r\nThe ISA names could then likely be based on the \"feature names\" that ARM has given them in the C/C++ headers as they are what most users would be familiar with them as and should be largely stable for back-compat reasons: https://developer.arm.com/docs/101028/latest/5-feature-test-macros\r\n\r\n```csharp\r\nnamespace System.Runtime.Intrinsics.Arm.Arm32\r\n{\r\n    public static class ArmBase\r\n    {\r\n        public static bool IsSupported { get; }\r\n\r\n        // Intrinsics that exist on all ARM chips\r\n\r\n        public abstract class Arm32\r\n        {\r\n            public static bool IsSupported { get; }\r\n\r\n            // Intrinsics that exist on all ARM32 chips\r\n        }\r\n\r\n\r\n        public abstract class Arm64\r\n        {\r\n            public static bool IsSupported { get; }\r\n\r\n            // Intrinsics that exist on all ARM64 chips\r\n        }\r\n    }\r\n\r\n    public static class Neon\r\n    {\r\n        public static bool IsSupported { get; }\r\n\r\n        // Intrinsics that exist on ARM chips with AdvSimd baseline support\r\n\r\n        public abstract class Arm32\r\n        {\r\n            public static bool IsSupported { get; }\r\n\r\n            // Intrinsics that exist on all ARM32 chips with AdvSimd baseline support\r\n        }\r\n\r\n\r\n        public abstract class Arm64\r\n        {\r\n            public static bool IsSupported { get; }\r\n\r\n            // Intrinsics that exist on all ARM64 chips with AdvSimd baseline support\r\n        }\r\n    }\r\n}\r\n```","Url":"https://github.com/dotnet/corefx/issues/37199","RelatedDescription":"Open issue \"Change how the Arm intrinsics are exposed\" (#37199)"},{"Id":"437404083","IsPullRequest":false,"CreatedAt":"2019-04-25T21:24:24","Actor":"wtgodbe","Number":"37198","RawContent":null,"Title":"Test failure: ProcessStart_UseShellExecute_OnUnix_SuccessWhenProgramInstalled(isFolder: False)","State":"open","Body":"The test is failing on Linux with:\r\n\r\n> Assert.Equal() Failure\r\n          ↓ (pos 0)\r\nExpected: xdg-open\r\nActual:   sh\r\n          ↑ (pos 0)\r\n\r\nThere are a few related failures, such as `ProcessStart_OpenFileOnLinux_UsesSpecifiedProgramUsingArgumentList(programToOpenWith: \\\"vi\\\")`.

This isn't a proper issue because my time is limited and I'm struggling to make sense of what's happening, but I think it's better to use an issue instead of Gitter to log my findings and maybe get help.\r\n\r\nI'm working on [C# bindings for the PhysX library](https://github.com/Alan-FGR/SharpPhysX), and I have a testbed sample kinda thing which renders the debug geometry from the PhysX library, it's working fine on both .NET Framework (4.7.2) and .NET Core 2.1, and the code seems correct. However, I couldn't get that to work properly on CoreRT.\r\n\r\nAt first I thought it could be something in my pinvokes/wrappers, but after some investigation by debugging the output binary in VS, the stack traces point to the PhysX internals, most specifically some threading code (most of the time at least). At that point I've tried to make a minimal repro using only the PhysX libraries, but I simply couldn't get the problem to manifest. I then started from the other way and stripped stuff from the sample until I get something that works, that's when I noticed that for some reason the contact solving stuff in PhysX is broken, take a look at these lovely gifs :trollface::\r\nHere's the proper expected result on CoreCLR:\r\n![coreclr](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/8399299/56623789-23562680-660c-11e9-896e-c1b4dcd0d7ef.gif)\r\nHere's what happens on CoreRT:\r\n![corert](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/8399299/56623786-20f3cc80-660c-11e9-8890-0905b1785400.gif)\r\n\r\nHowever, the thing is, even though the error happens in PhysX, when I remove the other libraries (I was trying to make a minimal SSCCE), the thing works, here's a minimal code that does the same thing except the other libraries were removed (it plots the cube height to console): https://github.com/Alan-FGR/CoreRT_SharpPhysX_Debug and it works fine on CoreRT, and here's a branch of SharpPhysX with some *kinda minimal* code that doesn't work: https://github.com/Alan-FGR/SharpPhysX/tree/corert_debug, note how the code that has to do with PhysX is the same (not 1:1 but the pinvoke calls are), the project in question is the [\"dotnetCore\"](https://github.com/Alan-FGR/SharpPhysX/tree/corert_debug/dotnetCore) the code is all in the DebugRenderer though because I thought it could be the abstract impls :P...\r\n\r\nI've also tried to remove PhysX and have just the rendering (bgfx debug text and whatnot), and that works fine, **the thing only crashes when I'm using all the pinvoked libs at the same time**, what makes me think that somehow they're conflicting with each other, like maybe they're writing on each other memories or something, I don't really know... but that makes debugging very hard, especially since I'm a total n00b at debugging interop.\r\n\r\nI'm going to try and make some better repros, but in case some of you want to give it a try I think that's all you need, the native PhysX is an opensource project too (https://github.com/NVIDIAGameWorks/PhysX/tree/4.0) and the native library (LibSharpPhysX) was built against the latest 4.0.","Url":"https://github.com/dotnet/corert/issues/7341","RelatedDescription":"Closed issue \"Pinvoked libraries somehow get broken in CoreRT\"

Either target .NET Core 2.1 or lower, or use a version of the .NET SDK that supports .NET Core 2.2.`\r\n\r\nIf you downloaded the .NET Core SDK 2.2 between April 2 and April 12, 2019, the main [.NET downloads page](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/download/) included only 2.2.2nn. Starting April 12th, a new button marked \"Compatible with Visual Studio 2017\" is provided to target 2.2.1nn. If you downloaded 2.2 prior to this date, and you use Visual Studio 2017, install the compatible version.\r\n\r\n### Visual Studio 2017 can't target .NET Core 2.1\r\n\r\nIf you receive this error message in Visual Studio 2017:\r\n\r\n`The current .NET SDK does not support targeting .NET Core 2.1.

Simply reinstall it from the [.NET Core 2.1 downloads page](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/download/dotnet-core/2.1).\r\n\r\n## More information\r\n\r\nHere is the draft of an article we are preparing for .NET Core documentation:\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n## Solving Problems with .NET Core SDK Selection in Visual Studio\r\n\r\nYou may have .NET Core SDKs on your machine and still have problems with Visual Studio finding an appropriate one. This article explains why this happens and how you can fix your installation.\r\n\r\nWhen Visual Studio can't find an appropriate version of the .NET Core SDK, you'll receive an error message. This may appear in the Error pane as NETSDK1045:\r\n\r\n\"The current .NET SDK does not support targeting .NET Core 2...\"\r\n\r\nYou can check what .NET Core SDKs you have on your machine with the following command:\r\n\r\n```bash\r\ndotnet --list-sdks\r\n```\r\n\r\nUnless you have a global.json file, when you use `dotnet` from the command line, the latest .NET Core SDK is used.\r\n\r\n> [TIP!] \r\n> Open a command prompt and try to build with `dotnet build`. If the command line build works, but Visual Studio doesn't suggestions in this article may help.\r\n\r\nThe last two digits of the .NET Core SDK version numbers are in the format are a patch number, which is represented by `nn` in this article because we will continue to service them to include the latest runtimes. To find out more, vist the [Overview of how .NET Core is versioned page](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/core/versions/).\r\n\r\n## Fixes for Common Problems\r\n\r\n### Visual Studio 2017 can't target .NET Core 2.2\r\n\r\nIf you receive the error message in Visual Studio 2017:\r\n\r\n`The current .NET SDK does not support targeting .NET Core 2.2… Either target .NET Core 2.1 or lower, or use a version of the .NET SDK that supports .NET Core 2.2.`\r\n\r\nUse `dotnet --list-sdks` to ensure you have .NET Core SDK 2.2.1nn. As an example, 2.2.106 would be a valid entry.\r\n\r\nIf you downloaded the .NET Core SDK 2.2 after April 2, 2019, version 2.2.2nn (such as 2.2.203) is listed first and is the highest version available. However, Visual Studio 2017 requires 2.2.1nn (such as 2.2.106). .NET Core SDK 2.2.2nn works with Visual Studio 2019. Visual Studio 2017 and Visual Studio 2019 can be installed side by side, but this requires both .NET Core SDK 2.2.1nn and .NET Core SDK 2.2.2nn to develop .NET Core 2.2 applications.\r\n\r\nTo download .NET Core SDK 2.2.2nn, visit the [.NET downloads page](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/download/dotnet-core/2.2).\r\n\r\n### Visual Studio 2017 can't target .NET Core 2.1\r\n\r\nIf you receive this error message in Visual Studio 2017:\r\n\r\n`The current .NET SDK does not support targeting .NET Core 2.1. Either target .NET Core 2.0 or lower, or use a version of the .NET SDK that supports .NET Core 2.1.`\r\n\r\nUse `dotnet --list-sdks` to ensure you have .NET Core SDK 2.1.5nn. As an example, 2.1.505 would be a valid entry. \r\n\r\nThis problem occurs of you manually uninstall the 2.1.5nn version.\r\n\r\nThe Visual Studio 2019 installation will not remove this file and Visual Studio 2017 will continue to work side by side.\r\n\r\nTo reinstall .NET Core SDK 2.1.5nn, visit the [.NET downloads page](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/download/dotnet-core/2.1).\r\n\r\n### Visual Studio 2019 can't target .NET Core 3.0 Preview\r\n\r\nIf you receive this error message in Visual Studio 2019:\r\n\r\n`The current .NET SDK does not support targeting .NET Core 2.1. Either target .NET Core 2.0 or lower, or use a version of the .NET SDK that supports .NET Core 2.1.`\r\n\r\nUse `dotnet --list-sdks` to ensure you have .NET Core SDK 3.0.100-preview... As an example, SDK 3.0.100-preview3-010431 would be a valid entry.\r\n\r\nTo install .NET Core SDK 3.0.1nn preview, visit the [.NET downloads page](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/download/dotnet-core/3.0).\r\n\r\nIn Visual Studio, go to `Tools\\Options\\Projects and Solutions\\.NET Core` and check the box `Use Previews of the .NET Core SDK`.\r\n\r\n> [NOTE!]\r\n> This option will be moving to `Tools\\Options\\Environment` and renamed `Preview Features` in Visual Studio 2019 version 16.1 Preview 2.\r\n\r\nIf you are targeting .NET Core 3.0 preview, the [C# language version will be C# 8.0 Preview by default](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/visualstudio/releases/2019/release-notes#csharp-defaults) allowing you to use new C# features.\r\n\r\n## Understand the relationship between .NET Core SDKs and Visual Studio build tools\r\n\r\nVisual Studio has its own copies of tools like MSBuild, NuGet and the compilers. If you install the .NET Core workload, it also installs the .NET Core SDK which has versions of these tools and provides tasks and targets. These two versions are built from the same repositories, but target .NET Framework and .NET Core respectively. \r\n\r\nWhen you build a .NET Core project in Visual Studio, it uses Visual Studio's copy of MSBuild, but the tasks and targets are supplied from the selected version of the .NET Core SDK. \r\n\r\nWhen you upgrade the .NET Core SDK, you get new tasks and targets. These new tasks and targets may contain features that are not supported by older versions of MSBuild. Like all of the .NET Core SDK, MSBuild is backwards compatible. It is not forwards compatible.\r\n\r\nThis generally works well, but requires a guarantee that the tasks and targets work with the MSBuild version. To ensure this, each .NET Core SDK indicates an MSBuild version range that is used by Visual Studio to determine compatibility. Versions of the .NET Core SDK that have a higher MSBuild identifier than expected are ignored by Visual Studio. In the normal case, this simply means you use the tasks and targets that were installed with your version of Visual Studio.\r\n\r\nBecause of this, you may have many versions of the .NET Core SDK on your machine and Visual Studio still fail to find one it considers appropriate. This is compounded by a poor error message, which we cannot fully correct because it is from the old version of the .NET Core SDK on your machine. Confusion is also compounded by a complex non-linear release matrix that makes it difficult to predict the right .NET Core SDK to select. We are working to improve all this. \r\n\r\n## The Visual Studio / .NET Core SDK support matrix\r\n\r\nThe last two digits of the .NET Core SDK version number are a patch number, which are represented by a `nn` in this table. You can learn more about .NET Core SDK and .NET Core Runtime versioning at the [Overview of how .NET Core is versioned page](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/core/versions/).\r\n\r\nThe following table shows which Visual Studio versions and .NET Core SDKs are compatible and how they are acquired if you are working with Visual Studio. \r\n\r\n| .NET Core SDK | .NET Core Runtime | Compatible Visual Studio | MSBuild | Notes                                     |\r\n|---------------|-------------------|--------------------------|---------|-------------------------------------------|\r\n| 2.1.5nn       | 2.1               | 2017                     | 15      | Installed as part of VS 2017 version 15.9 |\r\n| 2.1.6nn       | 2.1               | 2019                     | 16      | Installed as part of VS 2019              |\r\n| 2.2.1nn       | 2.2               | 2017                     | 15      | Installed manually                        |\r\n| 2.2.2nn       | 2.2               | 2019                     | 16      | Installed as part of VS 2019              |\r\n| 3.0.1nn       | 3.0 (Preview)     | 2019                     | 16      | Installed manually                        |\r\n\r\nVisual Studio 2017 cannot work with .NET Core SDK 2.1.6nn or 2.2.2nn.\r\n\r\nTo find out more about removing older versions of the .NET Core Runtime and .NET Core SDK, visit the [How to remove the .NET Core Runtime and SDK page](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/core/versions/remove-runtime-sdk-versions?tabs=macos).\r\n\r\nTo download the .NET Core SDK, visit the [.NET downloads page](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/download/dotnet-core).","Url":"https://github.com/dotnet/announcements/issues/108","RelatedDescription":"Open issue \".NET Core SDK 2.2.2nn and 2.1.6nn do not work with Visual Studio 2017\" (#108)"},{"Id":"432081093","IsPullRequest":false,"CreatedAt":"2019-04-11T15:16:43","Actor":"KathleenDollard","Number":"107","RawContent":null,"Title":"Limit DotNetCliToolReference Tools to .NET Core 2.2 and Below","State":"open","Body":"# Limit DotNetCliToolReference Tools to .NET Core 2.2 and Below\r\n\r\n.NET Core 3 takes the next step in the .NET Core tool strategy with local tools.

This issue would occur much more frequently if targeting .NET Core 3.0 was allowed. Restricting tools to target only .NET Core 2.2 and below means existing scenarios to continue to work (as well as they previously did), regardless of the framework version targeted by the project or the current .NET Core SDK. \r\n\r\nThe new .NET Core tool strategy avoids this flaw in restore strategy and offers other benefits, like the ability to author one type of tool and install it in different ways depending on project and user needs.\r\n\r\nWe look forward to your feedback on .NET Core Local Tools, and on challenges you face moving away from DotNetCliToolReference tools. \r\n\r\n[dotnet/sdk #3057](https://github.com/dotnet/sdk/pull/3057)","Url":"https://github.com/dotnet/announcements/issues/107","RelatedDescription":"Open issue \"Limit DotNetCliToolReference Tools to .NET Core 2.2 and Below\" (#107)"},{"Id":"431012407","IsPullRequest":false,"CreatedAt":"2019-04-09T14:51:18","Actor":"MichaelSimons","Number":"106","RawContent":null,"Title":".NET Core SDK container images now contain the Visual Studio 2019 toolset","State":"open","Body":"# .NET Core SDK container images now contain the Visual Studio 2019 toolset\r\n\r\n.NET Core SDK container images now include Visual Studio 2019 tools.

There are two primary reasons for this change:\r\n\r\n* Syndicate Microsoft-provided container images to multiple registries, like Docker Hub and Red Hat.\r\n* Use Microsoft Azure as a global CDN for delivering Microsoft-provided container images.\r\n\r\nYou will use and see MCR as a storage back-end for Microsoft images. The primary way you learn about Microsoft container images and tags will be through a registry, which for most users will continue to be Docker Hub. Most of the experience you've had browsing for .NET Core container images will continue unchanged with this new model. The Docker Hub URLs you've used for Microsoft repos will continue to work, and forward to updated locations on Docker Hub. Existing Docker Hub will images will be maintained as-is.\r\n\r\nSee [.NET Core Container Images now Published to Microsoft Container Registry](https://devblogs.microsoft.com/dotnet/net-core-container-images-now-published-to-microsoft-container-registry/) for the most updated information on our use of MCR.\r\n\r\n## Discussion\r\nPlease share your thoughts on this change and see what others are saying at:\r\n\r\n* [dotnet-docker #935](https://github.com/dotnet/dotnet-docker/issues/935)\r\n\r\n## Starting with .NET Core nightly repo\r\n\r\nOn the .NET team, we started our [transition to MCR](https://github.com/dotnet/dotnet-docker/issues/745) with the .NET Core \"nightly\" repo. [dotnet-nightly](dockerhub.com/r/microsoft/dotnet-nightly) is now hosted on MCR and syndicated to Docker Hub. We started with the nightly repo in order to discover and fix any challenges we found with this new model before we move our higher-traffic primary container repository.\r\n\r\nWe will start publishing [dotnet](dockerhub.com/r/microsoft/dotnet) to MCR a bit later, in either February or March. This issue will be updated when that happens.\r\n\r\n## Repo Split\r\n\r\nThe [.NET Core repo](https://hub.docker.com/r/microsoft/dotnet) currently includes 4 major categories of tags: \r\n\r\n* `sdk`\r\n* `aspnetcore-runtime`\r\n* `runtime` \r\n* `runtime-deps`\r\n\r\nProviding all of the tags in one place has helped with discoverability but made for a repo with an enormous README that can be challenging to navigate and consume. It is large enough that we exceeded Docker Hub README limits and had to artificially make it smaller.\r\n\r\nGoing forward, we will provide a repo for each of the tag categories listed above. We'll also provide a \"product repo\" that will hierarchicaly group all of our repos together. This will satisfy discoverability needs so that it will be easy to find the tags you want.\r\n\r\nYou can already see this experience with [microsoft-dotnet-core-nightly](https://hub.docker.com/_/microsoft-dotnet-core-nightly). There are now multiple repos for our nightly builds:\r\n\r\n* [.NET Core Nightly product repo](https://hub.docker.com/_/microsoft-dotnet-core-nightly)\r\n* [.NET Core SDK Nightly repo](https://hub.docker.com/_/microsoft-dotnet-core-nightly-sdk/)\r\n* [.NET Core ASP.NET Core Nightly repo](https://hub.docker.com/_/microsoft-dotnet-core-nightly-aspnet/)\r\n* [.NET Core Runtime Nightly repo](https://hub.docker.com/_/microsoft-dotnet-core-nightly-runtime/)\r\n* [.NET Core Runtime-deps Nightly repo](https://hub.docker.com/_/microsoft-dotnet-core-nightly-runtime-deps/)\r\n\r\nThe same split will exist for the non-nightly stable repo (currently hosted at  [microsoft/dotnet](https://hub.docker.com/r/microsoft/dotnet)) when we start publishing it to MCR and syndicating it back to DockerHub.\r\n\r\n## Changes to registry URL\r\n\r\nThe biggest change is that your Dockerfiles need to be updated to point to the MCR registry in order get access to new .NET Core container tags. The same change is required for scripts or human operations that pull images via `docker pull`.\r\n\r\nThe following example shows the registry path, repo and tag for the .NET Core 2.2 \"Nightly\" SDK on MCR:\r\n\r\n```console\r\nmcr.microsoft.com/dotnet/core-nightly/sdk:2.2\r\n```\r\n\r\nAs comparison, the following repo and tag have been used to date for the .NET Core 2.2 \"Nightly\" SDK on Docker Hub:\r\n\r\n```console\r\nmicrosoft/dotnet-nightly:2.2-sdk\r\n```\r\n\r\nThe new repo URL is provided at each of the news repos. For example, the new .NET Core SDK \"nightly\" repo provides a box on the right where you can copy and paste the correct MCR-based repo syntax that you can use for `docker pull` or in `FROM` statements in your Dockerfiles.\r\n\r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/2608468/52811702-95c5eb80-304a-11e9-8de8-e6ea1f4b4d75.png)\r\n\r\n## Servicing existing Docker Hub tags\r\n\r\nWe will continue to service existing non-version-specific or floating tags on Docker Hub while the associated .NET Core version is supported. For example the `microsoft/dotnet:2.1-sdk` tag is a floating tag that will continue to be serviced for the lifetime of .NET Core 2.1. You can continue using floating tags without issue.\r\n\r\nIf you use non-floating tags, like `microsoft/dotnet:2.1.504-sdk-alpine`, then you will need to update your Dockerfile to use a new non-floating tag. No new non-floating tags will be published to `microsoft/dotnet` and `microsoft/dotnet-nightly` after we fully transition to MCR.\r\n\r\n.NET Core 3.0 Preview 3 and later will only be made available on MCR.\r\n\r\n## Microsoft is a Verified Publisher\r\n\r\nUntil now, Microsoft-provided container images were considered \"community images\". As part of this change, we are re-classifying Microsoft as a \"verified publisher\" on Docker Hub.

Congratulations, Alpine team! On the .NET team, we are committed to supporting new Alpine versions quickly, and also need to define a policy for older versions. This policy only applies for the container images that we publish.\r\n\r\n## Discussion\r\nPlease share your thoughts on this change and see what others are saying at:\r\n\r\n* [dotnet-docker #933](https://github.com/dotnet/dotnet-docker/issues/933)\r\n\r\n## Policy\r\n\r\nWe intend to establish the following policy for supporting Alpine with .NET Core container images:\r\n\r\n* Support new Alpine versions within 60 days of release (hopefully much less).\r\n* Support n-1 Alpine versions for 3 months after we support a new Alpine version.\r\n\r\nNote: The [.NET Core support policy](https://github.com/dotnet/core/blob/master/os-lifecycle-policy.md) may be broader. This policy is specific to the container images we produce.\r\n\r\n## Plans\r\n\r\nWe're in the process of [fixing issues required to support Alpine 3.9](https://github.com/dotnet/dotnet-docker/issues/921). We expect that these issues will be resolved in February and that we'll be able to provide support for Alpine 3.9 in March.\r\n\r\nWe will produce Alpine 3.9 images for .NET Core 2.1, 2.2 and 3.0. Assuming we publish 3.9 images in March, we'll stop producing and supporting Alpine 3.7 and 3.8 images after June (2019).\r\n\r\n## Using Alpine-based .NET Core images\r\n\r\nWe produce a variety of Alpine-based images. You can either depend on a specific Alpine version, like with `microsoft/dotnet:2.2-sdk-alpine3.8` or opt to use the latest Alpine image we have to offer, like with `microsoft/dotnet:2.2-sdk-alpine`. Either are good choices. It is just a question of whether you want to make a conscious decision to move to later Alpine releases.\r\n\r\n## Support for ARM32?\r\n\r\nWe produce Alpine images for x64 (and ARM64, shortly). The [Alpine 3.9 announcement](https://twitter.com/alpinelinux/status/1090416212822110214) made mention of support for ARM32v7. We would like to enable .NET Core [Alpine-based images on ARM32](https://github.com/gliderlabs/docker-alpine/issues/463#issuecomment-460530395). We are patiently waiting for that to happen.

To check the currently installed runtimes, open a command prompt and run the `dotnet --info` command. If you have a 2.1 or greater runtime installed, you'll see output like the following;\r\n\r\n```text\r\n.NET Core SDK (reflecting any global.json):\r\n Version:   2.2.100\r\n Commit:    b9f2fa0ca8\r\n\r\nRuntime Environment:\r\n OS Name:     Windows\r\n OS Version:  10.0.17134\r\n OS Platform: Windows\r\n RID:         win10-x64\r\n Base Path:   C:\\Program Files\\dotnet\\sdk\\2.2.100\\\r\n\r\nHost (useful for support):\r\n  Version: 2.2.0\r\n  Commit:  1249f08fed\r\n\r\n.NET Core SDKs installed:\r\n  2.1.5 [C:\\Program Files\\dotnet\\sdk]\r\n  2.1.502 [C:\\Program Files\\dotnet\\sdk]\r\n  2.2.100 [C:\\Program Files\\dotnet\\sdk]\r\n\r\n.NET Core runtimes installed:\r\n  Microsoft.AspNetCore.All 2.1.6 [C:\\Program Files\\dotnet\\shared\\Microsoft.AspNetCore.All]\r\n  Microsoft.AspNetCore.App 2.1.6 [C:\\Program Files\\dotnet\\shared\\Microsoft.AspNetCore.App]\r\n  Microsoft.AspNetCore.All 2.2.0 [C:\\Program Files\\dotnet\\shared\\Microsoft.AspNetCore.All]\r\n  Microsoft.AspNetCore.App 2.2.0 [C:\\Program Files\\dotnet\\shared\\Microsoft.AspNetCore.App]\r\n  Microsoft.NETCore.App 2.1.6 [C:\\Program Files\\dotnet\\shared\\Microsoft.NETCore.App]\r\n  Microsoft.NETCore.App 2.2.0 [C:\\Program Files\\dotnet\\shared\\Microsoft.NETCore.App]\r\n\r\nTo install additional .NET Core runtimes or SDKs:\r\n  https://aka.ms/dotnet-download\r\n```\r\n\r\nIf your host version is 2.1.x and the highest `Microsoft.NETCore.App` runtime version is less than 2.1.7, you're vulnerable to this issue.\r\nIf your host version is 2.2.x and the highest 2.1.x `Microsoft.NETCore.App` runtime version is less than 2.2.1, you're vulnerable to this issue.\r\n\r\nYou will not see SDK versions if you have only installed the runtime.\r\n\r\n#### Applications not using Microsoft.NetCore.App\r\n\r\nThe affected assembly is also available separately as a NuGet package. If you are not using Microsoft.NetCore.App, you may still be affected if you are referencing the packages listed above.\r\n\r\n##### Direct dependencies\r\n\r\nDirect dependencies are discoverable by examining your `csproj` file. They can be fixed by [editing the project file](#fixing-direct-dependencies) or using NuGet to update the dependency.\r\n\r\n##### Transitive dependencies\r\n\r\nTransitive dependencies occur when you add a package to your project that in turn relies on another package. For example, if Contoso publishes a package `Contoso.Utility` which, in turn, depends on `Contoso.Internals` and you add the `Contoso.Utility` package to your project now your project has a direct dependency on `Contoso.Utility` and, because `Contoso.Utility` depends 'Contoso.Internals', your application gains a transitive dependency on the `Contoso.Internals` package.\r\n\r\nTransitive dependencies are reviewable in two ways:\r\n\r\n* In the Visual Studio Solution Explorer window, which supports searching.\r\n* By examining the `project.assets.json` file contained in the obj directory of your project for `csproj` based projects\r\n\r\nThe `project.assets.json` files are the authoritative list of all packages used by your project, containing both direct and transitive dependencies.\r\n\r\nThere are two ways to view transitive dependencies. You can either [use Visual Studio’s Solution Explorer](#vs-solution-explorer), or you can review [the `project.assets.json` file](#project-assets-json)).\r\n\r\n##### <a name=\"vs-solution-explorer\"></a>Using Visual Studio Solution Explorer\r\n\r\nTo use Solution Explorer, open the project in Visual Studio, and then press Ctrl+; to activate the search in Solution Explorer. Search for the [vulnerable package](#affected-software) and make a note of the version numbers of any results you find.\r\n\r\nFor example, searching for `Microsoft.AspNetCore.Mvc.Core` in an example project that contains a package that takes a dependency on `Microsoft.AspNetCore.Mvc` shows the following results in Visual Studio 2017:\r\n\r\n![Screenshot of search results in Visual Studio 2017](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/796298/25858816/8ecdc2b4-3491-11e7-9363-746804bb9832.png)\r\n\r\nThe search results appear as a tree. In the previous results, you can see that a reference to `Microsoft.AspNetCore.Mvc.Core` version 1.1.2 is discovered.\r\n\r\nUnder the Dependencies node is a NuGet node. Under the NuGet node is the list of packages you have directly taken a dependency on and their versions.\r\nIn screenshot, the application takes a direct dependency on `Microsoft.AspNetCore.Mvc`. `Microsoft.AspNetCore.Mvc` in turn has leaf nodes that list its dependencies and their versions.\r\nThe `Microsoft.AspNetCore.Mvc` package takes a dependency on a version of `Microsoft.AspNetCore.Mvc.ApiExplorer`, that in turn takes a dependency on a version of `Microsoft.AspNetCore.Mvc.Core`.\r\n\r\n##### <a name=\"project-assets-json\"></a> Manually reviewing project.assets.json\r\n\r\nOpen the *project.assets.json* file from your project’s obj directory in your editor. We suggest you use an editor that understands JSON and allows you to collapse and expand nodes to review this file.\r\nVisual Studio and Visual Studio Code provide JSON friendly editing.\r\n\r\nSearch the *project.assets.json* file for the [vulnerable package](#affected-software), using the format `packagename/` for each of the package names from the preceding table. If you find the assembly name in your search:\r\n\r\n* Examine the line on which they are found, the version number is after the `/`.\r\n* Compare to the [vulnerable versions table](#affected-software).\r\n\r\nFor example, a search result that shows `System.Private.Uri/4.3.0` is a reference to version 4.3.0 of `System.Private.Uri`.\r\n\r\nIf your *project.assets.json* file includes references to the [vulnerable package](#affected-software), then you need to fix the transitive dependencies.\r\n\r\nIf you have not found any reference to any vulnerable packages, this means either\r\n\r\n* None of your direct dependencies depend on any vulnerable packages, or\r\n* You have already fixed the problem by updating the direct dependencies.\r\n\r\n### <a name=\"how-fix\"></a>How do I fix the issue?\r\n\r\n#### Updating the version of Microsoft.NETCore.App\r\n\r\nIf your host version is a 2.1.x host you must install version 2.1.8 or later of the [.NET Core 2.1 runtime](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/download/dotnet-core/2.1), or corresponding [.NET Core 2.1 SDK](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/download/dotnet-core/2.1).\r\n\r\nIf your host version is a 2.2.x you must install version 2.2.2 or later of the [.NET Core 2.2 runtime](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/download/dotnet-core/2.2), or corresponding  [.NET Core 2.2 SDK](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/download/dotnet-core/2.2).\r\n\r\n#### <a name=\"fixing-direct-dependencies\"></a>Fixing direct dependencies\r\n\r\nOpen *projectname.csproj* in your editor. If you're using Visual Studio, right-click the project and choose **Edit projectname.csproj** from the context menu, where projectname is the name of your project. Look for `PackageReference` elements. The following shows an example project file:\r\n\r\n```xml\r\n<Project Sdk=\"Microsoft.NET.Sdk.Web\">\r\n  <PropertyGroup>\r\n    <TargetFramework>netcoreapp2.1</TargetFramework>\r\n  </PropertyGroup>\r\n  <ItemGroup>\r\n    <PackageReference Include=\"System.Private.Uri\" Version=\"4.3.0\" />\r\n  </ItemGroup>\r\n</Project>\r\n```\r\n\r\nThe preceding example has a reference to the [vulnerable package](#affected-software), as seen by the single `PackageReference` element. The name of the package is in the `Include` attribute.\r\nThe package version number is in the `Version` attribute. The previous example shows a single direct dependency on `System.Private.Uri` version 4.3.0\r\n\r\nTo update the version to the secure package, change the version number to the updated package version as listed on the table [previously](#affected-software).\r\nIn this example, update `System.Private.Uri` to the appropriate [fixed package number](#affected-software) for your major version. Save the *csproj* file. The example *csproj* now looks as follows:\r\n\r\n```xml\r\n<Project Sdk=\"Microsoft.NET.Sdk.Web\">\r\n  <PropertyGroup>\r\n    <TargetFramework>netcoreapp2.1</TargetFramework>\r\n  </PropertyGroup>\r\n  <ItemGroup>\r\n    <PackageReference Include=\"System.Private.Uri\" Version=\"4.3.0\" />\r\n  </ItemGroup>\r\n</Project>\r\n```\r\n\r\nIf you're using Visual Studio and you save your updated *csproj* file, Visual Studio will restore the new package version.\r\nYou can see the restore results by opening the **Output** window (Ctrl+Alt+O) and changing the **Show output from** drop-down list to **Package Manager**.\r\n\r\nIf you're not using Visual Studio, open a command line and change to your project directory. Execute the `dotnet restore` command to restore the updated dependencies.\r\n\r\nNow recompile your application. If after recompilation you see a *Dependency conflict warning*, you must update your other direct dependencies to versions that take a dependency on the updated package.\r\n\r\n#### <a name=\"transitive-dependencies\"></a>Fixing transitive dependencies\r\n\r\nIf your transitive dependency review found references to the [vulnerable package](#affected-software), you must add a direct dependency to the updated package to your *csproj* file to override the transitive dependency.\r\n\r\nOpen *projectname.csproj* in your editor. If you're using Visual Studio, right-click the project and choose **Edit projectname.csproj** from the context menu, where projectname is the name of your project.\r\nLook for `PackageReference` nodes, for example:\r\n\r\n```xml\r\n<Project Sdk=\"Microsoft.NET.Sdk.\">\r\n  <PropertyGroup>\r\n    <TargetFramework>net461</TargetFramework>\r\n  </PropertyGroup>\r\n  <ItemGroup>\r\n    <PackageReference Include=\"ThirdParty.NotUpdatedYet\" Version=\"2.0.0\" />\r\n  </ItemGroup>\r\n</Project>\r\n```\r\n\r\nYou must add a direct dependency to the updated version of the [vulnerable package](#affected-software) by adding it to the *csproj* file.\r\nYou do this by adding a new line to the dependencies section, referencing the fixed version.\r\nFor example, if your search showed a transitive reference to a vulnerable `System.ServiceModel.Http` version, you'd add a reference to the [fixed package number](#affected-software).\r\n\r\n```xml\r\n<Project Sdk=\"Microsoft.NET.Sdk.Web\">\r\n  <PropertyGroup>\r\n    <TargetFramework>net461</TargetFramework>\r\n  </PropertyGroup>\r\n  <ItemGroup>\r\n    <PackageReference Include=\"System.Private.Uri\" Version=\"4.3.0\" />\r\n    <PackageReference Include=\"ThirdParty.NotUpdatedYet\" Version=\"2.0.0\" />\r\n  </ItemGroup>\r\n</Project>\r\n```\r\n\r\nAfter you've added the direct dependency reference, save your *csproj* file.\r\n\r\nIf you're using Visual Studio, save your updated *csproj* file and Visual Studio will restore the new package versions.\r\nYou can see the restore results by opening the **Output** window (Ctrl+Alt+O) and changing the **Show output from** drop-down list to **Package Manager**.\r\n\r\nIf you're not using Visual Studio, open a command line and change to your project directory. Execute the `dotnet restore` command to restore the new dependencies.\r\n\r\n##### Rebuilding your application\r\n\r\nFinally, you must rebuild your application, test, and redeploy.\r\n\r\n## Other Information\r\n\r\n### Reporting Security Issues\r\n\r\nIf you have found a potential security issue in .NET Core, please email details to secure@microsoft.com.

To check the currently installed runtimes, open a command prompt and run the `dotnet --info` command. If you have a 2.1 or greater runtime installed, you'll see output like the following;\r\n\r\n```text\r\n.NET Core SDK (reflecting any global.json):\r\n Version:   2.2.100\r\n Commit:    b9f2fa0ca8\r\n\r\nRuntime Environment:\r\n OS Name:     Windows\r\n OS Version:  10.0.17134\r\n OS Platform: Windows\r\n RID:         win10-x64\r\n Base Path:   C:\\Program Files\\dotnet\\sdk\\2.2.100\\\r\n\r\nHost (useful for support):\r\n  Version: 2.2.0\r\n  Commit:  1249f08fed\r\n\r\n.NET Core SDKs installed:\r\n  2.1.5 [C:\\Program Files\\dotnet\\sdk]\r\n  2.1.502 [C:\\Program Files\\dotnet\\sdk]\r\n  2.2.100 [C:\\Program Files\\dotnet\\sdk]\r\n\r\n.NET Core runtimes installed:\r\n  Microsoft.AspNetCore.All 2.1.6 [C:\\Program Files\\dotnet\\shared\\Microsoft.AspNetCore.All]\r\n  Microsoft.AspNetCore.App 2.1.6 [C:\\Program Files\\dotnet\\shared\\Microsoft.AspNetCore.App]\r\n  Microsoft.AspNetCore.All 2.2.0 [C:\\Program Files\\dotnet\\shared\\Microsoft.AspNetCore.All]\r\n  Microsoft.AspNetCore.App 2.2.0 [C:\\Program Files\\dotnet\\shared\\Microsoft.AspNetCore.App]\r\n  Microsoft.NETCore.App 2.1.6 [C:\\Program Files\\dotnet\\shared\\Microsoft.NETCore.App]\r\n  Microsoft.NETCore.App 2.2.0 [C:\\Program Files\\dotnet\\shared\\Microsoft.NETCore.App]\r\n\r\nTo install additional .NET Core runtimes or SDKs:\r\n  https://aka.ms/dotnet-download\r\n```\r\n\r\nIf your host version is 2.1.x and the highest `Microsoft.NETCore.App` runtime version is less than 2.1.7, you're vulnerable to this issue.\r\nIf your host version is 2.2.x and the highest 2.1.x `Microsoft.NETCore.App` runtime version is less than 2.1.7, you're vulnerable to this issue.\r\n\r\nYou will not see SDK versions if you have only installed the runtime.\r\n\r\n#### Applications not using Microsoft.NetCore.App\r\n\r\nThe affected assembly is also available separately as a NuGet package. If you are not using Microsoft.NetCore.App, you may still be affected if you are referencing the packages listed above.\r\n\r\n##### Direct dependencies\r\n\r\nDirect dependencies are discoverable by examining your `csproj` file. They can be fixed by [editing the project file](#fixing-direct-dependencies) or using NuGet to update the dependency.\r\n\r\n##### Transitive dependencies\r\n\r\nTransitive dependencies occur when you add a package to your project that in turn relies on another package. For example, if Contoso publishes a package `Contoso.Utility` which, in turn, depends on `Contoso.Internals` and you add the `Contoso.Utility` package to your project now your project has a direct dependency on `Contoso.Utility` and, because `Contoso.Utility` depends 'Contoso.Internals', your application gains a transitive dependency on the `Contoso.Internals` package.\r\n\r\nTransitive dependencies are reviewable in two ways:\r\n\r\n* In the Visual Studio Solution Explorer window, which supports searching.\r\n* By examining the `project.assets.json` file contained in the obj directory of your project for `csproj` based projects\r\n\r\nThe `project.assets.json` files are the authoritative list of all packages used by your project, containing both direct and transitive dependencies.\r\n\r\nThere are two ways to view transitive dependencies. You can either [use Visual Studio’s Solution Explorer](#vs-solution-explorer), or you can review [the `project.assets.json` file](#project-assets-json)).\r\n\r\n##### <a name=\"vs-solution-explorer\"></a>Using Visual Studio Solution Explorer\r\n\r\nTo use Solution Explorer, open the project in Visual Studio, and then press Ctrl+; to activate the search in Solution Explorer. Search for the [vulnerable package](#affected-software) and make a note of the version numbers of any results you find.\r\n\r\nFor example, searching for `Microsoft.AspNetCore.Mvc.Core` in an example project that contains a package that takes a dependency on `Microsoft.AspNetCore.Mvc` shows the following results in Visual Studio 2017:\r\n\r\n![Screenshot of search results in Visual Studio 2017](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/796298/25858816/8ecdc2b4-3491-11e7-9363-746804bb9832.png)\r\n\r\nThe search results appear as a tree. In the previous results, you can see that a reference to `Microsoft.AspNetCore.Mvc.Core` version 1.1.2 is discovered.\r\n\r\nUnder the Dependencies node is a NuGet node. Under the NuGet node is the list of packages you have directly taken a dependency on and their versions.\r\nIn screenshot, the application takes a direct dependency on `Microsoft.AspNetCore.Mvc`. `Microsoft.AspNetCore.Mvc` in turn has leaf nodes that list its dependencies and their versions.\r\nThe `Microsoft.AspNetCore.Mvc` package takes a dependency on a version of `Microsoft.AspNetCore.Mvc.ApiExplorer`, that in turn takes a dependency on a version of `Microsoft.AspNetCore.Mvc.Core`.\r\n\r\n##### <a name=\"project-assets-json\"></a> Manually reviewing project.assets.json\r\n\r\nOpen the *project.assets.json* file from your project’s obj directory in your editor. We suggest you use an editor that understands JSON and allows you to collapse and expand nodes to review this file.\r\nVisual Studio and Visual Studio Code provide JSON friendly editing.\r\n\r\nSearch the *project.assets.json* file for the [vulnerable package](#affected-software), using the format `packagename/` for each of the package names from the preceding table. If you find the assembly name in your search:\r\n\r\n* Examine the line on which they are found, the version number is after the `/`.\r\n* Compare to the [vulnerable versions table](#affected-software).\r\n\r\nFor example, a search result that shows `SSystem.Net.Http/4.3.0` is a reference to version 4.3.0 of `System.Net.Http`.\r\n\r\nIf your *project.assets.json* file includes references to the [vulnerable package](#affected-software), then you need to fix the transitive dependencies.\r\n\r\nIf you have not found any reference to any vulnerable packages, this means either\r\n\r\n* None of your direct dependencies depend on any vulnerable packages, or\r\n* You have already fixed the problem by updating the direct dependencies.\r\n\r\n### <a name=\"how-fix\"></a>How do I fix the issue?\r\n\r\n#### Updating the version of Microsoft.NETCore.App\r\n\r\nIf your host version is a 2.1.x host you must install version 2.1.7 or later of the [.NET Core 2.1 runtime](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/download/dotnet-core/2.1), or corresponding [.NET Core 2.1 SDK](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/download/dotnet-core/2.1).\r\n\r\nIf your host version is a 2.2.x you must install version 2.2.1 or later of the [.NET Core 2.2 runtime](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/download/dotnet-core/2.2), or corresponding  [.NET Core 2.2 SDK](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/download/dotnet-core/2.2).\r\n\r\n#### <a name=\"fixing-direct-dependencies\"></a>Fixing direct dependencies\r\n\r\nOpen *projectname.csproj* in your editor. If you're using Visual Studio, right-click the project and choose **Edit projectname.csproj** from the context menu, where projectname is the name of your project. Look for `PackageReference` elements. The following shows an example project file:\r\n\r\n```xml\r\n<Project Sdk=\"Microsoft.NET.Sdk.Web\">\r\n  <PropertyGroup>\r\n    <TargetFramework>netcoreapp2.1</TargetFramework>\r\n  </PropertyGroup>\r\n  <ItemGroup>\r\n    <PackageReference Include=\"System.Net.Http\" Version=\"4.3.0\" />\r\n  </ItemGroup>\r\n</Project>\r\n```\r\n\r\nThe preceding example has a reference to the [vulnerable package](#affected-software), as seen by the single `PackageReference` element. The name of the package is in the `Include` attribute.\r\nThe package version number is in the `Version` attribute. The previous example shows a single direct dependency on `System.Net.Http` version 4.3.0\r\n\r\nTo update the version to the secure package, change the version number to the updated package version as listed on the table [previously](#affected-software).\r\nIn this example, update `System.IO.Pipelines` to the appropriate [fixed package number](#affected-software) for your major version. Save the *csproj* file. The example *csproj* now looks as follows:\r\n\r\n```xml\r\n<Project Sdk=\"Microsoft.NET.Sdk.Web\">\r\n  <PropertyGroup>\r\n    <TargetFramework>netcoreapp2.1</TargetFramework>\r\n  </PropertyGroup>\r\n  <ItemGroup>\r\n    <PackageReference Include=\"System.Net.Http\" Version=\"4.3.5\" />\r\n  </ItemGroup>\r\n</Project>\r\n```\r\n\r\nIf you're using Visual Studio and you save your updated *csproj* file, Visual Studio will restore the new package version.\r\nYou can see the restore results by opening the **Output** window (Ctrl+Alt+O) and changing the **Show output from** drop-down list to **Package Manager**.\r\n\r\nIf you're not using Visual Studio, open a command line and change to your project directory. Execute the `dotnet restore` command to restore the updated dependencies.\r\n\r\nNow recompile your application. If after recompilation you see a *Dependency conflict warning*, you must update your other direct dependencies to versions that take a dependency on the updated package.\r\n\r\n#### <a name=\"transitive-dependencies\"></a>Fixing transitive dependencies\r\n\r\nIf your transitive dependency review found references to the [vulnerable package](#affected-software), you must add a direct dependency to the updated package to your *csproj* file to override the transitive dependency.\r\n\r\nOpen *projectname.csproj* in your editor. If you're using Visual Studio, right-click the project and choose **Edit projectname.csproj** from the context menu, where projectname is the name of your project.\r\nLook for `PackageReference` nodes, for example:\r\n\r\n```xml\r\n<Project Sdk=\"Microsoft.NET.Sdk.\">\r\n  <PropertyGroup>\r\n    <TargetFramework>net461</TargetFramework>\r\n  </PropertyGroup>\r\n  <ItemGroup>\r\n    <PackageReference Include=\"ThirdParty.NotUpdatedYet\" Version=\"2.0.0\" />\r\n  </ItemGroup>\r\n</Project>\r\n```\r\n\r\nYou must add a direct dependency to the updated version of the [vulnerable package](#affected-software) by adding it to the *csproj* file.\r\nYou do this by adding a new line to the dependencies section, referencing the fixed version.\r\nFor example, if your search showed a transitive reference to a vulnerable `System.ServiceModel.Http` version, you'd add a reference to the [fixed package number](#affected-software).\r\n\r\n```xml\r\n<Project Sdk=\"Microsoft.NET.Sdk.Web\">\r\n  <PropertyGroup>\r\n    <TargetFramework>net461</TargetFramework>\r\n  </PropertyGroup>\r\n  <ItemGroup>\r\n    <PackageReference Include=\"System.Net.Http\" Version=\"4.3.5\" />\r\n    <PackageReference Include=\"ThirdParty.NotUpdatedYet\" Version=\"2.0.0\" />\r\n  </ItemGroup>\r\n</Project>\r\n```\r\n\r\nAfter you've added the direct dependency reference, save your *csproj* file.\r\n\r\nIf you're using Visual Studio, save your updated *csproj* file and Visual Studio will restore the new package versions.\r\nYou can see the restore results by opening the **Output** window (Ctrl+Alt+O) and changing the **Show output from** drop-down list to **Package Manager**.\r\n\r\nIf you're not using Visual Studio, open a command line and change to your project directory. Execute the `dotnet restore` command to restore the new dependencies.\r\n\r\n##### Rebuilding your application\r\n\r\nFinally, you must rebuild your application, test, and redeploy.\r\n\r\n## Other Information\r\n\r\n### Reporting Security Issues\r\n\r\nIf you have found a potential security issue in .NET Core, please email details to secure@microsoft.com.

However, .NET hasn't had a (great) built-in way to deal with JSON. Instead we've relied on [Json.NET] which continues to serve the .NET ecosystem well.\r\n\r\n[Json.NET]: https://www.newtonsoft.com/json\r\n\r\nMoving forward, we plan on making some changes to our JSON support:\r\n\r\n* **We need high-performance JSON APIs**. We need a new set of JSON APIs that are highly tuned for performance by using `Span<T>` and allows for processing UTF-8 directly without having to transcode to UTF-16 `string` instances. Both aspects are critical for our web server Kestrel, where throughput is a key requirement.\r\n\r\n* **Remove dependency from ASP.NET Core to Json.NET**. Today, ASP.NET Core has a dependency on Json.NET. While this provides a tight integration between ASP.NET Core and Json.NET, it also means that application developers cannot freely choose which JSON library they are using. This is also problematic for customers of Json.NET as the version is dictated by the underlying platform. However, Json.NET is frequently updated and application developers often want to -- or even have to -- use a specific version. Thus, we want to remove the dependency from ASP.NET Core 3.0 to Json.NET so that customers can choose which version to use, without fearing they might accidentally break the underlying platform. In addition, this makes it also possible to plug-in an entirely different JSON library.\r\n\r\n* **Provide an ASP.NET Core integration package for Json.NET**. Json.NET has basically become the Swiss Army knife of JSON processing in .NET. It provides many options and facilities that allow customers to handle their JSON needs with ease. We don't want to compromise on the Json.NET support customers are getting today, for example, the ability to configure the JSON serialization via the `AddJsonOptions` extension method. Thus, we want to provide the Json.NET integration as a NuGet package that developers can optionally install so they get all the bells and whistles they get from Json.NET today. The other part of this work item is to ensure we have the right extension points so that other parties can provide similar integration packages for their JSON library of choice.\r\n\r\nBelow are more details around this plan.\r\n\r\n## The need for high-performance JSON APIs\r\n\r\nThe requirements for the .NET stack have changed a bit since the arrival of .NET Core. Historically, .NET has valued usability and convenience. With .NET Core, we've added a focus on performance, and we've made significant investments to serve high performance needs. And the [improvements we made][techempower] in the popular TechEmpower benchmark are a testament to that.\r\n\r\n[techempower]: https://www.techempower.com/blog/2016/11/16/framework-benchmarks-round-13/\r\n\r\nWith .NET Core 2.1, we've added a brand new primitive called [Span\\<T>][span-msdn] that allows us to represent native memory and arrays in a uniform way. With this type, we've also added a set of parsing and encoding APIs that are much more memory efficient without having to resort to unsafe code.\r\n\r\n[span-msdn]: https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/magazine/mt814808.aspx\r\n\r\nPart of the work of minimizing allocations is to avoid having to transcode UTF-8 payloads into UTF-16 strings, purely for parsing reasons. Currently, Json.NET is implemented by reading UTF-16. We need the ability to read (and write) JSON documents directly in UTF-8 because most network protocols (including HTTP) use UTF-8.\r\n\r\nDuring .NET Core 2.1 we've learned that updating our existing APIs to leverage `Span<T>` has limits. While we did add a bunch of overloads that accept spans, we also had to produce brand new APIs that are designed around minimizing allocations and dealing with buffers, which we exposed in `System.Buffers` namespaces. And with `System.IO.Pipelines` we've also added a programming model that enables developers to share buffers without having to deal with lifetime issues.\r\n\r\nBased on these experiences we believe in order to support JSON parsing, we'll need to expose a new set of JSON APIs that are specifically geared for high-performance scenarios.\r\n\r\nYou might wonder why we can't just update Json.NET to include support for parsing JSON using `Span<T>`? Well, James Newton-King -- the author of Json.NET -- has the following to say about that:\r\n\r\n> Json.NET was created over 10 years ago, and since then it has added a wide range of features aimed to help developers work with JSON in .NET. In that time Json.NET has also become far and away NuGet's most depended on and downloaded package, and is the go-to library for JSON support in .NET. Unfortunately, Json.NET's wealth of features and popularity works against making major changes to it. Supporting new technologies like `Span<T>` would require fundamental breaking changes to the library and would disrupt existing applications and libraries that depend on it.\r\n>\r\n> Going forward Json.NET will continue to be worked on and invested in, both addressing known issues today and supporting new platforms in the future. Json.NET has always existed alongside other JSON libraries for .NET, and there will be nothing to prevent you using one or more together, depending on whether you need the performance of the new JSON APIs or the large feature set of Json.NET.\r\n\r\n## Move Json.NET integration into a separate NuGet package\r\n\r\nToday, you cannot use ASP.NET Core without Json.NET because it is a dependency of ASP.NET Core itself. Over the years, we've received feedback that the dependency can conflict with other libraries that have their own dependency on a different version of Json.NET. In the past, we've considered addressing this issue by using a private copy of Json.NET in ASP.NET. However, this would create problems when developers want to configure Json.NET (for instance, in order to control how the serializer behaves when formatting JSON objects).\r\n\r\nMoving forward we'd like to:\r\n\r\n1. Replace the internal usage of Json.NET in ASP.NET Core by the new platform-provided JSON APIs.\r\n\r\n2. Factor the public facing usage of Json.NET into an optional integration package that can be acquired from NuGet.\r\n\r\nSo the existing integration between ASP.NET Core and Json.NET will continue to be supported, but will be moving out of the platform and into a separate package. However, since the integration is then designed to sit on top of the platform, it will also allow customers to update Json.NET to later versions.\r\n\r\nFurthermore, customers who need more performance can also choose to use the new JSON APIs, at the expense of the rich feature set that Json.NET offers.\r\n\r\n## Discussion\r\n\r\nFor a discussion, please go to https://github.com/dotnet/corefx/issues/33115.","Url":"https://github.com/dotnet/announcements/issues/90","RelatedDescription":"Open issue \"The future of JSON in .NET Core 3.0\" (#90)"},{"Id":"368440353","IsPullRequest":false,"CreatedAt":"2018-10-09T23:44:06","Actor":"vivmishra","Number":"89","RawContent":null,"Title":"October 2018 .NET Updates","State":"open","Body":"# October 2018 .NET Updates\r\n\r\nThe following .NET updates were released in October 2018.

LTS releases are stable release which receive critical updates and are supported for at least three years. Current releases can include new features that may undergo future change based on feedback. Current releases are supported for three months after the subsequent .NET Core major or minor release. Both LTS and Current releases receive critical fixes throughout their lifecycle, for security, reliability, or to add support for new operating system versions. You must stay up-to-date with the latest patches to qualify for support. \r\n\r\n## .NET Core 2.0 Lifecycle\r\n\r\n[.NET Core 2.0](https://blogs.msdn.microsoft.com/dotnet/2017/08/14/announcing-net-core-2-0/) was released in August 2017 as a Current release. Per the lifecycle policy, Current releases reach end of life 3 months after a subsequent release (Current or LTS). .NET Core 2.1 released May 2018 and began the end of life countdown for .NET Core 2.0. The 3 month maintenance period for .NET Core 2.0 was scheduled to end August 2018 but was [extended to October](https://blogs.msdn.microsoft.com/dotnet/2018/06/20/net-core-2-0-will-reach-end-of-life-on-september-1-2018/) to allow time to address an issue some customers were experiencing while migrating to .NET Core 2.1.\r\n\r\n## .NET Core 2.0 Downloads\r\n\r\n.NET Core 2.0 installers, zips and tar.gzs will remain available, but unsupported. This includes existing releases available on Linux package feeds. Previous versions, including 2.0, will be accessible through the [Download Archives](https://www.microsoft.com/net/download/archives). \r\n\r\n## .NET Core 2.0 Docker Images\r\n\r\n.NET Core 2.0 will be removed from the .NET and ASP.NET Docker repo READMEs, however the existing images remain available in those repos.\r\n\r\n* [microsoft/dotnet](https://hub.docker.com/r/microsoft/dotnet/)\r\n* [microsoft/dotnet-nightly](https://hub.docker.com/r/microsoft/dotnet-nightly/)\r\n* [microsoft/aspnetcore](https://hub.docker.com/r/microsoft/aspnetcore/)\r\n* [microsoft/aspnetcore-build](https://hub.docker.com/r/microsoft/aspnetcore-build/)\r\n\r\n## Policy Information\r\n\r\nAdditional lifecycle and support details  and background can be seen in the following:\r\n\r\n* [.NET Core Support Lifecycle](https://www.microsoft.com/net/platform/support-policy)\r\n* [Support and Versioning](https://blogs.msdn.microsoft.com/dotnet/2016/07/26/net-support-and-versioning/)\r\n* [2.0 end of life early announcement](https://blogs.msdn.microsoft.com/dotnet/2018/06/20/net-core-2-0-will-reach-end-of-life-on-september-1-2018/)\r\n* [.NET Core OS Lifecycle Policy](https://github.com/dotnet/core/blob/master/os-lifecycle-policy.md)\r\n","Url":"https://github.com/dotnet/announcements/issues/86","RelatedDescription":"Open issue \".NET Core 2.0 has reached end of life\" (#86)"},{"Id":"361098704","IsPullRequest":false,"CreatedAt":"2018-09-18T01:10:23","Actor":"spshant","Number":"85","RawContent":null,"Title":"NET Framework 4.8 Early Access build 3646 is available!","State":"open","Body":"Today, we are happy to share an Early Access build for the .NET Framework 4.8.

This advisory also provides guidance on what developers can do to update their applications to remove this vulnerability.\r\n\r\nMicrosoft is aware of a denial of service vulnerability in .NET Core when System.IO.Pipelines improperly handles requests. An attacker who successfully exploited this vulnerability could cause a denial of service against an application that is leveraging System.IO.Pipelines. The vulnerability can be exploited remotely, without authentication. A remote unauthenticated attacker could exploit this vulnerability by providing specially crafted requests to the application.\r\n\r\nThe update addresses the vulnerability by correcting how System.IO.Pipelines handles requests.\r\n\r\nIf you are using ASP.NET Core 2.1 you will also need to update your ASP.NET version this by following the instructions in the [ASP.NET Core bulletin](https://github.com/aspnet/Announcements/issues/316).\r\n\r\n## Discussion\r\n\r\nDiscussion for this issue can be found at https://github.com/dotnet/corefx/issues/32228\r\n\r\n### <a name=\"mitigation-factors\"></a>Mitigation factors\r\n\r\nThere are no mitigating factors for this vulnerability.\r\n\r\n## <a name=\"affected-software\"></a>Affected software\r\n\r\nAny .NET Core based application that uses the System.IO.Pipelines package with a vulnerable version listed below.\r\n\r\nPackage name | Vulnerable versions | Secure versions\r\n------------ | ------------------- | -------------------------\r\nSystem.IO.Pipelines | 4.5.0 | 4.5.1\r\n\r\n## <a name=\"advisory-faq\"></a>Advisory FAQ\r\n\r\n### <a name=\"how-affected\"></a>How do I know if I am affected?\r\n\r\n#### Applications which use System.IO.Pipelines\r\n\r\nSystem.IO.Pipelines is distributed both in ASP.NET Core 2.1 and separately as a NuGet package. If you are not using Microsoft.AspNetCore.App or .All, you may still be affected if you are referencing the System.IO.Pipelines package.\r\n\r\n##### Direct dependencies\r\n\r\nDirect dependencies are discoverable by examining your `csproj` file. They can be fixed by [editing the project file](#fixing-direct-dependencies) or using NuGet to update the dependency.\r\n\r\n##### Transitive dependencies\r\n\r\nTransitive dependencies occur when you add a package to your project that in turn relies on another package. For example, if Contoso publishes a package `Contoso.Utility` which, in turn, depends on `Contoso.Internals` and you add the `Contoso.Utility` package to your project now your project has a direct dependency on `Contoso.Utility` and, because `Contoso.Utility` depends 'Contoso.Internals', your application gains a transitive dependency on the `Contoso.Internals` package.\r\n\r\nTransitive dependencies are reviewable in two ways:\r\n\r\n* In the Visual Studio Solution Explorer window, which supports searching.\r\n* By examining the `project.assets.json` file contained in the obj directory of your project for `csproj` based projects\r\n\r\nThe `project.assets.json` files are the authoritative list of all packages used by your project, containing both direct and transitive dependencies.\r\n\r\nThere are two ways to view transitive dependencies. You can either [use Visual Studio’s Solution Explorer](#vs-solution-explorer), or you can review [the `project.assets.json` file](#project-assets-json)).\r\n\r\n##### <a name=\"vs-solution-explorer\"></a>Using Visual Studio Solution Explorer\r\n\r\nTo use Solution Explorer, open the project in Visual Studio, and then press Ctrl+; to activate the search in Solution Explorer. Search for the [vulnerable package](#affected-software) and make a note of the version numbers of any results you find.\r\n\r\nFor example, searching for `Microsoft.AspNetCore.Mvc.Core` in an example project that contains a package that takes a dependency on `Microsoft.AspNetCore.Mvc` shows the following results in Visual Studio 2017:\r\n\r\n![Screenshot of search results in Visual Studio 2017](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/796298/25858816/8ecdc2b4-3491-11e7-9363-746804bb9832.png)\r\n\r\nThe search results appear as a tree. In the previous results, you can see that a reference to `Microsoft.AspNetCore.Mvc.Core` version 1.1.2 is discovered.\r\n\r\nUnder the Dependencies node is a NuGet node. Under the NuGet node is the list of packages you have directly taken a dependency on and their versions.\r\nIn screenshot, the application takes a direct dependency on `Microsoft.AspNetCore.Mvc`. `Microsoft.AspNetCore.Mvc` in turn has leaf nodes that list its dependencies and their versions.\r\nThe `Microsoft.AspNetCore.Mvc` package takes a dependency on a version of `Microsoft.AspNetCore.Mvc.ApiExplorer`, that in turn takes a dependency on a version of `Microsoft.AspNetCore.Mvc.Core`.\r\n\r\n##### <a name=\"project-assets-json\"></a> Manually reviewing project.assets.json\r\n\r\nOpen the *project.assets.json* file from your project’s obj directory in your editor. We suggest you use an editor that understands JSON and allows you to collapse and expand nodes to review this file.\r\nVisual Studio and Visual Studio Code provide JSON friendly editing.\r\n\r\nSearch the *project.assets.json* file for the [vulnerable package](#affected-software), using the format `packagename/` for each of the package names from the preceding table. If you find the assembly name in your search:\r\n\r\n* Examine the line on which they are found, the version number is after the `/`.\r\n* Compare to the [vulnerable versions table](#affected-software).\r\n\r\nFor example, a search result that shows `System.IO.Pipelines/4.5.0` is a reference to version 4.5.0 of `System.IO.Pipelines`.\r\n\r\nIf your *project.assets.json* file includes references to the [vulnerable package](#affected-software), then you need to fix the transitive dependencies.\r\n\r\nIf you have not found any reference to any vulnerable packages, this means either\r\n\r\n* None of your direct dependencies depend on any vulnerable packages, or\r\n* You have already fixed the problem by updating the direct dependencies.\r\n\r\n### <a name=\"how-fix\"></a>How do I fix the issue?\r\n\r\n#### <a name=\"fixing-direct-dependencies\"></a>Fixing direct dependencies\r\n\r\nOpen *projectname.csproj* in your editor. If you're using Visual Studio, right-click the project and choose **Edit projectname.csproj** from the context menu, where projectname is the name of your project. Look for `PackageReference` elements. The following shows an example project file:\r\n\r\n```xml\r\n<Project Sdk=\"Microsoft.NET.Sdk.Web\">\r\n  <PropertyGroup>\r\n    <TargetFramework>netcoreapp2.1</TargetFramework>\r\n  </PropertyGroup>\r\n  <ItemGroup>\r\n    <PackageReference Include=\"System.IO.Pipelines\" Version=\"4.5.0\" />\r\n  </ItemGroup>\r\n</Project>\r\n```\r\n\r\nThe preceding example has a reference to the [vulnerable package](#affected-software), as seen by the single `PackageReference` element. The name of the package is in the `Include` attribute.\r\nThe package version number is in the `Version` attribute. The previous example shows a single direct dependency on `System.IO.Pipelines` version 4.5.0\r\n\r\nTo update the version to the secure package, change the version number to the updated package version as listed on the table [previously](#affected-software).\r\nIn this example, update `System.IO.Pipelines` to the appropriate [fixed package number](#affected-software) for your major version. Save the *csproj* file. The example *csproj* now looks as follows:\r\n\r\n```xml\r\n<Project Sdk=\"Microsoft.NET.Sdk.Web\">\r\n  <PropertyGroup>\r\n    <TargetFramework>netcoreapp2.1</TargetFramework>\r\n  </PropertyGroup>\r\n  <ItemGroup>\r\n    <PackageReference Include=\"System.IO.Pipelines\" Version=\"4.5.1\" />\r\n  </ItemGroup>\r\n</Project>\r\n```\r\n\r\nIf you're using Visual Studio and you save your updated *csproj* file, Visual Studio will restore the new package version.\r\nYou can see the restore results by opening the **Output** window (Ctrl+Alt+O) and changing the **Show output from** drop-down list to **Package Manager**.\r\n\r\nIf you're not using Visual Studio, open a command line and change to your project directory. Execute the `dotnet restore` command to restore the updated dependencies.\r\n\r\nNow recompile your application. If after recompilation you see a *Dependency conflict warning*, you must update your other direct dependencies to versions that take a dependency on the updated package.\r\n\r\n#### <a name=\"transitive-dependencies\"></a>Fixing transitive dependencies\r\n\r\nIf your transitive dependency review found references to the [vulnerable package](#affected-software), you must add a direct dependency to the updated package to your *csproj* file to override the transitive dependency.\r\n\r\nOpen *projectname.csproj* in your editor. If you're using Visual Studio, right-click the project and choose **Edit projectname.csproj** from the context menu, where projectname is the name of your project.\r\nLook for `PackageReference` nodes, for example:\r\n\r\n```xml\r\n<Project Sdk=\"Microsoft.NET.Sdk.\">\r\n  <PropertyGroup>\r\n    <TargetFramework>net461</TargetFramework>\r\n  </PropertyGroup>\r\n  <ItemGroup>\r\n    <PackageReference Include=\"ThirdParty.NotUpdatedYet\" Version=\"2.0.0\" />\r\n  </ItemGroup>\r\n</Project>\r\n```\r\n\r\nYou must add a direct dependency to the updated version of the [vulnerable package](#affected-software) by adding it to the *csproj* file.\r\nYou do this by adding a new line to the dependencies section, referencing the fixed version.\r\nFor example, if your search showed a transitive reference to a vulnerable `System.ServiceModel.Http` version, you'd add a reference to the [fixed package number](#affected-software).\r\n\r\n```xml\r\n<Project Sdk=\"Microsoft.NET.Sdk.Web\">\r\n  <PropertyGroup>\r\n    <TargetFramework>net461</TargetFramework>\r\n  </PropertyGroup>\r\n  <ItemGroup>\r\n    <PackageReference Include=\"System.IO.Pipelines\" Version=\"4.5.1\" />\r\n    <PackageReference Include=\"ThirdParty.NotUpdatedYet\" Version=\"2.0.0\" />\r\n  </ItemGroup>\r\n</Project>\r\n```\r\n\r\nAfter you've added the direct dependency reference, save your *csproj* file.\r\n\r\nIf you're using Visual Studio, save your updated *csproj* file and Visual Studio will restore the new package versions.\r\nYou can see the restore results by opening the **Output** window (Ctrl+Alt+O) and changing the **Show output from** drop-down list to **Package Manager**.\r\n\r\nIf you're not using Visual Studio, open a command line and change to your project directory. Execute the `dotnet restore` command to restore the new dependencies.\r\n\r\n#### Rebuilding your application\r\n\r\nFinally you must rebuild your application, test, and redeploy.\r\n\r\n## Other Information\r\n\r\n### Reporting Security Issues\r\n\r\nIf you have found a potential security issue in .NET Core, please email details to secure@microsoft.com.

This issue was resolved earlier this year, with the [May 2018 Preview of Quality Rollup](https://blogs.msdn.microsoft.com/dotnet/2018/05/15/net-framework-may-2018-preview-of-quality-rollup/). We recently learned that some applications, including Johnson Controls’ C-CURE 9000 Software, were negatively impacted by this change as this update requires all client and server workstations to be updated simultaneously with the appropriate Microsoft updates. The changes made to .NET Framework 4.7.1 were also integrated into .NET Framework 4.6 and later servicing releases. As a result, this advisory applies to .NET Framework 4.6 and later versions.\r\n\r\nThis advisory is provided so that developers can correctly diagnose this issue and be aware of our guidance. We will continue to update this issue as we have new information to share.\r\n\r\n## Discussion\r\n\r\nPlease share your thoughts on this change and see what others are saying at:\r\n\r\n* [microsoft/dotnet #832](https://github.com/Microsoft/dotnet/issues/832)\r\n\r\n## Guidance\r\n\r\nThis guidance only applies to customers that have experienced this issue.\r\n\r\nWe have released [an update for .NET Framework 4.6](https://blogs.msdn.microsoft.com/dotnet/2018/08/30/net-framework-august-2018-preview-of-quality-rollup/) and later that resolves the issue. **You must deploy the .NET Framework update for this issue to all .NET Framework 4.6+ machines that communicate via serialized objects**. After doing that, cross-machine serialization will work as expected. \r\n \r\nPlease consult your software vendor to understand if this impacts the software you are using.\r\n\r\n## Technical Context\r\n\r\nIn the [May 2018 Preview of Quality Rollup](https://blogs.msdn.microsoft.com/dotnet/2018/05/15/net-framework-may-2018-preview-of-quality-rollup/), we made a change to the internal type CultureAwareComparer to implement ISerializable. We made the change in order to address [issue with serializing/deserializing a CultureAwareComparer](https://github.com/Microsoft/dotnet/blob/master/releases/net471/KnownIssues/521954%20-%20BCL%20CultureAwareComparer%20with%20ignore%20casing%20on%20serialized%20on%20previous%20versions%20of%20.NET%20do%20not%20correctly%20deserialize%20on%20.NET%204.7.1.md).\r\n\r\nThe issue reported was that a type that contains an instance of CultureAwareComparer was not able to correctly serialize and deserialize across different versions of the .NET Framework. There are a few types in .NET Framework that do this, the most commonly impacted one being the Dictionary<TKey, TValue> type.\r\n \r\nThe change to implement the ISerializable interface had unintended side effects when exchanging this type across different machines. We have had a small number of reports from customers who have been affected.\r\n\r\nA common, but not unique way, of exchanging objects across machines is to use WCF in conjunction with a serializer. One of the common serializers being DataContractSerializer. The side-effect of the change prevented data serialized on systems where the type implements ISerializable to correctly deserialize of systems where the type does NOT implement ISerializable. The same is true of the opposite case, that systems where the type does not implement ISerializable will not correctly deserialize data from systems where the type does implement ISerializable.\r\n\r\nWe have an updated fix that we intend to release within the next month that will remove the implementation of the ISerializable interface on the type and use a different internal mechanism for ensuring the cross-version serialization continues to work as expected. This change addresses the break experienced with WCF.\r\n\r\nThe upcoming fix will remove the implementation of the ISerializable interface on the type and use a different mechanism for ensuring the cross-version serialization of that type continues to work. This change addresses the break experienced with WCF.\r\n\r\n## Symptoms\r\n\r\nAn application that is affected by this issue will most likely crash when trying to deserialize an object. It may print or log an error message similar to the following one:\r\n\r\n```\r\nThe formatter threw an exception while trying to deserialize the message: \r\nThere was an error while trying to deserialize parameter . The InnerException message was ''EndElement' 'Comparer' from namespace '' is not expected. Expecting element '_compareInfo'.'.  Please see InnerException for more details.\r\n```\r\n","Url":"https://github.com/dotnet/announcements/issues/81","RelatedDescription":"Open issue \"Advisory serializing/deserializing a CultureAwareComparer with .NET Framework 4.6+\" (#81)"}],"ResultType":"GitHubIssue"},"Twitter":{"ResultType":"TwitterTimeline","Tweets":[{"Id":"1121443014239379458","CreatedAt":"2019-04-25T15:57:04+00:00","UserScreenname":"dotnet","Text":"Join us live right now for another @dotnet #CommunityStandup with live demos and QA https://t.co/ptNZnKrqoO","Source":"<a href=\"https://www.elgato.com/gaming\" rel=\"nofollow\">Elgato Stream Deck</a>","RetweetCount":10,"FavoriteCount":4,"RawContent":null},{"Id":"1121149312442912768","CreatedAt":"2019-04-24T20:30:00+00:00","UserScreenname":"dotnet","Text":"We're bringing Apache Spark to .NET devs with .NET for Apache Spark. #SparkAISummit \nhttps://t.co/QJBouS8GMj https://t.co/gmAEfZoOwi","Source":"<a href=\"https://about.twitter.com/products/tweetdeck\" rel=\"nofollow\">TweetDeck</a>","RetweetCount":95,"FavoriteCount":54,"RawContent":null},{"Id":"1120820297974730752","CreatedAt":"2019-04-23T22:42:37+00:00","UserScreenname":"dotnet","Text":"Join us live right now for another @dotnet #CommunityStandup with live demoes and QA https://t.co/ptNZnKrqoO","Source":"<a href=\"https://www.elgato.com/gaming\" rel=\"nofollow\">Elgato Stream Deck</a>","RetweetCount":21,"FavoriteCount":6,"RawContent":null},{"Id":"1119356060135907328","CreatedAt":"2019-04-19T21:44:16+00:00","UserScreenname":"dotnet","Text":"Upcoming Updates for .NET Framework 4.8 https://t.co/MYATh2Zg6u","Source":"<a href=\"https://about.twitter.com/products/tweetdeck\" rel=\"nofollow\">TweetDeck</a>","RetweetCount":86,"FavoriteCount":31,"RawContent":null},{"Id":"1119087634003841025","CreatedAt":"2019-04-19T03:57:38+00:00","UserScreenname":"dotnet","Text":".NET Framework 4.8 is now available. https://t.co/emspxTsaEX","Source":"<a href=\"http://twitter.com/#!/download/ipad\" rel=\"nofollow\">Twitter for iPad</a>","RetweetCount":381,"FavoriteCount":223,"RawContent":null},{"Id":"1119030394605588480","CreatedAt":"2019-04-19T00:10:11+00:00","UserScreenname":"dotnet","Text":"Announcing .NET Core 3 Preview 4 https://t.co/7QaZC5qmx6","Source":"<a href=\"https://about.twitter.com/products/tweetdeck\" rel=\"nofollow\">TweetDeck</a>","RetweetCount":373,"FavoriteCount":215,"RawContent":null},{"Id":"1118906461180973059","CreatedAt":"2019-04-18T15:57:43+00:00","UserScreenname":"dotnet","Text":"Join us live right now for another @dotnet #CommunityStandup with live demoes and QA https://t.co/ptNZnKrqoO","Source":"<a href=\"https://www.elgato.com/gaming\" rel=\"nofollow\">Elgato Stream Deck</a>","RetweetCount":11,"FavoriteCount":5,"RawContent":null},{"Id":"1118551190927622144","CreatedAt":"2019-04-17T16:26:00+00:00","UserScreenname":"dotnet","Text":"If you're enjoying the DevOps for https://t.co/iOiV9qNspl Developers series on @ch9 check out this FREE ebook from… https://t.co/IlN3xK8cpo","Source":"<a href=\"https://about.twitter.com/products/tweetdeck\" rel=\"nofollow\">TweetDeck</a>","RetweetCount":32,"FavoriteCount":22,"RawContent":null},{"Id":"1118529550902865924","CreatedAt":"2019-04-17T15:00:00+00:00","UserScreenname":"dotnet","Text":"In part 3 of DevOps For https://t.co/iOiV9r53NV Developers @AbelSquidHead\n&amp; @jeremylikness show us how to create a… https://t.co/s7eQpdTakW","Source":"<a href=\"https://about.twitter.com/products/tweetdeck\" rel=\"nofollow\">TweetDeck</a>","RetweetCount":14,"FavoriteCount":6,"RawContent":null},{"Id":"1118196772604530688","CreatedAt":"2019-04-16T16:57:40+00:00","UserScreenname":"dotnet","Text":"Join us live right now for another @dotnet #CommunityStandup with live demoes and QA https://t.co/ptNZnKrqoO","Source":"<a href=\"https://www.elgato.com/gaming\" rel=\"nofollow\">Elgato Stream Deck</a>","RetweetCount":20,"FavoriteCount":5,"RawContent":null},{"Id":"1116672310809903105","CreatedAt":"2019-04-12T12:00:00+00:00","UserScreenname":"dotnet","Text":"The #OnDotNet show joined forces with @azureadvocates to bring you DevOps for https://t.co/iOiV9r53NV Developers!… https://t.co/eP7EZV54nW","Source":"<a href=\"https://about.twitter.com/products/tweetdeck\" rel=\"nofollow\">TweetDeck</a>","RetweetCount":56,"FavoriteCount":27,"RawContent":null}]}},"RunOn":"2019-04-26T05:30:34.6087549Z","RunDurationInMilliseconds":9932}
