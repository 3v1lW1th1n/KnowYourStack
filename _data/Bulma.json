A split screen forces the user to click the hamburger when the navbar only has a few links. I'm pulling Bulma in to SimulatedGREG's [electron-vue](https://github.com/SimulatedGREG/electron-vue) boilerplate. Then npm installing bulma as a dependency. I'd rather not have to touch the framework just to keep two/three links visible. I know an electron app probably wasn't the original intent of where this would be used, but it's a great fit if you all could support some scenarios like this.\r\n\r\n### Steps to Reproduce\r\n1 - Pull down the [electron-vue](https://github.com/SimulatedGREG/electron-vue) boilerplate and `npm i`\r\n2 - Get maybe 2 or 3 routes setup (like for a simple app)\r\n3 - Grab the 1st navbar example from the Bulma site, change the 1st two navbar-item's to router-links\r\n4 - Remove burger and everything else to make it look kinda like below:\r\n```\r\n<template lang='pug'>\r\n#app\r\n    nav.navbar(role=\"navigation\" aria-label=\"main navigation\")\r\n        .navbar-brand\r\n            a.navbar-item(href=\"https://bulma.io\")\r\n                img(src=\"https://bulma.io/images/bulma-logo.png\" width=\"112\" height=\"28\")\r\n        #navbarBasicExample.navbar-menu\r\n            .navbar-start\r\n                router-link(to='/').navbar-item\r\n                    | Menu-Link1\r\n                router-link(to='/something').navbar-item\r\n                    | Menu-Link2\r\n    router-view\r\n</template>\r\n\r\n<style lang='scss'>\r\n@import \"~bulma/css/bulma.css\";\r\n/* CSS */\r\n</style>\r\n```\r\n5 - `npm run dev`\r\n\r\n### Expected behavior\r\n\r\nIf burger html or class like 'disable-responsive' or 'disable-burger' (pick 1, I'm not saying all 3) is added to nav element with 'navbar', the two links will remain. When super small width they can just break as the min-width of the window could be set at the electron level, preventing the user from ever seeing it.\r\n\r\n### Actual behavior\r\nSplit screen with few views results in unnecessary click by user. Dependency has to be tweaked. #1042 doesn't really hit the mark here since it is more involved and Bulma is already a great fit stock for small apps.\r\n","Url":"https://github.com/jgthms/bulma/issues/2391","RelatedDescription":"Open issue \"[Feature Request] Class flag to disable responsiveness on navbar (links always show, no hamburger).\" (#2391)"},{"Id":"416546917","IsPullRequest":false,"CreatedAt":"2019-03-03T18:28:00","Actor":"dark-kitt","Number":"2390","RawContent":null,"Title":"grid/columns.sass | $column-gap | double of the default value","State":"open","Body":"Hey,\r\n\r\nI've just  a little question...

If I place it between an article tag that has class \"tile is-child\" I can toggle the modal on, but not off. It's the same modal code placed in two different locations.\r\n\r\n### Steps to Reproduce\r\n## This is my java-script code: \r\n```javascript\r\nwindow.onload = function() {\r\n    let button = document.getElementById('button');\r\n    let modal = document.getElementById('modal');\r\n    let close = document.getElementById('close');\r\n\r\n    button.onclick = function () {\r\n        modal.style.display = 'block';\r\n    }\r\n\r\n    close.onclick = function () {\r\n        modal.style.display = 'none';\r\n    }\r\n}\r\n```\r\n## This placement works.\r\n```html\r\n<section>\r\n            <a class=\"button\" id=\"button\">Anchor</a>\r\n            <div class=\"modal\" id=\"modal\">\r\n                <div class=\"modal-background\"></div>\r\n                <div class=\"modal-content\">\r\n                <!-- Any other Bulma elements you want -->\r\n                </div>\r\n                <button class=\"modal-close is-large\" aria-label=\"close\" id=\"close\"></button>\r\n            </div>\r\n</section>\r\n```\r\n\r\n## This will toggle on, but not off.
