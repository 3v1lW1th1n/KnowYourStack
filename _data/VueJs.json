new property `_attrs` to the `ExtendedVue` type so it can be used inside `JSX.ElementAttributesProperty`.(Examples are below)\r\n- Transform non-required props into optional properties of `props` interface.\r\n\r\n## Example\r\n\r\nGiven these 2 children components...\r\n\r\n```js\r\n// PrimaryButton.tsx\r\nimport Vue from 'vue'\r\n\r\nexport default Vue.extend({\r\n  name: 'Primary

  }\r\n  },\r\n  render() {\r\n    return <button style={this.style}>{this.label}</button>\r\n  }\r\n})\r\n```\r\n\r\nand prepare `shims-tsx.d.ts` like this\r\n\r\n```js\r\n// shims-tsx.d.ts\r\nimport Vue, { VNode } from 'vue'\r\n\r\ndeclare global {\r\n  namespace JSX {\r\n    interface Element extends VNode {}\r\n    interface ElementClass extends Vue {}\r\n    interface ElementAttributesProperty

(In v3 all slots are unified to work like scoped slots so that will be the default)\r\n\r\n- In 2.6, any slots using the new `v-slot` syntax are compiled as scopedSlots internally. This doesn't affect the child if it's using template, since `<slot/>` can render both scoped and normal slots, but if the child is using render functions, it is recommended to always use `this.$scopedSlots`. It is safe to do so in 2.6 since all normal slots are proxied on `this.$scopedSlots` as well.\r\n\r\n- Unfortunately, any child components with static slot content still need to be forced updated. This means the common use case of `<parent><child></child></parent>` doesn't benefit from this change, unless the default slot is explicitly forced into a scoped slot by using `<parent v-slot:default><child></child></parent>`.

On the other hand it is not possible to hook into a plugins destroy/replacement.\r\nIn production mode there is no need for such hook, because it's not possible to remove a plugin (this might be reconsidered after https://github.com/vuejs/vuex/issues/467#issuecomment-266493888).\r\n\r\nBut given the [plugin example](https://vuex.vuejs.org/guide/plugins.html#committing-mutations-inside-plugins) which registers event handlers on the `socket` and taking [hot reloading](https://vuex.vuejs.org/guide/hot-reload.html) into account, the handlers are registered multiple times.\r\nThere is no way to unregister an event handler before the plugin gets replaced.\r\n\r\nI'm not sure if this is a general problem with a HMR system (like webpack's) or if its caused by the [`store.hotUpdate()`](https://vuex.vuejs.org/api/#hotupdate) function. I suspect, that even `store.subscribe()` gets called multiple times causing the code to be executed multiple times after some hot replacements.\r\n\r\n**Workaround**:\r\nStore event handlers in a local variable outside the plugin's context.\r\n\r\n### What does the proposed API look like?\r\nEither additional methods exposed by the plugin (similar to [this](https://github.com/vuejs/vuex/issues/467#issuecomment-270836284)):\r\n```\r\nconst myPlugin = {\r\n  init(store) {\r\n     registerAllEventListeners()\r\n\r\n     store.subscribe((mutation, state) => {\r\n        doSomething()\r\n     })\r\n  },\r\n  beforeDestroy(store) {\r\n     unregisterAllEventListeners()\r\n  }\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nOr as a store instance method:\r\n```\r\nconst myPlugin = (store) => {\r\n   registerAllEventListeners()\r\n\r\n   store.subscribe((mutation, state) => {\r\n       doSomething()\r\n   })\r\n\r\n  store.subscribeBeforeDestroy(() => {\r\n     unregisterAllEventListeners()\r\n  }\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nThe latter wouldn't introduce breaking changes of the plugin API.\r\n\r\n<!-- generated by vue-issues.

But, if I need to access a getter from a parent module, for example, I extract together with dispatch, the rootGetters.\r\n\r\nAlthough they are exceptional cases, I have some situations that I need, inside a getter, access a getter from another module (parent module).
