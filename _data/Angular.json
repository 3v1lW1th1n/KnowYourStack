In the component file, it's setup with the following styles:\r\n\r\n`    :root {\r\n      background-color: blue;\r\n    }\r\n    h1 {\r\n      color: red;\r\n    }`\r\n\r\nAdditionally, there's a css style in styles.css with the following:\r\n\r\n`:root {\r\n  background-color: rgb(87, 172, 87);\r\n}`\r\n\r\nThis ends up showing red text (from h1 css inside angular element) against a green background (from the :root tag in styles.css) but ignores the blue background style rule on :root within the angular element.\r\n\r\nAgain, regardless of how I configure the angular element, anything I put in a :root style within the element doesn't apply.\r\n\r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/1421719/63219208-d35f1a80-c13a-11e9-804f-76b9444a7e90.png)\r\n\r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/1421719/63219213-e96cdb00-c13a-11e9-8c81-de0e3925cf1e.png)\r\n\r\n","Url":"https://github.com/angular/angular/issues/32177","RelatedDescription":"Open issue \":root css pseudo-class ignored in angular elements\" (#32177)"},{"Id":"481919290","IsPullRequest":false,"CreatedAt":"2019-08-17T19:35:53","Actor":"zygimantas","Number":"32176","RawContent":null,"Title":"Ng-animating class of child animation is not removed","State":"open","Body":"<!--üîÖüîÖüîÖüîÖüîÖüîÖüîÖüîÖüîÖüîÖüîÖüîÖüîÖüîÖüîÖüîÖüîÖüîÖüîÖüîÖüîÖüîÖüîÖüîÖüîÖüîÖüîÖüîÖüîÖüîÖüîÖ\r\n\r\nOh hi there! üòÑ\r\n\r\nTo expedite issue processing please search open and closed issues before submitting a new one.\r\nExisting issues often contain information about workarounds, resolution, or progress updates.\r\n\r\nüîÖüîÖüîÖüîÖüîÖüîÖüîÖüîÖüîÖüîÖüîÖüîÖüîÖüîÖüîÖüîÖüîÖüîÖüîÖüîÖüîÖüîÖüîÖüîÖüîÖüîÖüîÖüîÖüîÖüîÖüîÖüîÖüîÖ-->\r\n\r\n\r\n# üêû bug report\r\n\r\n### Affected Package\r\n<!-- Can you pin-point one or more @angular/* packages as the source of the bug? -->\r\n<!-- ‚úçÔ∏èedit: --> The issue is caused by package @angular/animations\r\n\r\n\r\n### Is this a regression?\r\n\r\n<!-- Did this behavior use to work in the previous version? -->\r\n<!-- ‚úçÔ∏è--> No\r\n\r\n\r\n### Description\r\n\r\n<!-- ‚úçÔ∏è--> on the first run, the ng-animating class is not removed until all elements are animated\r\n\r\n\r\n## üî¨ Minimal Reproduction\r\n<!--\r\nPlease create and share minimal reproduction of the issue starting with this template: https://stackblitz.com/fork/angular-issue-repro2\r\n-->\r\n<!-- ‚úçÔ∏è--> https://stackblitz.com/edit/angular-issue-repro2-9pmdhp\r\n\r\n<!--\r\nIf StackBlitz is not suitable for reproduction of your issue, please create a minimal GitHub repository with the reproduction of the issue.\r\nA good way to make a minimal reproduction is to create a new app via `ng new repro-app` and add the minimum possible code to show the problem. \r\nShare the link to the repo below along with step-by-step instructions to reproduce the problem, as well as expected and actual behavior.\r\n\r\nIssues that don't have enough info and can't be reproduced will be closed.\r\n\r\nYou can read more about issue submission guidelines here: https://github.com/angular/angular/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md#-submitting-an-issue\r\n-->\r\n\r\n## üî• Exception or Error\r\n<pre><code>\r\n<!-- If the issue is accompanied by an exception or an error, please share it below: -->\r\n<!-- ‚úçÔ∏è--> None\r\n\r\n</code></pre>\r\n\r\n\r\n## üåç  Your Environment\r\n\r\n**Angular Version:**\r\n<pre><code>\r\n<!-- run `ng version` and paste output below -->\r\n<!-- ‚úçÔ∏è-->Angular CLI: 8.2.2\r\nNode: 12.4.0\r\nOS: win32 x64\r\nAngular: 8.2.2\r\n... animations, cli, common, compiler, compiler-cli, core\r\n... language-service, platform-browser, platform-browser-dynamic\r\n... router, service-worker\r\n\r\nPackage                           Version\r\n-----------------------------------------------------------\r\n@angular-devkit/architect         0.802.2\r\n@angular-devkit/build-angular     0.802.2\r\n@angular-devkit/build-optimizer   0.802.2\r\n@angular-devkit/build-webpack     0.802.2\r\n@angular-devkit/core              8.2.2\r\n@angular-devkit/schematics        8.2.2\r\n@angular/pwa                      0.802.2\r\n@ngtools/webpack                  8.2.2\r\n@schematics/angular               8.2.2\r\n@schematics/update                0.802.2\r\nrxjs                              6.5.2\r\ntypescript                        3.5.3\r\nwebpack                           4.38.0\r\n\r\n</code></pre>\r\n\r\n**Anything else relevant?**\r\n<!-- ‚úçÔ∏èIs this a browser specific issue?

When you use `awesome-typescript-loader` it works correctly. \r\n\r\nWhat is even weirder is that if you stop compilation process and run it again, error is thrown correctly everywhere, only during `HMR` change it is not handled correctly. \r\n\r\nIf you fix initial problem and `HMR` is running you will get error \r\n> from the TypeScript compilation. Please make sure it is in your tsconfig via the 'files' or 'include' property.\r\n\r\nand you have to restart `npm start` command. All three mentioned things are slowing development with `@ngtools/webpack` compared to `awesome-typescript-loader`.\r\n\r\n## üî¨ Minimal Reproduction\r\n\r\ndownload this https://github.com/kukjevov/ngtools-error\r\n\r\n**#1**\r\n\r\n> `git clone https://github.com/kukjevov/ngtools-error`\r\n> `cd ngtools-error`\r\n> `npm install`\r\n> `npm start`\r\n> open in browser `http://localhost:8888\r\n> add `ChangeDetectorRef` into `navigation.component.ts` into import statement\r\n> save file\r\n> you can see error in system console, but no error in browser, nor in WebpackNotifierWindow\r\n\r\n**#2**\r\n\r\n> stop `npm start`\r\n> run `npm start` again\r\n> you will see error in system notification window\r\n> refresh browser `http://localhost:8888`\r\n> you will see also in browser\r\n\r\n**#3**\r\n\r\n> open `navigation.component.ts` and remove unused `ChangeDetectorRef` from import statement\r\n> save file\r\n> you can see error in system console, this errors dissapears after you restart `npm start`\r\n\r\n## üî• Exception or Error\r\n\r\nSee minimal reproduction part\r\n\r\n## üåç Your Environment\r\n\r\n- angular: 9.0.0-next.2\r\n- @ngtools/webpack: 8.3.0-rc.0\r\n- node: 10.16.0\r\n- npm: 6.9.0","Url":"https://github.com/angular/angular-cli/issues/15372","RelatedDescription":"Open issue \"@ngtools/webpack HMR compilation errors ignored\" (#15372)"},{"Id":"482234976","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2019-08-19T10:37:54","Actor":"filipesilva","Number":"15371","RawContent":null,"Title":"test: use Ivy by default, opt-in to VE","State":"open","Body":"","Url":"https://github.com/angular/angular-cli/pull/15371","RelatedDescription":"Open PR \"test: use Ivy by default, opt-in to VE\" (#15371)"},{"Id":"482178495","IsPullRequest":false,"CreatedAt":"2019-08-19T08:38:17","Actor":"robert-king","Number":"15370","RawContent":null,"Title":"ng new check if angular cli is up to date ","State":"open","Body":"feature suggestion:\r\nangular cli checks for the latest version of angular cli when using ng new or ng update","Url":"https://github.com/angular/angular-cli/issues/15370","RelatedDescription":"Open issue \"ng new check if angular cli is up to date \" (#15370)"},{"Id":"482017299","IsPullRequest":false,"CreatedAt":"2019-08-18T17:24:53","Actor":"ahnpnl","Number":"15368","RawContent":null,"Title":"ng-serve: cannot load application","State":"open","Body":"# üêû Bug report\r\n\r\n### Command (mark with an `x`)\r\n```\r\n- [ ] new\r\n- [ ] build\r\n- [x] serve\r\n- [ ] test\r\n- [ ] e2e\r\n- [ ] generate\r\n- [ ] add\r\n- [ ] update\r\n- [ ] lint\r\n- [ ] xi18n\r\n- [ ] run\r\n- [ ] config\r\n- [ ] help\r\n- [ ] version\r\n- [ ] doc\r\n```\r\n\r\n### Is this a regression?\r\n\r\nNot so sure\r\n\r\n### Description\r\n\r\nAfter running `ng serve`, application can't be loaded at `localhost:4200`.\r\n\r\n## üî¨ Minimal Reproduction\r\n- Configure global Angular CLI config to use `yarn` as package manager.\r\n- Generate a new project by `ng new <project_name>`.\r\n- Choose `n` when command asks to configure routing.\r\n- Chose `css` when command asks to configure css extension.\r\n- Wait for project generation and dependencies installation to be finished, then run `yarn start`.\r\n- Go to `http://localhost:4200` and application doesn't load.\r\n\r\nExample repo: https://github.com/ahnpnl/cli-serve-issue\r\n\r\n## üî• Exception or Error\r\n- First time go to `http://localhost:4200`\r\n<pre><code>\r\nchunk {main} main.js, main.js.map (main) 9.86 kB [initial] [rendered]\r\nchunk {polyfills} polyfills.js, polyfills.js.map (polyfills) 278 kB [initial] [rendered]\r\nchunk {runtime} runtime.js, runtime.js.map (runtime) 6.09 kB [entry] [rendered]\r\nchunk {styles} styles.js, styles.js.map (styles) 16.3 kB [initial] [rendered]\r\nchunk {vendor} vendor.js, vendor.js.map (vendor) 3.82 MB [initial] [rendered]\r\nDate: 2019-08-18T17:11:03.022Z -

Service is prepended in the hungarian-like system I like, but it also has to be appended to comply with angular convention.\r\n3 - it doesn't seem possible to programmatically or humanly know whether a folder under app refers to a component, service, module...by looking at the folder name when generating a non-flat entity.\r\n\r\n### Describe the solution you'd like\r\n<!-- ‚úçÔ∏è--> If you have a solution in mind, please describe it.\r\n1 - An option to have the files generated with flipped naming like component.x.ts and service.y.ts\r\n2 - A different option to allow type to be added to the folder name without redundancy.
