Historically this allowed us to disconnect large pieces of the BCL from the linker-rooted parts so the resulting apps were much smaller. We used this on `System.Net.Http.HttpClientHandler` because historically it could not be used (you had to use a different WASM-specific `HttpClientHandler`) and it pulled in large amounts of code from `ServicePointManager` and so on.\r\n\r\nHowever, we no longer need to wipe `HttpClientHandler` (because it no longer references large dependencies in the current Mono BCL) and we don't want to (because you actually can use it now - it now works with WebAssembly by default). Additionally, it's really valuable to stop wiping it, because doing so is breaking the gRPC-Web prototype.\r\n\r\nTechnically after this PR we no longer use the wiping infrastructure at all. Eventually we might want to remove it, but I don't want to do so immediately because we haven't finished our size-optimization investigations yet, and they may well want to use this.","Url":"https://github.com/dotnet/blazor/pull/1960","RelatedDescription":"Closed or merged PR \"Stop wiping HttpClientHandler\" (#1960)"},{"Id":"537606991","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2019-12-13T19:14:47","Actor":"javiercn","Number":"1959","RawContent":null,"Title":"[Blazor] Update Blazor branding","State":"closed","Body":"","Url":"https://github.com/dotnet/blazor/pull/1959","RelatedDescription":"Closed or merged PR \"[Blazor] Update Blazor branding\" (#1959)"},{"Id":"537572675","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2019-12-13T15:39:34","Actor":"SteveSandersonMS","Number":"1958","RawContent":null,"Title":"Update mono (2019-12-13)","State":"closed","Body":"Updates Mono to a build that hopefully includes the new client websocket support.\r\n\r\nInstead of doing the upgrade manually, I've finally added a script that does it, plus [updated the instructions to describe the process of using that script](https://github.com/aspnet/Blazor/blob/4b49ece533d4e03e236000b9d04cf77cfec05ac0/src/Microsoft.AspNetCore.Blazor.Mono/HowToUpgradeMono.md). @javiercn @pranavkm Could you please check [these instructions](https://github.com/aspnet/Blazor/blob/4b49ece533d4e03e236000b9d04cf77cfec05ac0/src/Microsoft.AspNetCore.Blazor.Mono/HowToUpgradeMono.md) and let me know if you think this is sufficient for someone other than me to do a future upgrade?
