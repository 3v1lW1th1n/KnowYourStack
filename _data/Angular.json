So you're supposed to create a pipe instead, and the pipe's \"transform\" method is in charge of calling the function you need on your object.\r\nI figured that creating a brand new pipe for each function I need to call is not efficient, not reusable .

Why? It is very common scenario when you want to pass formControl / formGroup to \"sub-edit\" component. Developer has to do everytime the same - subscribe to status / value changes and markForCheck component manually. It doesnt respect the principle of least astonishment as well (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Principle_of_least_astonishment) \r\n\r\n- i got ReactiveForms have methods like setValue / patchValue because of tests and for usage in non-reactive environment. However, if they are named reactive - they are missing still one thing -  reactive way to enable / disable form parts..  \r\n\r\n- statusChanges push notifications only for validity - they should push notifications for ALL status changes.. why? You would like to  show / hide buttons when form is dirty / pristine, etc... \r\n\r\n\r\nPlease, focus atleast on posiblities to \"auto mark\" components  by reactive forms directives like formControl, formControlName etc. It is very usable (it eliminates big part of component boiler plate) and it is very cheap (call on markForCheck()). When you have time, think about reactive solution to update value of form parts...\r\n\r\nbecause setValue/patchValue is not a reactive way (calling methods != reactive) .\r\n\r\nThank you for your work, cannot wait for new NG 8.0! \r\n\r\n### Describe the solution you'd like\r\n1) auto markforcheck in reactive forms directive\r\n2) provide a way to reactively set form control value [formControl]=\"name\" [formControlValue]=\"person.name\"\r\n\r\nto eliminate\r\n@Input\r\nset person(value: Person) {\r\n this.form.get('name').setValue(value.name);\r\n}\r\n\r\n3) statusChanges should notify about all status changes - like Router does.  We can still filter events by type.\r\n\r\n4) Provide reactive way to disable /enable form.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Describe alternatives you've considered\r\nTemplate driven forms.

Please describe:\r\n\r\n## What is the current behavior?\r\n\r\nCurrently, when using a `FormArray`, most templates look like:\r\n\r\n```html\r\n<div formArrayName=\"tags\">\r\n  <div *ngFor=\"let tag of tagsArray.controls; index as i\">\r\n    <input [formControlName]=\"i\">\r\n  </div>\r\n</div>\r\n```\r\n\r\nHere `formControlName` receives a number whereas its input type is a string.\r\n\r\nThis is fine for VE and `fullTemplateTypeCheck`, but not for Ivy which does a more thorough type checking on inputs with `fullTemplateTypeCheck` enabled and throws `Type 'number' is not assignable to type 'string'`. It is fixable by using `formControlName=\"{{i}}\"` but you have to know the difference between `a=\"{{b}}\"` and `[a]=\"b\"` and change it all over the application codebase. \r\n\r\n## What is the new behavior?\r\n\r\nThis commit relaxes the type of the `formControlName` input to accept both a `string` and a `number`.\r\n\r\n## Does this PR introduce a breaking change?\r\n\r\n- [ ] Yes\r\n- [x] No\r\n\r\n\r\n## Other information\r\n\r\nThis has been discussed with @kara on Slack.\r\n\r\nNote that this PR contains two commits:\r\n\r\n- the first one relaxes the input type to `string | number` by changing it on the base `NgControl` class\r\n- the second one reverts #29473 , where @piotrtomiak  ran into a similar issue and changed the example in the docs to help users avoid it. It is now no longer necessary, and the example uses `[formControlName]=\"i\"` again, as all the other examples in the codebase.\r\n\r\nAlso note that no tests were added as the issue is already caught by our tests when `fullTemplateTypeCheck` is on, but it is currently disabled until Ivy type-checking is on par with VE (see FW-1004). For example, adding `type_check=True` in https://github.com/angular/angular/blob/master/packages/examples/forms/BUILD.bazel#L12-L14 surfaces the issue.\r\n","Url":"https://github.com/angular/angular/pull/30606","RelatedDescription":"Open PR \"feat(forms): formControlName also accepts a number \" (#30606)"},{"Id":"447007497","IsPullRequest":false,"CreatedAt":"2019-05-22T08:43:55","Actor":"ronakpandya7","Number":"30605","RawContent":null,"Title":"Angular testing with bazel inside docker is not working.","State":"open","Body":"# 🐞 bug report\r\n\r\n### Description\r\n\r\nHello,\r\nWe are using angular cli version \"8.0.0-rc.3\" and we tried to run `ng test` using bazel inside docker environment.\r\n On the local machine with ubuntu OS it is working fine, but when we tried to run `ng test` on the docker environment it gives the following error:\r\n\r\n```\r\n\r\n\t[0521/141803.288440:ERROR:zygote_host_impl_linux.cc(89)] Running as root without --no-sandbox is not supported.

following error:\r\n\r\n`Unknown option: '--no-sandbox'`\r\n\r\nThen we tried to pass this flag in our karma configuration file, but somehow by default bazel is not executing karma configuration file when we fire ng test command.\r\nAnd that is why this flag is not getting applied on the docker environment.\r\n\r\nSo what we are missing here?\r\nHow can we point karma configuration file to bazel?\r\nIs there any change in --no-sandbox flag with bazel environment?\r\n\r\nThanks in advance,\r\nRonak pandya","Url":"https://github.com/angular/angular/issues/30605","RelatedDescription":"Open

`4.32.1`](https://diff.intrinsic.com/webpack/4.31.0/4.32.1) | [source](https://togithub.com/webpack/webpack) |\n\n---\n\n### Release Notes\n\n<details>\n<summary>webpack/webpack</summary>\n\n### [`v4.32.1`](https://togithub.com/webpack/webpack/releases/v4.32.1)\n\n[Compare Source](https://togithub.com/webpack/webpack/compare/v4.32.0...v4.32.1)\n\n### Bugfixes\n\n-   reverts some changes from 4.32.0 which accidentally disabled some CommonJs features when using `node: false`.\n\n### [`v4.32.0`](https://togithub.com/webpack/webpack/releases/v4.32.0)\n\n[Compare Source](https://togithub.com/webpack/webpack/compare/v4.31.0...v4.32.0)\n\n### Features\n\n-   Added `this.mode` to the loader API, to allow loaders to choose defaults by `mode` similar to webpacks options\n-   Stack Trace for Errors in rejected Promises from `import()` now includes the stack from where the `import()` was called\n\n### Bugfixes\n\n-   The Parser can now analyse identifiers in rest patterns too\n    -   `const { a, ...rest } = obj`, where `rest` conflicts with an imported binding etc.\n-   `node: false` now correctly disables `__dirname` and `__filename` too\n-   `__dirname` and `__filename` now no longer evaluates to something when `node: false` or `node.__file/dirname: false` is set\n    -   `if(__dirname !== \"\")` is no longer replaced with `if(true)` in such scenarios\n-   prefetching chunks is no executed **after** the initial module evaluation\n    -   This allows to override i. e. `__webpack_public_path__` for prefetching too\n-   fixes a runtime crash when using side-effect-free modules with the DllPlugin\n\n### Contribute\n\n-   CI tests node.js 12 now too\n-   webpack-bot now merges dependabot PRs automatically when status checks succeed\n\n</details>\n\n---\n\n### Renovate configuration\n\n:date: **Schedule**: \"after 10pm every weekday,before 4am every weekday,every weekend\" in timezone

the \"bundleOptimizer: true\" option would just overwrite the whole thing. (Given the nature of the config I'm not expecting that this would be possible anytime, hence this proposal:) If I'd to disable that, I'd need to re-implement the whole thing just to change one option. And when I do it naively with a simple setup it straight up fails. (Probably because ng8 now builds both legacy and modern bundles and would require different setups, as I've seen that in this repo where the default config is assembled. But I have no way differentiating that in a custom config file.)\r\n\r\n### Describe the solution you'd like\r\n\r\nAdd a terserOptions config option -- which accepts an object -- into the project's angular.json config (under architect.build.configurations.production). And merge it into the default terserOptions object if exists. (This one here: https://github.com/angular/angular-cli/blob/74f2ee68d6d166903d5ef571d8a793bd4994e142/packages/angular_devkit/build_angular/src/angular-cli-files/models/webpack-configs/common.ts#L284)\r\n\r\n### Use-case\r\n\r\nI'd like to have the terser option \"keep_classnames\" turned on (set to a set of classes which are to be persisted) because of a serialization/deserialization mechanic that resolves the class that belongs to a JSON (stored in a database) by the name of the class. If the name of the class is minified,  these persistent, serialized objects would not be cross-compatible between dev and prod builds. Also there's no guarantee that between different prod versions these minified class names wouldn't change over time.\r\n\r\n","Url":"https://github.com/angular/angular-cli/issues/14487","RelatedDescription":"Closed issue \"Pass extra terser options through the angular.json\"

This option stores type and DI token information so that the runtime JIT compiler can inject the proper provider.  This option is not needed for AOT compilation and the metadata is indirectly stripped from the output due to all Angular decorators being removed during the compilation process.\r\n\r\nUnfortunately, the `emitDecoratorMetadata` option does not support forward references (or more generally circular dependencies) within ES2015+ output due to the TypeScript compiler transforming the metadata into a direct reference of the yet to be defined class.  This results in a runtime TDZ error.  This is a known limitation of the `emitDecoratorMetadata` option ([reference](https://github.com/microsoft/TypeScript/issues/27519)).  This situation is not unique to Angular and can occur in any TypeScript code.  As it is marked as a design limitation, it is considered that it cannot be fixed within the current architecture of TypeScript.\r\n\r\nAs a result, the change in this PR removes the need for the use of the option by storing the DI information in a static property function via the use of the tsickle `ctorParameters` transformation.  By leveraging the existing functionality, no changes to the framework code is necessary.  Also, minimal new code is required within the CLI, as the relevant tsickle code can be extracted and used with several local modifications.\r\n\r\nFor forward references to function in ES2015+, the `emitDecoratorMetadata` option must be disabled based on the current implementation.  To support both the option and forward references, the metadata generated by TypeScript would need to be altered to remove the type information that would trigger a TDZ error.  However, by doing so the metadata information is no longer useful to Angular and technically incorrect as it will not contain the information from the source code as described by the option.\r\n\r\nCloses: #14424","Url":"https://github.com/angular/angular-cli/pull/14473","RelatedDescription":"Open PR \"fix(@ngtools/webpack): downlevel constructor parameter type information\" (#14473)"}],"ResultType":"GitHubIssue"},"material2-Issues":{"Issues":[{"Id":"447242640","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2019-05-22T22:05:24","Actor":"crisbeto","Number":"16088","RawContent":null,"Title":"fix(schematics): avoid lint warning in code generated by nav schematic","State":"closed","Body":"Fixes a lint warning in the code that is generated by the `nav` schematic.
