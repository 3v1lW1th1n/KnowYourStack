Therefore, there\r\nwill also be two `ts.Symbol`s bound per class, and ngcc needs to switch\r\nbetween those declarations and symbols depending on where certain\r\ninformation can be found.\r\n\r\nPrior to this commit, the `NgccReflectionHost` interface had methods\r\n`getClassSymbol` and `findClassSymbols` that would return a `ts.Symbol`.\r\nThese class symbols would be used to kick off compilation of components\r\nusing ngtsc, so it is important for these symbols to correspond with the\r\npublicly visible outer declaration of the class. However, the ESM2015\r\nreflection host used to return the `ts.Symbol` for the inner\r\ndeclaration, if the class was declared as follows:\r\n\r\n```javascript\r\nvar MyClass = class MyClass {};\r\n```\r\n\r\nFor the above code, `Esm2015ReflectionHost.getClassSymbol` would return\r\nthe `ts.Symbol` corresponding with the `class MyClass {}` declaration,\r\nwhereas it should have corresponded with the `var MyClass` declaration.\r\nAs a consequence, no `NgModule` could be resolved for the component, so\r\nno components/directives would be in scope for the component. This\r\nresulted in errors during runtime.\r\n\r\nThis commit resolves the issue by introducing a `NgccClassSymbol` that\r\ncontains references to both the outer and inner `ts.Symbol`, instead of\r\njust a single `ts.Symbol`. This avoids the unclarity of whether a\r\n`ts.Symbol` corresponds with the outer or inner declaration.\r\n\r\nMore details can be found here: https://hackmd.io/7nkgWOFWQlSRAuIW_8KPPw\r\n\r\nFixes

The downloaded package.json shows `\"core-js\": \"2.6.9\"` while a new empty local project package-lock.json shows `\"core-js\": \"3.2.1\"`.  A significant difference.  Further checking shows that the StackBlitz project was created with `Angular CLI version (7.0.7)`, while my local environment is `(8.3.1)`.  Obviously not directly compatible.\r\n\r\nAfter experimenting with ways to get the StackBlitz code updated to the newer environment for awhile, I hit on a simple solution.  Before deleting the `/src` folder from the new local project, save a copy of `/src/polyfills.ts`.  After moving the downloaded `/src` folder into the project, replace the downloaded `polyfills.ts` file with the saved version.  That gets the latest polyfill version, apparently upgrading everything to match the local environment.\r\n\r\nThe `polyfills.ts` file was never touched while creating the start application on StackBlitz.  It seems to have the default for the environment used there.  So it should be safe to simply replace it.  At least it worked for me, with no warnings about version differences.","Url":"https://github.com/angular/angular/issues/32527","RelatedDescription":"Open issue \"polyfill.ts in start application on StackBlitz too old for local build\" (#32527)"},{"Id":"490588012","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2019-09-07T04:02:25","Actor":"asvishnyakov","Number":"32526","RawContent":null,"Title":"fix(router): lazy loaded empty root path loads with auxiliary outlet","State":"open","Body":"## PR Checklist\r\nPlease check if your PR fulfills the following requirements:\r\n\r\n- [x] The commit message follows our guidelines: https://github.com/angular/angular/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md#commit\r\n- [ ] Tests for the changes have been added (for bug fixes / features)\r\n- [ ] Docs have been added / updated (for bug fixes / features)\r\n\r\n\r\n## PR Type\r\nWhat kind of change does this PR introduce?\r\n\r\n<!-- Please check the one that applies to this PR using \"x\". -->\r\n\r\n- [x] Bugfix\r\n- [ ] Feature\r\n- [ ] Code style update (formatting, local variables)\r\n- [ ] Refactoring (no functional changes, no api changes)\r\n- [ ] Build related changes\r\n- [ ] CI related changes\r\n- [ ] Documentation content changes\r\n- [ ] angular.io application / infrastructure changes\r\n- [ ] Other...

These modules would be part of libs that are compiled (AOT) together with the application, so the chunks would be known to webpack, but routes would only be added to the router config as a result of a Web API call.\r\n\r\n### Describe the solution you'd like\r\nBasically, I'd like to be able to do the following (from a component or e.g. a ngrx effect), and successfully navigate to the new route and its children:\r\n\r\n```javascript\r\nthis._router.config.unshift({\r\n  path: 'dynamic',\r\n  loadChildren: () => import(modulePathReceivedFromServer).then(m => m[moduleNameReceivedFromServer])\r\n});\r\nthis._router.resetConfig(this._router.config);\r\n```\r\n\r\n### Describe alternatives you've considered\r\nThe only alternative I can think of is a Webpack plugin doing something similar to what the `AngularCompilerPlugin` does in `contextModuleFactory.afterResolve`.\r\nYou can see my detailed analysis, with a simple demo app and the solutions I could think of here: https://github.com/mbinic/dynamic-lazy-routes#dynamic-lazy-routes-experiment.\r\n\r\nConstructive criticism from the experts is the best way to learn, so I'd love to get your input even if you think this is a bad idea. And I'd gladly make a PR if this is something you'd support, to angular-cli and webpack :)","Url":"https://github.com/angular/angular-cli/issues/15556","RelatedDescription":"Open issue \"Registering lazy routes (dynamic import) at runtime\" (#15556)"},{"Id":"490676837","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2019-09-07T20:24:10","Actor":"renovate-bot","Number":"15555","RawContent":null,"Title":"build: update terser to version 4.3.0","State":"open","Body":"This PR contains the following updates:\n\n| Package | Type | Update | Change |\n|---|---|---|---|\n| [terser](https://togithub.com/fabiosantoscode/terser) | dependencies | minor | [`4.2.1` -> `4.3.0`](https://renovatebot.com/diffs/npm/terser/4.2.1/4.3.0) |\n\n---\n\n### Release Notes\n\n<details>\n<summary>fabiosantoscode/terser</summary>\n\n### [`v4.3.0`](https://togithub.com/fabiosantoscode/terser/blob/master/CHANGELOG.md#v430)\n\n[Compare Source](https://togithub.com/fabiosantoscode/terser/compare/v4.2.1...v4.3.0)\n\n-   Do not drop computed object keys with side effects\n-   Functions passed to other functions in calls are now wrapped in parentheses by default, which speeds up loading most modules\n-   Objects with computed properties are now less likely to be hoisted\n-   Speed and memory efficiency optimizations\n-   Fixed scoping issues with `try` and `switch`\n\n</details>\n\n---\n\n### Renovate configuration\n\n:date: **Schedule**: \"after 10pm every weekday,before 4am every weekday,every weekend\" in timezone America/Tijuana.\n\n:vertical_traffic_light: **Automerge**: Disabled by config.

A lot of great capabitilies :raised_hands:. \r\nSome background:\r\nSince three weeks I'm working currently on something to enable the [micro frontends](https://martinfowler.com/articles/micro-frontends.html) approach with angular. \r\nThe first two weeks I spent with evaluating in how this is even possible together with angular:\r\n _Besides @angular/elements, I have the feeling that web components were never really the focus for the angular team, right?...._\r\n _**But!!!**..... it works. There are some pitfalls and little details, but all in all, I do have a solution so far, where I'm peacefully happy with to use on a larger environment in enterprise._ \r\nSome of the things I managed to solve:\r\n- **Share the @angular libraries** between the angular-elements instead of bundling and loading them for each one again.\r\n- **Make use of Ivy for compilation**. This works both for the shared vendor.bundle and for the angular\r\n- **Provide tooling for all of this** (builders, schematics etc.) <-- Spent the third week with\r\n\r\n(Yes, I am the one with [2kb angular element](https://twitter.com/simsek_dev/status/1168163228574277639), I'm willing to provide access to the private repo if needed. But I'm not going to make it public right now) \r\n\r\n#### My issue comes with the last point:\r\nOn one side, **you provide** great CLI API's for extensions and custom logic, \r\nbut on the other side, **you restrict** people which I don't really get why. \r\nWhat I'm talking about is the [json schema for the angular workspace](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli/blob/master/packages/angular/cli/lib/config/schema.json). \r\nAs long as we tinker with builders, everything is okay. But once you need little more than this, things get complicated:\r\n- [This](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli/blob/master/packages/angular/cli/lib/config/schema.json#L396) prevents us from extending the project schema definition\r\n- [This](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli/blob/master/packages/angular/cli/lib/config/schema.json#L398) small WTF\r\n- [This](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli/blob/master/packages/angular/cli/lib/config/schema.json#L402) prevents us to define a custom targets schema\r\n\r\n> ### Why though?\r\n\r\n**Let's assume** you have one project composited of mutliple subprojects. \r\nAll of the **sub-projects share** some same information, because \r\neven though they **can be independent** from each other, \r\n**they do** have some kind of **relation** \r\nwhen it comes to that **bigger composition project**.\r\n\r\n### Describe the solution you'd like\r\n<!-- ‚úçÔ∏è--> \r\nJust allow additionalProperties? In which way they disturb? :thinking:\r\nA builder may just use those properties he is interested in and ignore all the others.\r\n\r\n### Describe alternatives you've considered\r\n<!-- ‚úçÔ∏è--> \r\nSo far, that I'm started to code an own angular workspace parser with utilities, because **builder** are allowed to have additionalProperties (WTF!!!). \r\nAnd thats the gap I'm using currently to provide some shared information between my angular elements and the container project.\r\n\r\nI started to think about using a completely separate custom json for my configuration, which would be sad just because of some flags I'm not getting why they are set.\r\n\r\nKind regards\r\n","Url":"https://github.com/angular/angular-cli/issues/15547","RelatedDescription":"Open issue \"Enable extension of #/definitions/project & #/definitions/target\" (#15547)"},{"Id":"490356338","IsPullRequest":false,"CreatedAt":"2019-09-06T16:10:33","Actor":"dipamtech","Number":"15546","RawContent":null,"Title":"ERROR in Failed to list lazy routes: Unknown module 'P:/Ionic4FullApp-StartUp_4.7/src/app/app.module#AppModule'.","State":"closed","Body":"üõëüõëüõëüõëüõëüõëüõëüõëüõëüõëüõëüõëüõëüõëüõëüõëüõëüõëüõëüõëüõëüõëüõëüõëüõëüõëüõë\r\n\r\nPlease help us process issues more efficiently by filing an\r\nissue using one of the following templates:\r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/angular/angular-cli/issues/new/choose\r\n\r\nThank you!\r\n\r\nüõëüõëüõëüõëüõëüõëüõëüõëüõëüõëüõëüõëüõëüõëüõëüõëüõëüõëüõëüõëüõëüõëüõëüõëüõëüõëüõë\r\n","Url":"https://github.com/angular/angular-cli/issues/15546","RelatedDescription":"Closed issue \"ERROR in Failed to list lazy routes: Unknown module 'P:/Ionic4FullApp-StartUp_4.7/src/app/app.module#AppModule'.\" (#15546)"},{"Id":"490352439","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2019-09-06T14:16:46","Actor":"josephperrott","Number":"15545","RawContent":null,"Title":"ci: update saucelabs protractor config to run e2e tests in series rather than parallel","State":"open","Body":"Our combined CI usage is often hitting the max number of concurrent sessions on saucelabs.

This library comes with one minified `main.js` and `main.js.map`. `main.js` ends with `//# sourceMappingURL=main.js.map`.\r\n\r\nIn `angular.json` I have enabled `\"sourceMaps\": true` and I would expect all vendor source maps to be merged in the final `vendors.js.map`, but it does not seem to be the case. When I open `Developer Tools -> Debugger -> webpack` I see the original minified version of my external library, rather than the individual files inside it.\r\n\r\n## üî¨ Minimal Reproduction\r\n\r\n1. Create a simple library with 2 ts files and build it using tsc or webpack with sourcemaps. Run npm pack\r\n2. Create a simple Angular application using the library as a npm package. Enable source maps in `angular.json`\r\n3.
