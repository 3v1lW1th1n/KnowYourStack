I'm not sure if this is a winforms problem or an arcade problem, or how big of a problem it really is.\r\n\r\nTo reproduce:\r\n1. Do a build.\r\n1. Switcher to an older branch whose global.json specifies an older SDK version.\r\n1. Do NOT clean the repo.\r\n1. Do a build.\r\n\r\nExpected: the precise SDK version specified in the global.json is used.\r\nActual: the `latestMajor` roll forward policy is applied and a newer SDK in the `.dotnet` folder of the repo is used.\r\n\r\nAn example build, where 3.1.100-preview1-014024 is the specified version in global.json and there is also a 3.1.100-preview2-999999 SDK in the .dotnet folder of the repo.

At least for the winforms repo, it appears the file specified for `SolutionPath` does not have to exist.\r\n* Change the arcade SDK installation logic to delete the local .dotnet folder. Currently the scripts install the .NET SDK by extracting the correct version over any existing version. This leaves incorrect SDK versions in place.\r\n* Document that one should always do a clean build when switching branches.","Url":"https://github.com/dotnet/winforms/issues/2085","RelatedDescription":"Closed issue \"When building winforms repo, global.json file is not fully respected\" (#2085)"},{"Id":"508021154","IsPullRequest":false,"CreatedAt":"2019-10-17T00:25:00","Actor":"zsd4yr","Number":"2101","RawContent":null,"Title":"Add tests for all expected TypeDescriptor.GetEditor ","State":"closed","Body":"This includes both types with an EditorAttribute as well as types listed in the UITypeDescriptor intrinsic table","Url":"https://github.com/dotnet/winforms/issues/2101","RelatedDescription":"Closed issue \"Add tests for all expected TypeDescriptor.GetEditor \" (#2101)"},{"Id":"508164885","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2019-10-17T00:23:40","Actor":"zsd4yr","Number":"2103","RawContent":null,"Title":"Add associations to previous ported editors and add meta test for editors","State":"closed","Body":"\n\n###### Microsoft Reviewers: [Open in CodeFlow](http://wpcp.azurewebsites.net/CodeFlowProtocolProxy2.php?pullrequest=https://github.com/dotnet/winforms/pull/2103)","Url":"https://github.com/dotnet/winforms/pull/2103","RelatedDescription":"Closed or merged PR \"Add associations to previous ported editors and add meta test for editors\" (#2103)"},{"Id":"508095346","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2019-10-17T00:22:14","Actor":"zsd4yr","Number":"2102","RawContent":null,"Title":"add missing system drawing design editor associations","State":"closed","Body":"I believe we need to service these into 3.0.
