The `*active` classes should then be applied during the `hydration` so that the transition can appear smoothly.\r\n\r\n### What is actually happening?\r\nThe element is first displayed, as if there were no transitions.

components when writing TSX since there's no exposed property that JSX can handle as element attributes properties.\r\n\r\n![2019-01-27 22 45 39](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/8381075/51801762-4e3b1380-2285-11e9-8262-18136c6afbe1.png)\r\n\r\nThis PullRequest achieves 2 things.\r\n\r\n    * Creates new property `_attrs` to the `ExtendedVue` type so it can be used inside `JSX.ElementAttributesProperty`.(Examples are below)\r\n\r\n    * Transform non-required props into optional properties of `props` interface.\r\n\r\n\r\n## Example\r\n\r\nGiven these 2 children components...\r\n\r\n```js\r\n// PrimaryButton.tsx\r\nimport Vue from 'vue'\r\n\r\nexport default Vue.extend({\r\n  name: 'Primary Button',\r\n  props: {\r\n    label: {\r\n      type: String,\r\n      required: true as true\r\n    },\r\n    color: String\r\n  },\r\n  computed: {\r\n    style(): string {\r\n      return `color: ${this.color || 'blue'};`\r\n    }\r\n  },\r\n  render() {\r\n    return <button style={this.style}>{this.label}</button>\r\n  }\r\n})\r\n```\r\n\r\n```js\r\n// SecondaryButton.tsx\r\nimport Vue from 'vue'\r\n\r\nexport default Vue.extend({\r\n  name: 'Secondary Button',\r\n  props: ['color', 'label'],\r\n  computed: {\r\n    style(): string {\r\n      return `color: ${this.color || 'blue'};`\r\n    }\r\n  },\r\n  render() {\r\n    return <button style={this.style}>{this.label}</button>\r\n  }\r\n})\r\n```\r\n\r\nand prepare `shims-tsx.d.ts` like this\r\n\r\n```js\r\n// shims-tsx.d.ts\r\nimport Vue, { VNode } from 'vue'\r\n\r\ndeclare global {\r\n  namespace JSX {\r\n    interface Element extends VNode {}\r\n    interface ElementClass extends Vue {}\r\n    interface ElementAttributesProperty {\r\n      _attrs: any\r\n    }\r\n    interface IntrinsicElements {\r\n      [elem: string]: any\r\n    }\r\n  }\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nProperty completion works as expected.\r\n\r\n![2019-01-27 22 55

My confusion comes from the statement _\"but this component is reused in the new route\"_.  What about in a scenario with `<router-view :key=\"$route.path\">` in which we may navigate from `/user/1` to `/user/2` but we want to animate between the two and thus we force a new component creation (assuming the route path is `/user/:id)`.\r\n\r\nIf you look at the linked codepen console when navigating between the two routes, the component instance is destroyed and a new one created, but it still calls `beforeRouteUpdate`\r\n\r\nWhich of the following should be correct in this scenario?\r\n* `beforeRouteEnter` is called on the destination component because it is a net-new component, even though we're still within the same \"route\".  If so, I think this would be need a bug fix.\r\n* `beforeRouteUpdate` is called on the destination component because even though we use a new component, we remained in the same `/user/:id` \"route\".  If this is the case, I think `vue-router` is functioning correctly but the docs are misleading about `beforeRouteUpdate` being called when the component is reused.\r\n\r\n### What is expected?\r\nFrom the docs are they stand, it seems to me that `beforeRouteEnter` should be called on the new component when using a `<router-view>` `:key` prop that causes a new component instance to be created.  This also is more intuitive IMO because the component is not updating in place.\r\n\r\n### What is actually happening?\r\n`beforeRouteUpdate` is being called\r\n\r\n---\r\nWe found this when trying to figure out the best place to show/hide our loaders during page to page transitions.  Initially it seemed like the `next` callback of `beforeRouteEnter` might be the best place because it triggers after the new DOM was patched.\r\n\r\n<!-- generated by vue-issues.

subscriber\r\n\r\n2) throw an error in the subscriber\r\n\r\n3) --> action is performed regardless of exception\r\n\r\n\r\n### What is expected?\r\nWhen an error is thrown in an action subscriber, I expect the action to be interrupted and the exception to bubble up to the caller.\r\n\r\n### What is actually happening?\r\nThe exception is quietly swallowed.\r\nAlso seems i cannot catch the exception.\r\n\r\n\r\n---\r\nIm not sure you can revert to the old behaviour since other users might be dependent on this silent swallowing (though I fail to see why anyone would like such behaviour :-) ... fail early and never ignore exceptions.)\r\nIf it cant be reverted, it would be nice to be able to interrupt the action flow by some other mechanism.\r\n\r\nI use this as part of validation/permission framework to prevent user in UI to perform actions shes not allowed to do. Of course this is checked in backend also, but user feedback can be given quicker and easier this way and it does not require implementation in every action - only in the subscriber.\r\n\r\n<!-- generated by vue-issues.
