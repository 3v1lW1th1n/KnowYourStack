I am trying to add the following packages:\r\n\r\n  <package id=\"CacheManager.Core\" version=\"1.1.2\" targetFramework=\"net451\" />\r\n  <package id=\"CacheManager.Serialization.ProtoBuf\" version=\"1.1.2\" targetFramework=\"net451\" />\r\n  <package id=\"CacheManager.StackExchange.Redis\" version=\"1.1.2\" targetFramework=\"net451\" />\r\n  <package id=\"CacheManager.SystemRuntimeCaching\" version=\"1.1.2\" targetFramework=\"net451\" />\r\n  <package id=\"protobuf-net\" version=\"2.1.0\" targetFramework=\"net451\" />\r\n  <package id=\"StackExchange.Redis.StrongName\" version=\"1.2.6\" targetFramework=\"net451\" />\r\n\r\nFirst I tried this via the web interface but I get this error:\r\nThe element 'metadata' in namespace 'http://schemas.microsoft.com/packaging/2013/05/nuspec.xsd' has invalid child element 'repository' in namespace 'http://schemas.microsoft.com/packaging/2013/05/nuspec.xsd'. List of possible elements expected: 'frameworkAssemblies, developmentDependency, dependencies, summary, language, references, title' in namespace 'http://schemas.microsoft.com/packaging/2013/05/nuspec.xsd'. Details…\r\n\r\nSo then I tried mirroring the packages within the server. We have a BAT file with the following command:\r\n\r\nNuGet mirror packages.config http://xxxxx.co.uk/api/v2/ http://xxxxx.co.uk/ -source https://nuget.org/api/v2 -ApiKey xxxxxxxxxxxxxxx -NoCache -verbosity detailed > logs\\mirror.txt  2>&1\r\n\r\nThis uses NuGet 2.8.60717.93. However, I am getting this error:\r\n\r\nGET https://www.nuget.org/api/v2/package/NETStandard.Library/1.6.0\r\nSystem.InvalidOperationException: 'NETStandard.Library' already has a dependency defined for 'Microsoft.NETCore.Platforms'.\r\n   at NuGet.Manifest.ValidateDependencySets(IPackageMetadata metadata)\r\n   at NuGet.Manifest.Validate(Manifest manifest)\r\n\r\nI believe the above issue is fixed in latest nuget.exe, however, the 'mirror' command has been deprecated after 3.2+ so I cannot use the latest nuget.exe version. I tried to look for NuGet.ServerExtensions.dll as per https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/nuget/tools/cli-ref-mirror but cannot locate the extension. As a test, I tried to mirror only Microsoft.NETCore.Platforms as follows:\r\n\r\nNuGet mirror Microsoft.NETCore.Platforms http://xxxxx.co.uk/api/v2/ http://xxxx.co.uk/ -source https://nuget.org/api/v2 -ApiKey xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx -version 2.1.1 -NoCache -verbosity detailed\r\n\r\nand now I get a different error:\r\n\r\nNuGet.NuGetVersionNotSatisfiedException: The 'Microsoft.NETCore.Platforms 1.0.1' package requires NuGet client version '2.12' or above, but the current NuGet version is '2.8.60717.93'.\r\n   at NuGet.PackageWalker.CheckPackageMinClientVersion(IPackage package)\r\n\r\nI cannot find nuget.exe v2.12 anywhere so next I tried to copy one of the packages (without dependencies) directly to local NuGet cache and shared file storage:\r\n\r\nC:\\Users\\xxxx\\AppData\\Local\\NuGet\\Cache\r\n\\\\xxxxx.co.uk\\itshared\\Lab\\Build\\Nuget\\packages (i.e. FileStorageDirectory)\r\n\r\nbut this has also not helped - even after re-indexing.\r\n\r\nWe are not in a position to upgrade our server yet and might do this in the future. For now I am looking to upload the packages as the team is blocked. There is nothing in the server logs to suggest any errors. \r\n\r\nDo you have any suggestions/workaround on how I can mirror the packages? \r\n\r\nWhy copying the package to the above folders is not taking effect even after re-indexing? \r\n\r\nAlso, \r\n\r\n## Detailed repro steps so we can see the same problem\r\n\r\n1.
