Adds the @angular/service-worker package to your project.\r\n2. Enables service worker build support in the CLI.\r\n3. Imports and registers the service worker in the app module.\r\n4. Updates the index.html file:\r\n5. Includes a link to add the manifest.json file.\r\n6. Adds meta tags for theme-color.\r\n7. Installs icon files to support the installed Progressive Web App (PWA).\r\n8. Creates the service worker configuration file called ngsw-config.json, which specifies the caching behaviors and other settings.\r\n\r\nHowever on step 7, adding the icons files these are generic default Angular icons. In order to replace these developers then need to manually:\r\n\r\n1. Find an icon generator\r\n2. Upload their image and generate the new code\r\n3. Download the icons copy/paste into the folder\r\n4. Copy/paste the icons code into the index.html head tag\r\n\r\nEvery developer needs to do these steps on every new project. So it would save alot of time if we had an automated solution.\r\n\r\n### Describe the solution you'd like\r\nThe option to include my HQ image file for the icon, which is automatically converted into the various sizes and added used instead of the default Angular icon.\r\n\r\n### Describe alternatives you've considered\r\nConsider using a webpack plugin or node.js script to generate the icons for us?\r\n\r\nSome examples:\r\nhttps://github.com/jantimon/favicons-webpack-plugin\r\nhttps://github.com/itgalaxy/favicons","Url":"https://github.com/angular/angular-cli/issues/15844","RelatedDescription":"Open issue \"Generate favicon as part of adding PWA service worker\" (#15844)"},{"Id":"506157828","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2019-10-14T16:50:02","Actor":"alan-agius4","Number":"15826","RawContent":null,"Title":"test: fix i18n extraction e2e test (Make master green)","State":"closed","Body":"The default `source-language` is `en-US` and not `en`.","Url":"https://github.com/angular/angular-cli/pull/15826","RelatedDescription":"Closed or merged PR \"test: fix i18n extraction e2e test (Make master green)\" (#15826)"},{"Id":"506521458","IsPullRequest":false,"CreatedAt":"2019-10-14T08:50:53","Actor":"filipesilva","Number":"15836","RawContent":null,"Title":"--experimentalRollupPass feedback issue","State":"open","Body":"Heya all, \r\n\r\nIn https://github.com/angular/angular-cli/pull/15690 we introduced a new experimental flag, --`--experimentalRollupPass`, that attempts an advanced optimization pass.

I don't think they're particularly useful to test authors, and instead we probably want APIs that are more focused in purpose. I do think it makes sense, however, to allow users to get some handle on the content. I think the thing users are most likely to do with the content element is either query for more harnesses within it, or query outside of the harness system (e.g. `document.querySelector`). I settled on returning a selector because it allows the user to do either of those things. Another option would be to provide a method for loading a sub-harness directly (they pass the harness class and we return an instance).
