Every language is served under a different path, e.g.:\r\n```\r\nhttps://coolapp.com/en/\r\nhttps://coolapp.com/de/\r\n```\r\nWhen changing the language both service workers do collide in their responsibility, as both match their pattern: \r\n```\r\n    {\r\n      \"positive\": true,\r\n      \"regex\": \"^\\\\/.*$\"\r\n    }\r\n```\r\nand want to serve their `index.html`. By scoping them to their respective location on the server they do not collide anymore. \r\n\r\n### Workaround (nasty)\r\nDefine different `\"ngswConfigPath\": \"src/ngsw-config.json\"` (full duplicates) in your `angular.json` for each environment and specify the `navigationUrls` accordingly:\r\n```\r\n\"navigationUrls\": [\r\n    \"/de/**\",\r\n    \"!/**/*.*\",\r\n    \"! /**/*__*\",\r\n    \"! /**/*__*/**\"\r\n  ]\r\n```","Url":"https://github.com/angular/angular/issues/27953","RelatedDescription":"Closed issue \"ServiceWorker: Standard NavigationUrls do not respect baseHref \" (#27953)"},{"Id":"396598805","IsPullRequest":false,"CreatedAt":"2019-01-07T18:35:45","Actor":"rmorrise","Number":"27967","RawContent":null,"Title":"Improve router unit testing docs","State":"closed","Body":"# üìö Docs bug report\r\n\r\n### Description\r\n\r\nPlease cover the following topics thoroughly in the Angular docs:\r\n- Unit testing a router module\r\n- Unit testing a component which uses a router-outlet\r\n\r\n## üî¨ Minimal Reproduction\r\n\r\nBoth router docs sections (tutorial and fundamentals) don't really mention unit testing.\r\n\r\nThe live example project on the routing fundamentals page doesn't have unit tests.\r\n\r\nIn the API docs, two of the utilities don't have examples; the third has an incomplete example (it shows how to mock the routes, but not how to set the route for your test case).\r\n\r\n### What's the affected URL?**\r\nhttps://angular.io/tutorial/toh-pt5\r\nhttps://angular.io/guide/router\r\nhttps://angular.io/api/router/testing\r\n\r\n","Url":"https://github.com/angular/angular/issues/27967","RelatedDescription":"Closed issue \"Improve router unit testing docs\" (#27967)"},{"Id":"396592879","IsPullRequest":false,"CreatedAt":"2019-01-07T18:10:46","Actor":"devversion","Number":"27966","RawContent":null,"Title":"Bazel ng_package does not generate maps for esm5/es2015 output","State":"open","Body":"e.g. see here: https://unpkg.com/@angular/core@7.2.0/esm5/\r\n\r\nI'll be looking into this very soon, so that we can re-enable the `source-map-test` in #27937.","Url":"https://github.com/angular/angular/issues/27966","RelatedDescription":"Open issue \"Bazel ng_package does not generate maps for esm5/es2015 output\" (#27966)"},{"Id":"396578298","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2019-01-07T17:26:38","Actor":"benlesh","Number":"27965","RawContent":null,"Title":"fix(ivy): ngOnChanges only runs for binding updates","State":"open","Body":"Updates ivy to trigger onChanges only when bindings update on not when properties are set.\r\n\r\n- Currently there are still test failures in a few places, I'm not sure they are related as `core` is passing, if they are not, I'll mark them `fixMeIvy` and move on, because this PR is already pretty large\r\n- SimpleChanges is now stored alongside the directive instance in LView.

When I run `ng build`, I do not see the `assets/images` folder or the `favicon.ico` included in the build. When I run `ng build` on my other machine with the same application, these files are included and `ng serve` displays the images. Here are my angular build options:\r\n\r\n```\r\n{\r\n          \"builder\": \"@angular-devkit/build-angular:browser\",\r\n          \"options\": {\r\n            \"outputPath\": \"dist/proposal-app\",\r\n            \"index\": \"src/index.html\",\r\n            \"main\": \"src/main.ts\",\r\n            \"polyfills\": \"src/polyfills.ts\",\r\n            \"tsConfig\": \"src/tsconfig.app.json\",\r\n            \"assets\": [\r\n              \"src/favicon.ico\",\r\n              \"src/assets\"\r\n            ],\r\n            \"styles\": [\r\n              \"src/styles.css\"\r\n            ],\r\n            \"scripts\": []\r\n          },\r\n          \"configurations\": {\r\n            \"production\": {\r\n              \"fileReplacements\": [\r\n                {\r\n                  \"replace\": \"src/environments/environment.ts\",\r\n                  \"with\": \"src/environments/environment.prod.ts\"\r\n                }\r\n              ],\r\n              \"optimization\": true,\r\n              \"outputHashing\": \"all\",\r\n              \"sourceMap\": false,\r\n              \"extractCss\": true,\r\n              \"namedChunks\": false,\r\n              \"aot\": true,\r\n              \"extractLicenses\": true,\r\n              \"vendorChunk\": false,\r\n              \"buildOptimizer\": true,\r\n              \"budgets\": [\r\n                {\r\n                  \"type\": \"initial\",\r\n                  \"maximumWarning\": \"2mb\",\r\n                  \"maximumError\": \"5mb\"\r\n                }\r\n              ]\r\n            }\r\n          }\r\n        }\r\n```\r\n\r\nI have searched and have found several issues related to this, but they were all old and fixed by now.\r\n\r\nThanks for your help.

At that point when I call next or previous since the steps interacted field is false by default I'm not able to go backward or forward through the stepper.  \r\n\r\nAt the moment my only way to solve this issue is to iterate the stepper's \"_steps\" and set the \"interacted\" field to true.
