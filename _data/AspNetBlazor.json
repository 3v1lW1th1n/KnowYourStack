It is very simple but I have absolutely no idea how we can fix this in Blazor (without JavaScript)\r\n\r\n`ToggleNavMenu` function is connected to `onclick` events in two places:\r\n`<button class=\"navbar-toggler\" onclick=@ToggleNavMenu>`\r\nand\r\n`<div class=@(collapseNavMenu ? \"collapse\" : null) onclick=@ToggleNavMenu>`\r\n\r\nBoth places are necessary if application works on small screen. First one shows or hides menu when we click on \"hamburger\" button. Second one hides menu when we click on any menu option.\r\n\r\nUnfortunately on big screen we have a problem. \"Hamburger\" button is not visible and it is OK, but each time we click on menu (strictly speaking on sidebar) `collapseNavMenu` variable is changed between true/false and `collapse` class is added/removed to/from `<div>` element. In site.css file we have:\r\n```\r\n@media (min-width: 768px) {\r\n.sidebar .collapse {\r\n        /* Never collapse the sidebar for wide screens */\r\n        display: block;\r\n    }\r\n}\r\n```\r\nso it is not a problem on big screen. But if `callapseNavMenu` variable is false and we make our browser windows smaller, menu will be visible - it should be hidden.\r\n\r\nTo solve the problem we should have access to browser window size from C# code and don't toggle the variable if it is 768px or wider.\r\n\r\nTo solve this and plenty of other problems related to responsive applications we should have access to DOM/window events and properties like onscroll, onresize, different width/height properties, pageXOffest, pageYOffset, and more.\r\n\r\nIs it planned in the future?","Url":"https://github.com/aspnet/Blazor/issues/834","RelatedDescription":"Open issue \"Blazor App - simple bug, hard to fix - make DOM/window properties and events available in Blazor\" (#834)"},{"Id":"322977497","IsPullRequest":false,"CreatedAt":"2018-05-14T20:53:58","Actor":"rglos","Number":"833","RawContent":null,"Title":"Unable to host in IIS on Windows 10 as an application","State":"open","Body":"I am unable to get Blazor working using the `Blazor (ASP.NET Core hosted)` template while hosting the application as an IIS application on my local Windows 10 machine.\r\n\r\n- File, New Project, ASP.NET Core Web Application\r\n- Name: `BlazorDotNetHosted`, click `OK`\r\n- Select `Blazor (ASP.NET Core hosted)`\r\n- Right-click `BlazorDotNetHosted.Server` and select Publish\r\n- Select `Folder`, note it's going to `bin\\Release\\netcoreapp2.1\\publish\\`, click Publish\r\n- Create local folder at `D:\\apps\\web\\BlazorDotNetHosted`\r\n- Copy+paste contents at `bin\\Release\\netcoreapp2.1\\publish\\` to `D:\\apps\\web\\BlazorDotNetHosted`\r\n- Open IIS, navigate to `Default Web Site`\r\n- Right-click `Default Web Site` and select `Add Application`\r\n- Alias: `BlazorDotNetHosted`, Application Pool: `DefaultAppPool`, Physical path: `D:\\apps\\web\\BlazorDotNetHosted`, click `OK`\r\n- Click `Browse..` to view the app at `http://localhost/BlazorDotNetHosted/` and note that the page just says `Loading...`\r\n\r\nThings I've tried:\r\n\r\nUpdate the app base path as suggested [here](https://blazor.net/docs/host-and-deploy/index.html#app-base-path) by opening the `index.html` at `D:\\apps\\web\\BlazorDotNetHosted\\BlazorDotNetHosted.Client\\dist\\index.html` and edit the `base` element to add the path:\r\n\r\n```\r\n<base href=\"/BlazorDotNetHosted/\" />\r\n```\r\n\r\nThis does allow the application to load.
