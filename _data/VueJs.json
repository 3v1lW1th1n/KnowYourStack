Here's the example with checking all of the possible `undefined`s:\r\n\r\n```TypeScript\r\n// The type-safe equivalent in TypeScript is\r\nrender (h) {\r\n  if (this.$scopedSlots && this.$scopedSlots.default) {\r\n    const defaultSlot = this.$scopedSlots.default({\r\n      action: this.action\r\n    })\r\n\r\n    if (defaultSlot) {\r\n      return defaultSlot // This is VNode[] but render demands a VNode\r\n    }\r\n  }\r\n\r\n  return h('div') // for this example proof of type safety\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nThe error statement:\r\n\r\n```\r\nNo overload matches this call.\r\n  The last overload gave the following error.\r\n    Argument of type '{ props: { project: { type: ObjectConstructor; required: true; }; }; methods: { deleteProject(): void; }; render(h: CreateElement): VNode[] | VNode; }' is not assignable to parameter of type 'ComponentOptions<Vue, DefaultData<Vue>, DefaultMethods<Vue>, DefaultComputed, PropsDefinition<Record<string, any>>, Record<...>>'.\r\n      The types returned by 'render(...)' are incompatible between these types.\r\n        Type 'VNode[] | VNode' is not assignable to type 'VNode'.\r\n          Type 'VNode[]' is missing the following properties from type 'VNode': isRootInsert, isComment\r\n```\r\n\r\n### What is expected?\r\nThe `render` return type allows all valid return types. In this case, it's at least `VNode[] | VNode`. \r\n\r\n```diff\r\n-  render?(createElement: CreateElement, hack: RenderContext<Props>): VNode;\r\n+  render?(createElement: CreateElement, hack: RenderContext<Props>): VNode | VNode[];\r\n```\r\n\r\nThere might be others valid types? \r\n\r\n### What is actually happening?\r\n`return defaultSlot` is expecting a `VNode[]` but the `render` typing only accepts a `VNode`.\r\n\r\nThe only way to work around this now is to cast to `any` when returning a value, which is a hack.\r\n\r\n---\r\nSource line for render function: https://github.com/vuejs/vue/blob/4821149b8bbd4650b1d9c9c3cfbb539ac1e24589/types/options.d.ts#L84\r\n\r\n<!-- generated by vue-issues.

This leads to large garbage collections which cause jank in the animation.\r\n\r\n---\r\nI realize that the minimal reproduction i've linked to is a bit questionable. But i arrived at this problem with a more realistic scenario, where i was using a webworker to generate a lot of data, and storing it in a vuex instance. This data was not being updated at all during the animation, but was used to determine what the animation state was. However even without reading the bulky data, a simple update of a \"time\" property i was using to set the time of the animation was causing a huge amount of memory allocation.

Clicking on the home tab (router link) destroys the about component and resets lingeringObj to null- this causes the LingeringObject to get removed by the garbage collector- this is all fine, and can be tested by taking a heap snapshots in chrome. Now, the memory leak that I've noticed happens when you use the 'Go Home' button on the about tab. This uses router.push() instead of a \\<router-link\\>. After clicking the Go Home button, if you take a snapshot, you'll notice the LingeringObject is still in memory. What's even weirder is when you inspect the object to see what is still holding onto a reference of it- it's showing HTMLButtonElement, which is the Go Home button. Very peculiar. According to the [vue router documentation](https://router.vuejs.org/guide/essentials/navigation.html#router-push-location-oncomplete-onabort): \"...clicking \\<router-link :to=\"...\"\\> is the equivalent of calling router.push(...).\"\r\n\r\nHere is the source code for the reproduction link:\r\nhttps://github.com/ChuckFields/VueRouterLingeringObject\r\n\r\n### What is expected?\r\nThe LingeringObject to get removed from memory when using router.push()\r\n\r\n### What is actually happening?\r\nIt's staying in memory\r\n\r\n<!-- generated by vue-issues.

But if I decide to create an additional route afterwards, this would not be available as the catch-all route would take priority.\r\n\r\nFor example, I want to allow administrator users to press an \"Add content to this URL\" button when they land on a URL that doesn't exist in the route list. In order to achieve this, I would need to create a new route for the non-existent URL *before* the catch-all route. The only alternative I can currently see is to completely refresh the page using a POST request to add the URL or to dismantle and recreate the Vue.$router object.\r\n\r\n### What does the proposed API look like?\r\nFor my specific use-case, I expect the desired behaviour could be achieved by adding an optional \"before\" parameter to the addRoutes function e.g. `router.addRoutes([ { path:\"/new-page\" } ], catchAllRoute)`. But I see a greater benefit in general if the route list could be accessed and updated in a more dynamic way.\r\n\r\n<!-- generated by vue-issues.
