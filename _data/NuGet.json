At present, the MSBuild NuGet [PackTask](https://github.com/NuGet/NuGet.Client/blob/63e8539791d4f662efffceb2185ad4510396d76e/src/NuGet.Core/NuGet.Build.Tasks.Pack/PackTask.cs) only supports including Package Resource Index (\\*.pri) files.\r\n\r\n## Overview\r\nWinRT applications that include custom controls often also include default styles and themes in the **Generic.xaml** file. The compiler also generates a few additional, related files that must be included in the NuGet package, including:\r\n\r\n* Generic.xbf\r\n* _[Package Id]_.xr.xml\r\n\r\nThese files are required to have a very specific folder structure in the package:\r\n\r\n```\r\nlib\r\n└─ [tfm]\r\n   ├─ [package id]\r\n   │  ├─ Themes\r\n   │  │  ├─ Generic.xaml\r\n   │  │  └─ Generic.xbf\r\n   │  └─ [package id].xr.xml\r\n   ├─ [package id].dll\r\n   └─ [package id].pri\r\n```\r\n\r\nIf these files are not included in this exact structure, then the default theme and other style information will fail to be picked up by package consumers.\r\n\r\n## Problem\r\nDespite numerous attempts to specify the correct MSBuild items and metadata, I was unable to make the **PackTask** include these additional files using the required package paths. Upon closer examination of the [MSBuildProjectFactory](https://github.com/NuGet/NuGet.Client/blob/6ca0c29c28ac3d0f52dcda3c178e3c3c3b8b80bf/src/NuGet.Core/NuGet.Commands/MSBuildProjectFactory.cs), it seems that only \\*.pri files are considered and all other uncognized files are ignored. The **NuGet.Build.Tasks.Pack.targets** also include a special build target for the [_AddPriFileToPackBuildOutput](https://github.com/NuGet/NuGet.Client/blob/6ca0c29c28ac3d0f52dcda3c178e3c3c3b8b80bf/src/NuGet.Core/NuGet.Build.Tasks.Pack/Pack.targets#L293).\r\n\r\nI tried using the same approach for the other WinRT files, but I was unable to get the files to pack into the correct subfolders. It is possible to create the desired \\*.nuspec manually, but all of the great benefits from using MSBuild, in particular package dependencies, are lost and must also be managed manually.\r\n\r\nPrevious discussions on this topic include #3225 and #3293, which were solved by manually crafting the \\*.nuspec file.\r\n\r\n## Proposed Fix\r\nThe **PackTask** should automatically detect these files and correctly include them in the generated NuSpec metadata.\r\n\r\nIt should also be noted that this behavior does not apply to Windows Presentation Foundation (WPF), even though it too has Generic.xaml files. The compiler compiles WPF Generic.xaml files to a \\*.baml file, which is included in the output \\*.dll as an embedded resource.\r\n\r\n## Recommendations\r\nWhile default behaviors and conventions should be supported by the **PackTask**, the task should also support explicitly specifying additional content to pack. Since such items are explicit, they should be included without filtering. This behavior allows packing build output that may not follow the expected conventions understood by the **PackTask**. Warnings may optionally be emmitted by package validation when unconventional content is added.\r\n\r\nFor example:\r\n```xml\r\n<ItemGroup>\r\n <!-- the \"Pack\" metadata item shouldn't be necessary since the mere\r\n      existence of these items means that we want them packed -->\r\n <CustomPackageFile Include=\"bin\\*.*\">\r\n  <PackagePath>bin\\</PackagePath>\r\n </CustomPackageFile>\r\n</ItemGroup>\r\n```\r\n\r\nAs a practical example, you might have a _build-only_ package that has varying \\*.targets by platform, but a single build task assembly. This assembly can be placed in an unconventional folder, which negates the need to include the same assembly or other content multiple times. In some cases, this can significantly reduce the final package size.\r\n\r\nFor example:\r\n```\r\nbin\r\n├─ Tasks.dll\r\n└─ BuildTool.exe\r\n\r\nbuild\r\n├─ net45\r\n│  └─ MyPackage.targets\r\n├─ netstandard1.0\r\n│  └─ MyPackage.targets\r\n└─ uap10.0\r\n   └─ MyPackage.targets\r\n```\r\n\r\nArguably, you could probably use the **tools** folder instead of the custom **bin** folder. As it stands, there is no way to pack custom folders using the MSBuild **PackTask** today (that I found find).\r\n\r\n## Workaround\r\nI was able to come up with my own workaround, but it was tedious and time consuming. I'm sharing here in the hopes that it might help others until this issue is formally addressed and resolved.\r\n\r\n### Step 1\r\nMake sure that your Generic.xaml items are correctly defined. To simplify things, you'll want to define the item twice, but as different build artifacts. This will ensure that things are both compiled (e.g. \\*.xbf) and included in the build output.\r\n\r\nThis is the normal build output, but it will not be in the format that you want. In order to make that work, you can use the **Link** item metadata to control where the output will go:\r\n\r\n```xml\r\n<Page Include=\"Themes\\Generic.xaml\">\r\n <Generator>MSBuild:Compile</Generator>\r\n <SubType>Designer</SubType>\r\n <!-- the compiler generates Generic.xbf -->\r\n <Link>$(PackageId)\\Themes\\Generic.xaml</Link>\r\n</Page>\r\n\r\n<Content Include=\"Themes\\Generic.xaml\">\r\n <Link>$(PackageId)\\Themes\\Generic.xaml</Link>\r\n <CopyToOutputDirectory>PreserveNewest</CopyToOutputDirectory>\r\n <!-- this prevents the PackTask from putting it in the\r\n      \"content\" package folder, which we don't want -->\r\n <Pack>false</Pack>\r\n</Content>\r\n```\r\n\r\n### Step 2\r\nNow that the content is in the build output in the structure we want, you need to include it in the NuSpec metadata.

At present, the MSBuild NuGet [PackTask](https://github.com/NuGet/NuGet.Client/blob/63e8539791d4f662efffceb2185ad4510396d76e/src/NuGet.Core/NuGet.Build.Tasks.Pack/PackTask.cs) only supports including Package Resource Index (\\*.pri) files.\r\n\r\n## Overview\r\nWinRT applications that include custom controls often also include default styles and themes in the **Generic.xaml** file. The compiler also generates a few additional, related files that must be included in the NuGet package, including:\r\n\r\n* Generic.xbf\r\n* _[Package Id]_.xr.xml\r\n\r\nThese files are required to have a very specific folder structure in the package:\r\n\r\n```\r\nlib\r\n└─ [tfm]\r\n   ├─ [package id]\r\n   │  ├─ Themes\r\n   │  │  ├─ Generic.xaml\r\n   │  │  └─ Generic.xbf\r\n   │  └─ [package id].xr.xml\r\n   ├─ [package id].dll\r\n   └─ [package id].pri\r\n```\r\n\r\nIf these files are not included in this exact structure, then the default theme and other style information will fail to be picked up by package consumers.\r\n\r\n## Problem\r\nDespite numerous attempts to specify the correct MSBuild items and metadata, I was unable to make the **PackTask** include these additional files using the required package paths. Upon closer examination of the [MSBuildProjectFactory](https://github.com/NuGet/NuGet.Client/blob/6ca0c29c28ac3d0f52dcda3c178e3c3c3b8b80bf/src/NuGet.Core/NuGet.Commands/MSBuildProjectFactory.cs), it seems that only \\*.pri files are considered and all other uncognized files are ignored. The **NuGet.Build.Tasks.Pack.targets** also include a special build target for the [_AddPriFileToPackBuildOutput](https://github.com/NuGet/NuGet.Client/blob/6ca0c29c28ac3d0f52dcda3c178e3c3c3b8b80bf/src/NuGet.Core/NuGet.Build.Tasks.Pack/Pack.targets#L293).\r\n\r\nI tried using the same approach for the other WinRT files, but I was unable to get the files to pack into the correct subfolders. It is possible to create the desired \\*.nuspec manually, but all of the great benefits from using MSBuild, in particular package dependencies, are lost and must also be managed manually.\r\n\r\nPrevious discussions on this topic include #3225 and #3293, which were solved by manually crafting the \\*.nuspec file.\r\n\r\n## Proposed Fix\r\nThe **PackTask** should automatically detect these files and correctly include them in the generated NuSpec metadata.\r\n\r\nIt should also be noted that this behavior does not apply to Windows Presentation Foundation (WPF), even though it too has Generic.xaml files. The compiler compiles WPF Generic.xaml files to a \\*.baml file, which is included in the output \\*.dll as an embedded resource.\r\n\r\n## Recommendations\r\nWhile default behaviors and conventions should be supported by the **PackTask**, the task should also support explicitly specifying additional content to pack. Since such items are explicit, they should be included without filtering. This behavior allows packing build output that may not follow the expected conventions understood by the **PackTask**. Warnings may optionally be emmitted by package validation when unconventional content is added.\r\n\r\nFor example:\r\n```xml\r\n<ItemGroup>\r\n <!-- the \"Pack\" metadata item shouldn't be necessary since the mere\r\n      existence of these items means that we want them packed -->\r\n <CustomPackageFile Include=\"bin\\*.*\">\r\n  <PackagePath>bin\\</PackagePath>\r\n </CustomPackageFile>\r\n</ItemGroup>\r\n```\r\n\r\nAs a practical example, you might have a _build-only_ package that has varying \\*.targets by platform, but a single build task assembly. This assembly can be placed in an unconventional folder, which negates the need to include the same assembly or other content multiple times. In some cases, this can significantly reduce the final package size.\r\n\r\nFor example:\r\n```\r\nbin\r\n├─ Tasks.dll\r\n└─ BuildTool.exe\r\n\r\nbuild\r\n├─ net45\r\n│  └─ MyPackage.targets\r\n├─ netstandard1.0\r\n│  └─ MyPackage.targets\r\n└─ uap10.0\r\n   └─ MyPackage.targets\r\n```\r\n\r\nArguably, you could probably use the **tools** folder instead of the custom **bin** folder. As it stands, there is no way to pack custom folders using the MSBuild **PackTask** today (that I found find).\r\n\r\n## Workaround\r\nI was able to come up with my own workaround, but it was tedious and time consuming. I'm sharing here in the hopes that it might help others until this issue is formally addressed and resolved.\r\n\r\n### Step 1\r\nMake sure that your Generic.xaml items are correctly defined. To simplify things, you'll want to define the item twice, but as different build artifacts. This will ensure that things are both compiled (e.g. \\*.xbf) and included in the build output.\r\n\r\nThis is the normal build output, but it will not be in the format that you want. In order to make that work, you can use the **Link** item metadata to control where the output will go:\r\n\r\n```xml\r\n<Page Include=\"Themes\\Generic.xaml\">\r\n <Generator>MSBuild:Compile</Generator>\r\n <SubType>Designer</SubType>\r\n <!-- the compiler generates Generic.xbf -->\r\n <Link>$(PackageId)\\Themes\\Generic.xaml</Link>\r\n</Page>\r\n\r\n<Content Include=\"Themes\\Generic.xaml\">\r\n <Link>$(PackageId)\\Themes\\Generic.xaml</Link>\r\n <CopyToOutputDirectory>PreserveNewest</CopyToOutputDirectory>\r\n <!-- this prevents the PackTask from putting it in the\r\n      \"content\" package folder, which we don't want -->\r\n <Pack>false</Pack>\r\n</Content>\r\n```\r\n\r\n### Step 2\r\nNow that the content is in the build output in the structure we want, you need to include it in the NuSpec metadata. There are several ways this can be done, but I chose to use a use a C# script (\\*.csx).\r\n\r\n```c#\r\n#r \"System.Xml.Linq.dll\"\r\n\r\nusing System;\r\nusing System.Linq;\r\nusing System.Xml.Linq;\r\n\r\nvar nuspec = Args[0];\r\nvar src = Args[1];\r\nvar target = Args[2];\r\nvar doc = XDocument.Load( nuspec );\r\nvar xmlns = (XNamespace) \"http://schemas.microsoft.com/packaging/2013/01/nuspec.xsd\";\r\nvar files = doc.Root.Element( xmlns + \"files\" );\r\n\r\nif ( files == null )\r\n{\r\n    doc.Root.Add( files = new XElement( xmlns + \"files\" ) );\r\n}\r\n\r\nfiles.Add(\r\n    new XElement(\r\n        xmlns + \"file\",\r\n        new XAttribute( \"src\", src ),\r\n        new XAttribute( \"target\", target ) ) );\r\n\r\ndoc.Save( nuspec );\r\n```\r\n\r\n### Step 3\r\nWith build output and script in hand, we need to hook the two together using a custom build target (based on VS2017):\r\n\r\n```xml\r\n<?xml version=\"1.0\" encoding=\"utf-8\"?>\r\n<Project xmlns=\"http://schemas.microsoft.com/developer/msbuild/2003\">\r\n\r\n <PropertyGroup>\r\n  <SolutionDir Condition=\" '$(SolutionDir)' == '' \">$([System.IO.Path]::GetFullPath(\"$(MSBuildThisFileDirectory)..\"))\\</SolutionDir>\r\n  <CsiExe>$(MSBuildToolsPath)\\Roslyn\\csi.exe</CsiExe>\r\n  <CsiLibPath>$(MSBuildToolsPath)</CsiLibPath>\r\n </PropertyGroup>\r\n\r\n <Target Name=\"AddXamlThemeFilesToNuspec\">\r\n\r\n  <PropertyGroup>\r\n   <CsiScript>$(SolutionDir)tools\\add-nuspec-xaml-content.csx</CsiScript>\r\n  </PropertyGroup>\r\n\r\n  <ItemGroup>\r\n   <XamlThemeFile Include=\"$(BinPath)$(TargetFramework)\\**\\*.xaml;$(BinPath)$(TargetFramework)\\**\\*.xbf\">\r\n    <PackagePath>lib\\$(TargetFramework)\\$(PackageId)\\Themes\\</PackagePath>\r\n   </XamlThemeFile>\r\n   <XamlThemeFile Include=\"$(BinPath)$(TargetFramework)\\**\\*.xr.xml\">\r\n    <PackagePath>lib\\$(TargetFramework)\\$(PackageId)\\</PackagePath>\r\n   </XamlThemeFile>\r\n  </ItemGroup>\r\n\r\n  <Exec Command=\"&quot;$(CsiExe)&quot; /lib:&quot;$(CsiLibPath)&quot; &quot;$(CsiScript)&quot; &quot;$(NuspecFile)&quot; &quot;%(XamlThemeFile.Identity)&quot; &quot;@(XamlThemeFile->'%(PackagePath)%(Filename)%(Extension)')&quot;\"\r\n        Condition=\" '@(XamlThemeFile)' != '' \" />\r\n\r\n </Target>\r\n\r\n <Target Name=\"ForEachTargetFramework\"\r\n         AfterTargets=\"Build\"\r\n         DependsOnTargets=\"GenerateNuspec\"\r\n         Condition=\" '$(GeneratePackageOnBuild)' == 'true' AND '$(IsInnerBuild)' != 'true' \">\r\n\r\n  <!-- re-initial required properties that are otherwise no longer available -->\r\n  <PropertyGroup>\r\n   <ProjectDir Condition=\" '$(ProjectDir)' == '' \">$([System.IO.Path]::GetDirectoryName('$(PackProjectInputFile)'))\\</ProjectDir>\r\n   <NuspecFile>$(ProjectDir)$(BaseIntermediateOutputPath)$(PackageId).$(PackageVersion).nuspec</NuspecFile>\r\n   <AddXamlThemeFilesToNuspecProperties>\r\n    PackageId=$(PackageId);\r\n    NuspecFile=$(NuspecFile);\r\n    SolutionDir=$(SolutionDir);\r\n    CsiExe=$(CsiExe);\r\n    CsiLibPath=$(CsiLibPath);\r\n    BuildProjectReferences=false;\r\n    BinPath=$(ProjectDir)$(OutputPath)\r\n   </AddXamlThemeFilesToNuspecProperties>\r\n  </PropertyGroup>\r\n\r\n  <!-- run the *.csx script for each target framework with additional xaml artifacts -->\r\n  <MSBuild Projects=\"$(MSBuildProjectFullPath)\"\r\n           Targets=\"AddXamlThemeFilesToNuspec\"\r\n           Properties=\"TargetFramework=%(_TargetFrameworks.Identity);$(AddXamlThemeFilesToNuspecProperties)\" />\r\n  \r\n  <!-- HACK: now that the *.nuspec contains all of the required files,\r\n       explicitly invoke the pack task using the finalized *.nuspec file -->\r\n  <PackTask PackItem=\"$(PackProjectInputFile)\"\r\n            NuspecFile=\"$(NuspecFile)\"\r\n            PackageOutputPath=\"$(PackageOutputPath)\"\r\n            NuspecOutputPath=\"$(BaseIntermediateOutputPath)\" />\r\n\r\n </Target>\r\n\r\n</Project>\r\n```\r\n\r\nThe name and location of your \\*.csx script may be different; update the paths accordingly.

We plan to remove this capability in the future, as making this change allows us to migrate all of our APIs keys to use a one-way hash and further protect against malicious use of the key.\r\n\r\n**Starting Feb 5th 2018, the 'Full access API key' cannot be copied from NuGet.org**. While most of the packages pushed to NuGet.org now use a scoped API key and are not impacted by this change, users continuing to use our legacy 'Full access API keys' will need to securely stash the key before this date after which they will not be accessible. Please note that the 'Full access API keys' will continue to work just like they did before. We are only removing the ability to copy them down from NuGet.org.\r\n\r\nIf you have further question, please reach out to us by commenting on the [discussion issue](https://github.com/NuGet/NuGetGallery/issues/5231) or send me an email at [anangaur@microsoft.com](mailto:anangaur@microsoft.com).
