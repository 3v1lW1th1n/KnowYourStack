There is usually only one reason I ever have to switch from Emulated to another option, typically None, and that's because there's styling in a third-party component that I need to override for some reason. \r\n\r\nHowever, it's annoying that I can only opt into view encapsulation as an all or nothing proposition, especially given its usefulness in simplifying my development by ensuring that I don't have colliding class names across my own various components.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Describe the solution you'd like\r\nIt would be fantastic to have a fifth option,, one that would allow me to decorate the CSS selectors in such a way so as to indicate that I'm selectively opting out of the view-encapsulation, but only for those decorated selectors.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Describe alternatives you've considered\r\nI have two options I can currently take:\r\n- Put the overriding CSS in a base file to compile into the rest of the solution\r\n- Opt out of view encapsulation on a per-component basis\r\n\r\nThe downside to the former option is that my override file is no longer a 1:1 relationship to a given component, but now becomes a clutter of various overrides. The downside to the latter is that I usually have need for CSS customization in the component apart from the few changes I apply to the component I'm overriding, and now I have to ensure that I'm without collisions all over again. In other words, either of these alternatives are less than ideal and forgo the benefits of view encapsulation in the first place.\r\n","Url":"https://github.com/angular/angular/issues/29364","RelatedDescription":"Open issue \"Partial view encapsulation\" (#29364)"},{"Id":"422021981","IsPullRequest":false,"CreatedAt":"2019-03-18T03:28:05","Actor":"Nguyendangthe","Number":"29363","RawContent":null,"Title":"[Ivy Mode] \"ng build\" and \"ng serve\" error under Ivy mode  in angular 8 beta ","State":"open","Body":"🛑🛑🛑🛑🛑🛑🛑🛑🛑🛑🛑🛑🛑🛑🛑🛑🛑🛑🛑🛑🛑🛑🛑🛑🛑🛑🛑\r\n\r\nPlease file any Angular CLI issues at: https://github.com/angular/angular-cli/issues/new\r\n\r\nFor the time being, we keep Angular CLI issues in a separate repository.\r\n\r\n🛑🛑🛑🛑🛑🛑🛑🛑🛑🛑🛑🛑🛑🛑🛑🛑🛑🛑🛑🛑🛑🛑🛑🛑🛑🛑🛑\r\n","Url":"https://github.com/angular/angular/issues/29363","RelatedDescription":"Open issue \"[Ivy Mode] \"ng build\" and \"ng serve\" error under Ivy mode  in angular 8 beta \" (#29363)"},{"Id":"421989757","IsPullRequest":false,"CreatedAt":"2019-03-17T23:53:12","Actor":"rcketscientist","Number":"29362","RawContent":null,"Title":"Ivy, ngcc: InlineSVGModule.forRoot() yields \"is not a reference\"","State":"open","Body":"<!--🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅\r\n\r\nOh hi there! 😄\r\n\r\nTo expedite issue processing please search open and closed issues before submitting a new one.\r\nExisting issues often contain information about workarounds, resolution, or progress updates.\r\n\r\n🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅-->\r\n\r\n\r\n# 🐞 bug report\r\n\r\n### Description\r\n\r\n<!-- ✍️--> A clear and concise description of the problem...\r\nDuring `ivy-ngcc` I crash on a module with this error:\r\n`Value at position 2 in the NgModule.importss of AlloyIconModule is not a reference: [object Ob`\r\n\r\nthe culprit has these imports:\r\n```\r\n  imports: [\r\n      CommonModule,\r\n      HttpClientModule,\r\n      InlineSVGModule.forRoot()\r\n  ]\r\n```\r\n\r\nIt appears that `InlineSVGModule.forRoot()` cannot be processed.\r\nPlease let me know any further steps I can take to debug.\r\n\r\nPossibly related:\r\nhttps://github.com/angular/angular/pull/27326\r\nhttps://github.com/angular/angular/issues/27582\r\n\r\n## 🔬 Minimal Reproduction\r\n<!--\r\nPlease create and share minimal reproduction of the issue starting with this template: https://stackblitz.com/fork/angular-issue-repro2\r\n-->\r\n<!-- ✍️--> https://stackblitz.com/...\r\n\r\n<!--\r\nIf StackBlitz is not suitable for reproduction of your issue, please create a minimal GitHub repository with the reproduction of the issue.\r\nA good way to make a minimal reproduction is to create a new app via `ng new repro-app` and add the minimum possible code to show the problem. \r\nShare the link to the repo below along with step-by-step instructions to reproduce the problem, as well as expected and actual behavior.\r\n\r\nIssues that don't have enough info and can't be reproduced will be closed.\r\n\r\nYou can read more about issue submission guidelines here: https://github.com/angular/angular/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md#-submitting-an-issue\r\n-->\r\n\r\n## 🔥 Exception or Error\r\n<pre><code>\r\n<!-- If the issue is accompanied by an exception or an error, please share it below: -->\r\n<!-- ✍️-->\r\n\r\n</code></pre>\r\n\r\n\r\n## 🌍  Your Environment\r\n\r\n**Angular Version:**\r\n<pre><code>\r\n<!-- run `ng version` and paste output below -->\r\n<!-- ✍️-->\r\n8b8\r\n</code></pre>\r\n\r\n**Anything else relevant?**\r\n<!-- ✍️Is this a browser specific issue?

I was able to pass extra args with 1.7.X builds but with new CLI versions I can't simply because CLI is very restrictive. \r\n\r\n\r\n### Describe the solution you'd like\r\nDevelopers should be able to pass custom arguments to ng serve command. Classic example as follows. Our current project has so many API endpoints like DEV1, DEV2... SIT1, SIT2, SVP to PROD. So with previous NG CLI versions we had our custom proxy conf file which reads an argument like  endpoint and then proxy to the correct API endpoint. But with new limitation we are unable to do that.\r\nE.g. \r\n`ng serve --ssl true --proxy-config proxy.conf.js --endpoint sit1`\r\n\r\nproxy conf.\r\n\r\n```\r\nconst ENDPOINTS = {\r\n\tlocal: {\r\n\t\tendpoint: 'https://localhost:9443',\r\n\t\tmockEam: true\r\n\t},\r\n\tdev1: {\r\n\t\tendpoint: 'https:/dev.test.com.au',\r\n                autoRewrite: true,\r\n                changeOrigin: true,\r\n\t\tproxy: false\r\n\t},\r\n\tsit1: {\r\n\t\tendpoint: 'https://dev.test.com.au',\r\n                autoRewrite: true,\r\n                changeOrigin: true,\r\n                proxy: true\r\n\t},\r\n\tuat1: {\r\n\t\tendpoint: 'https://uat.test.com.au'\r\n\t},\r\n\tsvp1: {\r\n\t\tendpoint: 'https://svp.test.com.au',\r\n\t\tproxy: true\r\n\t}\r\n};\r\n```\r\n\r\n\r\n### Describe alternatives you've considered\r\nCan't think of any alternatives other than modify the endpoint manually every time which is a poor developer experience.\r\n","Url":"https://github.com/angular/angular-cli/issues/13937","RelatedDescription":"Open issue \"Enable custom arguments in serve command\" (#13937)"},{"Id":"421974113","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2019-03-17T21:18:22","Actor":"clydin","Number":"13936","RawContent":null,"Title":"feat(@angular-devkit/build-angular): implement stable architect API for karma","State":"open","Body":"This is a continuation of the Angular builder refactoring following the introduction of the new stable architect builder API.\r\nAdditional refactoring and cleanup are possible.
