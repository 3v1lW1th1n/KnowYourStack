Specifically, in this mode,\r\nevents do not automatically mark OnPush views as dirty. Only changed\r\ninputs and manual calls to `markDirty()` actually mark a view dirty.\r\n\r\nHowever, this mode cannot be the default for OnPush components if we\r\nwant to be backwards compatible with View Engine. This commit re-adds\r\nthe legacy logic for OnPush components where events always mark views\r\ndirty and makes it the default behavior.\r\n\r\nNote: It is still TODO to add a public API for manual change detection.\r\n","Url":"https://github.com/angular/angular/pull/28462","RelatedDescription":"Open PR \"WIP - fix(ivy): mark view as dirty by default when events fire\" (#28462)"},{"Id":"404831712","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2019-01-31T01:40:57","Actor":"pkozlowski-opensource","Number":"28450","RawContent":null,"Title":"refactor(ivy): remove firstTemplatePass as global state","State":"closed","Body":"Feels good to remove global state and few lines of code, isn't it?","Url":"https://github.com/angular/angular/pull/28450","RelatedDescription":"Closed or merged PR \"refactor(ivy): remove firstTemplatePass as global state\" (#28450)"},{"Id":"405011417","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2019-01-31T00:06:47","Actor":"kyliau","Number":"28460","RawContent":null,"Title":"fix(bazel): fix integration test for bazel-schematics","State":"closed","Body":"With the release of @angular/bazel v7.2.3, the npm install step right\r\nafter `ng new` installs this version. However there is a bug in the\r\nbuilder which results in bazel executable not found.\r\n\r\nThis bug was not discovered before because the dependencies of the\r\nproject created by `ng new` are not pinned.\r\n\r\nThe fix is to pin the version of @angular/bazel to 7.2.2 which relies on\r\nglobal installation of bazel.

Instead, changed to recommending `providedIn`. Kept the discussion about `forRoot()` in `singleton-services.md` because it explains the technique and sheds light on use of Router and the importance of the Router's single instance. Changed the former CoreModule into a greeting module (greets user in the NgModules example). It still provides a service, as a simple demo to show how `forRoot()` and `forChild` work as a simple example of the Router/singletons and how to check to see if an NgModule has already been loaded.\r\n\r\n## Does this PR introduce a breaking change?\r\n\r\n- [ ] Yes\r\n- [x] No\r\n\r\n\r\n<!-- If this PR contains a breaking change, please describe the impact and migration path for existing applications below. -->\r\n\r\n\r\n## Other information\r\n\r\n- Fixed validation in example. \r\n- Removed NgModules FAQ example and replaced it with references to the NgModules example (which was nearly identical but the NgModules example has updates). \r\n- Fixed some styles. \r\n- Did some general cleanup of spacing in style guide. \r\n- Fixed passive voice and grammar issues. \r\n- Fixed e2e test of validation.\r\n- Replaced NgModel usage in Reactive form in example according to upcoming recommendation for v.7.\r\n\r\n","Url":"https://github.com/angular/angular/pull/28434","RelatedDescription":"Open PR \"docs: take out coremodule references\" (#28434)"},{"Id":"404450449","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2019-01-29T19:31:16","Actor":"jasonaden","Number":"28433","RawContent":null,"Title":"Revert \"feat(compiler-cli): expose ngtsc as a TscPlugin\"","State":"closed","Body":"This reverts commit df2221c6476df1f2d2478b949702f3270c3a4565 from PR #28431.\r\n","Url":"https://github.com/angular/angular/pull/28433","RelatedDescription":"Closed or merged PR \"Revert \"feat(compiler-cli): expose ngtsc as a TscPlugin\"\" (#28433)"}],"ResultType":"GitHubIssue"},"AngularCli-Issues":{"Issues":[{"Id":"405082984","IsPullRequest":false,"CreatedAt":"2019-01-31T05:05:07","Actor":"wkurniawan07","Number":"13550","RawContent":null,"Title":"Regression in 7.3.0 when choosing SASS as preprocessor","State":"open","Body":"# üêû Bug report\r\n\r\n### Command (mark with an `x`)\r\n<!-- Can you pin-point the command or commands that are effected by this bug? -->\r\n<!-- ‚úçÔ∏èedit: -->\r\n```\r\n- [x] new\r\n- [x] build\r\n- [x] serve\r\n- [ ] test\r\n- [ ] e2e\r\n- [ ] generate\r\n- [ ] add\r\n- [ ] update\r\n- [ ] lint\r\n- [ ] xi18n\r\n- [ ] run\r\n- [ ] config\r\n- [ ] help\r\n- [ ] version\r\n- [ ] doc\r\n```\r\n\r\n### Is this a regression?\r\n\r\n<!-- Did this behavior use to work in the previous version? -->\r\nYes, the previous version in which this bug was not present was: All 7.x before 7.3.0\r\n\r\n### Description\r\n\r\nWhen choosing Sass as the stylesheet preprocessor, CLI produces `styles.scss` but `angular.json` expects `styles.sass`.\r\nPrevious available choice of \"Scss\" is gone.\r\n\r\n## üî¨ Minimal Reproduction\r\n\r\n1. `ng new`\r\n1.

The `@ngtools/webpack` package can not be resolved. This happens due to a yarn monorepo structure, in which `@ngtools/webpack` will not be placed in the root `./node_modules` folder due conflicts with other dependencies, so it gets placed under `./node_modules/@angular-devkit/build-angular/node_modules`. And then it can not be found during build.\r\n\r\nI tracked down the issue and found the source. You can see the problem also in issue #10220. It was fixed by @hansl in the old single repo: https://github.com/angular/devkit/pull/647 but didn't get copied to the new monorepo? --> https://github.com/angular/angular-cli/blob/master/packages/angular_devkit/build_angular/src/angular-cli-files/models/webpack-configs/typescript.ts#L23\r\n\r\n**Can we do this change once again?**\r\n\r\nIf I change those lines locally the build is successful, but I do not know if we can simply change this without other problems?\r\n\r\nNote: If you have a monorepo with only one angular application this problem should not happen, but in my case the monorepo has also some angularjs applications and multiple webpack configurations. So multiple webpack, loader and angular dependency versions are around, not all aligned.\r\n\r\n\r\n## üî¨ Minimal Reproduction\r\n\r\nReproduction repo: https://github.com/fabianbru/angular-cli-bug-reproduction\r\nThis repo is a striped down repo, so there are many dependencies without real code.\r\n\r\nStep-by-Step guide:\r\n- Node 10 (Node version should not matter)\r\n- yarn 1.13.0\r\n- Checkout\r\n- run `yarn` in the root to install all dependencies\r\n- run `yarn dev` in the root\r\n--> ERROR will occur\r\n- change lines 7-9 locally in `node_modules/@angular-devkit/build-angular/src/angular-cli-files/models/webpack-configs/typescript.js` to:\r\n```\r\nconst webpackLoader = require.resolve('@ngtools/webpack')\r\n```\r\n---> build should be successful\r\n\r\n## üî• Exception or Error\r\n<pre><code>\r\n<!-- If the issue is accompanied by an exception or an error, please share it below: -->\r\nERROR in multi <workspace-path>/angular-cli-bug-reproduction/node_modules/webpack-dev-server/client?http://0.0.0.0:0 webpack/hot/dev-server ./src/main.ts\r\nModule not found: Error: Can't resolve '@ngtools/webpack' in '<workspace-path>/angular-cli-bug-reproduction/packages/angular'\r\nERROR in multi ./src/polyfills.ts\r\nModule not found: Error: Can't resolve '@ngtools/webpack' in '<workspace-path>/angular-cli-bug-reproduction/packages/angular'\r\n\r\n<workspace-path> is the path to my workspace, like `/Users/xyz/workspace`\r\n</code></pre>\r\n\r\n\r\n## üåç Your Environment\r\n<pre><code>\r\n<!-- run `ng version` and paste output below -->\r\nAngular CLI: 7.2.3\r\nNode: 10.15.0\r\nOS: darwin x64\r\nAngular: 7.2.2\r\n... animations, cdk, common, compiler, compiler-cli, core, forms\r\n... http, language-service, material, platform-browser\r\n... platform-browser-dynamic, platform-server, router\r\n\r\nPackage                           Version\r\n-----------------------------------------------------------\r\n@angular-devkit/architect         0.12.3\r\n@angular-devkit/build-angular     0.12.3\r\n@angular-devkit/build-optimizer   0.12.3\r\n@angular-devkit/core              7.2.3\r\n@angular-devkit/schematics        7.2.3\r\n@angular/cli                      7.2.3\r\n@angular/flex-layout              7.0.0-beta.23\r\n@schematics/angular               7.2.3\r\n@schematics/update                0.12.3\r\nrxjs                              6.3.3\r\ntypescript                        3.2.4\r\nwebpack                           4.29.0\r\n</code></pre>\r\n\r\n**Anything else relevant?**","Url":"https://github.com/angular/angular-cli/issues/13539","RelatedDescription":"Open issue \"Can't resolve '@ngtools/webpack' in yarn monorepo\" (#13539)"},{"Id":"403854098","IsPullRequest":false,"CreatedAt":"2019-01-28T16:17:25","Actor":"jsdiaz19","Number":"13535","RawContent":null,"Title":"how resolve unchanged chunks angular cli","State":"closed","Body":"when i run command 'npm start', its dont excetue the lastest changes and the console show this:\r\n\r\n7 unchanged chunks\r\nchunk {main} main.js, main.js.map (main) 73.7 kB [initial] [rendered]\r\ni ÔΩ¢wdmÔΩ£: Compiled successfully.\r\n\r\n¬øwhat mean unchanged chunks?\r\nwith this error, i cant work\r\n\r\n","Url":"https://github.com/angular/angular-cli/issues/13535","RelatedDescription":"Closed issue \"how resolve unchanged chunks angular cli\" (#13535)"},{"Id":"403851631","IsPullRequest":false,"CreatedAt":"2019-01-28T16:16:33","Actor":"jsdiaz19","Number":"13534","RawContent":null,"Title":"how resolve unchanged chunks in angular cli","State":"closed","Body":"<!--üîÖüîÖüîÖüîÖüîÖüîÖüîÖüîÖüîÖüîÖüîÖüîÖüîÖüîÖüîÖüîÖüîÖüîÖüîÖüîÖüîÖüîÖüîÖüîÖüîÖüîÖüîÖüîÖüîÖüîÖüîÖ\r\n\r\nOh hi there! üòÑ\r\n\r\nTo expedite issue processing please search open and closed issues before submitting a new one.\r\nExisting issues often contain information about workarounds, resolution, or progress updates.\r\n\r\nüîÖüîÖüîÖüîÖüîÖüîÖüîÖüîÖüîÖüîÖüîÖüîÖüîÖüîÖüîÖüîÖüîÖüîÖüîÖüîÖüîÖüîÖüîÖüîÖüîÖüîÖüîÖüîÖüîÖüîÖüîÖüîÖüîÖ-->\r\n\r\n\r\n# üêû Bug report\r\n\r\n### Command (mark with an `x`)\r\n<!-- Can you pin-point the command or commands that are effected by this bug?

If you navigate to the template for the controller, and remove the `trackBy` function from the `mat-tree` element, you will find that upon clicking 'new' the tree will continue to collapse, but you will be able to re-expand individual nodes and see the new leaf.\r\n\r\nhttps://stackblitz.com/edit/angular-afy2h1","Url":"https://github.com/angular/material2/issues/15015","RelatedDescription":"Open issue \"(bug)[Mat-Tree] - Problematic behavior when combining dynamic data with trackby\" (#15015)"},{"Id":"404810196","IsPullRequest":false,"CreatedAt":"2019-01-30T16:39:45","Actor":"vadjs","Number":"15008","RawContent":null,"Title":"[MatTable], [MatSort] Sorting stops work if table has *ngIf attribute","State":"closed","Body":"#### What is the expected behavior?\r\nSorting should work correct.\r\n\r\n#### What is the current behavior?\r\n```\r\n<table *ngIf='true' mat-table [dataSource]=\"dataSource\" matSort>\r\n```\r\n`*ngIf` makes sorting not work.\r\n\r\n#### What are the steps to reproduce?\r\nhttps://stackblitz.com/edit/angular-sn7pfz?file=app/table-sorting-example.html\r\n\r\n#### Which versions of Angular, Material, OS, TypeScript, browsers are affected?\r\nAngular = 7.2.2\r\nMaterial = 7.3.0\r\nOS = ALL\r\nTypeScript = ALL\r\n\r\n#### Is there anything else we should know?\r\n","Url":"https://github.com/angular/material2/issues/15008","RelatedDescription":"Closed issue \"[MatTable], [MatSort] Sorting stops work if table has *ngIf attribute\" (#15008)"},{"Id":"404847503","IsPullRequest":false,"CreatedAt":"2019-01-30T16:15:29","Actor":"mfairchild365","Number":"15013","RawContent":null,"Title":"Icon example is missing alternative text","State":"open","Body":"#### What is the expected behavior?\r\nInformative icons must convey their meaning to users of screen reader software.\r\n\r\n#### What is the current behavior?\r\nThe informative icon in the example does not convey its meaning to users to screen reader software.\r\n\r\n#### What are the steps to reproduce?\r\n1.
