This way the `baseUrl` for e2e test run will be created correctly.\r\n\r\nAlternatively, the value of `baseUrl` option passed in protractor config could be respected, and concatenated with the calculated host from `publicHost` option. However, this way there is duplicate configuration: base url will be specified both for serve command and for e2e command.\r\n\r\n\r\n## üî¨ Minimal Reproduction\r\n\r\nTo reproduce, set the serve configuration options as following:\r\n```json\r\n\"options\": {\r\n    \"browserTarget\": \"myapp:build\",\r\n    \"baseHref\": \"/custom-namespace/\",\r\n    \"publicHost\": \"https://localhost/custom-namespace/\"\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nThen run `ng e2e`. \r\n\r\n<!--\r\nSimple steps to reproduce this bug.\r\n\r\nPlease include: commands run (including args), packages added, related code changes.\r\n\r\nIf reproduction steps are not enough for reproduction of your issue, please create a minimal GitHub repository with the reproduction of the issue. \r\nA good way to make a minimal reproduction is to create a new app via `ng new repro-app` and add the minimum possible code to show the problem. \r\nShare the link to the repo below along with step-by-step instructions to reproduce the problem, as well as expected and actual behavior.\r\n\r\nIssues that don't have enough info and can't be reproduced will be closed.\r\n\r\nYou can read more about issue submission guidelines here: https://github.com/angular/angular-cli/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md#-submitting-an-issue\r\n-->\r\n\r\n## üî• Exception or Error\r\n\r\nThe browser will open with URL: `https://localhost/` instead of `https://localhost/custom-namespace/`\r\n\r\n\r\n## üåç Your Environment\r\n\r\nIt seems that my environment is older compared to the latest commit in this repository.
