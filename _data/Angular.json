This surfaces an issue with the Angular compiler where use of `forwardRef` results in broken code. \r\n\r\nSay you have some source code like this:\r\n```ts\r\n@Component({...})\r\nexport class MatCalendarHeader {\r\n  constructor(@Inject(forwardRef(() => MatCalendar)) calendar: MatCalendar, ...) { ... }\r\n}\r\n\r\n@Component({...})\r\nexport class MatCalendar { ... }\r\n```\r\n\r\nWith ES5, the JS output for this will look something like:\r\n```js\r\n    var MatCalendarHeader = /** @class */ (function () {\r\n        function MatCalendarHeader(calendar, _dateAdapter, _dateFormats, changeDetectorRef) {\r\n          /** ... */\r\n        }\r\n        /** ... */\r\n        MatCalendarHeader = tslib_1.__decorate([\r\n            core_1.Component({ /** ... */ }),\r\n            tslib_1.__param(1, core_1.Inject(core_1.forwardRef(function () { return MatCalendar; }))),\r\n            tslib_1.__param(2, core_1.Optional()),\r\n            tslib_1.__param(3, core_1.Optional()), tslib_1.__param(3, core_1.Inject(core_2.MAT_DATE_FORMATS)),\r\n            tslib_1.__metadata(\"design:paramtypes\", [datepicker_intl_1.MatDatepickerIntl,\r\n                MatCalendar,\r\n                core_2.DateAdapter, Object, core_1.ChangeDetectorRef])\r\n        ], MatCalendarHeader);\r\n        return MatCalendarHeader;\r\n    }());\r\n    exports.MatCalendarHeader = MatCalendarHeader;\r\n\r\n    var MatCalendar = /** @class */ (function () {\r\n        function MatCalendar(/** ... */) { }\r\n        /** ... */\r\n        return MatCalendar;\r\n    }());\r\n```\r\n\r\nNotice a few key things:\r\n1. `MatCalendar` is referenced in the `__decorate` block of `MatCalendarHeader` because it's used in the type position for a constructor param\r\n2. `MatCalendar` is declared _after_ `MatCalendarHeader`\r\n3. `MatCalendar` is declared with `var`.\r\n\r\nWith the ES2015 output, the result is mostly the same, except that the use of `var` is now `let`. This causes a run-time error because the value of `MatCalendar` is read before it is initialized.\r\n\r\nThe workaround for this it to modify the tsconfig used by bazel to include\r\n```json\r\n  \"bazelOptions\": {\r\n    \"devmodeTargetOverride\": \"es5\"\r\n  }\r\n```","Url":"https://github.com/angular/angular/issues/29107","RelatedDescription":"Open issue \"forwardRef run-time error with ES2015 output under bazel\" (#29107)"},{"Id":"416814738","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2019-03-04T22:43:21","Actor":"pkozlowski-opensource","Number":"29094","RawContent":null,"Title":"test(ivy): remove ngComponentOutlet example with a lazy-loaded NgModule","State":"closed","Body":"This PR _removes_ one of the existing examples and the associated e2e test. This might sound like a terrible thing to do (why would one remove an example from documentation???) but I will argue that this example does more harm than good.\r\n\r\nThere are multiple levels of problems with the code being demonstrated and the test setup, let me explain it step by step:\r\n\r\n- the primary problem is in the API of `ngComponentOutlet` - this directive takes component `Type` and `NgModuleFactory` as `@Input()`s. Normally the  `Type` should be enough but in view engine it is not enough for lazy loaded modules. So `NgModuleFactory` was introduced to support components from lazy-loaded modules but this is wrong API - `componentFactoryResolver` should have been used instead as it would cover both regular and lazy-loaded modules;\r\n- `Type` was used instead of `componentFactoryResolver` since dealing with `componentFactoryResolver` is less ergonomic as compared to simply using `Type`. But this limitation will go away in ivy so introducing `componentFactoryResolver` into `ngComponentOutlet` at this point would just confuse everyone;\r\n- so we are stuck with `NgModuleFactory` before ivy is default but getting an instance of  `NgModuleFactory` in practice is super-difficult for an end-user - one either need to lazy-load it _or_ use a `Compiler` (as in the example being deleted). I don't think that we want to teach people usage of `Compiler` for lazy loaded modules so this is why I'm claiming that the current example does more harm than good (teaches `Compiler` instead of lazy loading).\r\n\r\nWith ivy all those workflows (lazy loading, dynamic component instantiation) will get dramatically simpler so there is no great value in building examples on broken APIs and overly complex workflows.\r\n\r\nAs such I'm proposing the following:\r\n* pre-ivy - re-move the confusing example (this is done in this PR);\r\n* post-ivy: depreciate `ngComponentOutletNgModuleFactory !: NgModuleFactory<any>;` input ","Url":"https://github.com/angular/angular/pull/29094","RelatedDescription":"Closed or merged PR \"test(ivy): remove ngComponentOutlet example with a lazy-loaded NgModule\" (#29094)"},{"Id":"416967251","IsPullRequest":false,"CreatedAt":"2019-03-04T22:32:35","Actor":"micheladennis","Number":"29104","RawContent":null,"Title":"SyntaxError: expected expression, got '<' whenever basehref is changed in production/dist","State":"closed","Body":"### Description\r\n\r\nWhenever I change basehref to \"/v2/\" (or any other value other than \"/\") I get the following error:\r\nSyntaxError: expected expression, got '<'\r\n\r\nWorks in development - ng serve --base-href /v2/\r\n\r\n## 🔬 Minimal Reproduction\r\nTerminal\r\n```\r\n$ ng new testng\r\n$ cd testng\r\n$ ng build --prod --base-href /v2/\r\n\r\n```\r\nDeploy dist folder to nginx server\r\n\r\nEasy - Docker Deployment for Reproducing\r\n\r\n\r\nnginx default.conf\r\n\r\n```\r\nserver {\r\n  listen 80;\r\n  charset utf-8;\r\n  sendfile on;\r\n  root /usr/share/nginx/html;\r\n   \r\n  location / {\r\n    expires -1;\r\n    add_header Pragma \"no-cache\";\r\n    add_header Cache-Control \"no-store, no-cache, must-revalidate, post-check=0, pre-check=0\";\r\n  \r\n    try_files $uri $uri/ /index.html = 404;\r\n  }\r\n      \r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nDockerfile\r\n```\r\nFROM nginx:alpine\r\n\r\nENV DEPLOYMENT_FOLDER deployment/docker\r\nENV DIST dist/testng\r\n\r\n#create the server and location configuration\r\nCOPY $DEPLOYMENT_FOLDER/default.conf /etc/nginx/conf.d/default.conf\r\n#copies the build app to the default location\r\nCOPY $DIST /usr/share/nginx/html\r\n```\r\n\r\n`$ docker build -f Dockerfile -t testng:0.1 .`\r\n`$ docker run --name testng -p 8083:80 -d testng:0.1`\r\n\r\n\r\n## 🔬 Expected Results\r\nhttps://server/v2/ show page data\r\n\r\n## 🔬 Actually Results / 🔥 Exception or Error\r\nhttps://server/v2/ -- Blank Page\r\n\r\nSyntaxError: expected expression, got '<'[Learn More] runtime.06daa30a2963fa413676.js:1\r\nSyntaxError: expected expression, got '<'[Learn More] polyfills.f4b78b65941f8063fd57.js:1\r\nSyntaxError: expected expression, got '<'[Learn More] main.41370b040b122bba133b.js:1 \r\n\r\n## Other Info\r\nAngular CLI: 6.2.9\r\nNode: 8.10.0\r\nOS: linux x64\r\nAngular: 6.1.10\r\n... animations, common, compiler, compiler-cli, core, forms\r\n... http, language-service, platform-browser\r\n... platform-browser-dynamic, router\r\n\r\nPackage                           Version\r\n-----------------------------------------------------------\r\n@angular-devkit/architect         0.8.9\r\n@angular-devkit/build-angular     0.8.9\r\n@angular-devkit/build-optimizer   0.8.9\r\n@angular-devkit/build-webpack     0.8.9\r\n@angular-devkit/core              0.8.9\r\n@angular-devkit/schematics        0.8.9\r\n@angular/cli                      6.2.9\r\n@ngtools/webpack                  6.2.9\r\n@schematics/angular               0.8.9\r\n@schematics/update                0.8.9\r\nrxjs                              6.2.2\r\ntypescript                        2.9.2\r\nwebpack                           4.16.4\r\n","Url":"https://github.com/angular/angular/issues/29104","RelatedDescription":"Closed issue \"SyntaxError: expected expression, got '<' whenever basehref is changed in production/dist\" (#29104)"},{"Id":"416980629","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2019-03-04T21:38:50","Actor":"devversion","Number":"29105","RawContent":null,"Title":"ci: print sauce-connect log output on timeout [patch]","State":"closed","Body":"Patch version of #29084 ","Url":"https://github.com/angular/angular/pull/29105","RelatedDescription":"Closed or merged PR \"ci: print sauce-connect log output on timeout [patch]\" (#29105)"},{"Id":"416983661","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2019-03-04T20:41:34","Actor":"devversion","Number":"29106","RawContent":null,"Title":"ci: bazel saucelabs test job does not setup circleci bazelrc","State":"open","Body":"Currently the `test_saucelabs` job does not use our general\r\nCircleCI bazel configuration.

The new library is what is affected.\r\n\r\n### Description\r\n\r\nA CSS stylesheet included in a third-party library is incorrectly rendered when the `ng build --prod` command is used.\r\n\r\n## 🔬 Minimal Reproduction\r\n\r\nBecause this seems file dependent I have created a basic repo to reproduce this issue at:\r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/mcavagnaro/dhtmlxgantt-css-issue\r\n\r\nTwo changes were made after using the `ng new` command:\r\n\r\n1) The file `src/third-party/dhtmlxgantt.css` was added.\r\n2) The `angular.json` file was added to include this new CSS file.\r\n\r\nAfter downloading the app run `ng build --prod` and compare the CSS file in the `dist` folder to what is in the original file. The rule that is changed is `.gantt_task_line.gantt_milestone .gantt_task_content`.\r\n\r\n## 🔥 Exception or Error\r\n\r\nThe `border` property is what changed. It starts off as `border: inherit;` and becomes `border: 1px inherit inherit;`. It looks like it's being merged with the `border-width` property, but I'm not sure where the second `inherit` is coming from.\r\n\r\nOriginal:\r\n<pre><code>.gantt_task_line.gantt_milestone .gantt_task_content {\r\n    background: inherit;\r\n    border: inherit;\r\n    border-width: 1px;\r\n    border-radius: inherit;\r\n    box-sizing: border-box;\r\n    -moz-box-sizing: border-box;\r\n    transform: rotate(45deg)\r\n}\r\n</code></pre>\r\n\r\nRendered:\r\n<pre><code>.gantt_task_line.gantt_milestone .gantt_task_content {\r\n    background: inherit;\r\n    border: 1px inherit inherit;\r\n    border-radius: inherit;\r\n    box-sizing: border-box;\r\n    -moz-box-sizing: border-box;\r\n    -webkit-transform: rotate(45deg);\r\n    transform: rotate(45deg)\r\n}\r\n</code></pre>\r\n\r\n## 🌍 Your Environment\r\n<pre><code>Angular CLI: 7.0.7\r\nNode: 8.11.4\r\nOS: win32 x64\r\nAngular: 7.0.4\r\n... animations, common, compiler, compiler-cli, core, forms\r\n... http, language-service, platform-browser\r\n... platform-browser-dynamic, router\r\n\r\nPackage                           Version\r\n-----------------------------------------------------------\r\n@angular-devkit/architect         0.10.7\r\n@angular-devkit/build-angular     0.10.7\r\n@angular-devkit/build-optimizer   0.10.7\r\n@angular-devkit/build-webpack     0.10.7\r\n@angular-devkit/core              7.0.7\r\n@angular-devkit/schematics        7.0.7\r\n@angular/cli                      7.0.7\r\n@ngtools/webpack                  7.0.7\r\n@schematics/angular               7.0.7\r\n@schematics/update                0.10.7\r\nrxjs                              6.3.3\r\ntypescript                        3.1.6\r\nwebpack                           4.19.1\r\n</code></pre>\r\n\r\n**Anything else relevant?**\r\nSimilar to https://github.com/angular/angular-cli/issues/12408","Url":"https://github.com/angular/angular-cli/issues/13814","RelatedDescription":"Open issue \"CSS Extracted/Optimized Incorrectly With Prod Flag\" (#13814)"},{"Id":"416777725","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2019-03-04T18:25:33","Actor":"alan-agius4","Number":"13812","RawContent":null,"Title":"test: fix new tslint architect test large on windows","State":"closed","Body":"","Url":"https://github.com/angular/angular-cli/pull/13812","RelatedDescription":"Closed or merged PR \"test: fix new tslint architect test large on windows\" (#13812)"},{"Id":"416555184","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2019-03-04T17:36:02","Actor":"clydin","Number":"13809","RawContent":null,"Title":"feat(@angular-devkit/build-angular): change es5BrowserSupport  output filename to `polyfills.es5.js`","State":"closed","Body":"Closes #13808\r\n\r\n//cc @StephenFluin ","Url":"https://github.com/angular/angular-cli/pull/13809","RelatedDescription":"Closed or merged PR \"feat(@angular-devkit/build-angular): change es5BrowserSupport  output filename to `polyfills.es5.js`\" (#13809)"},{"Id":"416540759","IsPullRequest":false,"CreatedAt":"2019-03-04T17:36:02","Actor":"StephenFluin","Number":"13808","RawContent":null,"Title":"Differentially loaded polyfill naming is confusing","State":"closed","Body":"# 🚀 Feature request\r\nCurrently the differentially loaded polyfills are named something like this:\r\n`es2015-polyfills.93d33834f014c18240da.js`\r\n`polyfills.13391cdb066748d88c83.js`\r\n\r\nThese names are a little confusing because one might guess that the es2015 one is loaded by modern browsers, and the other one is loaded by legacy browsers, but this isn't what happens.\r\n\r\nToday, the `es2015-polyfills.js` is loaded by browsers that DON'T support ES2015, and the file marked ES2015 is **ACTUALLY ES5**.\r\n\r\n### Proposals\r\nI propose to instead name the legacy file based on what it contains in a way that makes it clearer by using an additional file extension.

Create a component that accesses that service and try to deconstruct the return value on the object.\r\nimport {DataService} from './data.service';\r\n\r\n```\r\n@Component({\r\n  selector: 'app-root',\r\n  templateUrl: './app.component.html',\r\n  styleUrls: ['./app.component.css'],\r\n})\r\n\r\nexport class AppComponent implements OnInit {\r\n//declaration of variables to display\r\n...\r\n    constructor(private data: DataService) {\r\n\r\n    }\r\n\r\n   ngOnInit() {\r\n    this.data.getScore(this.titleUrl).subscribe(data => {\r\n   ({avgrating: this.avgRating, numOfReviews: this.numReviews, posterUrl: this.posterUrl}= data) \r\n   }\r\n     \r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\n\r\n<!--\r\n\r\n-->\r\n\r\n## 🔥 Exception or Error\r\n<pre><code>\r\nERROR in src/app/app.component.ts(84,11): error TS2459: Type 'Object' has no property 'poster_Url' and no string index signature. \r\n\r\n</code></pre>\r\n\r\n\r\n","Url":"https://github.com/angular/angular-cli/issues/13803","RelatedDescription":"Closed issue \"ES6 Destructuring Issue with Data from API\" (#13803)"},{"Id":"416330775","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2019-03-02T00:28:20","Actor":"clydin","Number":"13802","RawContent":null,"Title":"fix(@angular-devkit/build-angular): remove index option as required","State":"open","Body":"It is not a required option and is allowed to be undefined ([relevant code](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli/blob/master/packages/angular_devkit/build_angular/src/angular-cli-files/models/webpack-configs/browser.ts#L39)).
