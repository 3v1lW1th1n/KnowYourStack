If added inside the controller any number of characters can be added but if the number exceeds 5, and error is displayed \r\n\r\nThe expected behavior would be an identical functionality independent of the declaration. \r\n\r\n## üî¨ Minimal Reproduction\r\nhttps://stackblitz.com/edit/angular-fw7tpa\r\n\r\nHTML:\r\n```html\r\n<form class=\"example-form\">\r\n  <mat-form-field class=\"example-full-width\">\r\n    <input matInput placeholder=\"Validation rules from controller\" \r\n           [formControl]=\"validationRulesFromController\"\r\n           [errorStateMatcher]=\"matcher\">\r\n    <mat-hint>Can type as long as I want, only the error appears</mat-hint>\r\n    <mat-error>\r\n      Too long\r\n    </mat-error>\r\n  </mat-form-field>\r\n  <mat-form-field class=\"example-full-width\">\r\n    <input matInput placeholder=\"Validation rules from input element\" \r\n           [formControl]=\"validationRulesFromInputElement\" [maxLength]=\"5\"\r\n           [errorStateMatcher]=\"matcher\">\r\n    <mat-hint>Can only type 5 charactes, no error appears.</mat-hint>\r\n    <mat-error>\r\n      Too long\r\n    </mat-error>\r\n  </mat-form-field>\r\n</form>\r\n```\r\n\r\nController:\r\n```ts\r\nimport {Component} from '@angular/core';\r\nimport {FormControl, FormGroupDirective, NgForm, Validators} from '@angular/forms';\r\nimport {ErrorStateMatcher} from '@angular/material/core';\r\n\r\n/** Error when invalid control is dirty, touched, or submitted. */\r\nexport class MyErrorStateMatcher implements ErrorStateMatcher {\r\n  isErrorState(control: FormControl | null, form: FormGroupDirective | NgForm | null): boolean {\r\n    const isSubmitted = form && form.submitted;\r\n    return !!(control && control.invalid && (control.dirty || control.touched || isSubmitted));\r\n  }\r\n}\r\n\r\n/** @title Input with a custom ErrorStateMatcher */\r\n@Component({\r\n  selector: 'input-error-state-matcher-example',\r\n  templateUrl: './input-error-state-matcher-example.html',\r\n  styleUrls: ['./input-error-state-matcher-example.css'],\r\n})\r\nexport class InputErrorStateMatcherExample {\r\n  validationRulesFromController = new FormControl('', [Validators.maxLength(5)]);\r\n\r\n  matcher = new MyErrorStateMatcher();\r\n}\r\n```","Url":"https://github.com/angular/angular/issues/28008","RelatedDescription":"Open issue \"Different maxlength behavior depending on definition\" (#28008)"}],"ResultType":"GitHubIssue"},"AngularCli-Issues":{"Issues":[{"Id":"397424129","IsPullRequest":false,"CreatedAt":"2019-01-10T00:40:31","Actor":"code2nguyen","Number":"13388","RawContent":null,"Title":"Missing declaration types NormalizedSourceMaps, CurrentFileReplacement, AssetPatternObject","State":"closed","Body":"<!--\r\nIF YOU DON'T FILL OUT THE FOLLOWING INFORMATION YOUR ISSUE MIGHT BE CLOSED WITHOUT INVESTIGATING\r\n-->\r\n### Bug Report or Feature Request (mark with an `x`)\r\n```\r\n- [X] bug report -> please search issues before submitting\r\n- [ ] feature request\r\n```\r\n### Area\r\n```\r\n- [X] devkit\r\n- [ ] schematics\r\n```\r\n### Versions\r\nng --version v7.2.0\r\n\r\n### Repro steps\r\n```\r\nimport { BrowserBuilder, } from '@angular-devkit/build-angular';\r\n```\r\n\r\n\r\n### The log given by the failure\r\n```\r\n../../node_modules/@angular-devkit/build-angular/src/browser/schema.d.ts:417:14 -

Be unable to know that the asset outside of budget range as the \"any\" budget type will catch the bundle. \r\n\r\n\r\n### The log given by the failure\r\nN/A\r\n\r\n### Desired functionality\r\nI would like to set a budget **specifically** for image assets in my `ng build`. Ideally, I can configure this per image type (as each image type has different compressability.\r\n\r\ne.g\r\n```\r\n{\r\n  ...\r\n  \"configurations\": {\r\n    \"production\": {\r\n      ...\r\n      budgets: [\r\n         {\"type\": \"asset:jpg\", \"maximumWarning\": \"150kb\", \"maximumError\": \"300kb\"},\r\n         {\"type\": \"asset:svg\", \"maximumWarning\": \"15kb\", \"maximumError\": \"30kb\"},\r\n         {\"type\": \"asset:png\", \"maximumWarning\": \"150kb\", \"maximumError\": \"300kb\"},\r\n       ]\r\n    }\r\n  }\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nThe use case here is automation around enforcing filesize requirements for assets to prevent absurd image sizes from being included. While `\"type\": \"any\"` meets this requirement, there are niches of asset types that should have stricter requirements (e.g. `svg`).\r\n\r\n### Mention any other details that might be useful\r\nI'm trying to create budgets for the assets we use on the `Daffodil` project: \r\nhttps://github.com/graycoreio/daffodil\r\n\r\nSpecifically, the PR in question:\r\nhttps://github.com/graycoreio/daffodil/pull/171\r\n","Url":"https://github.com/angular/angular-cli/issues/13393","RelatedDescription":"Open issue \"Proposal: Asset Budgets potentially w/ subtypes\" (#13393)"},{"Id":"397555676","IsPullRequest":false,"CreatedAt":"2019-01-09T20:47:09","Actor":"Jun711","Number":"13392","RawContent":null,"Title":"ng generate universal (after adding pwa) update main.ts incorrectly causing syntax error","State":"open","Body":"<!--\r\nIF YOU DON'T FILL OUT THE FOLLOWING INFORMATION YOUR ISSUE MIGHT BE CLOSED WITHOUT INVESTIGATING\r\n-->\r\n### Bug Report or Feature Request (mark with an `x`)\r\n```\r\n- [x] bug report -> please search issues before submitting\r\n- [ ] feature request\r\n```\r\n\r\n### Command (mark with an `x`)\r\n```\r\n- [ ] new\r\n- [ ] build\r\n- [ ] serve\r\n- [ ] test\r\n- [ ] e2e\r\n- [x] generate\r\n- [ ] add\r\n- [ ] update\r\n- [ ] lint\r\n- [ ] xi18n\r\n- [ ] run\r\n- [ ] config\r\n- [ ] help\r\n- [ ] version\r\n- [ ] doc\r\n```\r\n\r\n### Versions\r\n<!--\r\nOutput from: `node --version`, `npm --version` and `ng --version`.\r\n  Windows (7/8/10).

Note the comment, it should never be imported.\r\n\r\nBy doing this I can keep imports in my routes simple:\r\n```\r\n{\r\n  path: 'lazy',\r\n  loadChildren: 'lazy-component#LazyComponentModule',\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\n### Mention any other details that might be useful\r\nI am very sorry for intentional duplicate, but as I said, I would like to bring the new workaround to your attention, since it feels like the real solution is not far.\r\n\r\nDuplicate of #6373","Url":"https://github.com/angular/angular-cli/issues/13386","RelatedDescription":"Closed issue \"Lazy load libraries with router - bring new workaround to the attention\" (#13386)"},{"Id":"397244053","IsPullRequest":false,"CreatedAt":"2019-01-09T10:11:02","Actor":"c00","Number":"13385","RawContent":null,"Title":"Wiki: stories universal rendering: Cannot find name 'AppServerModuleNgFactory' not 'LAZY_MODULE_MAP'","State":"closed","Body":"<!--\r\nIF YOU DON'T FILL OUT THE FOLLOWING INFORMATION YOUR ISSUE MIGHT BE CLOSED WITHOUT INVESTIGATING\r\n-->\r\n### Bug Report or Feature Request (mark with an `x`)\r\n```\r\n- [x ] bug report -> please search issues before submitting\r\n- [ ] feature request\r\n```\r\n\r\n### Versions\r\n<!--\r\nOutput from: `node --version`, `npm --version` and `ng --version`.\r\n  Windows (7/8/10).

By scoping them to their respective location on the server they do not collide anymore. \r\n\r\n### Workaround (nasty)\r\nDefine different `\"ngswConfigPath\": \"src/ngsw-config.json\"` (full duplicates) in your `angular.json` for each environment and specify the `navigationUrls` accordingly:\r\n```\r\n\"navigationUrls\": [\r\n    \"/de/**\",\r\n    \"!/**/*.*\",\r\n    \"! /**/*__*\",\r\n    \"! /**/*__*/**\"\r\n  ]\r\n```","Url":"https://github.com/angular/angular-cli/issues/13368","RelatedDescription":"Closed issue \"ServiceWorker: Standard NavigationUrls do not respect baseHref\" (#13368)"},{"Id":"396375765","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2019-01-07T07:22:53","Actor":"alan-agius4","Number":"13377","RawContent":null,"Title":"fix(@schematics/angular): remove properties which are set by default ‚Ä¶","State":"open","Body":"‚Ä¶from required\r\n\r\nAt the moment, these would end up being required to be passed even though a default is provided.\r\n\r\nFixes #13010","Url":"https://github.com/angular/angular-cli/pull/13377","RelatedDescription":"Open PR \"fix(@schematics/angular): remove properties which are set by default ‚Ä¶\" (#13377)"},{"Id":"396303010","IsPullRequest":false,"CreatedAt":"2019-01-07T06:37:56","Actor":"peterennis","Number":"13376","RawContent":null,"Title":"unable to run e2e tests with simple project","State":"closed","Body":"<!--\r\nIF YOU DON'T FILL OUT THE FOLLOWING INFORMATION YOUR ISSUE MIGHT BE CLOSED WITHOUT INVESTIGATING\r\n-->\r\n### Bug Report or Feature Request (mark with an `x`)\r\n```\r\n- [x] bug report -> please search issues before submitting\r\n- [ ] feature request\r\n```\r\n\r\n### Command (mark with an `x`)\r\n```\r\n- [ ] new\r\n- [ ] build\r\n- [ ] serve\r\n- [ ] test\r\n- [x] e2e\r\n- [ ] generate\r\n- [ ] add\r\n- [ ] update\r\n- [ ] lint\r\n- [ ] xi18n\r\n- [ ] run\r\n- [ ] config\r\n- [ ] help\r\n- [ ] version\r\n- [ ] doc\r\n```\r\n\r\n### Versions\r\n<!--\r\nOutput from: `node --version`, `npm --version` and `ng --version`.\r\n  Windows (7/8/10).
