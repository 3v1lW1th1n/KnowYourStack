I am a newbie of using ML.net to implement my classification problem. I already trained a model from CIFA 10 datasets based on Keras library and that model has been transferred to ONNX model. My goal is to display the image's prediction task on WindowForm, so I am going to use ML.net integrated with ONNX model, but right now I am getting stuck on how to use the ONNX model on ML.net and how to define the label and get the prediction result by the model. Do you have any suggestion to me? Thank you a lot in advance.\r\n### Source code / logs\r\n\r\nPlease paste or attach the code or logs or traces that would be helpful to diagnose the issue you are reporting.\r\n","Url":"https://github.com/dotnet/machinelearning/issues/3562","RelatedDescription":"Open issue \"Making a prediction from ONNX model in ML.net\" (#3562)"},{"Id":"436457978","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2019-04-24T01:38:37","Actor":"codemzs","Number":"3561","RawContent":null,"Title":"Sample code cleanup.","State":"open","Body":"","Url":"https://github.com/dotnet/machinelearning/pull/3561","RelatedDescription":"Open PR \"Sample code cleanup.\" (#3561)"},{"Id":"436447706","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2019-04-24T00:43:47","Actor":"najeeb-kazmi","Number":"3560","RawContent":null,"Title":"Documentation for loss functions","State":"open","Body":"Fixes #3480 ","Url":"https://github.com/dotnet/machinelearning/pull/3560","RelatedDescription":"Open PR \"Documentation for loss functions\" (#3560)"},{"Id":"436441157","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2019-04-24T00:09:31","Actor":"codemzs","Number":"3559","RawContent":null,"Title":"Standardize Key Type annotation.","State":"open","Body":"When referencing key types, use `[Key](xref:Microsoft.ML.Data.KeyDataViewType) type`.\r\n\r\nfixes #3529","Url":"https://github.com/dotnet/machinelearning/pull/3559","RelatedDescription":"Open PR \"Standardize Key Type annotation.\" (#3559)"},{"Id":"436434354","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2019-04-23T23:37:42","Actor":"sfilipi","Number":"3558","RawContent":null,"Title":"simplifying and improving the examples","State":"open","Body":"Towards #3509: simplifying and adding more description to the FilterRows samples. \r\n\r\n","Url":"https://github.com/dotnet/machinelearning/pull/3558","RelatedDescription":"Open PR \"simplifying and improving the examples\" (#3558)"},{"Id":"436395145","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2019-04-23T23:27:47","Actor":"wschin","Number":"3551","RawContent":null,"Title":"Fix AP's output schema in its XML doc","State":"closed","Body":"Fix #3498 and fix #3496 by\r\n\r\n- Add a new I/O file for binary classifier without probability output\r\n- Reference that new file in AP's and LinearSVM's XML docs.\r\n","Url":"https://github.com/dotnet/machinelearning/pull/3551","RelatedDescription":"Closed or merged PR \"Fix AP's output schema in its XML doc\" (#3551)"},{"Id":"436336448","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2019-04-23T23:15:26","Actor":"wschin","Number":"3534","RawContent":null,"Title":"Polish some options' XML document strings","State":"closed","Body":"Fix #3507.\r\n\r\nNote that some options don't have API references because they are not used to create trainers.
