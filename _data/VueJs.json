However I've probably found the issue and enough hints to why it's occuring.\r\n\r\nThe problem is that IE11 is adding a `/undefined` to the url, when I'm initializing the router with a `scrollBevariour` method. The reason is the following line of code, which was implemented to fix #1585: \r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/vuejs/vue-router/blob/dev/src/util/scroll.js#L11\r\n\r\nThere are similar issues in other projects, that have been closed:\r\nhttps://github.com/ampproject/amphtml/issues/743\r\n\r\nI haven't found an easy way to fix this except commenting out the line. So the easiest fix would be to test for IE and not execute the line at all.\r\n\r\n### What is expected?\r\nIE should not add `/undefined` to the route when providing a scrollBehaviour function.\r\n\r\n### What is actually happening?\r\nIE (under some arcane circumstances) adds `/undefined` to the URL, when vue-router's `setupScroll` is executed.\r\n\r\n---\r\nAs I said, I wasn't able to reproduce it in a reduced Fiddle. When stepping through the code, I could identify the line that was causing it. I'm not sure however, if some kind of listener may be the cause.\r\n\r\n<!-- generated by vue-issues.
