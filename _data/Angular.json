While my custom `DefaultUrlSerializer` will essentially make Router work with case-insensitive URLs by lower-casing everything, it doesn't appear to work for /INDEX.HTML.\r\n\r\nI am also aware that the case-sensitivity problem has been brought up before (https://github.com/angular/angular/issues/7691, etc), but I think this is a unique case that is worth looking at.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Describe the solution you'd like\r\nSince Router already appears to handle /index.html internally somewhere, I think in this one-off case it should handle it in a case-insensitive manner to prevent the `Cannot match any routes` error.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Describe alternatives you've considered\r\nI do not see an alternative. I welcome any workarounds!\r\n\r\n### Sample project / reproduction\r\nI hesitated a bit in considering this a feature request, but in case this is classified as a bug, I put together a repro [here](https://stackblitz.com/edit/angular-pkxduk).\r\n1. Expand the console on the right and add /index.html to the address bar and refresh. You will not see anything wrong.\r\n2. Try using /INDEX.HTML and you _will_ see an error (in the console), **even though my custom DefaultUrlSerializer lower-cased it** (as seen in the console).","Url":"https://github.com/angular/angular/issues/36804","RelatedDescription":"Open issue \"Router should support case-insensitive root index.html\" (#36804)"},{"Id":"606600170","IsPullRequest":false,"CreatedAt":"2020-04-24T21:49:22","Actor":"AlQuraian","Number":"36803","RawContent":null,"Title":"Strange bug with regex.","State":"closed","Body":"### Description\r\nThe rendered output differs when commenting/uncommenting a console log.\r\nJust comment/uncomment line 11.\r\n\r\n## üî¨ Minimal Reproduction\r\nhttps://stackblitz.com/edit/angular-issue-repro2-zqt2sn\r\n\r\n\r\n## üåç  Your Environment\r\n\r\n**Angular Version:**\r\n<pre><code>\r\nAngular CLI: 9.1.1\r\nNode: 12.16.0\r\nOS: win32 x64\r\n\r\nAngular: 9.1.1\r\n... animations, cli, common, compiler, compiler-cli, core, forms\r\n... platform-browser, platform-browser-dynamic, platform-server\r\n... router\r\nIvy Workspace: Yes\r\n\r\nPackage                           Version\r\n-----------------------------------------------------------\r\n@angular-devkit/architect         0.901.1\r\n@angular-devkit/build-angular     0.901.1\r\n@angular-devkit/build-optimizer   0.901.1\r\n@angular-devkit/build-webpack     0.901.1\r\n@angular-devkit/core              9.1.1\r\n@angular-devkit/schematics        9.1.1\r\n@angular/language-service         9.1.2\r\n@angular/localize                 9.1.2\r\n@ngtools/webpack                  9.1.1\r\n@schematics/angular               9.1.1\r\n@schematics/update                0.901.1\r\nrxjs                              6.5.5\r\ntypescript                        3.8.3\r\nwebpack                           4.42.0\r\n\r\n</code></pre>","Url":"https://github.com/angular/angular/issues/36803","RelatedDescription":"Closed issue \"Strange bug with regex.\" (#36803)"},{"Id":"606577637","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2020-04-24T20:53:15","Actor":"josephperrott","Number":"36802","RawContent":null,"Title":"build: create macro for transpiling javascript file to es5","State":"open","Body":"For testing on IE, shims must be served in es5.

We did it as it's indicated in its docs:\r\n\r\n```js\r\nconst dom = new JSDOM(`<p>Hello</p>`, {\r\n  beforeParse(window) {\r\n    window.document.childNodes.length === 0;\r\n    window.someCoolAPI = () => { /* ... */ };\r\n  }\r\n});\r\n```\r\nLuckely the `karma-json-launcher` offers the posibility to configure the `jsdom` instance throught `karma.conf.js` file:\r\n\r\n```js\r\n// karma.conf.js\r\nconst jsdom = require(\"jsdom\");\r\n \r\nmodule.exports = function(config) {\r\n  config.set({\r\n    browsers: ['jsdom'],\r\n    jsdomLauncher: {\r\n      jsdom: {\r\n        beforeParse(window) {\r\n          window.someCoolAPI = () => { /* ... */ };\r\n        }\r\n      }\r\n    }\r\n  });\r\n};\r\n```\r\nThe karma plugin creates the jsdom [instance correctly](https://github.com/badeball/karma-jsdom-launcher/blob/3c364d8988a7a1bc8d4687ec76810cb530adfffe/index.js#L28-L40) with the passed options, and it tries to parse the url where karma is running. But unfortunalety the `someCoolAPI` is not present in test context inside `window` property and test fails with a `ReferenceError: someCoolAPI is not defined`\r\n\r\nOn the other hand, when you try to manually create your own `jsdom` instance (same way `karma-json-launcher does`), with `someCoolAPI` polyfill, and parse any html document which use that API inside  it works, jsdom parses the document and the scripst are executed correctly, so that makes me think is not a `jsdom` or `karma-jsdom-launcher` problem. Can be an issue with the CLI, or Karma itself?\r\n\r\n\r\n## üî¨ Minimal Reproduction\r\n<!--\r\nSimple steps to reproduce this bug.\r\n\r\nPlease include: commands run (including args), packages added, related code changes.\r\n\r\nIf reproduction steps are not enough for reproduction of your issue, please create a minimal GitHub repository with the reproduction of the issue. \r\nA good way to make a minimal reproduction is to create a new app via `ng new repro-app` and add the minimum possible code to show the problem. \r\nShare the link to the repo below along with step-by-step instructions to reproduce the problem, as well as expected and actual behavior.\r\n\r\nIssues that don't have enough info and can't be reproduced will be closed.\r\n\r\nYou can read more about issue submission guidelines here: https://github.com/angular/angular-cli/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md#-submitting-an-issue\r\n-->\r\n1.\r\n```sh\r\n$ ng new foo\r\n$ cd foo\r\n$ npm install karma-jsdom-launcher jsdom\r\n```\r\n2. Configure `angular.json` file as @badeball indicates [here ](https://github.com/badeball/karma-jsdom-launcher#i-am-using-angular-cli-and-the-test-suite-hangs-indefinitely) due to #11561 and #13580\r\n3. Configure `karma.config.js` file as `karma-jsdom-launcher` docs indicates:\r\n```js\r\n// karma.config.js\r\n...\r\nplugins: [\r\n  ....\r\n  require('karma-jsdom-launcher'),\r\n  ....\r\n],\r\n...\r\nbrowsers: ['jsdom'],\r\njsdomLauncher: {\r\n  jsdom: {\r\n    beforeParse(window) {\r\n        window.someCoolAPI = () => { /* ... */ };\r\n     }\r\n  }\r\n},\r\n...\r\n```\r\n4. Create `app.component.ts` that uses that `someCoolAPI` in some way.\r\n\r\n```\r\n@Component({...})\r\nexport class AppComponent {\r\n  constructor() {\r\n    window.someCoolAPI();  //the test will fail here because someCoolAPI is not defined\r\n  }\r\n}\r\n```\r\n5. \r\n```sh\r\nng test\r\n```\r\n\r\n## üî• Exception or Error\r\n<!-- If the issue is accompanied by an exception or an error, please share it below: -->\r\n<!-- ‚úçÔ∏è-->\r\n<pre><code>\r\n> ng test\r\n10% building 2/2 modules 0 active24 04 2020 23:56:59.854:WARN [karma]: No captured browser, open http://localhost:9877/\r\n24 04 2020 23:56:59.871:INFO [karma-server]: Karma v4.4.1 server started at http://0.0.0.0:9877/\r\n24 04 2020 23:56:59.873:INFO [launcher]: Launching browsers jsdom with concurrency unlimited\r\n24 04 2020 23:56:59.911:INFO [launcher]: Starting browser jsdom\r\n24 04 2020 23:57:12.239:WARN [karma]: No captured browser, open http://localhost:9877/\r\n24 04 2020 23:57:12.552:INFO [Mozilla/5.0 (win32) AppleWebKit/537.36 (KHTML, like Gecko) jsdom/16.2.2]: Connected on socket BdQYHk1WXZIxjHKdAAAA with id 85109278\r\nMozilla/5.0 (win32) AppleWebKit/537.36 (KHTML, like Gecko) jsdom/16.2.2 AppComponent should create the app FAILED\r\n        ReferenceError: crypto is not defined\r\n            at <Jasmine>\r\n            at new AppComponent (http://localhost:9877/_karma_webpack_/main.js:580:21)\r\n            at NodeInjectorFactory.AppComponent_Factory [as factory] (ng:///AppComponent/…µfac.js:5:10)\r\n            at getNodeInjectable (http://localhost:9877/_karma_webpack_/vendor.js:41519:44)\r\n            at instantiateRootComponent (http://localhost:9877/_karma_webpack_/vendor.js:47483:23)\r\n            at createRootComponent (http://localhost:9877/_karma_webpack_/vendor.js:60827:23)\r\n            at ComponentFactory$1.create (http://localhost:9877/_karma_webpack_/vendor.js:66890:25)\r\n            at initComponent (http://localhost:9877/_karma_webpack_/vendor.js:82940:51)\r\n            at ZoneDelegate.invoke (http://localhost:9877/_karma_webpack_/polyfills.js:3836:30)\r\n            at ProxyZoneSpec.push../node_modules/zone.js/dist/zone-testing.js.ProxyZoneSpec.onInvoke (http://localhost:9877/_karma_webpack_/vendor.js:100670:43)\r\n            at ZoneDelegate.invoke (http://localhost:9877/_karma_webpack_/polyfills.js:3835:36)\r\nMozilla/5.0 (win32) AppleWebKit/537.36 (KHTML, like Gecko) jsdom/16.2.2: Executed 1 of 3 (1 FAILED) (0 secs / 0.294 secs)\r\nMozilla/5.0 (win32) AppleWebKit/537.36 (KHTML, like Gecko) jsdom/16.2.2 AppComponent should create the app FAILED\r\n        ReferenceError: crypto is not defined\r\n            at <Jasmine>\r\n            at new AppComponent (http://localhost:9877/_karma_webpack_/main.js:580:21)\r\n            at NodeInjectorFactory.AppComponent_Factory [as factory] (ng:///AppComponent/…µfac.js:5:10)\r\n            at getNodeInjectable (http://localhost:9877/_karma_webpack_/vendor.js:41519:44)\r\n            at instantiateRootComponent (http://localhost:9877/_karma_webpack_/vendor.js:47483:23)\r\n            at createRootComponent (http://localhost:9877/_karma_webpack_/vendor.js:60827:23)\r\n            at ComponentFactory$1.create (http://localhost:9877/_karma_webpack_/vendor.js:66890:25)\r\n            at initComponent (http://localhost:9877/_karma_webpack_/vendor.js:82940:51)\r\n            at ZoneDelegate.invoke (http://localhost:9877/_karma_webpack_/polyfills.js:3836:30)\r\n            at ProxyZoneSpec.push../node_modules/zone.js/dist/zone-testing.js.ProxyZoneSpec.onInvoke (http://localhost:9877/_karma_webpack_/vendor.js:100670:43)\r\n</code></pre>\r\n\r\n## üåç Your Environment\r\n<pre><code>\r\nAngular CLI: 9.1.3\r\nNode: 12.10.0\r\nOS: win32 x64\r\n\r\nAngular: 9.1.3\r\n... animations, cli, common, compiler, compiler-cli, core, forms\r\n... language-service, platform-browser, platform-browser-dynamic\r\n... router\r\nIvy Workspace: Yes\r\n\r\nPackage                           Version\r\n-----------------------------------------------------------\r\n@angular-devkit/architect         0.901.3\r\n@angular-devkit/build-angular     0.901.3\r\n@angular-devkit/build-optimizer   0.901.3\r\n@angular-devkit/build-webpack     0.901.3\r\n@angular-devkit/core              9.1.3\r\n@angular-devkit/schematics        9.1.3\r\n@ngtools/webpack                  9.1.3\r\n@schematics/angular               9.1.3\r\n@schematics/update                0.901.3\r\nrxjs                              6.5.5\r\ntypescript                        3.8.3\r\nwebpack                           4.42.0\r\n</code></pre>\r\n\r\n<!-- **Anything else relevant?**\r\n ‚úçÔ∏èIs this a browser specific issue?
