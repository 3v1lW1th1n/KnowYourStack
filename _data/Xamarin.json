pull request \"Android - Fix various issues in object dispose methods.\" (#6467) at xamarin/Xamarin.Forms","RelatedBody":"### Context ###\r\nI notice in my apps a lot of these exceptions on Android, very hard (or even impossible) to reproduce.\r\nI fixed some of them in #4707, #4955, #4974 but I continue to have a certain amount of them.\r\nAnd there are plenty of them on the Xamarin Forum or in the issues list of this repository (and the previous on bugzilla).\r\n\r\nWhen fixing the dispose method of the TabbedPageRenderer in #4974, I notice that most dispose methods in the Android backend have also issues.\r\n- Missing native Android ressources dispose/remove/detach\r\n> This cause memory leak\r\n- EventHander unsubscribed after that the ressource used in it was disposed\r\n> This cause race condition and can trigger random \"No view found for Id XXX\", if an event is trigerred during dispose\r\n- Renderer disposed before the view rendered was removed\r\n> This also can cause race condition and can trigger random \"No view found for Id XXX\" or NullReference exception during layout, if android call layout method and try to restore the renderer during dispose\r\n- Base method not called last\r\n> The child class ressources always need to be disposed first, on exception a comment need to explain why\r\n\r\n### Description of Change ###\r\nThe complete modifications list is :\r\n\r\n**AppCompat/CarouselPageRenderer**\r\n- Unsubscribe CollectionChanged event before the viewPager is disposed\r\n- Missing ClearOnPageChangeListeners on the ViewPager\r\n- Remove the ViewPager before dispose the renderer\r\n- Add missing null check on Element before access to children\r\n\r\n**AppCompat/FormsAppCompatActivity**\r\n- Remove the root layout in destroy before

Remove TitleView before dispose her renderer\r\n- Unsubscribe Toolbar items PropertyChanged \r\n- Clear Toolbar menu items\r\n- Remove Toolbar view before dispose her renderer\r\n- Remove DrawerLayout view\r\n\r\n**AppCompat/Platform**\r\n- Unsubscribe FormsAppCompatActivity.BackPressed event before SetPage\r\n- Set Page to null when newRoot == null\r\n- Refactor SetPage so only cleanup method run inside the Handler to prevent possible race-condition in page affection\r\n\r\n**AppCompat/ShellFragmentContainer**\r\n- Call destroy last, no reason to call this method first\r\n\r\n**AppCompat/TabbedPageRenderer**\r\n- Unsubscribe CollectionChanged event before dispose renderer and remove view\r\n- Missing ClearOnPageChangeListeners on the ViewPager\r\n- Wrong ClearOnTabSelectedListeners on the TabLayout\r\n- Dispose renderer last\r\n\r\n**CollectionView/ItemsViewRenderer**\r\n- Missing ItemsViewAdapter dispose, Probable cause of #6427\r\n\r\n**FastRenderers/AutomationPropertiesProvider**\r\n- Missing Unsubscribe Element PropertyChanged\r\n\r\n**FastRenderers/ButtonRenderer**\r\n- OnFocusChangeListener to null\r\n- Unsubscribe Element PropertyChanged event before dispose\r\n\r\n**FastRenderers/FrameRenderer**\r\n- Unsubscribe Element PropertyChanged event before dispose\r\n\r\n**FastRenderers/ImageRenderer**\r\n-

necessary)\r\n- LabelTextColorDefault Dispose (Not sure if necessary)\r\n      \r\n**FastRenderers/VisualElementRenderer**\r\n- Unsubscribe Element PropertyChanged event before dispose\r\n- Dispose GestureManager and AutomationPropertiesProvider last\r\n\r\n**VisualElementPackager**\r\n- Unsubscribe events before clear and dispose\r\n\r\n**VisualElementRenderer**\r\n- Simplify and remove redondants null check\r\n- Unsubscribe Element PropertyChanged event before dispose\r\n\r\n### Issues Resolved ### \r\nA lot of random and hard to reproduce issues.\r\n\r\n### API Changes

contructor (IntPtr/JniHandleOwnership), which makes the leaks very difficult to see.
