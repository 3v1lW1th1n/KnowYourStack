I've faced these errors, when attempting to upgrade [angular-fontawesome](https://github.com/devoto13/angular-fontawesome/tree/angular-9) (see last commit in the branch) to Angular 9.\r\n\r\nNGCC should either compile ALL components or fail or at the very least print a warning that it was unable to compile certain components from the library for certain reason. This way library authors can either avoid using undesired behaviours or report clear issues here.\r\n\r\nTwo cases where `ngcc` silently skips components, which I've identified so far are:\r\n- injecting `Renderer2` into a component\r\n- injecting a directive into a component\r\n\r\n## üî¨ Minimal Reproduction\r\n<!--\r\nPlease create and share minimal reproduction of the issue starting with this template: https://stackblitz.com/fork/angular-issue-repro2\r\n-->\r\nhttps://github.com/devoto13/ngcc-skip-components-repro\r\n\r\nRepository is created using schematics (each command is one commit):\r\n\r\n```\r\n$ ng new eval-lib\r\n$ ng g lib test\r\n# import component from the library into application\r\n# inject `Renderer2` into library component (this leads to an error)\r\n```\r\n\r\nHow to reproduce a bug:\r\n\r\n```\r\n# clone repo\r\n$ npm i\r\n$ ng build test --prod # build the library\r\n$ ng build --prod # attempt to build the application using this library\r\n```\r\n\r\nObserve a misleading error about missing component. Observe that `dist/test/lib/test.component.d.ts` was not processed by NGCC and no clear error or warning was printed. Reverting latest commit in the repo will allow the application build to pass and application will run successfully.\r\n\r\n<!--\r\nIf StackBlitz is not suitable for reproduction of your issue, please create a minimal GitHub repository with the reproduction of the issue.\r\nA good way to make a minimal reproduction is to create a new app via `ng new repro-app` and add the minimum possible code to show the problem. \r\nShare the link to the repo below along with step-by-step instructions to reproduce the problem, as well as expected and actual behavior.\r\n\r\nIssues that don't have enough info and can't be reproduced will be closed.\r\n\r\nYou can read more about issue submission guidelines here: https://github.com/angular/angular/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md#-submitting-an-issue\r\n-->\r\n\r\n## üî• Exception or Error\r\n<pre><code>ERROR in src/app/app.component.html:1:1 - error TS8001: 'lib-test' is not a valid HTML element.\r\n\r\n1 <lib-test></lib-test>\r\n  ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\r\n\r\n  src/app/app.component.ts:5:16\r\n    5   templateUrl: './app.component.html',\r\n                     ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\r\n    Error occurs in the template of component AppComponent.\r\n</code></pre>\r\n\r\n\r\n## üåç  Your Environment\r\n\r\n**Angular Version:**\r\n<pre><code>Angular CLI: 9.0.0-next.6\r\nNode: 12.7.0\r\nOS: darwin x64\r\nAngular: 9.0.0-next.8\r\n... common, compiler, compiler-cli, core, language-service\r\n... platform-browser, platform-browser-dynamic\r\n\r\nPackage                            Version\r\n------------------------------------------------------------\r\n@angular-devkit/architect          0.900.0-next.6\r\n@angular-devkit/build-angular      0.900.0-next.6\r\n@angular-devkit/build-ng-packagr   0.900.0-next.6\r\n@angular-devkit/build-optimizer    0.900.0-next.6\r\n@angular-devkit/build-webpack      0.900.0-next.6\r\n@angular-devkit/core               9.0.0-next.6\r\n@angular-devkit/schematics         9.0.0-next.6\r\n@angular/cli                       9.0.0-next.6\r\n@ngtools/webpack                   9.0.0-next.6\r\n@schematics/angular                9.0.0-next.6\r\n@schematics/update                 0.900.0-next.6\r\nng-packagr                         5.5.1\r\nrxjs                               6.5.3\r\ntypescript                         3.5.3\r\nwebpack                            4.41.0\r\n</code></pre>\r\n\r\n**Anything else relevant?**\r\n<!-- ‚úçÔ∏èIs this a browser specific issue?

It is not the case. The default is `enabled_legacy` which does initial navigation but does *not* block the application bootstrap. \r\n\r\n`enabled` is not a good default for client side rendered applications because we want them to perform initial navigation without actually waiting for the route to be fully resolved. (Or otherwise the whole page will be blank and affect FCP and other performance metrics).\r\n\r\n### Proposal\r\nHave 3 states for `initialNavigation` :\r\n- `enabledNonBlocking`: This should be the default when unspecified\r\n- `enabledBlocking` : This is the new clearer name for `enabled`\r\n- `disabled`: Same as before - No initial navigation or blocking\r\n\r\nOptional:\r\n- Deprecate `enabled` (or alternatively mention in the doc that `enabled` and `enabledBlocking` are equivalent)\r\n\r\nClient side rendered apps should get the saner default of `enabledNonBlocking`.

Source](https://togithub.com/terser/terser/compare/v4.3.3...v4.3.4)\n\n-   Fixed a regression where the output size was increased when unused classes were referred to in the extends clause of a class.\n-   Small typescript typings fixes.\n-   Comments with `@preserve`, `@license`, `@cc_on` as well as comments starting with `/*!` and `/**!` are now preserved by default.\n\n### [`v4.3.3`](https://togithub.com/terser/terser/blob/master/CHANGELOG.md#v433)\n\n[Compare Source](https://togithub.com/terser/terser/compare/v4.3.2...v4.3.3)\n\n-   Fixed a problem where parsing template strings would mix up octal notation and a slash followed by a zero representing a null character.\n-   Started accepting the name `async` in destructuring arguments with default value.\n-   Now Terser takes into account side effects inside class `extends` clauses.\n-   Added parens whenever there's a comment between a return statement and the returned value, to prevent issues with ASI.\n-   Stopped using raw RegExp objects, since the spec is going to continue to evolve. This ensures Terser is able to process new, unknown RegExp flags and features. This is a breaking change in the AST node AST_RegExp.\n\n</details>\n\n---\n\n### Renovate configuration\n\n:date: **Schedule**: \"after 10pm every weekday,before 4am every weekday,every weekend\" in timezone America/Tijuana.\n\n:vertical_traffic_light: **Automerge**: Disabled by config.

However when using variables while still providing fallback values for older browsers who don't support variables, the variables will be ignored when using `ng build --prod`. This only happens when using the flag `--prod`.\r\n\r\n## üî¨ Minimal Reproduction\r\n\r\nFor reproduction purposes I created a simple Angular App.\r\n\r\n```bash\r\ngit clone https://github.com/David-Development/angular-css-minify-bug-app\r\ncd angular-css-minify-bug-app\r\nnpm install\r\nng serve \r\n```\r\n\r\nYou'll notice that both divs look the same (both have rounded edges on the left side). So far, everything is correct.\r\n\r\nHowever, after running `ng build --prod`, you'll notice, that the second div has no round edges on the left side anymore. Somehow (I guess by doing some minifying) angular will merge the four attributes (`border-top-left-radius / border-bottom-left-radius / border-top-right-radius / border-bottom-right-radius`) together. The problem is, that by merging those attributes together, it is not considering variables.\r\n\r\n\r\n## üî• Exception or Error\r\nThe following css code: \r\n<pre><code>\r\n--control-border-radius: 10px;\r\n\r\nborder-top-left-radius: 1px;\r\nborder-bottom-left-radius: 1px;\r\n    \r\nborder-top-left-radius: var(--control-border-radius);\r\nborder-bottom-left-radius: var(--control-border-radius);\r\nborder-top-right-radius: 0px;\r\nborder-bottom-right-radius: 0px;\r\n</code></pre>\r\n\r\nis being converted to: (using `ng build --prod`)\r\n\r\n<pre><code>\r\n--control-border-radius: 10px;\r\n...\r\nborder-top-left-radius: 1px;\r\nborder-bottom-left-radius: 1px;\r\n    \r\nborder-top-left-radius: var(--control-border-radius);\r\nborder-bottom-left-radius: var(--control-border-radius);\r\nborder-top-right-radius: 0px;\r\nborder-bottom-right-radius: 0px;\r\nborder: 1px 0px 0px 1px;\r\n</code></pre>\r\n\r\n\r\n## üåç Your Environment\r\nTested in Angular 7 and 9\r\n\r\n## Related issue:\r\n- https://github.com/angular/angular-cli/issues/10579\r\n\r\nUnfortunately the described workaround does not work for me.\r\n```\r\n/* clean-css ignore:start */\r\n...\r\n/* clean-css ignore:end */\r\n``` \r\n","Url":"https://github.com/angular/angular-cli/issues/15684","RelatedDescription":"Closed issue \"CSS variables incorrectly optimized using prod flag\" (#15684)"},{"Id":"499163541","IsPullRequest":false,"CreatedAt":"2019-09-27T05:47:11","Actor":"dinobu","Number":"15692","RawContent":null,"Title":"ng command not found on Mac","State":"closed","Body":"\r\n\r\n\r\n# üêû Bug report\r\n\r\n### Command (mark with an `x`)\r\n<!-- Can you pin-point the command or commands that are effected by this bug? -->\r\nNo, this is issue with installation on Macbook Pro\r\n```\r\n- [ ] new\r\n- [ ] build\r\n- [ ] serve\r\n- [ ] test\r\n- [ ] e2e\r\n- [ ] generate\r\n- [ ] add\r\n- [ ] update\r\n- [ ] lint\r\n- [ ] xi18n\r\n- [ ] run\r\n- [ ] config\r\n- [ ] help\r\n- [ ] version\r\n- [ ] doc\r\n```\r\n\r\n### Is this a regression?\r\n\r\n<!-- Did this behavior use to work in the previous version? -->\r\nI dont know, I am new to angular\r\n\r\n\r\n### Description\r\nSTEPS\r\n1. sudo npm uninstall -g angular-cli\r\n2. sudo npm uninstall -g @angular/cli\r\n3. sudo npm cache clean --force\r\n4. sudo npm install -g @angular/cli\r\n5. sudo npm link @angular/cli\r\n6. ng -v results in -bash: ng: command not found\r\n7.

Most users will probably not notice, but any code that\n    depended on stream behavior always being deferred until next tick will\n    need to adjust.\n\nThe mississippi methods 'to', 'from', 'through', and so on, have been\nreplaced with their Minipass counterparts, and streaming interaction\nwith the file system is done via fs-minipass.\n\nThe following modules are of interest here:\n\n-   [minipass](http://npm.im/minipass) The core stream library.\n\n-   [fs-minipass](http://npm.im/fs-minipass)  Note that the 'WriteStream'\n    class from fs-minipass is _not_ a Minipass stream, but rather a plain\n    old EventEmitter that duck types as a Writable.\n\n-   [minipass-collect](http://npm.im/minipass-collect) Gather up all the\n    data from a stream.  Cacache only uses Collect.PassThrough, which is a\n    basic Minipass passthrough stream which emits a 'collect' event with\n    the completed data just before the 'end' event.\n\n-   [minipass-pipeline](http://npm.im/minipass-pipeline) Connect one or\n    more streams into a pipe chain.  Errors anywhere in the pipeline are\n    proxied down the chain and then up to the Pipeline object itself.\n    Writes go into the head, reads go to the tail.  Used in place of\n    pump() and pumpify().\n\n-   [minipass-flush](http://npm.im/minipass-flush) A Minipass passthrough\n    stream that defers its 'end' event until after a flush() method has\n    completed (either calling the supplied callback, or returning a\n    promise.)  Use in place of flush-write-stream (aka mississippi.to).\n\nStreams from through2, concat-stream, and the behavior provided by\nend-of-stream are all implemented in Minipass itself.\n\nFeatures of interest to cacache, which make Minipass a particularly good\nfit:\n\n-   All of the 'endish' events are normalized, so we can just listen on\n    'end' and know that finish, prefinish, and close will be handled as\n    well.\n-   Minipass doesn't waste time [containing\n    zalgo](https://blog.izs.me/2013/08/designing-apis-for-asynchrony).\n-   Minipass has built-in support for promises that indicate the end or\n    error: stream.promise(), stream.collect(), and stream.concat().\n-   With reliable and consistent timing guarantees, much less\n    error-checking logic is required.  We can be more confident that an\n    error is being thrown or emitted in the correct place, rather than in\n    a callback which is deferred, resulting in a hung promise or\n    uncaughtException.\n\nThe biggest downside of Minipass is that it lacks some of the internal\ncharacteristics of node-core streams, which many community modules use\nto identify streams.  They have no \\_writableState or \\_readableState\nobjects, or \\_read or \\_write methods.  As a result, the is-stream module\n(at least, at the time of this commit) doesn't recognize Minipass\nstreams as readable or writable streams.\n\nAll in all, the changes required of downstream users should be minimal,\nbut are unlikely to be zero.  Hence the semver major change.\n\n##### Features\n\n-   replace all streams with Minipass streams ([f4c0962](https://togithub.com/npm/cacache/commit/f4c0962))\n-   **deps:** Add minipass and minipass-pipeline ([a6545a9](https://togithub.com/npm/cacache/commit/a6545a9))\n-   **promise:** converted .resolve to native promise, converted .map and .reduce to native ([220c56d](https://togithub.com/npm/cacache/commit/220c56d))\n-   **promise:** individually promisifing functions as needed ([74b939e](https://togithub.com/npm/cacache/commit/74b939e))\n-   **promise:** moved .reject from bluebird to native promise ([1d56da1](https://togithub.com/npm/cacache/commit/1d56da1))\n-   **promise:** removed .fromNode, removed .join ([9c457a0](https://togithub.com/npm/cacache/commit/9c457a0))\n-   **promise:** removed .map, replaced with p-map. removed .try ([cc3ee05](https://togithub.com/npm/cacache/commit/cc3ee05))\n-   **promise:** removed .tap ([0260f12](https://togithub.com/npm/cacache/commit/0260f12))\n-   **promise:** removed .using/.disposer ([5d832f3](https://togithub.com/npm/cacache/commit/5d832f3))\n-   **promise:** removed bluebird ([c21298c](https://togithub.com/npm/cacache/commit/c21298c))\n-   **promise:** removed bluebird specific .catch calls ([28aeeac](https://togithub.com/npm/cacache/commit/28aeeac))\n-   **promise:** replaced .reduce and .mapSeries ([478f5cb](https://togithub.com/npm/cacache/commit/478f5cb))\n\n##### [12.0.3](https://togithub.com/npm/cacache/compare/v12.0.2...v12.0.3) (2019-08-19)\n\n##### Bug Fixes\n\n-   do not chown if not running as root ([2d80af9](https://togithub.com/npm/cacache/commit/2d80af9))\n\n##### [12.0.2](https://togithub.com/npm/cacache/compare/v12.0.1...v12.0.2) (2019-07-19)\n\n##### [12.0.1](https://togithub.com/npm/cacache/compare/v12.0.0...v12.0.1) (2019-07-19)\n\n-   **deps** Abstracted out `lib/util/infer-owner.js` to\n    [@&#8203;npmcli/infer-owner](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@&#8203;npmcli/infer-owner)\n    so that it could be more easily used in other parts of the npm CLI.\n\n</details>\n\n---\n\n### Renovate configuration\n\n:date: **Schedule**: \"after 10pm every weekday,before 4am every weekday,every weekend\" in timezone America/Tijuana.\n\n:vertical_traffic_light: **Automerge**: Disabled by config.

Simplified resulting HTML (removing some classes on the button, all classes visible in stackblitz) is shown below. \r\n\r\n```\r\n<button id=\"my-button\">\r\n  <span class=\"mat-button-wrapper\">Click me!</span>\r\n</button>\r\n```\r\nAs a result, when the user clicks on the center of the button (where the text is), the event.target doesn't get the target.id=\"my-button\"; instead, target.id=\"\" and Google Tag Manager doesn't trigger. If the user clicks on the edge of the button, then the target.id=\"my-button\".\r\n\r\n#### Reproduction\r\n\r\nStackBlitz:\r\n\r\nhttps://stackblitz.com/edit/angular-ljrxvd\r\n\r\nSteps to reproduce:\r\n1. In Stackblitz app, click on text in the button. The displayed event.target.id = '' and the outer HTML is the inserted <span>.\r\n2. Next, click on the EDGE of the button (avoiding the text). The displayed event.target.id = 'my-button' and the outer HTML is the inserted <button id=\"my-button\">.\r\n\r\nGoogle Tag Manager will not catch the majority of clicks which trigger the \"span\", not the button with the ID. (This stackblitz demo is not integrated with GTM.)\r\n\r\nIs there some way to overcome this and use Google Tag Manager as intended (set up triggers and tags non programmatically)?\r\n\r\nIs there some way to ensure the event.target.id is the id of the button?\r\n  \r\n#### Environment\r\n\r\n- Angular: 8.2.7\r\n- CDK/Material: 8.2.1\r\n- Browser(s): Chrome, Safari\r\n- Operating System (e.g. Windows, macOS, Ubuntu): Currently testing on Mac\r\n","Url":"https://github.com/angular/components/issues/17199","RelatedDescription":"Closed issue \"Google Tag Manager incompatible with MatButtonModule\" (#17199)"},{"Id":"498590200","IsPullRequest":false,"CreatedAt":"2019-09-26T08:05:39","Actor":"stayingcool","Number":"17204","RawContent":null,"Title":"Unable to copy text from disabled matInput on firefox.
