Unfortunately, the Orchestrator often receives the validation request seconds before the Gallery has had a chance to persist changes to its database. In other words, the Orchestrator often waits a full minute to validate a package, when in reality, it should have only waited a few seconds.\r\n\r\nThis change aims to drastically reduce the time the Orchestrator waits to start a package's validation by delaying the delivery of the validation request by 5 seconds.\r\n\r\n## Supporting Data\r\n\r\nI ran the following Application Insights query:\r\n\r\n```\r\ntraces\r\n| where message contains \"Starting Enqueuing asynchronous package validation\"\r\n| join (requests | where name == \"POST Packages/VerifyPackage\" or name == \"PUT Api/PushPackageApi\" | project requestTimestamp = timestamp, duration, operation_Id) on operation_Id \r\n| project requestTimestamp, validationTimestamp = timestamp, duration\r\n| extend timeToEnqueue = ((validationTimestamp - requestTimestamp)/ time(1ms))\r\n| extend timeAfterEnqueue = duration - timeToEnqueue\r\n| summarize percentiles(timeAfterEnqueue, 10, 50, 75, 80, 90, 95, 99), max(timeAfterEnqueue)\r\n```\r\n\r\nThis `timeAfterEnqueue` estimates the the time upload requests spent after the validation request has been enqueued to persist changes to the database (it also includes the package upload to blob storage).

Restore succeeds locally in VS 2017. Locally I am using dotnet sdk 2.0.0, and nuget 4.3.1. On the VSTS (cloud) server, I am specifying the latest nuget version, 4.5.0. I have tried many other versions, including 4.3.1 with no success.\r\n\r\nI know there is an older, similar question on stackoverflow, but that was never answered satisfactorily, in my opinion.\r\n\r\nIf I look at the meta data in VS, at the top of one of the Automapper files I can see this:\r\n\r\nAssembly AutoMapper, Version=6.2.2.0, Culture=neutral, PublicKeyToken=be96cd2c38ef1005\r\n// C:\\Users\\randyg.nuget\\packages\\automapper\\6.2.2\\lib\\netstandard1.3\\AutoMapper.dll\r\n\r\nFrom this you can see it's taking the netstandard1.3 version, which is correct. I'm wondering if the nuget on the build server is looking for a netcoreApp2.0 folder, rather than the netstandard1.3 folder? Following this theory, I tried adding this to my .csproj file:\r\n\r\n<AssetTargetFallback>$(AssetTargetFallback);netstandard1.3</AssetTargetFallback>\r\nMy theory was this would tell nuget to look for a netstandard1.3 version of automapper if it couldn't find a netcoreapp2.0 version. However, this didn't have any effect. I later read that behind the scenes this fallback is already added automatically.\r\n\r\nIf anyone has any ideas I would greatly appreciate it. I'm pulling out (what's left of) my hair on this, as this is the only package giving me trouble, and it's a critical one for my project.\r\n\r\nOn the build server I'm using .NET Core sdk 2.0.3 as well, if that matters.\r\n\r\nUpdate - I just tried adding a new project to my solution, with a target of netstandard1.3, then adding AutoMapper as a dependency. Restore is now working on the build server for this project. So it seems the problem is specific to having a project with target = netcoreapp2.0??"},{"Id":"7279219082","Type":"IssuesEvent","CreatedAt":"2018-02-22T03:03:08","Actor":"mishra14","Repository":"NuGet/Home","Organization":"NuGet","RawContent":null,"RelatedAction":"closed","RelatedUrl":"https://github.com/NuGet/Home/issues/6441","RelatedDescription":"Closed issue \"NotImplemented exception when running `nuget pack foo.csproj` on Linux\" (#6441) at NuGet/Home","RelatedBody":"## Details about Problem\r\n\r\nNuGet Version: 4.4.1.4656\r\nUbuntu 16.04.3 LTS\r\nmono 5.4.1.6\r\n\r\n## Detailed repro steps so we can see the same problem\r\n\r\n1.

A year ago, we introduced [scoped API keys](https://blog.nuget.org/20170202/introducing-scoped-api-keys.html) to help our users better manage their API keys. While we recommend the use of scoped API keys, we will continue to support our legacy 'Full access API keys' that were previously granted by the service. Such keys do not expire if you use them at least one every 365 days to push a package.\r\n \r\nWe are making a change to our service such that a newly issued API key cannot be copied after the page is refreshed. While this was always the case for scoped API keys, we were allowing users with 'Full access API keys' to copy them down at any point. We plan to remove this capability in the future, as making this change allows us to migrate all of our APIs keys to use a one-way hash and further protect against malicious use of the key.\r\n\r\n**Starting Feb 5th 2018, the 'Full access API key' cannot be copied from NuGet.org**. While most of the packages pushed to NuGet.org now use a scoped API key and are not impacted by this change, users continuing to use our legacy 'Full access API keys' will need to securely stash the key before this date after which they will not be accessible. Please note that the 'Full access API keys' will continue to work just like they did before. We are only removing the ability to copy them down from NuGet.org.\r\n\r\nIf you have further question, please reach out to us by commenting on the [discussion issue](https://github.com/NuGet/NuGetGallery/issues/5231) or send me an email at [anangaur@microsoft.com](mailto:anangaur@microsoft.com).
