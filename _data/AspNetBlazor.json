In case of yes, and it would be released relatively soon, then we can close the issue and wait for it.\r\n\r\nOtherwise, here are the features we would like to add to the current router:\r\n\r\n1.

I have created the duplicate with the hope that experts here can help me to tune the performance of the code build with Blazor. I am using Blazor version 0.3.0.\r\n\r\n\r\nIt is stated [here](https://webassembly.org) that\r\n> WebAssembly aims to execute at native speed\r\n\r\nTherefore, **mono-wasm** is expected to perform nearly the same as on desktop. Unfortunately, mono for WebAssembly is far away in performance than expected, it is on average 200x slower.\r\n\r\nConsider this code:\r\n```C#\r\nvar sw = Stopwatch.StartNew();\r\nvar a = Math.PI;\r\nfor (var i = 0; i < 1080; i++) {\r\n    for (var j = 0; j < 1000000; j++) {\r\n        a += Math.PI;\r\n    }\r\n}\r\nConsole.WriteLine(\"Elapsed \" + sw.Elapsed);\r\n```\r\nIt prints\r\n`Elapsed 00:00:00.9990513` when running in **.NET Core**\r\n`Elapsed 00:00:02.9962702` when running in **mono** on desktop\r\n`Elapsed 00:21:38.9038000` when running in **Blazor** (Google Chrome browser). This is >400x slower than mono on desktop!\r\n\r\nThe same code in JavaScript shows almost the same performance as in .NET Core:\r\n```JavaScript\r\nlet t = performance.now();\r\nlet a = Math.PI;\r\nfor (let i = 0; i < 1080; i++) {\r\n    for (let j = 0; j < 1000000; j++) {\r\n        a += Math.PI;\r\n    }\r\n}\r\nt = performance.now() - t;\r\nconsole.log(\"Elapsed \" + t + \" milliseconds\");\r\n```\r\nIt prints\r\n`Elapsed 1179.1999999986729 milliseconds`\r\n\r\nBy the way, mono-wasm in the latest Firefox shows better performance than in Chrome (`Elapsed 00:01:13.5770000`), but still very slow on average.\r\n\r\nSo my questions are:\r\n1. Why **mono-wasm** is too slow?\r\n2. Is it possible to tune its performance somehow?\r\n\r\nMy environment:\r\nHardware: ThinkPad X1 Carbon (2nd Gen), CPU: 4th Gen Intel® Core™ i7-4600U (3.30GHz 1600MHz 4MB)\r\nOS: Windows 10 Pro 64-bit 1803\r\nBrowser: Google Chrome 66.0.3359.181 (Official Build) (64-bit)\r\nMono-wasm from [this package](https://www.nuget.org/packages/Microsoft.AspNetCore.Blazor.Build/0.3.0)\r\nMono for desktop version 5.12.0 Stable (5.12.0.226) 64-bit\r\n.NET Core version 2.1.300-preview2-008533\r\n","Url":"https://github.com/aspnet/Blazor/issues/860","RelatedDescription":"Closed issue \"Performance of code in Blazor is extremely poor (~200x slower than on desktop)\" (#860)"},{"Id":"324635893","IsPullRequest":false,"CreatedAt":"2018-05-19T15:11:56","Actor":"MrFoxPro","Number":"859","RawContent":null,"Title":"Blazor shows empty page","State":"closed","Body":"Following [instructions](https://blazor.net/docs/get-started.html) i created project.\r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/17229619/40269899-caad63fa-5b9d-11e8-932d-00d4fcc1160e.png)\r\nThen i launched project using `dotnet run` command and opened browser on url, that was displayed.
