Developers are advised to update their .NET Core SDK to versions 1.1.8 or 2.1.101.\r\n\r\n## Discussion\r\n\r\nUse *TBD* for discussion of this advisory.\r\n\r\n### Mitigation Factors\r\nNone\r\n\r\n### Affected Software\r\n\r\nAny application running against .NET Core 1.0.9 or lower versions, 1.1.6 or lower minor versions or 2.0.5 or lower minor versions is affected. \r\n\r\n### Advisory FAQ\r\n#### How do I know if I am affected?\r\nAny application running against .NET Core 1.0.9 or lower versions, 1.1.6 or lower minor versions or 2.0.5 or lower minor versions is affected. \r\n\r\nA complete list of runtimes can be discovered by performing a directory listing in the install root directories. The default root directories are listed in the following table:\r\n\r\n| Operating System | Location |\r\n|------------------|----------|\r\n| Windows\t| `C:\\Program Files\\dotnet\\shared\\Microsoft.NETCore.App\\` |\r\n| macOS\t| `/usr/local/share/dotnet/shared/Microsoft.NETCore.App/` |\r\n| Supported Linux platforms\t| `/usr/share/dotnet/shared/Microsoft.NETCore.App/` |\r\n\r\nEach runtime version is installed in its own directory, where the directory name is the version number. If you don't have a directory for 1.0.10, 1.1.7 and 2.0.6, then any applications targeting the respective major/minor versions, 1.0 or 1.1 or 2.0 of .NET Core are vulnerable.\r\n\r\nAdditionally, if you've deployed self-contained applications targeting any of the impacted versions, these applications are also vulnerable and must be recompiled and redeployed.\r\n\r\n#### How do I fix my affected application?\r\n\r\nApplications can be fixed by installing the latest .NET Core runtimes or SDKs. Typically, application servers only have runtime packages installed and developer machines have the SDKs installed. \r\nInstallers for the runtimes can be downloaded from the [Runtime and SDK download archive](https://github.com/dotnet/core/blob/master/release-notes/download-archive.md). \r\n.NET Core 1.1.8 SDK installs both versions 1.0.10 and 1.1.7 of the .NET Core runtime.\r\n\r\nIf you've built a self-contained application, you must install the new runtime and SDK, recompile your application and redeploy.\r\n\r\n#### What if the update breaks my application?\r\nAn application can be pinned to a previous version of the runtime by editing the `application.runtime.config` file for that application. Set the framework version to the desired version and the `rollForward` property to false. These settings should be treated as a temporary measure and the application updated to work with the patched versions of the framework.\r\n\r\nSince the `application.runtime.config` file is an optional file, you may need to create one for each application and add it alongside the executable.\r\n\r\n### Acknowledgments\r\n[Ben Adams](https://twitter.com/ben_a_adams) of [Illyriad Games](https://www.illyriad.co.uk/)\r\n\r\n### External Links\r\n[CVE-2018-0875](https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2018-0875)\r\n\r\n### Revisions\r\n\r\nV1.0 (Mar 13, 2018): Advisory published.\r\n\r\n_Version 1.0_\r\n_Last Updated 2018-03-13_\r\n"}],"ResultType":"GitHubEvent"},"CoreCLR":{"Events":[{"Id":"7582441106","Type":"PullRequestEvent","CreatedAt":"2018-04-25T04:15:16","Actor":"BruceForstall","Repository":"dotnet/coreclr","Organization":"dotnet","RawContent":null,"RelatedAction":"merged","RelatedUrl":"https://github.com/dotnet/coreclr/pull/17757","RelatedDescription":"Merged pull request \"Disable all failing Ubuntu arm corefx tests\" (#17757) at dotnet/coreclr","RelatedBody":""},{"Id":"7582344556","Type":"IssuesEvent","CreatedAt":"2018-04-25T03:35:32","Actor":"Petermarcu","Repository":"dotnet/coreclr","Organization":"dotnet","RawContent":null,"RelatedAction":"closed","RelatedUrl":"https://github.com/dotnet/coreclr/issues/3977","RelatedDescription":"Closed issue \"ARM 32-bit progress\" (#3977) at dotnet/coreclr","RelatedBody":"I'm opening an issue to track the progress of ARM 32-bit with respects to the regression tests.\n\nCurrently I'm getting the following results on Ubuntu 14.04 running on a NVidia Jetson TK1.

With #2010, we introduced a breaking change in a scenario that was not supported, but could sometimes work.  We decided to fix the breaking change for 2.1.3xx, which we'll track with this bug.  Separately, we will probably bring back the breaking change, making sure that we have a clear error or warning message, in a subsequent release.  We'll track that with #2170."},{"Id":"7581324946","Type":"PullRequestEvent","CreatedAt":"2018-04-24T21:50:13","Actor":"nugetlurker","Repository":"dotnet/sdk","Organization":"dotnet","RawContent":null,"RelatedAction":"opened","RelatedUrl":"https://github.com/dotnet/sdk/pull/2177","RelatedDescription":"Opened pull request \"Insert NuGet Build 4.7.0-rtm.5148 into sdk\" (#2177) at dotnet/sdk","RelatedBody":"Insert NuGet Build 4.7.0-rtm.5148 into sdk release/2.1.2xx branch"},{"Id":"7581130843","Type":"PullRequestEvent","CreatedAt":"2018-04-24T21:08:30","Actor":"tannergooding","Repository":"dotnet/sdk","Organization":"dotnet","RawContent":null,"RelatedAction":"opened","RelatedUrl":"https://github.com/dotnet/sdk/pull/2176","RelatedDescription":"Opened pull request \" Merge remote-tracking branch 'dotnet/release/2.1.3xx' into 'release/2.1.4xx'\" (#2176) at dotnet/sdk","RelatedBody":"FYI. @livarcocc, @dotnet/cli-contrib "},{"Id":"7581115561","Type":"PullRequestEvent","CreatedAt":"2018-04-24T21:05:25","Actor":"tannergooding","Repository":"dotnet/sdk","Organization":"dotnet","RawContent":null,"RelatedAction":"merged","RelatedUrl":"https://github.com/dotnet/sdk/pull/2166","RelatedDescription":"Merged pull request \"Merge remote-tracking branch 'dotnet/release/2.1.2xx' into version-tasks\" (#2166) at dotnet/sdk","RelatedBody":"FYI. @nguerrera, @livarcocc "},{"Id":"7580915902","Type":"PullRequestEvent","CreatedAt":"2018-04-24T20:26:36","Actor":"dsplaisted","Repository":"dotnet/sdk","Organization":"dotnet","RawContent":null,"RelatedAction":"merged","RelatedUrl":"https://github.com/dotnet/sdk/pull/2174","RelatedDescription":"Merged pull request \"Set ProjectAssetsFile property in SDK if it's not already set\" (#2174) at dotnet/sdk","RelatedBody":"Fixes #2173"}],"ResultType":"GitHubEvent"},"Twitter":{"ResultType":"TwitterTimeline","Tweets":[{"Id":"987375741204508673","CreatedAt":"2018-04-20T17:01:35+00:00","UserScreenname":"dotnet","Text":"Help us plan the future of .NET! https://t.co/R0QoZVvXx4","Source":"<a href=\"https://about.twitter.com/products/tweetdeck\" rel=\"nofollow\">TweetDeck</a>","RetweetCount":124,"FavoriteCount":93,"RawContent":null},{"Id":"986692696507953152","CreatedAt":"2018-04-18T19:47:25+00:00","UserScreenname":"dotnet","Text":"Performance Improvements in .NET Core 2.1 https://t.co/6YMK8P99cZ","Source":"<a href=\"https://about.twitter.com/products/tweetdeck\" rel=\"nofollow\">TweetDeck</a>","RetweetCount":250,"FavoriteCount":152,"RawContent":null},{"Id":"986692437211987969","CreatedAt":"2018-04-18T19:46:23+00:00","UserScreenname":"dotnet","Text":"Announcing Visual Studio 2017 15.7 Preview 4 https://t.co/XYIzXNDMhn","Source":"<a href=\"https://about.twitter.com/products/tweetdeck\" rel=\"nofollow\">TweetDeck</a>","RetweetCount":63,"FavoriteCount":44,"RawContent":null},{"Id":"986400394786914304","CreatedAt":"2018-04-18T00:25:55+00:00","UserScreenname":"dotnet","Text":".NET Core April 2018 Update https://t.co/PuT2Jc7GBy","Source":"<a href=\"https://about.twitter.com/products/tweetdeck\" rel=\"nofollow\">TweetDeck</a>","RetweetCount":71,"FavoriteCount":33,"RawContent":null},{"Id":"985915431499259904","CreatedAt":"2018-04-16T16:18:50+00:00","UserScreenname":"dotnet","Text":"Join our @csharpfritz and his pair-programming guest @fiercekittenz tomorrow for some LIVE CODING and discussion ab… https://t.co/Vll8gfdlKQ","Source":"<a href=\"https://about.twitter.com/products/tweetdeck\" rel=\"nofollow\">TweetDeck</a>","RetweetCount":11,"FavoriteCount":5,"RawContent":null}]}},"RunOn":"2018-04-25T05:30:23.7068386Z","RunDurationInMilliseconds":9001}
