The implementation is:\r\n\r\n### ParentComponent\r\n\r\n```\r\n@page \"/ParentComponent\"\r\n\r\n<h1>Parent Component</h1>\r\n\r\n<p>ParentYear: @ParentYear</p>\r\n\r\n<ChildComponent bind-Year=\"@ParentYear\" />\r\n\r\n@functions {\r\n    [Parameter]\r\n    private int ParentYear { get; set; } = 1978;\r\n}\r\n```\r\n### ChildComponent\r\n```\r\n<h2>Child Component</h2>\r\n<p>Year: @Year</p>\r\n\r\n<button class=\"btn btn-primary\" onclick=\"@ChangeTheYear\">Change Year to 1986</button>\r\n\r\n@functions {\r\n    [Parameter]\r\n    private int Year { get; set; }\r\n\r\n    [Parameter]\r\n    private Action<int> YearChanged { get; set; }\r\n\r\n    void ChangeTheYear()\r\n    {\r\n        Year = 1986;\r\n    }\r\n}\r\n```\r\nBut this approach doesn't work. So I tried to bind the event and value directly (see the code below), but it still fails, the only improvement is that now I can see the \"I was called\" line in the console output.\r\n\r\n### ParentComponent\r\n```\r\n@page \"/ParentComponent\"\r\n\r\n<h1>Parent Component</h1>\r\n\r\n<p>ParentYear: @ParentYear</p>\r\n\r\n<ChildComponent Year=\"@ParentYear\"  YearChanged=\"@((e) => { Console.WriteLine(\"I was called\"); @ParentYear = e;})\"/>\r\n\r\n@functions {\r\n    [Parameter]\r\n    private int ParentYear { get; set; } = 1978;\r\n}\r\n```\r\n### ChildComponent\r\n```\r\n<h2>Child Component</h2>\r\n\r\n<p>Year: @Year</p>\r\n\r\n<button class=\"btn btn-primary\" onclick=\"@ChangeTheYear\">Change Year to 1986</button>\r\n\r\n@functions {\r\n    [Parameter]\r\n    private int Year { get; set; }\r\n\r\n    [Parameter]\r\n    private Action<int> YearChanged { get; set; }\r\n\r\n    void ChangeTheYear()\r\n    {\r\n        Year = 1986;\r\n        YearChanged(Year);\r\n    }\r\n}\r\n```\r\nThen I added manualy UI refresh\r\n### ParentComponent\r\n```\r\n@page \"/ParentComponent\"\r\n\r\n<h1>Parent Component</h1>\r\n\r\n<p>ParentYear: @ParentYear</p>\r\n\r\n<ChildComponent Year=\"@ParentYear\" YearChanged=\"@((e) =>\r\n                                   {\r\n                                       Console.WriteLine(\"I was called!\");\r\n                                       @ParentYear = e;\r\n                                       StateHasChanged();\r\n                                   })\"></ChildComponent>\r\n\r\n@functions {\r\n    [Parameter]\r\n    private int ParentYear { get; set; } = 1978;\r\n}\r\n```\r\n### Child Component \r\n```\r\n<h2>Child Component</h2>\r\n\r\n<p>Year: @Year</p>\r\n\r\n<button class=\"btn btn-primary\" onclick=\"@ChangeTheYear\">Change Year to 1986</button>\r\n\r\n@functions {\r\n    [Parameter]\r\n    private int Year { get; set; }\r\n\r\n    [Parameter]\r\n    private Action<int> YearChanged { get; set; }\r\n\r\n    void ChangeTheYear()\r\n    {\r\n        Year = 1986;\r\n        YearChanged(Year);\r\n    }\r\n}\r\n```\r\nThe last thing I tried was to add a manual UI refresh via StateHasChanged(), this works, but I don't understand why the forced refresh is necessary, as the bind-{property} syntax should perform a Two-Way binding already. Is this behaviour intended or is it a bug? \r\n\r\nThanks and regards,\r\nAlberto\r\n","Url":"https://github.com/aspnet/Blazor/issues/1355","RelatedDescription":"Closed issue \"How to access parent component from child component.\" (#1355)"},{"Id":"352990423","IsPullRequest":false,"CreatedAt":"2018-08-24T12:29:01","Actor":"AnkitSharma-007","Number":"1347","RawContent":null,"Title":"dbContext getting updated without post while using EF Core with server-side Blazor","State":"closed","Body":"I tried creating a SPA using EF Core with Server-side Blazor.

\r\nFirst i should mention that blazor is preety awsome and in some aspects is much more convenient than other client side frame work i mean doing\r\n      `if(a){\r\n           <p>true</p>\r\n        }\r\n        else{\r\n              <p>false</p>\r\n       }`\r\nis simpler than *ngIf or the react way tnx to razor, and javascript intrope is really great and else\r\nBut in terms of performance it really is 'i have to say' bad\r\nIt takes 8 to 11 sec for first time loading even in published project in production mode and 3 to 5 for next reload which most of the time happens instantly in angular or react, also in terms of changing component it still experience huge performance gap, and also it consume lots of resources (cpu) but as i understand wasm should outpreforme js, so i was wondering why it is so weak in performance\r\nIs it because it still is in experimental phase and we should expect huuuuuuuuge performance gain by the time of final realese or not?\r\nTnx","Url":"https://github.com/aspnet/Blazor/issues/1336","RelatedDescription":"Closed issue \"Performance\"
