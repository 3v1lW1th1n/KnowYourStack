(old fix was reverted due to broken tests, this PR doesn't adds any test)\r\n\r\n\r\n## Proposed changes\r\n\r\n- Windows Forms has an embedded `hand.cur` (supposedly) due to previously supporting OSes not having `IDC_HAND`.\r\n- Windows Forms on .NET Core does not supports those operating systems anymore.\r\n- The `hand.cur` remains, and it looks terrible on high DPI screens as well as not respecting user cursor customization.\r\n- This change removes it, and instead uses the hand cursor that is built-in to the system.\r\n\r\n<!-- We are in TELL-MODE the following section must be completed -->\r\n\r\n## Customer Impact\r\n\r\n- Customers will see their system hand cursor instead of an old, pixelated hand cursor in Windows Forms apps.\r\n\r\n## Regression? \r\n\r\n- No\r\n\r\n## Risk\r\n\r\n- None, because all the operating systems supported by Windows Forms on .NET Core have this system cursor.\r\n\r\n<!-- end TELL-MODE -->\r\n\r\n\r\n## Screenshots <!-- Remove

methodology <!-- How did you ensure quality? -->\r\n\r\n- It builds\r\n- I did not directly try running something affected by the change, but I have been using reflection that does the same for a while in a production app, and have observed no breakage nor received user complaints (this app is what the screenshots are showing)\r\n\r\n## Accessibility testing  <!-- Remove this section if PR does not change UI -->\r\n\r\nI did not test this change using Accessibility Insights, but I don't think this will affect accessibility negatively (it might even affect it positively, for people that require the use of different-colored or big cursors)\r\n\r\n## Test environment(s) <!-- Remove any that don't apply -->\r\n\r\n```\r\n.NET Core SDK (reflecting any global.json):\r\n Version:

What if someone wants to make the entire form look like the UWP dark theme on Windows 10 but hard coded as dark theme?\r\n\r\nI think the application should be able to colorize the scrollbars without:\r\n1. Using undocumented windows api that can always change or break.\r\n2. Reinventing the wheel and having to create their own hacked together scrollbar for a hacked together class that would end up being the same scrollable controls we got now.\r\n\r\nI am also in the works of investigating NCPAINT on forms themeselves and getting the real bounds of that area; I know for sure at least on 10, 8, and 8.1 those bounds should be rectangle, on windows XP ~ 7 rounded rectangle using Regions. I was thinking of somehow inside of Form class calculate it by OS version the true bounds; then use a custom FormNCRenderer class (which I will intend to be subclassable) which would contain the painting of the NC area; text; and icon with system menu; which itself would allow use of an ContextMenuRenderer; and an for the Minimize; maximize; close; and help buttons allow yet another renderer separate from FormNCRenderer to keep it small and concise and readable.\r\n\r\nI think if we want to allow theming we should allow the user to override the system painting as well entirely.\r\n\r\nI hope my 'hacking' for this on my program can benefit everyone eventually.\r\n","Url":"https://github.com/dotnet/winforms/issues/2040","RelatedDescription":"Open issue \"[API Addition] Use ScollBar control for ScrollableControls to allow usage of Custom ScrollBarRenderers.\" (#2040)"},{"Id":"502969088","IsPullRequest":false,"CreatedAt":"2019-10-05T14:19:13","Actor":"AArnott","Number":"2039","RawContent":null,"Title":"Eliminate elevation required to init/build repo","State":"open","Body":"From what @russkie says over at https://github.com/AArnott/Xunit.StaFact/issues/30#issuecomment-538639542, the reason that `build-local.ps1` is required to elevate is to create a symlink. \r\n\r\nIt's true that VS requires the .NET SDK to be installed at the machine-wide location. Installing that would require elevation if it were not already installed. But building and testing from the command line should not require a machine-installed SDK. The build-local.ps1 is a local build and thus shouldn't (by default) require elevation.\r\n\r\nI think it's odd that the repo *requires* a local (per user or per repo?) install of the .NET SDK (if I read @russkie's comment correctly). But if it does, IMO it shouldn't be symlinked from the machine location because that requires that it actually be installed at the machine location. But even if it were sym-link'd, that does *not* require elevation. the `mklink /j` command creates directory junctions without elevation.\r\n\r\nSo: can we remove the elevation requirement?","Url":"https://github.com/dotnet/winforms/issues/2039","RelatedDescription":"Open issue \"Eliminate elevation required to init/build repo\" (#2039)"},{"Id":"502766284","IsPullRequest":false,"CreatedAt":"2019-10-04T17:53:17","Actor":"Tanya-Solyanik","Number":"2036","RawContent":null,"Title":"[Port] Regressions in custom DataGridView cell editing controls ","State":"open","Body":"* .NET Core Version: 3.0\r\n* Have you experienced this same bug with .NET Framework?: Yes\r\n\r\n<!-- Read https://github.com/dotnet/winforms/blob/master/Documentation/issue-guide.md -->\r\n\r\n**Problem description:**\r\nPort fix for https://devdiv.visualstudio.com/DevDiv/_workitems/edit/989913 (repro app is attached to the VSO bug)\r\nSteps to reproduce: A customer has reported this in the forums.\r\n1.
