I'm running with the Router's urlUpdateStrategy set to \"eager\". \r\n\r\nI have a modal outlet, in which the routes have a canDeactivate guard preventing the user from closing the modal when there is pending changes. Until version 7.2.1, the user would be able to attempt to close the modal as many times as they wanted, triggering the guard every time. In version 7.2.1 and onwards, the guard is triggered the first time, but not on subsequent navigation attempts.\r\n\r\nAs far as I can see, this unexpected behavior is due to https://github.com/angular/angular/commit/6ae7aee. It seems like the following change is a bit aggressive: https://github.com/angular/angular/blob/6ae7aee2c397f0454f1fe9395ca769ee2efd8198/packages/router/src/router.ts#L510\r\n\r\nIf you debug the above mentioned code in the reproduction, you'll see that the browserUrlTree is updated before the guard runs, and the changes aren't being undone when the guard denies navigation. This behavior will cause subsequent attempts to close the modal to stop at the following check: https://github.com/angular/angular/blob/6ae7aee2c397f0454f1fe9395ca769ee2efd8198/packages/router/src/router.ts#L466\r\n\r\n\r\n## 🔬 Minimal Reproduction\r\nhttps://stackblitz.com/edit/angular-issue-repro2-yq1jm2\r\n\r\n## 🔥 Exception or Error\r\nNone\r\n\r\n\r\n## 🌍  Your Environment\r\n\r\n**Angular Version:**\r\n<pre><code>\r\n<!-- run `ng version` and paste output below -->\r\n<!-- ✍️-->\r\n\r\n</code></pre>\r\n\r\n**Anything else relevant?**\r\nOnly happens when the Router's urlUpdateStrategy is set to \"eager\".\r\n","Url":"https://github.com/angular/angular/issues/28561","RelatedDescription":"Open issue \"Repeated navigation attempts not possible when canDeactivate guard turns down initial navigation and urlUpdateStrategy set to \"eager\"\" (#28561)"},{"Id":"407210889","IsPullRequest":false,"CreatedAt":"2019-02-06T12:49:24","Actor":"shekharsumanpandey-tudip","Number":"28559","RawContent":null,"Title":"subscribe show deprecate.","State":"closed","Body":"Hello,\r\n\r\nI have a problem with subscribe which show depricate.\r\nNode: 8.11.2,\r\nNpm: 6.7.0\r\n\r\n  \"@angular/animations\": \"^7.2.3\",\r\n    \"@angular/common\": \"^7.2.3\",\r\n    \"@angular/compiler\": \"^7.2.3\",\r\n    \"@angular/core\": \"^7.2.3\",\r\n    \"@angular/forms\": \"^7.2.3\",\r\n    \"@angular/http\": \"^7.2.3\",\r\n    \"@angular/platform-browser\": \"^7.2.3\",\r\n    \"@angular/platform-browser-dynamic\": \"^7.2.3\",\r\n    \"@angular/router\": \"^7.2.3\",\r\n\r\n \"devDependencies\": {\r\n    \"@angular-devkit/build-angular\": \"~0.13.0\",\r\n    \"@angular/cli\": \"^7.3.0\",\r\n    \"@angular/compiler-cli\": \"^7.2.3\",\r\n    \"@types/core-js\": \"0.9.35\",\r\n    \"@types/jasmine\": \"2.5.38\",\r\n    \"@types/jquery.slimscroll\": \"1.3.30\",\r\n    \"@types/node\": \"6.0.60\",\r\n    \"typescript\": \"3.1.1\"\r\n  }\r\n}\r\nWe are using HttpClient for API call.\r\n\r\n![subscribe_issue](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/23448126/52341039-85ed4c80-2a37-11e9-9514-62ced3cbec5e.png)\r\n\r\nPlease find the attached screenshot of the code snippet.\r\n \r\nCan any one help me out with this.","Url":"https://github.com/angular/angular/issues/28559","RelatedDescription":"Closed issue \"subscribe show deprecate.\" (#28559)"},{"Id":"407217339","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2019-02-06T12:42:39","Actor":"pkozlowski-opensource","Number":"28560","RawContent":null,"Title":"fix(ivy): properly query root nodes of embedded views(shallow queries)","State":"open","Body":"This PR fixes FW-803 (Queries for root nodes of embedded views aren't working properly).\r\n\r\nWhile fixing this bug and going through the existing query logic I've realised that:\r\n* with the current implementation a content child / children query can select a host node on which it is defined - while this is the behaviour of the view engine, it is also very counter-intuitive and was reported as a bug (#10098) breaking several real-life use cases;\r\n* the fact that a query can match its host significantly contributes to the queries code complexity so actually fixing makes the query code smaller and easier to follow.\r\n\r\nGiven the above this PR can be seen as:\r\n* a fix for FW-803;\r\n* a fix for #10098\r\n* a refactoring that significantly simplifies existing queries code (several methods with non-trivial branching logic are simplified - `getOrCreateCurrentQueries ` goes away and `addNode` becomes trivial).\r\n\r\n**Note**:  a fix for #10098 could be seen as a breaking change, as proven by the needed fix to the `routerLinkActive` directive. It is definitively a change in behaviour but I would argue that this is a fix / improvement as previously people had trouble properly write tree-like directives. Not to mention that  `ContentChild` \\ `ContentChildren` name indicates that a query should look for its children (and not try to match itself).\r\n\r\n**Note**:  @IgorMinar `public_api_guard/router/router.d.ts` file changed suggesting that we are changing public API. While it is true, technically speaking, real-life impact should not be visible to users:\r\n* usage in templates doesn't change;\r\n* if someone instantiates the `routerLinkActive` directly (calling its constructor) it should have no impact either as new arguments are optional.","Url":"https://github.com/angular/angular/pull/28560","RelatedDescription":"Open PR \"fix(ivy): properly query root nodes of embedded views(shallow queries)\" (#28560)"},{"Id":"407134416","IsPullRequest":false,"CreatedAt":"2019-02-06T08:57:14","Actor":"Serginho","Number":"28556","RawContent":null,"Title":"Bazel yarn_install doesn't work with package.json postinstall script.","State":"open","Body":"<!--🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅\r\n\r\nOh hi there! 😄\r\n\r\nTo expedite issue processing please search open and closed issues before submitting a new one.\r\nExisting issues often contain information about workarounds, resolution, or progress updates.\r\n\r\n🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅-->\r\n\r\n\r\n# 🐞 bug report\r\n\r\n### Affected Package\r\n<!-- Can you pin-point one or more @angular/* packages as the source of the bug? -->\r\n<!-- ✍️edit: --> The issue is caused by package @angular/bazel\r\n\r\n### Is this a regression?\r\nNo\r\n\r\n### Description\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n## 🔬 Minimal Reproduction\r\n- `ng new testproject`\r\n- Go to `package.json` and add `postinstall: \"node ./scripts/vendor-patches.js\"`\r\n- Run bazel\r\n## 🔥 Exception or Error\r\n<pre><code>\r\ninternal/modules/cjs/loader.js:582\r\n    throw err;\r\n    ^\r\n\r\nError: Cannot find module '/private/var/tmp/_bazel_user/1278b7bdb66d5638f4b8805b0e51d711/external/npm/scripts/vendor-patches.js'\r\n    at Function.Module._resolveFilename (internal/modules/cjs/loader.js:580:15)\r\n    at Function.Module._load (internal/modules/cjs/loader.js:506:25)\r\n    at Function.Module.runMain (internal/modules/cjs/loader.js:741:12)\r\n    at startup (internal/bootstrap/node.js:285:19)\r\n    at bootstrapNodeJSCore (internal/bootstrap/node.js:739:3)\r\nerror Command failed with exit code 1.\r\n\r\n</code></pre>\r\n\r\n\r\n## 🌍  Your Environment\r\n\r\n**Angular Version:** 7.2.2\r\n\r\n</code></pre>\r\n\r\n**Anything else relevant?**\r\n<!-- ✍️Is this a browser specific issue?

It can now however seem like this plugin is mistakenly always included.\r\n\r\n1. Even though I specify `\"sourceMap\": false` in `angular.json`\r\n\r\n2. Config is [normalized](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli/blob/v7.2.3/packages/angular_devkit/build_angular/src/karma/index.ts#L42-L46)\r\n\r\n3. `sourceMap` option is [further normalized](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli/blob/v7.2.3/packages/angular_devkit/build_angular/src/utils/normalize-builder-schema.ts#L59)\r\n\r\n4. Normalization of `sourceMap` always ends up with [an object](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli/blob/v7.2.3/packages/angular_devkit/build_angular/src/utils/normalize-source-maps.ts#L17-L22)\r\n\r\n5. `source-map-support` is [conditionally included](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli/blob/v7.2.3/packages/angular_devkit/build_angular/src/angular-cli-files/plugins/karma.ts#L80-L93), but the condition is always true\r\n\r\n## 🔬 Minimal Reproduction\r\n\r\n```\r\n$ ng new foo\r\n$ cd foo\r\n$ npm install karma-jsdom-launcher jsdom\r\n$ sed -i 's/Chrome/jsdom/g' src/karma.conf.js\r\n$ sed -i 's/chrome/jsdom/g' src/karma.conf.js\r\n```\r\n\r\nThen run `ng test` and watch the process never exit.\r\n\r\n## 🔥 Exception or Error\r\n\r\nI was made aware of this issue in https://github.com/badeball/karma-jsdom-launcher/issues/27. Project of said issue aims to allow `jsdom` to be used as a target browser. Making synchronous requests like `source-map-support` does will create a deadlock and halt execution indefinitely.\r\n\r\n## 🌍 Your Environment\r\n\r\n```\r\n$ ng --version\r\n\r\n     _                      _                 ____ _     ___\r\n    / \\   _ __   __ _ _   _| | __ _ _ __     / ___| |   |_ _|\r\n   / △ \\ | '_ \\ / _` | | | | |/ _` | '__|   | |   | |    | |\r\n  / ___ \\| | | | (_| | |_| | | (_| | |      | |___| |___ | |\r\n /_/   \\_\\_| |_|\\__, |\\__,_|_|\\__,_|_|       \\____|_____|___|\r\n                |___/\r\n    \r\n\r\nAngular CLI: 7.3.0\r\nNode: 11.8.0\r\nOS: linux x64\r\nAngular: 7.2.3\r\n... animations, common, compiler, compiler-cli, core, forms\r\n... language-service, platform-browser, platform-browser-dynamic\r\n... router\r\n\r\nPackage                           Version\r\n-----------------------------------------------------------\r\n@angular-devkit/architect         0.13.0\r\n@angular-devkit/build-angular     0.13.0\r\n@angular-devkit/build-optimizer   0.13.0\r\n@angular-devkit/build-webpack     0.13.0\r\n@angular-devkit/core              7.3.0\r\n@angular-devkit/schematics        7.3.0\r\n@angular/cli                      7.3.0\r\n@ngtools/webpack                  7.3.0\r\n@schematics/angular               7.3.0\r\n@schematics/update                0.13.0\r\nrxjs                              6.3.3\r\ntypescript                        3.2.4\r\nwebpack                           4.29.0\r\n`` ","Url":"https://github.com/angular/angular-cli/issues/13580","RelatedDescription":"Closed issue \"Inability to avoid including `source-map-support` in Karma tests\" (#13580)"},{"Id":"406017872","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2019-02-06T05:15:37","Actor":"renovate-bot","Number":"13583","RawContent":null,"Title":"build: update ajv to version 6.8.1","State":"closed","Body":"This PR contains the following updates:\n\n| Package | Type | Update | Change | References |\n|---|---|---|---|---|\n| ajv | dependencies | minor | `6.7.0` -> `6.8.1` | [source](https://togithub.com/epoberezkin/ajv) |\n| ajv | devDependencies | minor | `6.7.0` -> `6.8.1` | [source](https://togithub.com/epoberezkin/ajv) |\n\n---\n\n### Release Notes\n\n<details>\n<summary>epoberezkin/ajv</summary>\n\n### [`v6.8.1`](https://togithub.com/epoberezkin/ajv/compare/v6.8.0...v6.8.1)\n\n[Compare Source](https://togithub.com/epoberezkin/ajv/compare/v6.8.0...v6.8.1)\n\n### [`v6.8.0`](https://togithub.com/epoberezkin/ajv/releases/v6.8.0)\n\n[Compare Source](https://togithub.com/epoberezkin/ajv/compare/v6.7.0...v6.8.0)\n\nDocs: [security considerations](https://togithub.com/epoberezkin/ajv#security-considerations).\n[Meta-schema](https://togithub.com/epoberezkin/ajv/blob/master/lib/refs/json-schema-secure.json) for the security assessment of JSON Schemas.\n\n</details>\n\n---\n\n### Renovate configuration\n\n:date: **Schedule**: \"after 10pm every weekday,before 4am every weekday,every weekend\" in timezone America/Tijuana.\n\n:vertical_traffic_light: **Automerge**: Disabled by config.

Description\r\nIt would be a great feature to have the possibility to add the newly generated component|class|service|... to a barrel file when using the ng generate <c|s|class|...>.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Describe the solution you'd like\r\nThe barrel exportation could be an option that is defaulted to false. The exportation would be in the module of the generated item if any index.ts file is present:\r\n#### Examples\r\n##### The folder diagram\r\n```\r\n\r\no\r\n| --core\r\n|   | --core.module.ts\r\n|   | --index.ts  // core module's barrel\r\n|   | --services\r\n|   `-- models\r\n|-- pages\r\n|   |-- pages.module.ts\r\n|   |-- index.ts // pages module's barrel\r\n|   |-- dashboard\r\n|   |   |-- dashboard.module.ts\r\n|   |   `-- index.ts  // dashboard module's barrel. \r\n|    | `-- about\r\n|       |-- about.module.ts // This module doesn't have any barrel\r\n|       `-- about // about component folder is exported in index.ts of about module's barrel\r\n    `-- shared // more folder for style\r\n```\r\n\r\n##### Generating a module with barrels enabled\r\n```\r\nng g m pages/about\r\n```\r\nGenerate a module without any barrels in it. If the user had specified `-b` an `index.ts` file would have been created.\r\n\r\n\r\n##### Generating a new service with the shorthand syntax\r\n```\r\nng generate service core/services/myService -b\r\n```\r\nThis generate a new service named MyService and it is exported in the \"closest\" relative module. That means that the `index.ts` is in the core folder\r\n\r\n\r\n##### Generating a new component with the long syntax\r\n```\r\nng generate component pages/dashboard/dash --barrel\r\n```\r\nThis generate a new component named DashComponent in the \"closest\" relative module. That means that the `index.ts` is in the dashboard folder.\r\n\r\n##### Generating a new component that has no barrel \r\n```\r\nng generate component /pages/about/me -b\r\n```\r\nThis still generate the component, but does not add anything to any barrel because the module it belongs to doesn't have one\r\n\r\n##### Generating a new component that has no barrel \r\n```\r\nng generate component /pages/about/me -b=pages\r\n```\r\nThis generate a new component named MeComponent in specified module. That means that the `index.ts` is in the pages folder.\r\n\r\n### Describe alternatives you've considered\r\nThere is currently a library doing this: https://www.npmjs.com/package/barrelsby, but we have to run a separate command everytime we create a new item, a lot of configuration is needed as well and there is a devDependency.\r\n","Url":"https://github.com/angular/angular-cli/issues/13590","RelatedDescription":"Closed issue \"Barrel generation options\" (#13590)"},{"Id":"406308086","IsPullRequest":false,"CreatedAt":"2019-02-04T12:30:35","Actor":"V3nsla","Number":"13588","RawContent":null,"Title":"Html changes not detected in watched library by \"ng serve --aot\"","State":"open","Body":"<!--🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅\r\n\r\nOh hi there! 😄\r\n\r\nTo expedite issue processing please search open and closed issues before submitting a new one.\r\nExisting issues often contain information about workarounds, resolution, or progress updates.\r\n\r\n🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅-->\r\n\r\n\r\n# 🐞 Bug report\r\n\r\n### Command\r\n<!-- Can you pin-point the command or commands that are effected by this bug? -->\r\n<!-- ✍️edit: -->\r\n```\r\n- [ ] new\r\n- [ ] build\r\n- [X] serve\r\n- [ ] test\r\n- [ ] e2e\r\n- [ ] generate\r\n- [ ] add\r\n- [ ] update\r\n- [ ] lint\r\n- [ ] xi18n\r\n- [ ] run\r\n- [ ] config\r\n- [ ] help\r\n- [ ] version\r\n- [ ] doc\r\n```\r\n\r\n\r\n### Description\r\n\r\nHtml changes are not detected in library when starting project using ng serve --aot. Library is built using --watch flag and main project is served with --aot. On html change build and serve process are triggered and page refreshes but with no changes in html. Typescript changes are visible  after rebuild. Html change is only visible when you restart ng serve --aot process. \r\n\r\nWithout --aot flag everything is working as intended. \r\n\r\nSame problem exists with npm linked external library (not in the same project).\r\n\r\n## 🔬 Minimal Reproduction\r\n\r\nI made a small repro of the problem: https://github.com/V3nsla/aot-lib-html-changes\r\n\r\nTo reproduce the problem build library using --watch flag (ng build lib --watch) and start main project using ng serve --aot. \r\n\r\nMake some changes in the template of LibComponent and save to trigger build process. After main project is recompiled html changes are not reflected. \r\n\r\n## 🌍 Your Environment\r\n<pre><code>\r\nAngular CLI: 7.3.0\r\nNode: 10.12.0\r\nOS: win32 x64\r\nAngular: 7.2.3\r\n... animations, common, compiler, compiler-cli, core, forms\r\n... language-service, platform-browser, platform-browser-dynamic\r\n... router\r\n\r\nPackage                            Version\r\n------------------------------------------------------------\r\n@angular-devkit/architect          0.13.0\r\n@angular-devkit/build-angular      0.13.0\r\n@angular-devkit/build-ng-packagr   0.13.0\r\n@angular-devkit/build-optimizer    0.13.0\r\n@angular-devkit/build-webpack      0.13.0\r\n@angular-devkit/core               7.3.0\r\n@angular-devkit/schematics         7.3.0\r\n@angular/cli                       7.3.0\r\n@ngtools/json-schema               1.1.0\r\n@ngtools/webpack                   7.3.0\r\n@schematics/angular                7.3.0\r\n@schematics/update                 0.13.0\r\nng-packagr                         4.7.0\r\nrxjs                               6.3.3\r\ntypescript                         3.2.4\r\nwebpack                            4.29.0\r\n</code></pre>\r\n","Url":"https://github.com/angular/angular-cli/issues/13588","RelatedDescription":"Open issue \"Html changes not detected in watched library by \"ng serve --aot\"\" (#13588)"},{"Id":"406241475","IsPullRequest":false,"CreatedAt":"2019-02-04T09:29:22","Actor":"hussyd","Number":"13587","RawContent":null,"Title":"Angular CLI 7.3.0 generated angular.json contains src/styles.sass entry instead of .scss extension","State":"closed","Body":"<!--🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅\r\n\r\nOh hi there!

dependency ???\r\n\r\n#### What is the expected behavior?\r\nInstall `@angular/forms` if needed by `@angular/material`.\r\n\r\n#### What is the current behavior?\r\n`@angular/forms` is not installed as dependency of `@angular/material`.\r\n\r\n#### What are the steps to reproduce?\r\n\r\n  * Start a new project (without the CLI schematics)\r\n  * Install angular core packages and @angular/material\r\n  * (Try to) build the application\r\n\r\n#### Which versions of Angular, Material, OS, TypeScript, browsers are affected?\r\n```\r\n    / \\   _ __   __ _ _   _| | __ _ _ __

event in order to bring its subscribers into the `NgZone`, however this means that we're also triggering change detection to any consumers that aren't subscribed to changes (e.g. `mat-button` only cares about the classes being applied). These changes move around some logic so that the `NgZone.run` is only hit if somebody has subscribed to the observable.\r\n\r\n**Caretaker note:** this PR had to be reverted before (#15076) because there was an app that depended on the extra change detections.
