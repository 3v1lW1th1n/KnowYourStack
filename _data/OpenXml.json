I am not sure if this will be frowned upon or not :)\r\n\r\nThis second step is largely based on this post from Eric White;\r\n\r\nhttps://blogs.msdn.microsoft.com/ericwhite/2009/04/21/using-documentbuilder-with-content-controls-for-document-assembly/\r\n\r\n\r\nAlthough in my practical experience (been using this code in production for months) the Word documents generated are valid I had issues with the Unit Tests.  I think this is because we are using Office 365 and it looks like the validator only supports up-to 2013 at the minute?
