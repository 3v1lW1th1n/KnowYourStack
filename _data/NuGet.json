Search for packages. The packages' list of versions should be generated using the [search results'](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/nuget/api/search-query-service-resource#search-result) `versions` field.\r\n1. Load the package's [registration index](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/nuget/api/registration-base-url-resource#registration-index). Example: https://api.nuget.org/v3/registration3-gz-semver2/fake/index.json\r\n1. If necessary, load the latest version's [registration page](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/nuget/api/registration-base-url-resource#registration-page). Example: https://api.nuget.org/v3/registration3-gz-semver2/fake/page/4.64.13/5.8.4.json\r\n\r\nThe differences between this suggestion and the current implementation:\r\n\r\n1.
