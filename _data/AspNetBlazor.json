This worked by posting the rendering action to the circuit's sync context. [See code here](https://github.com/aspnet/Blazor/pull/1672/files#diff-4a18bde3a2af3f8ec6fe58b9f99c7ea2R109). This was a fix to the issue reported at #1573.\r\n\r\nHowever in retrospect I'm not certain this is the right fix. As per Ryan's comment:\r\n\r\n> I would expect the code after the await to resume on the sync context\r\n\r\nWe have a test to show this does work, plus I've manually checked that our sync context *does* cause the lifecycle methods' `await` continuations to be run in series within a given circuit. So why was it necessary to make a further change to queue the render calls sequentally on the sync context? Why weren't they *already* running sequentially on the sync context?\r\n\r\nAfter some investigation, I think the reason is that in various places, we use `task.ContinueWith`, and surprisingly that does *not* honour `SynchonizationContext.Current` in the same way that `await` does. If we want `ContinueWith` to queue continuations on the sync context, we need to change the value of `TaskScheduler.Current` to something like `TaskScheduler.FromCurrentSynchronizationContext()`. I'm not certain where the right place to plug that in would be. If we can make this work, then we can remove the old workaround that explicitly marshals onto the sync context in `RemoteRenderer.AddToRenderQueue` (because we'll already be on it), which will be a good thing for perf.\r\n\r\nAdditionally, I think we should consider being stricter about forcing all UI interactions (`Render` calls at least) to be running inside a queued work item on the renderer's corresponding sync context. In any case where that's not happening, we should consider throwing like other UI frameworks do. That would help earlier diagnosis of any weirdness we may have missed.\r\n\r\ncc @rynowak for any comments or opinions.\r\n\r\n**Repro steps**\r\n\r\nIf you want to repro the original issue, go to `RemoteRenderer.cs` and remove its override of the `AddToRenderQueue` method (or comment out the call to `_syncContext.Post`, and just invoke `base.AddToRenderQueue` directly instead). Then run the E2E tests in server-side execution mode (launch `TestServer`, browse to http://localhost:port/subdir#server), open the \"Concurrent renders\" example, and see that the rendering has got all messed up because you removed the marshalling back onto the sync context.\r\n\r\nYou can also set a breakpoint inside `RenderHandle`'s `Render` method and use the immediate window to observe that, after the `await`, the call is *not* on the circuit sync context any more.","Url":"https://github.com/aspnet/Blazor/issues/1679","RelatedDescription":"Open issue \"Reconsider how rendering calls are run in series via sync context\" (#1679)"},{"Id":"380563123","IsPullRequest":false,"CreatedAt":"2018-11-14T16:33:58","Actor":"danroth27","Number":"1676","RawContent":null,"Title":"Strange method intellisense in Blazor app","State":"closed","Body":"![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/1874516/48465643-675d1980-e798-11e8-973c-cf10758d2913.png)\r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/1874516/48465671-7cd24380-e798-11e8-97b4-ba415f383657.png)\r\n\r\nThe type name for the Blazor component should just be `Index`.","Url":"https://github.com/aspnet/Blazor/issues/1676","RelatedDescription":"Closed issue \"Strange method intellisense in Blazor app\" (#1676)"},{"Id":"380633576","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2018-11-14T10:31:56","Actor":"StevenTCramer","Number":"1678","RawContent":null,"Title":"(TS) Object is possibly 'null' fix","State":"open","Body":"micro fix for #1670 \r\nadd the non-null assertion operator.","Url":"https://github.com/aspnet/Blazor/pull/1678","RelatedDescription":"Open PR \"(TS) Object is possibly 'null' fix\" (#1678)"},{"Id":"380568230","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2018-11-14T07:25:27","Actor":"danroth27","Number":"1677","RawContent":null,"Title":"Update survey link for 0.7.0","State":"open","Body":"","Url":"https://github.com/aspnet/Blazor/pull/1677","RelatedDescription":"Open PR \"Update survey link for 0.7.0\" (#1677)"},{"Id":"380281042","IsPullRequest":false,"CreatedAt":"2018-11-13T15:30:25","Actor":"BickelLukas","Number":"1675","RawContent":null,"Title":"Allow ComponentFactory to be extended","State":"open","Body":"When using a custom DI container that doesn't provide an IServiceProvider it's not possible to inject services into components.\r\n\r\nI'm using SimpleInjector as a DI container.

Fixes #1573","State":"closed","Body":"Another case where the asynchrony of server-side rendering needed some extra work to ensure the correct behaviors. This was a simple thread safety issue inside `Renderer`.\r\n\r\nTo a first approximation, I could have fixed it just by putting a `lock(_renderer) { ... }` around `RenderHandle`'s call to `_renderer.AddToRenderQueue`. However that could lead to deadlock because rendering can be re-entrant (a child can cause its own parent to re-render, e.g., by invoking some callback passed by the parent).\r\n\r\nThe solution here is to enqueue render calls on the circuit sync context. This causes some extra allocations per-render but provides an easy-to-reason-about solution. Plus it ensures that component lifecycle methods such as `Init` (which is invoked by the renderer) get executed serially within the sync context, which better matches up with the WebAssembly execution style.","Url":"https://github.com/aspnet/Blazor/pull/1672","RelatedDescription":"Closed or merged PR \"Serialize server-side renders.

A typical scenario would be when the user is typing and triggering `input` events on each keystroke.\r\n\r\nPreviously, if the client triggered the same event multiple times in quick succession, then the server might handle the first instance by re-rendering a component and hence disposing an event handler, then it might try to process the next instance and fail because the event handler was already disposed.\r\n\r\nWith this PR, the server delays the event handler disposals until it gets confirmation from the client that it's finished updating the UI with whatever renderbatch contains the disposal.\r\n\r\nThis should eliminate the issue, because once the client has updated the UI with whatever renderbatch contains the disposal, it can no longer legitimately try to trigger new instances of the event (the client knows it has gone from the UI). Also since client/server message delivery order is guaranteed, there's no way that an earlier event triggering message could come through *after* the client's message to confirm the completion of the renderbatch in which the event is disposed.","Url":"https://github.com/aspnet/Blazor/pull/1655","RelatedDescription":"Closed or merged PR \"Handle overlapping events\" (#1655)"},{"Id":"379829513","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2018-11-13T11:34:03","Actor":"SteveSandersonMS","Number":"1666","RawContent":null,"Title":"Fix intermittent render omissions. Fixes #1223.","State":"closed","Body":"As per #1223, there were some timing-based cases where server-side rendering would just fail to apply certain updates to the UI.\r\n\r\nThe underlying reason turned out to be a misunderstanding about how the SignalR APIs work: I thought that `SendAsync` would at least *send* the data synchronously, and that the returned `Task` represented the network transfer. In fact I was wrong, and `SendAsync` doesn't necessarily serialize the inputs synchronously - if the network channel is currently busy, it waits until it's free before serializing. This was problematic because we reuse `RenderBatch` instances and their buffers for subsequent renders, so if multiple renders occurred sufficiently close together in time, the 2nd or later render could have its data overwritten by the 3rd or later render before its data was dispatched to the client.\r\n\r\nThe fix here is the obvious one, i.e., to snapshot the `RenderBatch` data synchronously at the time when `UpdateDisplay` is called. This has the drawback that we are now allocating an extra `byte[]` on every render. Later on, we should consider putting in some kind of object pool for this.","Url":"https://github.com/aspnet/Blazor/pull/1666","RelatedDescription":"Closed or merged PR \"Fix intermittent render omissions.

You'd have to fix it by calling `StateHasChanged` manually in the consumer's `SomeMethod` or the lambda. This was annoying and confusing.\r\n\r\n### Example 2:\r\n\r\nPassthroughComponent.cshtml:\r\n\r\n```\r\n@ChildContent\r\n\r\n@functions {\r\n    [Parameter] RenderFragment ChildContent { get; set; }\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nConsumer.cshtml:\r\n\r\n```\r\n<PassthroughComponent>\r\n    <button OnClick=@(() => { clickCount++; })>Click me</button>\r\n</PassthroughComponent>\r\n\r\nClicks: @clickCount\r\n\r\n@functions {\r\n    int clickCount = 0;\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nAgain, clicking the button would seem to have no effect, unless you manually put `StateHasChanged` into the lambda.\r\n\r\n### Fix\r\n\r\nWe now route events to the component matching `eventHandlerDelegate.Target`, not the component that inserted the delegate into the render tree. This fixes both of the common cases above, and works with event handlers expressed as both methods and lambdas.\r\n\r\nThis also simplifies cases around binding. Components that expose custom bindables can now trigger updates in their consumers easily.\r\n\r\n### New API\r\n\r\nIn the case where a custom component wants to trigger a supplied event handler delegate indirectly (e.g., inside one of its own methods), there's now a public static API:\r\n\r\n```\r\nComponentEvents.InvokeEventHandler(someDelegate, eventArgs)\r\n```\r\n\r\nThis works with delegates that are `Action`, `Action<T>`, `Func<Task>`, `Func<T, Task>` (the fast paths), or arbitrary `MulticastDelgate` (slower path). It automatically causes the recipient to trigger its own re-rendering logic, including responses to async tasks (i.e., if it's a `Func<Task>`, then the recipient renders once synchronously, then again asynchronously after the task, just like normal event handlers).\r\n\r\n### Breaking change\r\n\r\nThere's one scenario where this may break something people were already doing, i.e., relying on the older strange behavior. Example:\r\n\r\n```\r\n<button onclick=@SomeOtherObject.SomeMethod>Click me</button>\r\n```\r\n\r\nPreviously, this would run `SomeOtherObject.SomeMethod` and then re-render the component. That might be useful if this method updated some global state that you read back during rendering.\r\n\r\nNow it will no longer re-render the component, because `SomeMethod` isn't on that component. If you actually do want to re-render the component in this case, the solution is to ensure you're actually calling one of its methods or lambdas, e.g.:\r\n\r\n```\r\n<button onclick=@(() => SomeOtherObject.SomeMethod())>Click me</button>\r\n```\r\n\r\nAlternatively, if you're actually updating some global state container, it's better still to have the state container raise some event that triggers all the necessary UI updates on all components, not just the one that raised the action.\r\n\r\nAlthough it's a slight drawback to have this breaking change, I still think this is the right thing to do. The new rules about when events update components are much simpler and easier to reason about (i.e., we re-render the component that owns the event handler method/lambda, regardless of who passed it where).","Url":"https://github.com/aspnet/Blazor/pull/1651","RelatedDescription":"Open PR \"Route events based on delegate target, not component ID\" (#1651)"}],"ResultType":"GitHubIssue"}},"RunOn":"2018-11-15T05:30:03.6905467Z","RunDurationInMilliseconds":2363}
