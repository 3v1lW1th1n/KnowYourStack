Click on the `/foo` link.\r\n\r\n### What is expected?\r\nIt redirects to `/redir`, with the hashtag still in the url.\r\n\r\n### What is actually happening?\r\nIt can't find `/redir#bar`\r\n\r\n---\r\nI have a page which opens accordions by using hashtags, and I would like to include these hashtags in the vue routers redirect function like so: `{ path: '/foo', redirect: '/redir#bar' }`. \r\n\r\nManually typing the url `/redir#bar` works.\r\n\r\nIt seems like the redirect tries to find the path `/redir#bar`, including the hashtag. What I would like to do is for it to redirect to the `/redir` path, with the hashtag `#bar` still in the URL, as if you would write the URL manually.\r\n\r\nIs this possible?\r\n\r\nRegards,\r\n\r\n<!-- generated by vue-issues.
