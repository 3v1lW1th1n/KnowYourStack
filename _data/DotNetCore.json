Here's the original code:\r\n\r\n```\r\n       public static List<T> OrderByField<T>(this ObservableCollection<T> observableCollection, string sortField, string sortDirection)\r\n        {\r\n            // Sort the collection based on the name of the parameter.\r\n            IQueryable<T> queryable = observableCollection.AsQueryable();\r\n            string method = sortDirection == \"Asc\" ? \"OrderBy\" : \"OrderByDescending\";\r\n            var parameter = Expression.Parameter(queryable.ElementType, \"p\");\r\n            var property = Expression.Property(parameter, sortField);\r\n            var expression = Expression.Lambda(property, parameter);\r\n            Type[] types = new Type[] { queryable.ElementType, expression.Body.Type };\r\n            var methodCallExpression = Expression.Call(typeof(Queryable), method, types, queryable.Expression, expression);\r\n            return queryable.Provider.CreateQuery<T>(methodCallExpression).ToList();\r\n        }\r\n\r\n```\r\nThis works great in my debug build, but crashes when I set '**Compile with .Net Native tool chain**' with the message: \r\n\r\n> No generic method 'OrderBy' on type 'System.Linq.Queryable' is compatible with the supplied type arguments and arguments. No type arguments should be provided if the method is non-generic.\r\n\r\nFurther testing showed that if I called the 'OrderBy' methods explicitly, rather than dynamically, before I performed the dynamic '**Expression.Call**' it would work with the **.Net Native tool chain** setting.  So I distilled the method down to this (this is not a fix, this just illustrates the problem):\r\n\r\n```\r\n        public static List<T> OrderByField<T>(this ObservableCollection<T> observableCollection, string sortField, string sortDirection)\r\n        {\r\n            // [HACK] This fixes it so that the call to Expression.Call doesn't crash.\r\n            IQueryable<T> queryable1 = new ObservableCollection<T>().AsQueryable();\r\n            Queryable.OrderBy<T, int>(queryable1, p => p.GetHashCode());\r\n            Queryable.OrderByDescending<T, int>(queryable1, p => p.GetHashCode());\r\n\r\n            // Sort the collection based on the name of the parameter.\r\n            IQueryable<T> queryable = observableCollection.AsQueryable();\r\n            string method = sortDirection == \"Asc\" ? \"OrderBy\" : \"OrderByDescending\";\r\n            var parameter = Expression.Parameter(queryable.ElementType, \"p\");\r\n            var property = Expression.Property(parameter, sortField);\r\n            var expression = Expression.Lambda(property, parameter);\r\n            Type[] types = new Type[] { queryable.ElementType, expression.Body.Type };\r\n            var methodCallExpression = Expression.Call(typeof(Queryable), method, types, queryable.Expression, expression);\r\n            return queryable.Provider.CreateQuery<T>(methodCallExpression).ToList();\r\n        }\r\n\r\n```\r\nThere is some strange bug in the dynamic **Expression.Call** that only expresses itself when compiled with the **.NET Native tool chain**.  Initializing the library by calling the functions explicitly seems to 'prime' the pump and allow the method to work as intended.","Url":"https://github.com/dotnet/standard/issues/1261","RelatedDescription":"Open issue \"Expression.Call exception on sorting with .NET native tool chain.\" (#1261)"},{"Id":"457672725","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2019-06-18T20:10:06","Actor":"dotnet-maestro-bot","Number":"1260","RawContent":null,"Title":"[automated] Merge branch 'master' => 'release/3.0'","State":"closed","Body":"I detected changes in the master branch which have not been merged yet to release/3.0.

This functionality works fine in .NET Framework, but is broken in .NET Core.\r\n\r\nThe broken functionality relates to importing XSD schemas for validation. When trying to import a second XSD document into a root XSD document, .NET Core does not parse the contents of the child XSD document. This is visible in the debugger, and in failures to parse future XML documents based on the schema. .NET Framework does not have this issue.\r\n\r\nHere is an example repro:\r\n\r\nFilename \"Repro-Config.xsd\":\r\n```\r\n<?xml version=\"1.0\" encoding=\"utf-8\"?>\r\n<xs:schema\r\n  xmlns=\"http://consanto.com/test/unit/configuration/v2.0\"\r\n  xmlns:tns=\"http://consanto.com/test/unit/configuration/v2.0\"\r\n  targetNamespace=\"http://consanto.com/test/unit/configuration/v2.0\"\r\n  xmlns:specialized=\"http://consanto.com/test/unit/configuration/v2.0/specialized\"\r\n  xmlns:xs=\"http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema\"\r\n  elementFormDefault=\"qualified\">\r\n\r\n  <xs:import\r\n    namespace=\"http://consanto.com/test/unit/configuration/v2.0/specialized\"\r\n    schemaLocation=\"Repro-Config-Specialized.xsd\"/>\r\n    \r\n  <xs:element name=\"RootProperty\"/>\r\n  \r\n  <xs:complexType name=\"Root\">\r\n    <xs:sequence>\r\n      <xs:element ref=\"RootProperty\" minOccurs=\"0\" maxOccurs=\"1\"/>\r\n      <xs:element ref=\"specialized:SpecialProperty\" minOccurs=\"0\" maxOccurs=\"1\"/>\r\n    </xs:sequence>\r\n  </xs:complexType>\r\n  \r\n  <xs:element name=\"Root\" type=\"tns:Root\" />\r\n\r\n</xs:schema>\r\n```\r\n\r\nFilename \"Repro-Config-Specialized.xsd\":\r\n```\r\n<?xml version=\"1.0\" encoding=\"utf-8\"?>\r\n<xs:schema\r\n  xmlns=\"http://consanto.com/test/unit/configuration/v2.0/specialized\"\r\n  xmlns:tns=\"http://consanto.com/test/unit/configuration/v2.0/specialized\"\r\n  targetNamespace=\"http://consanto.com/test/unit/configuration/v2.0/specialized\"\r\n  xmlns:xs=\"http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema\"\r\n  elementFormDefault=\"qualified\">\r\n\r\n  <xs:element name=\"SpecialProperty\" />\r\n\r\n</xs:schema>\r\n```\r\n\r\nFilename Program.cs:\r\n```\r\nusing System;\r\nusing System.Xml;\r\nusing System.Xml.Schema;\r\n\r\nnamespace XSDRepro\r\n{\r\n    class Program\r\n    {\r\n        static void Main(string[] args)\r\n        {\r\n            string xsdfile = \"Repro-Config.xsd\";\r\n            string xmlfile = \"Repro-Config-Specialized.xml\";\r\n\r\n            // Configure an XML reader with XSD validation enabled\r\n            var settings = new XmlReaderSettings();\r\n            XmlSchema schema = settings.Schemas.Add(null, xsdfile);\r\n            settings.ValidationType = ValidationType.Schema;\r\n            XmlReader reader = XmlReader.Create(xmlfile, settings);\r\n        }\r\n    }\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nIf this program is compiled with .NET Framework and run, it successfully validates the XML file.

Add a file structure feature similar to resharper that can view the structure of the current document. Although you can view this in the solution explorer and above the current file, navigating the current document is not very convenient, nor very intuitive.\r\n\r\nCurrently some file structure UI is provided in the Solution Explorer:\r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/8293542/60225230-c0b31e00-983a-11e9-8ef4-ca3bebc569ff.png)\r\n\r\nAnother user provided specific improvements they'd like to see in this experience:\r\n\r\n> The class properties and methods displayed in solution explorer are nice but there are drawbacks :\r\n> 1. It's only shown when manually continuing to expand the tree : when opening a new file, i would love to automatically view it's structure because I use it a lot on every classes.\r\n> 2. It's very very hard to compare several file structure on a quick view : when displayed on another window, I can see similarities or difference between different file structure simply by quickly switching between file tabs. \r\n> 3. There are not differences between what is overridden or not\r\n> 4. No file regions display : most of the time, regions are used to group methods/class.\r\n> 5. The method/properties name and type have the same color : it would be great to use the same editor colors\r\n> 6. No method/properties highlight I'm currently writing/clicking on : not mandatory but would be appreciated\r\n> \r\n> I work a lot with very big files (more than 4000 lines and about 100 properties/methods) and I do a lot of code refactoring to try to clean up the mess.\r\n> To me, the file structure window is very important and the biggest missing thing in Visual

refactor, when the method being pulled is private, will keep its visibility and will break existing usages on the current derived type.\n\nMy expectation would be to use this refactor when I create a method in a derived type and want all derived types of a certain base type to be able to use it as well. If the method is not changed to &quot;protected&quot; instead of private, that doesn't happen and all the usages of that function in the current class are broken.\n\nTo repro:\n1. Create a base class A and a derived class B.\n2. Create a private method in class B and use it from somewhere inside that class.\n3. Use the &quot;Pull members up to base type&quot; refactor to pull that private method up to A.\n4. All usages are broken.\n\nI'm reporting this because I would not see any other possible use for this refactor in a private method than being able to access it from all classes derived from the base, and right now I am forced to go onto the base class and manually change the visibility of the method.\n\nThanks,\nDavid\n\n_This issue has been moved from https://developercommunity.visualstudio.com/content/problem/599195/pull-members-up-to-base-type-breaks-existing-usage.html\nVSTS ticketId: 911340_\n_These are the original issue comments:_\n\nVisual Studio Feedback System on 6/10/2019, 01:36 AM (16 days ago): <p>We have directed your feedback to the appropriate engineering team for further evaluation.

This works for a JIT, but not so well for AOT.\r\n\r\nFollowing scheme is used to adapt this for AOT compilation:\r\n* We tell RyuJIT all non-VEX intrinsics are supported.\r\n* We intercept the `IsSupported` property calls on the individual intrinsic classes and instead of telling RyuJIT the `IsSupported` methods are intrinsics (that RyuJIT would expand to a constant `true` based on the flags we passed to RyuJIT), we treat them as normal method calls.\r\n* We rewrite the IL of the `IsSupported` method to read a value from an RVA static field and check for a bit (each bit representing a different ISA extension).\r\n* At process startup we initialize the RVA static field with bits based on a CPUID check.","Url":"https://github.com/dotnet/corert/pull/7549","RelatedDescription":"Open

The API uses existing algorithms in `hostpolicy` which are executed during application startup to process the `.deps.json` for the app.\r\n\r\nApps are allowed to contain assemblies which are also part of a framework which the app relies on. As an example app which relies on ASP.NET framework can also have a package reference for `System.Threading.Channels` (assembly which is part of the ASP.NET framework). The current behavior is:\r\n* For self-contained apps, the SDK will pick the higher version of the two and copy it into the app (so if the package reference is higher it overwrites the one in the framework, otherwise the one from framework wins).\r\n* For framework-dependent apps, the SDK will make the package assembly part of the app and it will write the assembly and file versions into the `.deps.json`. At runtime `hostpolicy` uses the version information to compare the assembly from the app against the one in the framework and it picks the one with the higher version.\r\n\r\nApplying this logic to dynamically loaded components means that we would want the \"framework dependent\" behavior for components as well (we don't support self-contained components - that sort of doesn't make sense). Note that during component dependency resolution we intentionally ignore the assemblies from the app itself (this is to enable component isolation), but we do want to consider the frameworks (as frameworks are assumed to always be shared between the app and the components).\r\n\r\nIf the component is loaded into a framework dependent app, this is easy to solve as `hostpolicy` will apply the exact same logic and compare assembly and file versions for framework assemblies.\r\n\r\nThe problem is if the component is loaded into a self-contained app, there's no way to tell which assemblies are from a framework and which belong to the app itself. As noted above we want to consider the framework assemblies, but ignore the app assemblies.\r\n\r\nThe ask here is to add some information somewhere such that the dependency resolution could always tell which assemblies are framework assemblies, even in self-contained apps. For the hosting layer, putting this information into `.deps.json` would make a lot of sense, but if it makes sense to put it elsewhere, it might work as well.\r\n\r\nThe problem is also discussed here: https://github.com/dotnet/core-setup/issues/6826\r\n\r\nWe would be OK for this to not be solved in 3.0 as we probably don't have enough time to make the necessary hosting changes to support the new information coming from the SDK.","Url":"https://github.com/dotnet/sdk/issues/3339","RelatedDescription":"Open issue \"Add ability to differentiate framework assemblies in self-contained apps\" (#3339)"},{"Id":"457161990","IsPullRequest":false,"CreatedAt":"2019-06-17T21:42:34","Actor":"fadimounir","Number":"3337","RawContent":null,"Title":"App host not published correctly after a previous PublishSingleFile","State":"open","Body":"To repro:\r\n1) dotnet new console\r\n2) dotnet publish -r win-x64 /p:PublishSingleFile\r\n3) dotnet publish -r win-x64\r\n\r\nAfter step 2, there will be a single app.exe (+pdb) file in the publish folder.

Either target .NET Core 2.1 or lower, or use a version of the .NET SDK that supports .NET Core 2.2.`\r\n\r\nIf you downloaded the .NET Core SDK 2.2 between April 2 and April 12, 2019, the main [.NET downloads page](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/download/) included only 2.2.2nn. Starting April 12th, a new button marked \"Compatible with Visual Studio 2017\" is provided to target 2.2.1nn. If you downloaded 2.2 prior to this date, and you use Visual Studio 2017, install the compatible version.\r\n\r\n### Visual Studio 2017 can't target .NET Core 2.1\r\n\r\nIf you receive this error message in Visual Studio 2017:\r\n\r\n`The current .NET SDK does not support targeting .NET Core 2.1. Either target .NET Core 2.0 or lower, or use a version of the .NET SDK that supports .NET Core 2.1.`\r\n\r\nThis problem most often occurs because you manually uninstall the 2.1.5nn version. Simply reinstall it from the [.NET Core 2.1 downloads page](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/download/dotnet-core/2.1).\r\n\r\n## More information\r\n\r\nHere is the draft of an article we are preparing for .NET Core documentation:\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n## Solving Problems with .NET Core SDK Selection in Visual Studio\r\n\r\nYou may have .NET Core SDKs on your machine and still have problems with Visual Studio finding an appropriate one. This article explains why this happens and how you can fix your installation.\r\n\r\nWhen Visual Studio can't find an appropriate version of the .NET Core SDK, you'll receive an error message. This may appear in the Error pane as NETSDK1045:\r\n\r\n\"The current .NET SDK does not support targeting .NET Core 2...\"\r\n\r\nYou can check what .NET Core SDKs you have on your machine with the following command:\r\n\r\n```bash\r\ndotnet --list-sdks\r\n```\r\n\r\nUnless you have a global.json file, when you use `dotnet` from the command line, the latest .NET Core SDK is used.\r\n\r\n> [TIP!] \r\n> Open a command prompt and try to build with `dotnet build`. If the command line build works, but Visual Studio doesn't suggestions in this article may help.\r\n\r\nThe last two digits of the .NET Core SDK version numbers are in the format are a patch number, which is represented by `nn` in this article because we will continue to service them to include the latest runtimes. To find out more, vist the [Overview of how .NET Core is versioned page](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/core/versions/).\r\n\r\n## Fixes for Common Problems\r\n\r\n### Visual Studio 2017 can't target .NET Core 2.2\r\n\r\nIf you receive the error message in Visual Studio 2017:\r\n\r\n`The current .NET SDK does not support targeting .NET Core 2.2… Either target .NET Core 2.1 or lower, or use a version of the .NET SDK that supports .NET Core 2.2.`\r\n\r\nUse `dotnet --list-sdks` to ensure you have .NET Core SDK 2.2.1nn. As an example, 2.2.106 would be a valid entry.\r\n\r\nIf you downloaded the .NET Core SDK 2.2 after April 2, 2019, version 2.2.2nn (such as 2.2.203) is listed first and is the highest version available. However, Visual Studio 2017 requires 2.2.1nn (such as 2.2.106). .NET Core SDK 2.2.2nn works with Visual Studio 2019. Visual Studio 2017 and Visual Studio 2019 can be installed side by side, but this requires both .NET Core SDK 2.2.1nn and .NET Core SDK 2.2.2nn to develop .NET Core 2.2 applications.\r\n\r\nTo download .NET Core SDK 2.2.2nn, visit the [.NET downloads page](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/download/dotnet-core/2.2).\r\n\r\n### Visual Studio 2017 can't target .NET Core 2.1\r\n\r\nIf you receive this error message in Visual Studio 2017:\r\n\r\n`The current .NET SDK does not support targeting .NET Core 2.1. Either target .NET Core 2.0 or lower, or use a version of the .NET SDK that supports .NET Core 2.1.`\r\n\r\nUse `dotnet --list-sdks` to ensure you have .NET Core SDK 2.1.5nn. As an example, 2.1.505 would be a valid entry. \r\n\r\nThis problem occurs of you manually uninstall the 2.1.5nn version.\r\n\r\nThe Visual Studio 2019 installation will not remove this file and Visual Studio 2017 will continue to work side by side.\r\n\r\nTo reinstall .NET Core SDK 2.1.5nn, visit the [.NET downloads page](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/download/dotnet-core/2.1).\r\n\r\n### Visual Studio 2019 can't target .NET Core 3.0 Preview\r\n\r\nIf you receive this error message in Visual Studio 2019:\r\n\r\n`The current .NET SDK does not support targeting .NET Core 2.1. Either target .NET Core 2.0 or lower, or use a version of the .NET SDK that supports .NET Core 2.1.`\r\n\r\nUse `dotnet --list-sdks` to ensure you have .NET Core SDK 3.0.100-preview... As an example, SDK 3.0.100-preview3-010431 would be a valid entry.\r\n\r\nTo install .NET Core SDK 3.0.1nn preview, visit the [.NET downloads page](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/download/dotnet-core/3.0).\r\n\r\nIn Visual Studio, go to `Tools\\Options\\Projects and Solutions\\.NET Core` and check the box `Use Previews of the .NET Core SDK`.\r\n\r\n> [NOTE!]\r\n> This option will be moving to `Tools\\Options\\Environment` and renamed `Preview Features` in Visual Studio 2019 version 16.1 Preview 2.\r\n\r\nIf you are targeting .NET Core 3.0 preview, the [C# language version will be C# 8.0 Preview by default](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/visualstudio/releases/2019/release-notes#csharp-defaults) allowing you to use new C# features.\r\n\r\n## Understand the relationship between .NET Core SDKs and Visual Studio build tools\r\n\r\nVisual Studio has its own copies of tools like MSBuild, NuGet and the compilers. If you install the .NET Core workload, it also installs the .NET Core SDK which has versions of these tools and provides tasks and targets. These two versions are built from the same repositories, but target .NET Framework and .NET Core respectively. \r\n\r\nWhen you build a .NET Core project in Visual Studio, it uses Visual Studio's copy of MSBuild, but the tasks and targets are supplied from the selected version of the .NET Core SDK. \r\n\r\nWhen you upgrade the .NET Core SDK, you get new tasks and targets. These new tasks and targets may contain features that are not supported by older versions of MSBuild. Like all of the .NET Core SDK, MSBuild is backwards compatible. It is not forwards compatible.\r\n\r\nThis generally works well, but requires a guarantee that the tasks and targets work with the MSBuild version. To ensure this, each .NET Core SDK indicates an MSBuild version range that is used by Visual Studio to determine compatibility. Versions of the .NET Core SDK that have a higher MSBuild identifier than expected are ignored by Visual Studio. In the normal case, this simply means you use the tasks and targets that were installed with your version of Visual Studio.\r\n\r\nBecause of this, you may have many versions of the .NET Core SDK on your machine and Visual Studio still fail to find one it considers appropriate. This is compounded by a poor error message, which we cannot fully correct because it is from the old version of the .NET Core SDK on your machine. Confusion is also compounded by a complex non-linear release matrix that makes it difficult to predict the right .NET Core SDK to select. We are working to improve all this. \r\n\r\n## The Visual Studio / .NET Core SDK support matrix\r\n\r\nThe last two digits of the .NET Core SDK version number are a patch number, which are represented by a `nn` in this table. You can learn more about .NET Core SDK and .NET Core Runtime versioning at the [Overview of how .NET Core is versioned page](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/core/versions/).\r\n\r\nThe following table shows which Visual Studio versions and .NET Core SDKs are compatible and how they are acquired if you are working with Visual Studio. \r\n\r\n| .NET Core SDK | .NET Core Runtime | Compatible Visual Studio | MSBuild | Notes                                     |\r\n|---------------|-------------------|--------------------------|---------|-------------------------------------------|\r\n| 2.1.5nn       | 2.1               | 2017                     | 15      | Installed as part of VS 2017 version 15.9 |\r\n| 2.1.6nn       | 2.1               | 2019                     | 16      | Installed as part of VS 2019              |\r\n| 2.2.1nn       | 2.2               | 2017                     | 15      | Installed manually                        |\r\n| 2.2.2nn       | 2.2               | 2019                     | 16      | Installed as part of VS 2019              |\r\n| 3.0.1nn       | 3.0 (Preview)     | 2019                     | 16      | Installed manually                        |\r\n\r\nVisual Studio 2017 cannot work with .NET Core SDK 2.1.6nn or 2.2.2nn.\r\n\r\nTo find out more about removing older versions of the .NET Core Runtime and .NET Core SDK, visit the [How to remove the .NET Core Runtime and SDK page](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/core/versions/remove-runtime-sdk-versions?tabs=macos).\r\n\r\nTo download the .NET Core SDK, visit the [.NET downloads page](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/download/dotnet-core).","Url":"https://github.com/dotnet/announcements/issues/108","RelatedDescription":"Open issue \".NET Core SDK 2.2.2nn and 2.1.6nn do not work with Visual Studio 2017\" (#108)"},{"Id":"432081093","IsPullRequest":false,"CreatedAt":"2019-04-11T15:16:43","Actor":"KathleenDollard","Number":"107","RawContent":null,"Title":"Limit DotNetCliToolReference Tools to .NET Core 2.2 and Below","State":"open","Body":"# Limit DotNetCliToolReference Tools to .NET Core 2.2 and Below\r\n\r\n.NET Core 3 takes the next step in the .NET Core tool strategy with local tools.

DotNetCliToolReference tools can be used in projects targeting .NET Core 3.0, but the tools themselves should target .NET Core 2.2 or below.\r\n\r\n## Discussion\r\n\r\nPlease share your thoughts on this change and see what others are saying at:\r\n\r\n[dotnet/sdk #3115](https://github.com/dotnet/sdk/issues/3115)\r\n\r\n## Details\r\n\r\nThe suggested approach going forward is to to use [.NET Core Local Tools](https://aka.ms/local-tools) when you want a tool that is specific to a project or repository. At the same time we are removing the need to access local tools by the verbose `dotnet tool run <toolname>` that was present in earlier previews. You can now access local tools via `dotnet <toolname>`.\r\n\r\nDotNetCliToolReference tools have a flaw in how their dependencies are restored which can create [difficult to diagnose bugs when running these tools](https://github.com/NuGet/Home/issues/5067). This issue would occur much more frequently if targeting .NET Core 3.0 was allowed. Restricting tools to target only .NET Core 2.2 and below means existing scenarios to continue to work (as well as they previously did), regardless of the framework version targeted by the project or the current .NET Core SDK. \r\n\r\nThe new .NET Core tool strategy avoids this flaw in restore strategy and offers other benefits, like the ability to author one type of tool and install it in different ways depending on project and user needs.\r\n\r\nWe look forward to your feedback on .NET Core Local Tools, and on challenges you face moving away from DotNetCliToolReference tools. \r\n\r\n[dotnet/sdk #3057](https://github.com/dotnet/sdk/pull/3057)","Url":"https://github.com/dotnet/announcements/issues/107","RelatedDescription":"Open issue \"Limit DotNetCliToolReference Tools to .NET Core 2.2 and Below\" (#107)"},{"Id":"431012407","IsPullRequest":false,"CreatedAt":"2019-04-09T14:51:18","Actor":"MichaelSimons","Number":"106","RawContent":null,"Title":".NET Core SDK container images now contain the Visual Studio 2019 toolset","State":"open","Body":"# .NET Core SDK container images now contain the Visual Studio 2019 toolset\r\n\r\n.NET Core SDK container images now include Visual Studio 2019 tools.

This will reduce the number of SDKs that are installed on programmer machines.\r\n\r\nFeature bands of the SDK are defined like 3.0.1nn. [Find out more about SDK version numbers](https://docs.microsoft.com/dotnet/core/versions/#versioning-details).\r\n\r\nThis means when .NET Core SDK 3.0.101 becomes available and is installed, .NET Core SDK 3.0.100 will be removed from the machine if it exists. When .NET Core SDK 3.0.200 becomes available and is installed on the same machine, .NET Core SDK versions like 3.0.101 will not be removed but stay side by side with 3.0.200.\r\n\r\nThis approach supports use of `global.json` which will roll forward across patch versions, but not feature bands of the SDK.

There are two primary reasons for this change:\r\n\r\n* Syndicate Microsoft-provided container images to multiple registries, like Docker Hub and Red Hat.\r\n* Use Microsoft Azure as a global CDN for delivering Microsoft-provided container images.\r\n\r\nYou will use and see MCR as a storage back-end for Microsoft images. The primary way you learn about Microsoft container images and tags will be through a registry, which for most users will continue to be Docker Hub. Most of the experience you've had browsing for .NET Core container images will continue unchanged with this new model. The Docker Hub URLs you've used for Microsoft repos will continue to work, and forward to updated locations on Docker Hub. Existing Docker Hub will images will be maintained as-is.\r\n\r\nSee [.NET Core Container Images now Published to Microsoft Container Registry](https://devblogs.microsoft.com/dotnet/net-core-container-images-now-published-to-microsoft-container-registry/) for the most updated information on our use of MCR.\r\n\r\n## Discussion\r\nPlease share your thoughts on this change and see what others are saying at:\r\n\r\n* [dotnet-docker #935](https://github.com/dotnet/dotnet-docker/issues/935)\r\n\r\n## Starting with .NET Core nightly repo\r\n\r\nOn the .NET team, we started our [transition to MCR](https://github.com/dotnet/dotnet-docker/issues/745) with the .NET Core \"nightly\" repo. [dotnet-nightly](dockerhub.com/r/microsoft/dotnet-nightly) is now hosted on MCR and syndicated to Docker Hub. We started with the nightly repo in order to discover and fix any challenges we found with this new model before we move our higher-traffic primary container repository.\r\n\r\nWe will start publishing [dotnet](dockerhub.com/r/microsoft/dotnet) to MCR a bit later, in either February or March. This issue will be updated when that happens.\r\n\r\n## Repo Split\r\n\r\nThe [.NET Core repo](https://hub.docker.com/r/microsoft/dotnet) currently includes 4 major categories of tags: \r\n\r\n* `sdk`\r\n* `aspnetcore-runtime`\r\n* `runtime` \r\n* `runtime-deps`\r\n\r\nProviding all of the tags in one place has helped with discoverability but made for a repo with an enormous README that can be challenging to navigate and consume. It is large enough that we exceeded Docker Hub README limits and had to artificially make it smaller.\r\n\r\nGoing forward, we will provide a repo for each of the tag categories listed above. We'll also provide a \"product repo\" that will hierarchicaly group all of our repos together. This will satisfy discoverability needs so that it will be easy to find the tags you want.\r\n\r\nYou can already see this experience with [microsoft-dotnet-core-nightly](https://hub.docker.com/_/microsoft-dotnet-core-nightly). There are now multiple repos for our nightly builds:\r\n\r\n* [.NET Core Nightly product repo](https://hub.docker.com/_/microsoft-dotnet-core-nightly)\r\n* [.NET Core SDK Nightly repo](https://hub.docker.com/_/microsoft-dotnet-core-nightly-sdk/)\r\n* [.NET Core ASP.NET Core Nightly repo](https://hub.docker.com/_/microsoft-dotnet-core-nightly-aspnet/)\r\n* [.NET Core Runtime Nightly repo](https://hub.docker.com/_/microsoft-dotnet-core-nightly-runtime/)\r\n* [.NET Core Runtime-deps Nightly repo](https://hub.docker.com/_/microsoft-dotnet-core-nightly-runtime-deps/)\r\n\r\nThe same split will exist for the non-nightly stable repo (currently hosted at  [microsoft/dotnet](https://hub.docker.com/r/microsoft/dotnet)) when we start publishing it to MCR and syndicating it back to DockerHub.\r\n\r\n## Changes to registry URL\r\n\r\nThe biggest change is that your Dockerfiles need to be updated to point to the MCR registry in order get access to new .NET Core container tags. The same change is required for scripts or human operations that pull images via `docker pull`.\r\n\r\nThe following example shows the registry path, repo and tag for the .NET Core 2.2 \"Nightly\" SDK on MCR:\r\n\r\n```console\r\nmcr.microsoft.com/dotnet/core-nightly/sdk:2.2\r\n```\r\n\r\nAs comparison, the following repo and tag have been used to date for the .NET Core 2.2 \"Nightly\" SDK on Docker Hub:\r\n\r\n```console\r\nmicrosoft/dotnet-nightly:2.2-sdk\r\n```\r\n\r\nThe new repo URL is provided at each of the news repos. For example, the new .NET Core SDK \"nightly\" repo provides a box on the right where you can copy and paste the correct MCR-based repo syntax that you can use for `docker pull` or in `FROM` statements in your Dockerfiles.\r\n\r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/2608468/52811702-95c5eb80-304a-11e9-8de8-e6ea1f4b4d75.png)\r\n\r\n## Servicing existing Docker Hub tags\r\n\r\nWe will continue to service existing non-version-specific or floating tags on Docker Hub while the associated .NET Core version is supported. For example the `microsoft/dotnet:2.1-sdk` tag is a floating tag that will continue to be serviced for the lifetime of .NET Core 2.1. You can continue using floating tags without issue.\r\n\r\nIf you use non-floating tags, like `microsoft/dotnet:2.1.504-sdk-alpine`, then you will need to update your Dockerfile to use a new non-floating tag. No new non-floating tags will be published to `microsoft/dotnet` and `microsoft/dotnet-nightly` after we fully transition to MCR.\r\n\r\n.NET Core 3.0 Preview 3 and later will only be made available on MCR.\r\n\r\n## Microsoft is a Verified Publisher\r\n\r\nUntil now, Microsoft-provided container images were considered \"community images\". As part of this change, we are re-classifying Microsoft as a \"verified publisher\" on Docker Hub. This designation should make it clearer that .NET and other Microsoft-provided images are coming from a verified source. There clearly was that expectation previously, but Docker is now making that clearer in the Docker Hub pages they host for Microsoft.\r\n\r\nWe will provide official vulnerability scanning Microsoft-provided images as a second phase of this transition.","Url":"https://github.com/dotnet/announcements/issues/101","RelatedDescription":"Open issue \"Publishing .NET Core images to Microsoft Container Registry (MCR)\" (#101)"},{"Id":"410784442","IsPullRequest":false,"CreatedAt":"2019-02-15T14:06:29","Actor":"TaraOverfield","Number":"100","RawContent":null,"Title":"RESOLVED: Advisory on February 2019 Security update for Windows 10 update 1809","State":"open","Body":"<strong><em>Final Update 2/19/19 @1:30 PM (PST)</em></strong><em>: This </em><em>advisory is now resolved with no action needed from Microsoft Customers.

If you are not using Microsoft.NetCore.App, you may still be affected if you are referencing the packages listed above.\r\n\r\n##### Direct dependencies\r\n\r\nDirect dependencies are discoverable by examining your `csproj` file. They can be fixed by [editing the project file](#fixing-direct-dependencies) or using NuGet to update the dependency.\r\n\r\n##### Transitive dependencies\r\n\r\nTransitive dependencies occur when you add a package to your project that in turn relies on another package. For example, if Contoso publishes a package `Contoso.Utility` which, in turn, depends on `Contoso.Internals` and you add the `Contoso.Utility` package to your project now your project has a direct dependency on `Contoso.Utility` and, because `Contoso.Utility` depends 'Contoso.Internals', your application gains a transitive dependency on the `Contoso.Internals` package.\r\n\r\nTransitive dependencies are reviewable in two ways:\r\n\r\n* In the Visual Studio Solution Explorer window, which supports searching.\r\n* By examining the `project.assets.json` file contained in the obj directory of your project for `csproj` based projects\r\n\r\nThe `project.assets.json` files are the authoritative list of all packages used by your project, containing both direct and transitive dependencies.\r\n\r\nThere are two ways to view transitive dependencies. You can either [use Visual Studio’s Solution Explorer](#vs-solution-explorer), or you can review [the `project.assets.json` file](#project-assets-json)).\r\n\r\n##### <a name=\"vs-solution-explorer\"></a>Using Visual Studio Solution Explorer\r\n\r\nTo use Solution Explorer, open the project in Visual Studio, and then press Ctrl+; to activate the search in Solution Explorer. Search for the [vulnerable package](#affected-software) and make a note of the version numbers of any results you find.\r\n\r\nFor example, searching for `Microsoft.AspNetCore.Mvc.Core` in an example project that contains a package that takes a dependency on `Microsoft.AspNetCore.Mvc` shows the following results in Visual Studio 2017:\r\n\r\n![Screenshot of search results in Visual Studio 2017](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/796298/25858816/8ecdc2b4-3491-11e7-9363-746804bb9832.png)\r\n\r\nThe search results appear as a tree. In the previous results, you can see that a reference to `Microsoft.AspNetCore.Mvc.Core` version 1.1.2 is discovered.\r\n\r\nUnder the Dependencies node is a NuGet node. Under the NuGet node is the list of packages you have directly taken a dependency on and their versions.\r\nIn screenshot, the application takes a direct dependency on `Microsoft.AspNetCore.Mvc`. `Microsoft.AspNetCore.Mvc` in turn has leaf nodes that list its dependencies and their versions.\r\nThe `Microsoft.AspNetCore.Mvc` package takes a dependency on a version of `Microsoft.AspNetCore.Mvc.ApiExplorer`, that in turn takes a dependency on a version of `Microsoft.AspNetCore.Mvc.Core`.\r\n\r\n##### <a name=\"project-assets-json\"></a> Manually reviewing project.assets.json\r\n\r\nOpen the *project.assets.json* file from your project’s obj directory in your editor. We suggest you use an editor that understands JSON and allows you to collapse and expand nodes to review this file.\r\nVisual Studio and Visual Studio Code provide JSON friendly editing.\r\n\r\nSearch the *project.assets.json* file for the [vulnerable package](#affected-software), using the format `packagename/` for each of the package names from the preceding table. If you find the assembly name in your search:\r\n\r\n* Examine the line on which they are found, the version number is after the `/`.\r\n* Compare to the [vulnerable versions table](#affected-software).\r\n\r\nFor example, a search result that shows `System.Private.Uri/4.3.0` is a reference to version 4.3.0 of `System.Private.Uri`.\r\n\r\nIf your *project.assets.json* file includes references to the [vulnerable package](#affected-software), then you need to fix the transitive dependencies.\r\n\r\nIf you have not found any reference to any vulnerable packages, this means either\r\n\r\n* None of your direct dependencies depend on any vulnerable packages, or\r\n* You have already fixed the problem by updating the direct dependencies.\r\n\r\n### <a name=\"how-fix\"></a>How do I fix the issue?\r\n\r\n#### Updating the version of Microsoft.NETCore.App\r\n\r\nIf your host version is a 2.1.x host you must install version 2.1.8 or later of the [.NET Core 2.1 runtime](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/download/dotnet-core/2.1), or corresponding [.NET Core 2.1 SDK](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/download/dotnet-core/2.1).\r\n\r\nIf your host version is a 2.2.x you must install version 2.2.2 or later of the [.NET Core 2.2 runtime](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/download/dotnet-core/2.2), or corresponding  [.NET Core 2.2 SDK](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/download/dotnet-core/2.2).\r\n\r\n#### <a name=\"fixing-direct-dependencies\"></a>Fixing direct dependencies\r\n\r\nOpen *projectname.csproj* in your editor. If you're using Visual Studio, right-click the project and choose **Edit projectname.csproj** from the context menu, where projectname is the name of your project. Look for `PackageReference` elements. The following shows an example project file:\r\n\r\n```xml\r\n<Project Sdk=\"Microsoft.NET.Sdk.Web\">\r\n  <PropertyGroup>\r\n    <TargetFramework>netcoreapp2.1</TargetFramework>\r\n  </PropertyGroup>\r\n  <ItemGroup>\r\n    <PackageReference Include=\"System.Private.Uri\" Version=\"4.3.0\" />\r\n  </ItemGroup>\r\n</Project>\r\n```\r\n\r\nThe preceding example has a reference to the [vulnerable package](#affected-software), as seen by the single `PackageReference` element. The name of the package is in the `Include` attribute.\r\nThe package version number is in the `Version` attribute. The previous example shows a single direct dependency on `System.Private.Uri` version 4.3.0\r\n\r\nTo update the version to the secure package, change the version number to the updated package version as listed on the table [previously](#affected-software).\r\nIn this example, update `System.Private.Uri` to the appropriate [fixed package number](#affected-software) for your major version. Save the *csproj* file. The example *csproj* now looks as follows:\r\n\r\n```xml\r\n<Project Sdk=\"Microsoft.NET.Sdk.Web\">\r\n  <PropertyGroup>\r\n    <TargetFramework>netcoreapp2.1</TargetFramework>\r\n  </PropertyGroup>\r\n  <ItemGroup>\r\n    <PackageReference Include=\"System.Private.Uri\" Version=\"4.3.0\" />\r\n  </ItemGroup>\r\n</Project>\r\n```\r\n\r\nIf you're using Visual Studio and you save your updated *csproj* file, Visual Studio will restore the new package version.\r\nYou can see the restore results by opening the **Output** window (Ctrl+Alt+O) and changing the **Show output from** drop-down list to **Package Manager**.\r\n\r\nIf you're not using Visual Studio, open a command line and change to your project directory. Execute the `dotnet restore` command to restore the updated dependencies.\r\n\r\nNow recompile your application. If after recompilation you see a *Dependency conflict warning*, you must update your other direct dependencies to versions that take a dependency on the updated package.\r\n\r\n#### <a name=\"transitive-dependencies\"></a>Fixing transitive dependencies\r\n\r\nIf your transitive dependency review found references to the [vulnerable package](#affected-software), you must add a direct dependency to the updated package to your *csproj* file to override the transitive dependency.\r\n\r\nOpen *projectname.csproj* in your editor. If you're using Visual Studio, right-click the project and choose **Edit projectname.csproj** from the context menu, where projectname is the name of your project.\r\nLook for `PackageReference` nodes, for example:\r\n\r\n```xml\r\n<Project Sdk=\"Microsoft.NET.Sdk.\">\r\n  <PropertyGroup>\r\n    <TargetFramework>net461</TargetFramework>\r\n  </PropertyGroup>\r\n  <ItemGroup>\r\n    <PackageReference Include=\"ThirdParty.NotUpdatedYet\" Version=\"2.0.0\" />\r\n  </ItemGroup>\r\n</Project>\r\n```\r\n\r\nYou must add a direct dependency to the updated version of the [vulnerable package](#affected-software) by adding it to the *csproj* file.\r\nYou do this by adding a new line to the dependencies section, referencing the fixed version.\r\nFor example, if your search showed a transitive reference to a vulnerable `System.ServiceModel.Http` version, you'd add a reference to the [fixed package number](#affected-software).\r\n\r\n```xml\r\n<Project Sdk=\"Microsoft.NET.Sdk.Web\">\r\n  <PropertyGroup>\r\n    <TargetFramework>net461</TargetFramework>\r\n  </PropertyGroup>\r\n  <ItemGroup>\r\n    <PackageReference Include=\"System.Private.Uri\" Version=\"4.3.0\" />\r\n    <PackageReference Include=\"ThirdParty.NotUpdatedYet\" Version=\"2.0.0\" />\r\n  </ItemGroup>\r\n</Project>\r\n```\r\n\r\nAfter you've added the direct dependency reference, save your *csproj* file.\r\n\r\nIf you're using Visual Studio, save your updated *csproj* file and Visual Studio will restore the new package versions.\r\nYou can see the restore results by opening the **Output** window (Ctrl+Alt+O) and changing the **Show output from** drop-down list to **Package Manager**.\r\n\r\nIf you're not using Visual Studio, open a command line and change to your project directory. Execute the `dotnet restore` command to restore the new dependencies.\r\n\r\n##### Rebuilding your application\r\n\r\nFinally, you must rebuild your application, test, and redeploy.\r\n\r\n## Other Information\r\n\r\n### Reporting Security Issues\r\n\r\nIf you have found a potential security issue in .NET Core, please email details to secure@microsoft.com.

If you are not using Microsoft.NetCore.App, you may still be affected if you are referencing the packages listed above.\r\n\r\n##### Direct dependencies\r\n\r\nDirect dependencies are discoverable by examining your `csproj` file. They can be fixed by [editing the project file](#fixing-direct-dependencies) or using NuGet to update the dependency.\r\n\r\n##### Transitive dependencies\r\n\r\nTransitive dependencies occur when you add a package to your project that in turn relies on another package. For example, if Contoso publishes a package `Contoso.Utility` which, in turn, depends on `Contoso.Internals` and you add the `Contoso.Utility` package to your project now your project has a direct dependency on `Contoso.Utility` and, because `Contoso.Utility` depends 'Contoso.Internals', your application gains a transitive dependency on the `Contoso.Internals` package.\r\n\r\nTransitive dependencies are reviewable in two ways:\r\n\r\n* In the Visual Studio Solution Explorer window, which supports searching.\r\n* By examining the `project.assets.json` file contained in the obj directory of your project for `csproj` based projects\r\n\r\nThe `project.assets.json` files are the authoritative list of all packages used by your project, containing both direct and transitive dependencies.\r\n\r\nThere are two ways to view transitive dependencies. You can either [use Visual Studio’s Solution Explorer](#vs-solution-explorer), or you can review [the `project.assets.json` file](#project-assets-json)).\r\n\r\n##### <a name=\"vs-solution-explorer\"></a>Using Visual Studio Solution Explorer\r\n\r\nTo use Solution Explorer, open the project in Visual Studio, and then press Ctrl+; to activate the search in Solution Explorer. Search for the [vulnerable package](#affected-software) and make a note of the version numbers of any results you find.\r\n\r\nFor example, searching for `Microsoft.AspNetCore.Mvc.Core` in an example project that contains a package that takes a dependency on `Microsoft.AspNetCore.Mvc` shows the following results in Visual Studio 2017:\r\n\r\n![Screenshot of search results in Visual Studio 2017](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/796298/25858816/8ecdc2b4-3491-11e7-9363-746804bb9832.png)\r\n\r\nThe search results appear as a tree. In the previous results, you can see that a reference to `Microsoft.AspNetCore.Mvc.Core` version 1.1.2 is discovered.\r\n\r\nUnder the Dependencies node is a NuGet node. Under the NuGet node is the list of packages you have directly taken a dependency on and their versions.\r\nIn screenshot, the application takes a direct dependency on `Microsoft.AspNetCore.Mvc`. `Microsoft.AspNetCore.Mvc` in turn has leaf nodes that list its dependencies and their versions.\r\nThe `Microsoft.AspNetCore.Mvc` package takes a dependency on a version of `Microsoft.AspNetCore.Mvc.ApiExplorer`, that in turn takes a dependency on a version of `Microsoft.AspNetCore.Mvc.Core`.\r\n\r\n##### <a name=\"project-assets-json\"></a> Manually reviewing project.assets.json\r\n\r\nOpen the *project.assets.json* file from your project’s obj directory in your editor. We suggest you use an editor that understands JSON and allows you to collapse and expand nodes to review this file.\r\nVisual Studio and Visual Studio Code provide JSON friendly editing.\r\n\r\nSearch the *project.assets.json* file for the [vulnerable package](#affected-software), using the format `packagename/` for each of the package names from the preceding table. If you find the assembly name in your search:\r\n\r\n* Examine the line on which they are found, the version number is after the `/`.\r\n* Compare to the [vulnerable versions table](#affected-software).\r\n\r\nFor example, a search result that shows `SSystem.Net.Http/4.3.0` is a reference to version 4.3.0 of `System.Net.Http`.\r\n\r\nIf your *project.assets.json* file includes references to the [vulnerable package](#affected-software), then you need to fix the transitive dependencies.\r\n\r\nIf you have not found any reference to any vulnerable packages, this means either\r\n\r\n* None of your direct dependencies depend on any vulnerable packages, or\r\n* You have already fixed the problem by updating the direct dependencies.\r\n\r\n### <a name=\"how-fix\"></a>How do I fix the issue?\r\n\r\n#### Updating the version of Microsoft.NETCore.App\r\n\r\nIf your host version is a 2.1.x host you must install version 2.1.7 or later of the [.NET Core 2.1 runtime](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/download/dotnet-core/2.1), or corresponding [.NET Core 2.1 SDK](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/download/dotnet-core/2.1).\r\n\r\nIf your host version is a 2.2.x you must install version 2.2.1 or later of the [.NET Core 2.2 runtime](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/download/dotnet-core/2.2), or corresponding  [.NET Core 2.2 SDK](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/download/dotnet-core/2.2).\r\n\r\n#### <a name=\"fixing-direct-dependencies\"></a>Fixing direct dependencies\r\n\r\nOpen *projectname.csproj* in your editor. If you're using Visual Studio, right-click the project and choose **Edit projectname.csproj** from the context menu, where projectname is the name of your project. Look for `PackageReference` elements. The following shows an example project file:\r\n\r\n```xml\r\n<Project Sdk=\"Microsoft.NET.Sdk.Web\">\r\n  <PropertyGroup>\r\n    <TargetFramework>netcoreapp2.1</TargetFramework>\r\n  </PropertyGroup>\r\n  <ItemGroup>\r\n    <PackageReference Include=\"System.Net.Http\" Version=\"4.3.0\" />\r\n  </ItemGroup>\r\n</Project>\r\n```\r\n\r\nThe preceding example has a reference to the [vulnerable package](#affected-software), as seen by the single `PackageReference` element. The name of the package is in the `Include` attribute.\r\nThe package version number is in the `Version` attribute. The previous example shows a single direct dependency on `System.Net.Http` version 4.3.0\r\n\r\nTo update the version to the secure package, change the version number to the updated package version as listed on the table [previously](#affected-software).\r\nIn this example, update `System.IO.Pipelines` to the appropriate [fixed package number](#affected-software) for your major version. Save the *csproj* file. The example *csproj* now looks as follows:\r\n\r\n```xml\r\n<Project Sdk=\"Microsoft.NET.Sdk.Web\">\r\n  <PropertyGroup>\r\n    <TargetFramework>netcoreapp2.1</TargetFramework>\r\n  </PropertyGroup>\r\n  <ItemGroup>\r\n    <PackageReference Include=\"System.Net.Http\" Version=\"4.3.5\" />\r\n  </ItemGroup>\r\n</Project>\r\n```\r\n\r\nIf you're using Visual Studio and you save your updated *csproj* file, Visual Studio will restore the new package version.\r\nYou can see the restore results by opening the **Output** window (Ctrl+Alt+O) and changing the **Show output from** drop-down list to **Package Manager**.\r\n\r\nIf you're not using Visual Studio, open a command line and change to your project directory. Execute the `dotnet restore` command to restore the updated dependencies.\r\n\r\nNow recompile your application. If after recompilation you see a *Dependency conflict warning*, you must update your other direct dependencies to versions that take a dependency on the updated package.\r\n\r\n#### <a name=\"transitive-dependencies\"></a>Fixing transitive dependencies\r\n\r\nIf your transitive dependency review found references to the [vulnerable package](#affected-software), you must add a direct dependency to the updated package to your *csproj* file to override the transitive dependency.\r\n\r\nOpen *projectname.csproj* in your editor. If you're using Visual Studio, right-click the project and choose **Edit projectname.csproj** from the context menu, where projectname is the name of your project.\r\nLook for `PackageReference` nodes, for example:\r\n\r\n```xml\r\n<Project Sdk=\"Microsoft.NET.Sdk.\">\r\n  <PropertyGroup>\r\n    <TargetFramework>net461</TargetFramework>\r\n  </PropertyGroup>\r\n  <ItemGroup>\r\n    <PackageReference Include=\"ThirdParty.NotUpdatedYet\" Version=\"2.0.0\" />\r\n  </ItemGroup>\r\n</Project>\r\n```\r\n\r\nYou must add a direct dependency to the updated version of the [vulnerable package](#affected-software) by adding it to the *csproj* file.\r\nYou do this by adding a new line to the dependencies section, referencing the fixed version.\r\nFor example, if your search showed a transitive reference to a vulnerable `System.ServiceModel.Http` version, you'd add a reference to the [fixed package number](#affected-software).\r\n\r\n```xml\r\n<Project Sdk=\"Microsoft.NET.Sdk.Web\">\r\n  <PropertyGroup>\r\n    <TargetFramework>net461</TargetFramework>\r\n  </PropertyGroup>\r\n  <ItemGroup>\r\n    <PackageReference Include=\"System.Net.Http\" Version=\"4.3.5\" />\r\n    <PackageReference Include=\"ThirdParty.NotUpdatedYet\" Version=\"2.0.0\" />\r\n  </ItemGroup>\r\n</Project>\r\n```\r\n\r\nAfter you've added the direct dependency reference, save your *csproj* file.\r\n\r\nIf you're using Visual Studio, save your updated *csproj* file and Visual Studio will restore the new package versions.\r\nYou can see the restore results by opening the **Output** window (Ctrl+Alt+O) and changing the **Show output from** drop-down list to **Package Manager**.\r\n\r\nIf you're not using Visual Studio, open a command line and change to your project directory. Execute the `dotnet restore` command to restore the new dependencies.\r\n\r\n##### Rebuilding your application\r\n\r\nFinally, you must rebuild your application, test, and redeploy.\r\n\r\n## Other Information\r\n\r\n### Reporting Security Issues\r\n\r\nIf you have found a potential security issue in .NET Core, please email details to secure@microsoft.com.

However, .NET hasn't had a (great) built-in way to deal with JSON. Instead we've relied on [Json.NET] which continues to serve the .NET ecosystem well.\r\n\r\n[Json.NET]: https://www.newtonsoft.com/json\r\n\r\nMoving forward, we plan on making some changes to our JSON support:\r\n\r\n* **We need high-performance JSON APIs**. We need a new set of JSON APIs that are highly tuned for performance by using `Span<T>` and allows for processing UTF-8 directly without having to transcode to UTF-16 `string` instances. Both aspects are critical for our web server Kestrel, where throughput is a key requirement.\r\n\r\n* **Remove dependency from ASP.NET Core to Json.NET**. Today, ASP.NET Core has a dependency on Json.NET. While this provides a tight integration between ASP.NET Core and Json.NET, it also means that application developers cannot freely choose which JSON library they are using. This is also problematic for customers of Json.NET as the version is dictated by the underlying platform. However, Json.NET is frequently updated and application developers often want to -- or even have to -- use a specific version. Thus, we want to remove the dependency from ASP.NET Core 3.0 to Json.NET so that customers can choose which version to use, without fearing they might accidentally break the underlying platform. In addition, this makes it also possible to plug-in an entirely different JSON library.\r\n\r\n* **Provide an ASP.NET Core integration package for Json.NET**. Json.NET has basically become the Swiss Army knife of JSON processing in .NET. It provides many options and facilities that allow customers to handle their JSON needs with ease. We don't want to compromise on the Json.NET support customers are getting today, for example, the ability to configure the JSON serialization via the `AddJsonOptions` extension method. Thus, we want to provide the Json.NET integration as a NuGet package that developers can optionally install so they get all the bells and whistles they get from Json.NET today. The other part of this work item is to ensure we have the right extension points so that other parties can provide similar integration packages for their JSON library of choice.\r\n\r\nBelow are more details around this plan.\r\n\r\n## The need for high-performance JSON APIs\r\n\r\nThe requirements for the .NET stack have changed a bit since the arrival of .NET Core. Historically, .NET has valued usability and convenience. With .NET Core, we've added a focus on performance, and we've made significant investments to serve high performance needs. And the [improvements we made][techempower] in the popular TechEmpower benchmark are a testament to that.\r\n\r\n[techempower]: https://www.techempower.com/blog/2016/11/16/framework-benchmarks-round-13/\r\n\r\nWith .NET Core 2.1, we've added a brand new primitive called [Span\\<T>][span-msdn] that allows us to represent native memory and arrays in a uniform way. With this type, we've also added a set of parsing and encoding APIs that are much more memory efficient without having to resort to unsafe code.\r\n\r\n[span-msdn]: https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/magazine/mt814808.aspx\r\n\r\nPart of the work of minimizing allocations is to avoid having to transcode UTF-8 payloads into UTF-16 strings, purely for parsing reasons. Currently, Json.NET is implemented by reading UTF-16. We need the ability to read (and write) JSON documents directly in UTF-8 because most network protocols (including HTTP) use UTF-8.\r\n\r\nDuring .NET Core 2.1 we've learned that updating our existing APIs to leverage `Span<T>` has limits. While we did add a bunch of overloads that accept spans, we also had to produce brand new APIs that are designed around minimizing allocations and dealing with buffers, which we exposed in `System.Buffers` namespaces. And with `System.IO.Pipelines` we've also added a programming model that enables developers to share buffers without having to deal with lifetime issues.\r\n\r\nBased on these experiences we believe in order to support JSON parsing, we'll need to expose a new set of JSON APIs that are specifically geared for high-performance scenarios.\r\n\r\nYou might wonder why we can't just update Json.NET to include support for parsing JSON using `Span<T>`? Well, James Newton-King -- the author of Json.NET -- has the following to say about that:\r\n\r\n> Json.NET was created over 10 years ago, and since then it has added a wide range of features aimed to help developers work with JSON in .NET. In that time Json.NET has also become far and away NuGet's most depended on and downloaded package, and is the go-to library for JSON support in .NET. Unfortunately, Json.NET's wealth of features and popularity works against making major changes to it. Supporting new technologies like `Span<T>` would require fundamental breaking changes to the library and would disrupt existing applications and libraries that depend on it.\r\n>\r\n> Going forward Json.NET will continue to be worked on and invested in, both addressing known issues today and supporting new platforms in the future. Json.NET has always existed alongside other JSON libraries for .NET, and there will be nothing to prevent you using one or more together, depending on whether you need the performance of the new JSON APIs or the large feature set of Json.NET.\r\n\r\n## Move Json.NET integration into a separate NuGet package\r\n\r\nToday, you cannot use ASP.NET Core without Json.NET because it is a dependency of ASP.NET Core itself. Over the years, we've received feedback that the dependency can conflict with other libraries that have their own dependency on a different version of Json.NET. In the past, we've considered addressing this issue by using a private copy of Json.NET in ASP.NET. However, this would create problems when developers want to configure Json.NET (for instance, in order to control how the serializer behaves when formatting JSON objects).\r\n\r\nMoving forward we'd like to:\r\n\r\n1. Replace the internal usage of Json.NET in ASP.NET Core by the new platform-provided JSON APIs.\r\n\r\n2. Factor the public facing usage of Json.NET into an optional integration package that can be acquired from NuGet.\r\n\r\nSo the existing integration between ASP.NET Core and Json.NET will continue to be supported, but will be moving out of the platform and into a separate package. However, since the integration is then designed to sit on top of the platform, it will also allow customers to update Json.NET to later versions.\r\n\r\nFurthermore, customers who need more performance can also choose to use the new JSON APIs, at the expense of the rich feature set that Json.NET offers.\r\n\r\n## Discussion\r\n\r\nFor a discussion, please go to https://github.com/dotnet/corefx/issues/33115.","Url":"https://github.com/dotnet/announcements/issues/90","RelatedDescription":"Open issue \"The future of JSON in .NET Core 3.0\" (#90)"},{"Id":"368440353","IsPullRequest":false,"CreatedAt":"2018-10-09T23:44:06","Actor":"vivmishra","Number":"89","RawContent":null,"Title":"October 2018 .NET Updates","State":"open","Body":"# October 2018 .NET Updates\r\n\r\nThe following .NET updates were released in October 2018.

LTS releases are stable release which receive critical updates and are supported for at least three years. Current releases can include new features that may undergo future change based on feedback. Current releases are supported for three months after the subsequent .NET Core major or minor release. Both LTS and Current releases receive critical fixes throughout their lifecycle, for security, reliability, or to add support for new operating system versions.

The 3 month maintenance period for .NET Core 2.0 was scheduled to end August 2018 but was [extended to October](https://blogs.msdn.microsoft.com/dotnet/2018/06/20/net-core-2-0-will-reach-end-of-life-on-september-1-2018/) to allow time to address an issue some customers were experiencing while migrating to .NET Core 2.1.\r\n\r\n## .NET Core 2.0 Downloads\r\n\r\n.NET Core 2.0 installers, zips and tar.gzs will remain available, but unsupported.
