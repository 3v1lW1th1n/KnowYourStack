On the other hand it is not possible to hook into a plugins destroy/replacement.\r\nIn production mode there is no need for such hook, because it's not possible to remove a plugin (this might be reconsidered after https://github.com/vuejs/vuex/issues/467#issuecomment-266493888).\r\n\r\nBut given the [plugin example](https://vuex.vuejs.org/guide/plugins.html#committing-mutations-inside-plugins) which registers event handlers on the `socket` and taking [hot reloading](https://vuex.vuejs.org/guide/hot-reload.html) into account, the handlers are registered multiple times.\r\nThere is no way to unregister an event handler before the plugin gets replaced.\r\n\r\nI'm not sure if this is a general problem with a HMR system (like webpack's) or if its caused by the [`store.hotUpdate()`](https://vuex.vuejs.org/api/#hotupdate) function.
