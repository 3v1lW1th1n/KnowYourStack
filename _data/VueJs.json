For instance, when using promises to create microtasks, exceptions thrown by the callback are reported as rejected promises rather than being reported as standard exceptions. Also, creating and destroying promises takes additional overhead both in terms of time and memory that a function which properly enqueues microtasks avoids.\r\n\r\nI think there is no need to create a unit test, current tests will cover this small change well. I also mocked UI experiment for test `queueMicrotask()` on real terminal, no bizarre behaviors found so far (as it is the standard way).","Url":"https://github.com/vuejs/vue/pull/10865","RelatedDescription":"Open PR \"feat: use queueMicrotask for nextTick timerFunc\" (#10865)"},{"Id":"528079369","IsPullRequest":false,"CreatedAt":"2019-11-25T16:48:15","Actor":"wangziling","Number":"10864","RawContent":null,"Title":"The click event cannot be triggered by bubbling in browsers which based on FF.","State":"closed","Body":"### Version\r\n2.6.10\r\n\r\n### Reproduction link\r\n[https://codesandbox.io/s/please-test-3rgyj](https://codesandbox.io/s/please-test-3rgyj)\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n### Steps to reproduce\r\nUsing the firefox or other browser which based on firefox.\r\nAnd its browser core version is bigger than 53.\r\n\r\nI used the `Basilisk browser` - https://www.basilisk-browser.org/download.shtml\r\n\r\nThe newest version.\r\n\r\nAnd then, please visit: https://codesandbox.io/s/please-test-3rgyj\r\n\r\nClick \"click me.
