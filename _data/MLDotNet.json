This is a draft change to enable that functionality in order to get better logging to debug tests better.\r\n\r\nThere are two changes here. \r\nThe first is a simple adds a handler for MLContext's Log event and logs the message to test output. The second adds a TextWriter derived class to ConsoleEnvironment that makes ConsoleEnvironment also log to the test console if the code is running a test environment.\r\n\r\nI am putting this PR up for review for two purposes. \r\n\r\nThe first is for general verification of the code and concept.
