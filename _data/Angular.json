I found some things I wanted to update to be more accurate if anyone else ever would have the same question as I had.\r\n\r\nAs I don't think the above findings are things that necessarily need to end up in the docs, I thought I would be better of creating an issue first to discuss this further before creating a PR to update the docs.\r\n\r\n## A few remarks on snippets from the docs\r\nhttps://angular.io/api/core/Injectable\r\n\r\n> Injector throws an error if it tries to instantiate a class that is not decorated with @Injectable, as shown in the following example.\r\n\r\nI think this isn't entirely correct, it's only the case when that service has dependencies which are being injected in its constructor. \r\n\r\nhttps://angular.io/guide/dependency-injection#services-that-need-other-services\r\n\r\n> Notice that the Logger service also has the @Injectable() decorator, even though it might not need its own dependencies. In fact, the @Injectable() decorator is required for all services.\r\n\r\n> When Angular creates a class whose constructor has parameters, it looks for type and injection metadata about those parameters so that it can inject the correct service. If Angular can't find that parameter information, it throws an error. Angular can only find the parameter information if the class has a decorator of some kind. The @Injectable() decorator is the standard decorator for service classes.\r\n\r\nBoth snippets above might be a bit contradicting, the first one mentions it's required for all services. While the second snippet is mentioning the fact that the class' constructor needs to have parameters.\r\n\r\n## What I'd propose to change:\r\n\r\nhttps://angular.io/api/core/Injectable:\r\n\r\n> Injector throws an error if it tries to instantiate a class that is not decorated with @Injectable and is making use of Dependency Injection (add link to https://angular.io/guide/dependency-injection or https://angular.io/guide/dependency-injection#services-that-need-other-services here), as shown in the following example.\r\n\r\nMaybe we can also include an example that shows it doesn't throw in case we omit Injectable and have no Dependency Injection.\r\n\r\nhttps://angular.io/guide/dependency-injection#services-that-need-other-services\r\n\r\n> Notice that the Logger service also has the @Injectable() decorator, even though it might not need its own dependencies. Even though it's not required to add Injectable when you're not making use of Dependency Injection, we do encourage adding it as this will make it easier to add dependencies later on.\r\n\r\n> When Angular creates a class whose constructor has parameters, it looks for type and injection metadata about those parameters so that it can inject the correct service. If Angular can't find that parameter information, it throws an error. Angular can only find the parameter information if the class has a decorator of some kind. The @Injectable() decorator is the standard decorator for service classes.\r\n\r\nEven tho this still isn't 100% correct (as Injectable isn't required, any decorator should do), I think this could be an improvement.\r\n\r\nI'm also not aware if Ivy would change anything with regards to this, if this is the case these changes might be obsolete.","Url":"https://github.com/angular/angular/issues/30524","RelatedDescription":"Open issue \"Contradicting and incorrect Injectable docs\" (#30524)"},{"Id":"445134704","IsPullRequest":false,"CreatedAt":"2019-05-16T20:01:31","Actor":"chris13524","Number":"30523","RawContent":null,"Title":"Image inside <noscript> tag triggers request","State":"open","Body":"# 🐞 bug report\r\n\r\n### Description\r\n\r\nWhen you have an `<img>` inside a `<noscript>`, the `<img>` still triggers a request.\r\n\r\nMy need for proper behavior of `<noscript>` is for lazy loading of images. In the event that JavaScript isn't available, you [put the image in a `<noscript>`](https://developers.google.com/web/fundamentals/performance/lazy-loading-guidance/images-and-video/#javascript_availability) (which works in Angular using server-side rendering).

It appears to have attempted to remove the core-js imports although failed half way through leaving half a line of code:\r\n\r\n```typescript\r\n/***************************************************************************************************\r\n* BROWSER POLYFILLS\r\n*/\r\nk-map';\r\nimport 'core-js/es6/set';\r\n\r\n/** IE10 and IE11 requires the following for NgClass support on SVG elements */\r\n// import 'classlist.js';  // Run `npm install --save classlist.js`.\r\n```\r\n\r\nAll imports after the broken line are not removed. This obviously causes the build to fail.\r\n\r\n## 🔬 Minimal Reproduction\r\nClone this repo: https://github.com/UXAspects/UXAspects-Seed\r\nPerform the update: `ng update @angular/cli @angular/core --next --force`\r\nCLI will report success, however the broken code now remains\r\n\r\n## 🔥 Exception or Error\r\nNo exceptions during update, reports successful update\r\n\r\n## 🌍 Your Environment\r\n<pre><code>\r\nAngular CLI: 8.0.0-rc.4\r\nNode: 10.15.1\r\nOS: win32 x64\r\nAngular: 8.0.0-rc.4\r\n... animations, cli, common, compiler, compiler-cli, core, forms\r\n... language-service, platform-browser, platform-browser-dynamic\r\n... router, upgrade\r\n\r\nPackage                           Version\r\n-----------------------------------------------------------\r\n@angular-devkit/architect         0.800.0-rc.4\r\n@angular-devkit/build-angular     0.800.0-rc.4\r\n@angular-devkit/build-optimizer   0.800.0-rc.4\r\n@angular-devkit/build-webpack     0.800.0-rc.4\r\n@angular-devkit/core              8.0.0-rc.4\r\n@angular-devkit/schematics        8.0.0-rc.4\r\n@angular/cdk                      7.3.1\r\n@angular/http                     7.2.3\r\n@ngtools/webpack                  8.0.0-rc.4\r\n@schematics/angular               8.0.0-rc.4\r\n@schematics/update                0.800.0-rc.4\r\nrxjs                              6.5.2\r\ntypescript                        3.4.5\r\nwebpack                           4.30.0\r\n</code></pre>\r\n\r\n**Anything else relevant?**\r\nNo\r\n","Url":"https://github.com/angular/angular-cli/issues/14443","RelatedDescription":"Open issue \"ng update fails to remove polyfills leaving broken code behind (8rc 4)\" (#14443)"},{"Id":"444854365","IsPullRequest":false,"CreatedAt":"2019-05-16T09:39:44","Actor":"JonWallsten","Number":"14442","RawContent":null,"Title":"allowSyntheticDefaultImports/esModuleInterop enabled causes issues with build optimizer in webpack","State":"open","Body":"# 🐞 Bug report\r\n\r\n### Command (mark with an `x`)\r\n<!-- Can you pin-point the command or commands that are effected by this bug? -->\r\n<!-- ✍️edit: -->\r\n```\r\n- [x] build\r\n```\r\n\r\n### Is this a regression?\r\n\r\n<!-- Did this behavior use to work in the previous version? -->\r\n<!-- ✍️-->No\r\n\r\n\r\n### Description\r\n\r\n<!-- ✍️--> A clear and concise description of the problem...\r\nI'm building Angular with the latest webpack and for production builds we use `@angular-devkit/build-optimizer/webpack-loader`.
