[PlattCalibrator](https://github.com/dotnet/machinelearning/blob/c922529e669d1c4dcb4d2bf8157a579b10a60cee/src/Microsoft.ML.Data/Prediction/Calibrator.cs#L1569)\r\n\r\nwhen loading a model that uses any of these classes, their Create method is expected to be called, but, as stated, the method is not being called.\r\n\r\nI also noticed this behavior in 3 other classes of the [Calibrator.cs](https://github.com/dotnet/machinelearning/blob/master/src/Microsoft.ML.Data/Prediction/Calibrator.cs#L1569) file (namely, the `ParameterMixingCalibratedModelParameters`, `ValueMapperCalibratedModelParameters`, and `FeatureWeightsCalibratedModelParameters` classes), but I've fixed this problem for those specific classes in my recent PR #4306 (which, as of the moment of writing this, is still waiting to get approved). It was while working on that PR that I noticed this problem on these classes, and I commented about it [there](https://github.com/dotnet/machinelearning/pull/4306#discussion_r336139379)... but it is appropriate to open this separate issue to better document this, since it is a problem that affects different classes across different files.\r\n\r\nIn fact, as I will describe below, there's a certain code pattern that is related to this problem, and I've seen this pattern in other classes of the Calibrator.cs file as well. So, the problem I describe here might be affecting even more classes than the ones I've mentioned.\r\n\r\n### Cause of the problem\r\nThe [CreateInstanceCore](https://github.com/dotnet/machinelearning/blob/7c067854b564275b0d6387ca59c0ec83e8fc91b9/src/Microsoft.ML.Core/ComponentModel/ComponentCatalog.cs#L186) method in the `ComponentCatalog.cs` file is responsible to try to call the `Create` method of any class when loading a model from disk.\r\n\r\nThe current implementation of the method actually checks first if the class has a constructor with parameters `(IHostEnvironment env, ModelLoadContext ctx)` and invokes that constructor through reflection. If the class doesn't have such a constructor, then it checks if it has a `Create((IHostEnvironment env, ModelLoadContext ctx)` method, and it gets invoked through reflection.\r\n\r\nThis behavior is not desired for the classes I've mentioned (and potentially other classes), since they define both a constructor and a Create method with those parameters, but in these cases it's actually expected that the Create method gets called instead of the constructor. Thus, if a class follows the pattern of having a private or internal constructor (with the `(env, ctx)` parameters) and also has a Create method, then this problem might also be affecting that class.\r\n\r\nSince the Create method typically only runs some security checks before calling the constructor, it turns out that the overall process of loading models doesn't seem affected by this issue. But the problem remains that these security checks are being missed along with whatever behavior the Create method adds to the process.\r\n\r\nAs explained by @yaeldekel in [her comment](https://github.com/dotnet/machinelearning/pull/4306#discussion_r337981820) on my recent PR #4306 (under \"Answer 1\"), this problem might had been introduced before the official release of ML.net, when the `ComponentCatalog` method was modified in a way that permitted the `CreateInstanceCore` method to use private and internal constructors, which didn't use to happen... so before those changes were made, classes could have private or internal constructors and a Create method, and the latter would appropriately be called. But now the constructor gets called, and this is the case of all the classes mentioned in this issue.\r\n\r\nSince these changes were made while trying to internalize as many APIs as possible before the ML.net official release, many constructors where also made private or internal, and thus the changes in ComponentCatalog that permit using those constructors are also necessary.\r\n\r\nBecause of these, further investigation is needed to know for sure which classes are being affected by this problem, so to better find a way to fix this problem without affecting all of the other classes that doesn't present this situation.","Url":"https://github.com/dotnet/machinelearning/issues/4385","RelatedDescription":"Open issue \"Create methods not being called when loading models from disk\" (#4385)"},{"Id":"512245563","IsPullRequest":false,"CreatedAt":"2019-10-25T00:42:04","Actor":"volitantns","Number":"4383","RawContent":null,"Title":"CreatePredictionEngine does not work after retrain the modal without column Transforms","State":"open","Body":"### System information\r\n\r\n- Win7\r\n- DotNet Core 2.1\r\n\r\n### Issue\r\n\r\n- after first training ,   \r\ntransf = mlc.Transforms.Text.FeaturizeText(\"Features\", \"TextData\")\r\n   .Append(mlc.BinaryClassification.Trainers.LbfgsLogisticRegression()).Fit(data);  \r\nI saved the LinearBinaryModelParameters , and retrain the modal as :  \r\ntransf = mlc.BinaryClassification.Trainers.LbfgsLogisticRegression().Fit(newdata, lbmparameters);  \r\nand call  \r\npe = mlc.Model.CreatePredictionEngine<ViewItem, ViewPred>(transf);\r\n\r\n- for the first time of the training , PredictionEngine works . after retrain , PredictionEngine do not works and throws  \r\nSystem.ArgumentOutOfRangeException: Features column 'Feature' not found\r\n\r\n- I expect the CreatePredictionEngine can pass the mlc.Transforms.Text.FeaturizeText(\"Features\", \"TextData\")  so the TextData can be generated as Features  \r\nOr mlc.Transforms.Text.FeaturizeText(\"Features\", \"TextData\")\r\n   .Append(mlc.BinaryClassification.Trainers.LbfgsLogisticRegression()).Fit   \r\nThe Fit function can pass LinearBinaryModelParameters \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n### Source code / logs\r\n\r\n`\r\nusing System;\r\nusing System.Linq;\r\nusing System.IO;\r\nusing Microsoft.ML;\r\nusing System.Collections.Generic;\r\n\r\nusing Microsoft.ML.Data;\r\nusing Microsoft.ML.Trainers;\r\n\r\nclass Program\r\n{\r\n\tstatic bool STUDY_CONTINUE_MODE = true;\r\n\r\n\tconst int MEM_SIZE = 9;\r\n\r\n\tstatic Random rand = new Random();\r\n\r\n\tstatic int total_study = 0;\r\n\r\n\tstatic List<ViewItem> happymem = new List<ViewItem>();\r\n\tstatic List<ViewItem> dangermem = new List<ViewItem>();\r\n\tstatic int GetTotalMemCount()\r\n\t{\r\n\t\treturn happymem.Count + dangermem.Count;\r\n\t}\r\n\r\n\tstatic string feeling = new string('0', MEM_SIZE);\r\n\r\n\tstatic MLContext mlc = new MLContext();\r\n\r\n\tstatic long totalticks = 0;\r\n\r\n\tstatic long totalright = 0;\r\n\tstatic long totalwrong = 0;\r\n\r\n\tstatic void Main()\r\n\t{\r\n\r\n\t\twhile (true)\r\n\t\t{\r\n\t\t\tRunTick();\r\n\t\t\ttotalticks++;\r\n\t\t\tif (totalticks % 10000 == 0 && transf != null && totalright + totalwrong > 2)\r\n\t\t\t{\r\n\t\t\t\tConsole.Title = totalticks + \" -

Notice that these Create methods are supposed to load from disk, in each case, a BinaryModelParameters object of the appropriate type.

Specifically she mentioned that in the past Calibrators where a field of predictors, and predictors were responsible of loading them at deserialization time. This is no longer the case, and her guess is that the code that I've pointed to is no longer valid.\r\n\r\nEven more, she believes that the `return new SBCMP` statements I've mentioned are actually unreachable now, since they all appear in branches that only execute when there is _no calibrator_ to load inside the BinaryModelParameters (e.g. [this](https://github.com/dotnet/machinelearning/blob/d531ea801a34a3018b8fa2a2f352902eb703cd25/src/Microsoft.ML.FastTree/RandomForestClassification.cs#L110) 'if statement'). Since predictors are no longer in charge of loading calibrators, then those paths are unreachable, and then the Create methods I've mentioned, always return the predictor of the appropriate type anyway, without getting into creating `SBCMP` objects.\r\n\r\nIn the case of the `LinearBinaryModelParameters` Create method, a ParameterMixingCalibratedModelParameters<,> object could [also be returned](https://github.com/dotnet/machinelearning/blob/d531ea801a34a3018b8fa2a2f352902eb703cd25/src/Microsoft.ML.StandardTrainers/Standard/LinearModelParameters.cs#L484), but this also seems invalid and unreachable for the same reasons already described for SBCMP.\r\n\r\nPerhaps further investigation is needed to clarify all of this, and **if those pieces of code are truly unreachable and no longer valid, then it might be better to remove them**.","Url":"https://github.com/dotnet/machinelearning/issues/4381","RelatedDescription":"Open issue \"Incorrect code in BinaryModelParameters classes\" (#4381)"},{"Id":"512214160","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2019-10-24T22:36:41","Actor":"ashbhandare","Number":"4380","RawContent":null,"Title":"Image Classification Sample cleanup","State":"open","Body":"Make samples more readable and add comments.\r\n\r\n","Url":"https://github.com/dotnet/machinelearning/pull/4380","RelatedDescription":"Open PR \"Image Classification Sample cleanup\" (#4380)"},{"Id":"512204677","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2019-10-24T22:07:07","Actor":"harishsk","Number":"4379","RawContent":null,"Title":"Add Onnx export support for string processing transformers","State":"open","Body":"This checkin includes support for WordTokenizingTransformer and NGramExtractingTransformer and also fixes for ValueToKeyMappingTransformer.\r\n\r\nThe fixes are dependent on upgrades to the Onnx runtime and Google Protobuf packages.
