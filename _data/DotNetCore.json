Our planning has reached a point where we have a schedule for the coreclr, corefx and core-setupmoves into dotnet/runtime that we want to share out with the community.\r\n\r\n### November 13th\r\nWe’ll move all changes from the original repositories into dotnet/runtime up to 5PM PST on November 13th. We’ll try to help as many pull requests as possible get merged by then. At that point, if there’s any pull requests still open we’ll have to close them. If you’d still like to continue those pull requests, we’d encourage you to bring them to dotnet/runtime in a new pull request.\r\n\r\nThe repositories themselves will be effectively archived at this point. The state of the “master” branch will be recorded with a tag, named “master-archive”, but the branch itself will be deleted. The default branch for the repositories will be named “archive” and it will be a single commit with a README.md and CONTRIBUTING.md file pointing to our dotnet/runtime repository.\r\n\r\nThe repositories will remain active for servicing changes to .NET Core 3.1 and earlier hence we will not be using the GitHub archive capability. \r\n\r\n### November 22nd\r\nThe dotnet/runtime repository will be made public and available for community contribution. Even though the repository will be created on November 13th it will take several days to get it back into a working order: fixing up our build scripts, recreating our Azure Dev Ops build definitions, etc … Until those tasks are completed it will not be possible to accept pull request and hence the repository will remain private. Once we are in a state that pull requests can be merged again the repository will be made public.\r\n\r\nOur expectation is that will occur on November 22nd. If it is ready sooner it will be made public sooner. If the work takes longer than we planned then we will add an update to this announcement with a new expected date.\r\n\r\n### December 1st-2nd\r\nAll issues, open and closed, will be migrated from corefx, coreclr and core-setup into dotnet/runtime. This will be using GitHub’s existing issue transfer feature in a bulk migration. This means all of the existing issue links will continue to function via redirects.\r\n\r\nThis does mean though that labels will not transfer with the issues. Labels will be re-applied as a post processing step by our engineering team once the issue migration completes.\r\n\r\nEven though our issues won’t be fully migrated until this time we’d like the community to begin filing issues on dotnet/runtime as soon as it’s public rather than continuing to file issues on the original repositories.\r\n\r\n### Migrating Commits\r\nThe dotnet/runtime repository will be a new commit history from the original repositories. We are using this consolidation as an opportunity to clean up our history with the goal of having a cleaner, smaller history as a starting point. This means commits will be rewritten in the following ways as they are migrated to dotnet/runtime:\r\n\r\n1. Author information, contributor information, changed file list and time stamps from the original commit will be preserved.\r\n1. Links to issues, pull requests or commits in the repository using GitHub short links will be rewritten so they continue to point the original repository. \r\n1. Every commit will be appended with a link to the original commit it was mapped from.\r\n\r\nThe actual contents of the commit though will be updated to match the new directory layout of the dotnet/runtime repository."},{"Id":"10738283611","Type":"IssuesEvent","CreatedAt":"2019-10-29T14:32:57","Actor":"mthalman","Repository":"dotnet/announcements","Organization":"dotnet","RawContent":null,"RelatedAction":"opened","RelatedUrl":"https://github.com/dotnet/announcements/issues/132","RelatedDescription":"Opened issue \"Release of Alpine 3.10 Docker images\" (#132) at dotnet/announcements","RelatedBody":"# .NET Core Alpine Docker images updated to Alpine 3.10\r\n\r\nDocker images for .NET Core have been released that support Alpine 3.10.

information","State":"open","Body":"Currently, the native layout information for every non-auto-layout type is generated at type-load time, even if managed code never uses the native type. This design has lead to a few limitations in our field marshaling validation, as well as forced field marshalling initialization code to run during method-table building, causing some odd initialization ordering designs because of what data is available at what time.\r\n\r\nThis PR changes native layout information to only ever be initialized when user code or runtime code requests the native layout of a type and the type is non-blittable. To enable this, the function `IsFieldBlittable` does a fast, metadata-based blittability check that doesn't need to run all of the marshaler classification logic. When the runtime requests native layout information from a MethodTable that is blittable, it falls back to the managed information.

It's infuriating noob and been passed on by for how many years now ?.\r\n\r\nI got around this with a wrapper that just spit out characters from the value itself by simply doing the decimal to char conversion myself. Using a ugly fat noob wrapper around StringGarbageBuilder. \r\nThat typically outperforms it even though i massively bloated it. \r\nBecause numbers kind of need to be converted to characters in most apps, its kinda Not unheard of for that to happen in just about every single app ever made, a lot.\r\n\r\nSo.... is it possible.... since you guys are doing this new thing. That while you are at it,,,, \r\nYou can investigate how that conversion takes place internally. \r\nIf it is really, truly, absolutely, necessary to have to generate collectable garbage from all value.ToStrings() calls.\r\nevery single time !\r\non every single number to string!\r\nwith no way to stop it from happening or a way to get around it that makes sense ! \r\n\r\nI believe this is the No1 cause of garbage collections in any application by far for anyone who is not actively trying to prevent it or aware of it. Most people aren't even aware that this is a huge source of collections.\r\n\r\nIt most certainly should not be such a pain in the --- to get around it. c# has been around a long time now. Considering how much converting a number to a string should be considered to occur why has this never been addressed ?. \r\n\r\nYes i understand the problem of how do you return a string from a number without creating new string but there should be a way to feed a existing string or stringbuilder to ToString() or something so you don't have to create garbage that must be collected.\r\n\r\nSo file this under improved GC  one that doesn't have to follow behind a pig picking up after it.\r\n\r\nThank you.","Url":"https://github.com/dotnet/corefx/issues/42310","RelatedDescription":"Open issue \"Request toString()\" (#42310)"},{"Id":"516458671","IsPullRequest":false,"CreatedAt":"2019-11-02T03:44:28","Actor":"Random832","Number":"42309","RawContent":null,"Title":"Equals returns true for ReflectPropertyDescriptors with different target types.","State":"open","Body":"PropertyDescriptor.Equals only checks the Name and PropertyType, and ReflectPropertyDescriptor does not override.

This isn't clear in the documentation. \r\n* The `CancellationTokenSource` must be tracked in some way so it can be properly disposed. Otherwise a memory leak can occur. \r\n\r\nFor one-offs this is not a big deal. But as we increasingly use `CancellationToken`, it can become an significant expense in terms of memory and system resources.\r\n\r\nAn alternative would be to allow the `CancellationToken` itself to have an optional DateTime field that can be checked. While it would make the `CancellationToken` slightly more expensive in terms of memory, it would eliminate the need for an expensive timer. \r\n\r\n> What I think would make more sense would be to make CancellationToken struct itself smarter about timeouts. When you create a CancellationTokenSource with a timeout, it should calculate the timestamp of the expiration, and bake that into the token.

We can use TaskCompletionSource<T> for this. However there is no built in mechanism for consumers to await the result for a given amount of time or some other condition (which can be linked easily to CancellationToken).\r\n\r\nAnother example is a singleton implementation where an application needs to have only one instance of a given type at any one time. The factory for this instance is asynchronous (for example establishing I/O connection). Consumers of this can await the factory to establish the connection (which may take longer than anticipated or even be impossible at the moment), but they need to be able to specify how much time they are willing to do that. Real world example in Azure AMQP library: https://github.com/Azure/azure-amqp/blob/c161ce1c5abd182a4751295f0bc2757481404c8a/src/Fx/Singleton.cs#L113. Here the implementation is incorrect and is not honoring the timeout passed in when awaiting the factory task.\r\n\r\nHere is an old popular question from stackoverflow: https://stackoverflow.com/questions/4238345/asynchronously-wait-for-taskt-to-complete-with-timeout.\r\n\r\nExample of how the usage of this would look like:\r\n``` csharp\r\nawait _tcs.Task.ConfigureAwait(timeout: TimeSpan.FromSeconds(5));\r\n\r\n// Or another example if I'm using it inside ASP.NET Core Request\r\nawait _tcs.Task.ConfigureAwait(cancellationToken: HttpContext.RequestAborted);\r\n```\r\n\r\nHere is an example of how this can be implemented without having access to the internals of the Tasks - https://gist.github.com/zlatanov/8ed79f1897e5b737307532b10062ec39. I am hoping that there might be a better implementation and support if done here internally.\r\n\r\n","Url":"https://github.com/dotnet/corefx/issues/42292","RelatedDescription":"Open issue \"API proposal: Add new ConfigureAwait methods with additional TimeSpan as timeout or CancellationToken parameter. \" (#42292)"},{"Id":"515862987","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2019-11-01T13:58:21","Actor":"Marusyk","Number":"42282","RawContent":null,"Title":"Consolidate .netcoreapp.cs test files in System.Text.Encoding","State":"closed","Body":"Contributes #41821\r\n\r\nPlease review\r\nThank you in advance","Url":"https://github.com/dotnet/corefx/pull/42282","RelatedDescription":"Closed or merged PR \"Consolidate .netcoreapp.cs test files in System.Text.Encoding\" (#42282)"},{"Id":"516071280","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2019-11-01T13:15:25","Actor":"dotnet-maestro[bot]","Number":"42290","RawContent":null,"Title":"[master] Update dependencies from dotnet/arcade","State":"closed","Body":"This pull request updates the following dependencies\r\n\r\n[marker]: <> (Begin:c297d885-0692-40f8-6b97-08d61f281b4c)\r\n## From https://github.com/dotnet/arcade\r\n- **Build**: 20191031.14\r\n- **Date Produced**: 10/31/2019 10:18 PM\r\n- **Commit**: db50c8d7378a7a81033a1b8fcfa5461694a891c3\r\n- **Branch**: refs/heads/master\r\n- **Updates**:\r\n  - **Microsoft.DotNet.XUnitExtensions** -> 5.0.0-beta.19531.14\r\n  - **Microsoft.DotNet.XUnitConsoleRunner** -> 2.5.1-beta.19531.14\r\n  - **Microsoft.DotNet.VersionTools.Tasks** -> 5.0.0-beta.19531.14\r\n  - **Microsoft.DotNet.ApiCompat** -> 5.0.0-beta.19531.14\r\n  - **Microsoft.DotNet.Arcade.Sdk** -> 5.0.0-beta.19531.14\r\n  - **Microsoft.DotNet.Build.Tasks.Configuration** -> 5.0.0-beta.19531.14\r\n  - **Microsoft.DotNet.Build.Tasks.Feed** -> 5.0.0-beta.19531.14\r\n  - **Microsoft.DotNet.Build.Tasks.Packaging** -> 5.0.0-beta.19531.14\r\n  - **Microsoft.DotNet.CodeAnalysis** -> 5.0.0-beta.19531.14\r\n  - **Microsoft.DotNet.CoreFxTesting** -> 5.0.0-beta.19531.14\r\n  - **Microsoft.DotNet.GenAPI** -> 5.0.0-beta.19531.14\r\n  - **Microsoft.DotNet.Helix.Sdk** -> 5.0.0-beta.19531.14\r\n  - **Microsoft.DotNet.RemoteExecutor** -> 5.0.0-beta.19531.14\r\n  - **Microsoft.DotNet.GenFacades** -> 5.0.0-beta.19531.14\r\n\r\n[marker]: <> (End:c297d885-0692-40f8-6b97-08d61f281b4c)\r\n\r\n","Url":"https://github.com/dotnet/corefx/pull/42290","RelatedDescription":"Closed or merged PR \"[master] Update dependencies from dotnet/arcade\" (#42290)"},{"Id":"515930438","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2019-11-01T06:06:36","Actor":"judeleander","Number":"42288","RawContent":null,"Title":"Support for Ignore Default Values during JSON serialization in System.Text.Json","State":"open","Body":"","Url":"https://github.com/dotnet/corefx/pull/42288","RelatedDescription":"Open PR \"Support for Ignore Default Values during JSON serialization in System.Text.Json\" (#42288)"},{"Id":"515929328","IsPullRequest":false,"CreatedAt":"2019-11-01T06:02:32","Actor":"TimLovellSmith","Number":"42287","RawContent":null,"Title":"NegoState creates an ObjectDisposedException during Close() that might never be thrown?","State":"open","Body":"Noticed this because i found a small source of lock contention in .net Framework is that SslStream.Dispose() does this upfront exception construction during .net Framework's _SslState.Close() - and then tracked down that NegoState seems to be the equivalent in corefx, and AFAiCS follows the same pattern, though the exception might not actually ever get raised.

don't currently have a way to create a synchronization object with a given ACL in .NET Core. We can modify the ACL, but it would be more secure to have the proper ACL on the object from the start.\r\n\r\nThe related ACLs are already exposed in the `System.Threading.AccessControl` assembly , we should add creation extension methods to the existing `ThreadingAclExtensions`.\r\n\r\n### Customer impact\r\nBefore this change, customers had to create a `Mutex`, then set its ACLs. This presents a few problems:\r\n\r\n- Potential security hole as mutexes can be accessed between creation and modification.\r\n- Porting difficulties as there isn't a 1-1 API replacement\r\nThis change addresses those problems by adding a new extension method that allows creating a `Mutex` and ensuring the provided ACLs are set during creation.\r\n\r\nIf time permits it, we would try to backport this change to 3.1.","Url":"https://github.com/dotnet/corefx/pull/42281","RelatedDescription":"Open PR \"Add Mutex creation extension methods that take an ACL\" (#42281)"}],"ResultType":"GitHubIssue"},"Roslyn-Issues":{"Issues":[{"Id":"516463474","IsPullRequest":false,"CreatedAt":"2019-11-02T04:08:41","Actor":"cston","Number":"39650","RawContent":null,"Title":"Report a warning when calling a property or method that returns [MaybeNull]T","State":"open","Body":"Report a warning when calling a property or method that returns a value of a generic type annotated with `[MaybeNull]`.\r\n\r\nSee [C# LDM 2019-09-11](https://github.com/dotnet/csharplang/blob/master/meetings/2019/LDM-2019-09-11.md).\r\n\r\nSee https://github.com/dotnet/roslyn/pull/39589#issuecomment-548995903.","Url":"https://github.com/dotnet/roslyn/issues/39650","RelatedDescription":"Open issue \"Report a warning when calling a property or method that returns [MaybeNull]T\" (#39650)"},{"Id":"516442152","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2019-11-02T02:28:12","Actor":"dibarbet","Number":"39649","RawContent":null,"Title":"Add support for custom unnecessary locations on a diagnostic.","State":"open","Body":"","Url":"https://github.com/dotnet/roslyn/pull/39649","RelatedDescription":"Open PR \"Add support for custom unnecessary locations on a diagnostic.\" (#39649)"},{"Id":"516404321","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2019-11-01T23:50:01","Actor":"JoeRobich","Number":"39648","RawContent":null,"Title":"Add global.json for integration test","State":"open","Body":"Try forcing integration tests to run against a particular .NET Core SDK.","Url":"https://github.com/dotnet/roslyn/pull/39648","RelatedDescription":"Open PR \"Add global.json for integration test\" (#39648)"},{"Id":"516279782","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2019-11-01T23:06:11","Actor":"jasonmalinowski","Number":"39634","RawContent":null,"Title":"Fix crash where we are not always finding text snapshots","State":"closed","Body":"This is just a direct-to-master-vs-deps version of #39607.\r\n\r\nGiven this is not a reliable crash, my guess is the problem is we are sometimes processing an older Solution snapshot.

The first isn't showing `IDE0063` whereas the second does offer the fix, which breaks the code when applied.\r\n\r\n**Expected Behavior**:\r\nThe fix suggestion does not appear.\r\n\r\nOr in fact, even if there is code between the two `}` such that the finally blocks are apart, applying the fix would in fact have to put the finalizer for the simple using statement at the end of the block it is in, which is the finalizer position of the first `using` statement in the code below. So one could argue whether the code below in both forms should produce the exact same syntax tree end hence both compile without error.\r\n\r\nOn top of that, my understanding of the feature is that *any* block in which the simple `using` statement appears would become protected by the finalizer, even if there is just an `if` block or even just `{` ... `}` without any construct accompanying it. And indeed, if I remove the exact text `using (var d = new Disposable())` (but leave the brace-open) in the `IDE0063_After` code, the `goto` preceding the brace-open does not show `CS8648`.\r\n\r\nSo:\r\n\r\n**Really Expected Behavior**\r\nWhether I accept the fix or not, the code compiles and `CS8648` does not appear.\r\n\r\n**Actual Behavior**:\r\nThe fix suggestion, even before it is applied - in the preview, produces error `CS8648` \"A goto cannot jump to a location after a using declaration\".\r\n\r\n**Code**\r\n```CS\r\nstruct Disposable : IDisposable { public void Dispose() { } }\r\nclass IDE0063_Before\r\n{\r\n    static int Main(string[] args) {\r\n        var errorLevel = 0;\r\n        if (args.Length == 0) goto Fail;\r\n        using (var d = new Disposable()) {\r\n            if (int.TryParse(args[0], out errorLevel)) goto Fail;\r\n            /*IDE0063*/\r\n            using (var e = new Disposable()) {\r\n                foreach (var arg in args)\r\n                    if (int.TryParse(arg, out errorLevel)) goto Fail;\r\n            }\r\n        }\r\n        return errorLevel;\r\n    Fail:\r\n        errorLevel = default;\r\n        return errorLevel;\r\n    }\r\n}\r\nclass IDE0063_After\r\n{\r\n    static int NotMain(string[] args) {\r\n        var errorLevel = 0;\r\n        if (args.Length == 0) goto Fail;\r\n        using (var d = new Disposable()) {\r\n            if (int.TryParse(args[0], out errorLevel)) /*CS8648*/ goto Fail;\r\n            using var e = new Disposable();\r\n            foreach (var arg in args)\r\n                if (int.TryParse(arg, out errorLevel)) goto Fail;\r\n        }\r\n        return errorLevel;\r\n    Fail:\r\n        errorLevel = default;\r\n        return errorLevel;\r\n    }\r\n}\r\n```","Url":"https://github.com/dotnet/roslyn/issues/39637","RelatedDescription":"Open issue \"`IDE0063` fix introduces `CS8648` in presence of `goto` statements\" (#39637)"},{"Id":"516293669","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2019-11-01T19:02:18","Actor":"sharwell","Number":"39636","RawContent":null,"Title":"Fix stack overflow in inheritdoc evaluation","State":"open","Body":"Fixes #39158","Url":"https://github.com/dotnet/roslyn/pull/39636","RelatedDescription":"Open PR \"Fix stack overflow in inheritdoc evaluation\" (#39636)"},{"Id":"516292035","IsPullRequest":false,"CreatedAt":"2019-11-01T18:58:44","Actor":"CyrusNajmabadi","Number":"39635","RawContent":null,"Title":"OOP crash while editing in Roslyn.sln","State":"open","Body":"Got a yellow bar with \"unfortunatey a process has crashed\".

The packages were added; however, certain changes I made were not available - it was still the old code.\r\n\r\nWhen I examined the .csproj and project.assets.json, the version of the package was indeed a release version, i.e. \"4.0.0\" and not something like \"4.0.0-preview.5\". However, in project.assets.json, some of the dependencies were still prereleases, e.g. Azure.Core still referenced 1.0.0-preview.1.\r\n\r\nI took a look at my nuget cache ~\\.nuget\\packages and the \"4.0.0\" directory had today's date, but going deeper I found that the assemblies - the actually DLLs - had a date of 4 months ago. The .nuspec was also right, and had \"4.0.0\" with the right Azure.Core dependency (a released version, i.e. \"1.0.0\". The DLLs match those (both date and version) of our 4.0.0-preview.1 release back in June.\r\n\r\nIt seems that the package metadata was pulled from our private repo and even for extraction, but the binaries were actually from nuget.org - matching the lowest possible dependencies (as expected, were I actually wanting >= 4.0.0 *with* preview versions).\r\n\r\nAt the time, I didn't have a nuget.config that put our private feed first. Adding that fixed the issue, but the main concern here is that nuget / `dotnet add package` incorrectly extracted and used the wrong version of a package and was terribly misleading, calling the cache \"4.0.0\" when it should've been \"4.0.0-preview.1\". Besides, according to \"dotnet add package --help\",\r\n\r\n> -s, --source <SOURCE>               The NuGet package source to use during the restore.\r\n\r\nBut that doesn't seem to have been the case, given the metadata was correct but the binaries - everything within the package, it seems - was from nuget.org that only has prereleases right now.\r\n\r\n```\r\n$ dotnet --info\r\n.NET Core SDK (reflecting any global.json):\r\n Version:   3.1.100-preview1-014459\r\n Commit:    ac3b59712d\r\n\r\nRuntime Environment:\r\n OS Name:     Windows\r\n OS Version:  10.0.18363\r\n OS Platform: Windows\r\n RID:         win10-x64\r\n Base Path:   C:\\Program Files\\dotnet\\sdk\\3.1.100-preview1-014459\\\r\n\r\nHost (useful for support):\r\n  Version: 3.1.0-preview1.19506.1\r\n  Commit:  bbf5542781\r\n\r\n.NET Core SDKs installed:\r\n  1.1.14 [C:\\Program Files\\dotnet\\sdk]\r\n  2.1.801 [C:\\Program Files\\dotnet\\sdk]\r\n  2.2.401 [C:\\Program Files\\dotnet\\sdk]\r\n  3.0.100-preview8-013437 [C:\\Program Files\\dotnet\\sdk]\r\n  3.0.100 [C:\\Program Files\\dotnet\\sdk]\r\n  3.1.100-preview1-014459 [C:\\Program Files\\dotnet\\sdk]\r\n\r\n.NET Core runtimes installed:\r\n  Microsoft.AspNetCore.All 2.1.12 [C:\\Program Files\\dotnet\\shared\\Microsoft.AspNetCore.All]\r\n  Microsoft.AspNetCore.All 2.2.6 [C:\\Program Files\\dotnet\\shared\\Microsoft.AspNetCore.All]\r\n  Microsoft.AspNetCore.App 2.1.12 [C:\\Program Files\\dotnet\\shared\\Microsoft.AspNetCore.App]\r\n  Microsoft.AspNetCore.App 2.2.6 [C:\\Program Files\\dotnet\\shared\\Microsoft.AspNetCore.App]\r\n  Microsoft.AspNetCore.App 3.0.0-preview8.19374.1 [C:\\Program Files\\dotnet\\shared\\Microsoft.AspNetCore.App]\r\n  Microsoft.AspNetCore.App 3.1.0-preview1.19508.20 [C:\\Program Files\\dotnet\\shared\\Microsoft.AspNetCore.App]\r\n  Microsoft.NETCore.App 1.0.16 [C:\\Program Files\\dotnet\\shared\\Microsoft.NETCore.App]\r\n  Microsoft.NETCore.App 1.1.13 [C:\\Program Files\\dotnet\\shared\\Microsoft.NETCore.App]\r\n  Microsoft.NETCore.App 2.1.12 [C:\\Program Files\\dotnet\\shared\\Microsoft.NETCore.App]\r\n  Microsoft.NETCore.App 2.2.6 [C:\\Program Files\\dotnet\\shared\\Microsoft.NETCore.App]\r\n  Microsoft.NETCore.App 3.0.0-preview8-28373-17 [C:\\Program Files\\dotnet\\shared\\Microsoft.NETCore.App]\r\n  Microsoft.NETCore.App 3.1.0-preview1.19506.1 [C:\\Program Files\\dotnet\\shared\\Microsoft.NETCore.App]\r\n  Microsoft.WindowsDesktop.App 3.0.0-preview8-28373-17 [C:\\Program Files\\dotnet\\shared\\Microsoft.WindowsDesktop.App]\r\n  Microsoft.WindowsDesktop.App 3.1.0-preview1.19506.1 [C:\\Program Files\\dotnet\\shared\\Microsoft.WindowsDesktop.App]\r\n\r\nTo install additional .NET Core runtimes or SDKs:\r\n  https://aka.ms/dotnet-download\r\n```","Url":"https://github.com/dotnet/sdk/issues/3839","RelatedDescription":"Open issue \"dotnet add package --source downloads wrong nupkg\" (#3839)"},{"Id":"515503102","IsPullRequest":false,"CreatedAt":"2019-10-31T15:01:30","Actor":"MichaelSimons","Number":"3838","RawContent":null,"Title":"dotnet global tools failing to uninstall or update on 2.1-sdk-alpine","State":"open","Body":"@RyanWhite25 commented on [Wed Oct 30 2019](https://github.com/dotnet/dotnet-docker/issues/1426)\n\n## Steps to reproduce the issue\r\n1.

I've also confirmed that the same error occurs for both 2.2 and 3.0 SDKs.\r\n\r\n@RyanWhite25 - Although this is unrelated to the issue you encountered, we recommend that you update your .NET image references to use the [MCR Docker registry](https://devblogs.microsoft.com/dotnet/net-core-container-images-now-published-to-microsoft-container-registry/).  In your case, `microsoft/dotnet:2.1-sdk-alpine` would be replaced with `mcr.microsoft.com/dotnet/core/sdk:2.1-alpine`. These new tags are all published on [Docker Hub](https://hub.docker.com/_/microsoft-dotnet-core).\n\n---\n\n@MichaelSimons commented on [Thu Oct 31 2019](https://github.com/dotnet/dotnet-docker/issues/1426#issuecomment-548415206)\n\nThis issue is also not specific to the `alpine` images, you can reproduce it with Debian for example (e.g. `mcr.microsoft.com/dotnet/core/sdk:3.0`).  Given the `Cross-device link` error, I am speculating this is related to Docker layering and the overlay mount that is created that unions all of the image layers together.  For example if you install and uninstall the tool within a single layer everything works fine.  Does the `dotnet tool` infrastructure rely on hard links?  Moving to the SDK team to investigate.\n\n","Url":"https://github.com/dotnet/sdk/issues/3838","RelatedDescription":"Open issue \"dotnet global tools failing to uninstall or update on 2.1-sdk-alpine\" (#3838)"},{"Id":"515375804","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2019-10-31T14:23:15","Actor":"dotnet-maestro[bot]","Number":"3837","RawContent":null,"Title":"[master] Update dependencies from dotnet/arcade","State":"closed","Body":"This pull request updates the following dependencies\r\n\r\n[marker]: <> (Begin:daa187e0-7e60-4c7a-c1ac-08d6354da8a8)\r\n## From https://github.com/dotnet/arcade\r\n- **Build**: 20191030.15\r\n- **Date Produced**: 10/31/2019 12:30 AM\r\n- **Commit**: 35c10b82920baacbb3945fd952a0e49c4caec708\r\n- **Branch**: refs/heads/master\r\n- **Updates**:\r\n  - **Microsoft.DotNet.Arcade.Sdk** -> 5.0.0-beta.19530.15\r\n  - **Microsoft.DotNet.SignTool** -> 5.0.0-beta.19530.15\r\n\r\n[marker]: <> (End:daa187e0-7e60-4c7a-c1ac-08d6354da8a8)\r\n\r\n","Url":"https://github.com/dotnet/sdk/pull/3837","RelatedDescription":"Closed or merged PR \"[master] Update dependencies from dotnet/arcade\" (#3837)"},{"Id":"515327523","IsPullRequest":false,"CreatedAt":"2019-10-31T10:39:19","Actor":"shaulbehr","Number":"3836","RawContent":null,"Title":"dotnet build appears to succeed, but returns error code","State":"open","Body":"Environment: Linux Ubuntu 18.04\r\nDotnet SDK 3.0.100\r\n\r\ncommand line: `dotnet build soln.sln -r linux-x64 -o outputdir`\r\n\r\nBuild logs show normal output (including lots of warnings, but no actual errors), then:\r\n```\r\n    Build FAILED.\r\n```\r\nfollowed by a bunch more build output, then at the end:\r\n```\r\n    387 Warning(s)\r\n    0 Error(s)\r\n\r\nTime Elapsed 00:03:52.15\r\nFailing task since return code of [/usr/bin/dotnet build soln.sln -r linux-x64] was 1 while expected 0\r\n```\r\nIf you would like access to our repo so you can repro, contact me privately (shaul at lightsailed dot com)\r\n\r\n","Url":"https://github.com/dotnet/sdk/issues/3836","RelatedDescription":"Open issue \"dotnet build appears to succeed, but returns error code\" (#3836)"},{"Id":"515026974","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2019-10-30T23:50:44","Actor":"dotnet-maestro[bot]","Number":"3834","RawContent":null,"Title":"[release/3.1.1xx] Update dependencies from dotnet/core-setup","State":"closed","Body":"This pull request updates the following dependencies\r\n\r\n[marker]: <> (Begin:e0b7e874-2dc6-462b-dd42-08d72a4caef5)\r\n## From https://github.com/dotnet/core-setup\r\n- **Build**: 20191030.5\r\n- **Date Produced**: 10/30/2019 9:20 PM\r\n- **Commit**: 4950751278293d59898be799c0115e0ad895747e\r\n- **Branch**: refs/heads/release/3.1\r\n- **Updates**:\r\n  - **Microsoft.NET.HostModel** -> 3.1.0-preview3.19530.5\r\n\r\n[marker]: <> (End:e0b7e874-2dc6-462b-dd42-08d72a4caef5)\r\n\r\n","Url":"https://github.com/dotnet/sdk/pull/3834","RelatedDescription":"Closed or merged PR \"[release/3.1.1xx] Update dependencies from dotnet/core-setup\" (#3834)"},{"Id":"515042011","IsPullRequest":false,"CreatedAt":"2019-10-30T23:15:02","Actor":"thomaslevesque","Number":"3835","RawContent":null,"Title":"dotnet new hangs for several seconds after it completes","State":"open","Body":"Whenever I use `dotnet new`, it seems to hang for several seconds after it completes.\r\nFor instance, if I do `dotnet new sln`, it prints _\"The template \"Solution file\" was created successfully.\"_ almost immediately, but doesn't return until several seconds later (sometimes up to 10 seconds).

Our planning has reached a point where we have a schedule for the coreclr, corefx and core-setupmoves into dotnet/runtime that we want to share out with the community.\r\n\r\n### November 13th\r\nWe’ll move all changes from the original repositories into dotnet/runtime up to 5PM PST on November 13th. We’ll try to help as many pull requests as possible get merged by then. At that point, if there’s any pull requests still open we’ll have to close them. If you’d still like to continue those pull requests, we’d encourage you to bring them to dotnet/runtime in a new pull request.\r\n\r\nThe repositories themselves will be effectively archived at this point. The state of the “master” branch will be recorded with a tag, named “master-archive”, but the branch itself will be deleted. The default branch for the repositories will be named “archive” and it will be a single commit with a README.md and CONTRIBUTING.md file pointing to our dotnet/runtime repository.\r\n\r\nThe repositories will remain active for servicing changes to .NET Core 3.1 and earlier hence we will not be using the GitHub archive capability. \r\n\r\n### November 22nd\r\nThe dotnet/runtime repository will be made public and available for community contribution. Even though the repository will be created on November 13th it will take several days to get it back into a working order: fixing up our build scripts, recreating our Azure Dev Ops build definitions, etc … Until those tasks are completed it will not be possible to accept pull request and hence the repository will remain private. Once we are in a state that pull requests can be merged again the repository will be made public.\r\n\r\nOur expectation is that will occur on November 22nd. If it is ready sooner it will be made public sooner. If the work takes longer than we planned then we will add an update to this announcement with a new expected date.\r\n\r\n### December 1st-2nd\r\nAll issues, open and closed, will be migrated from corefx, coreclr and core-setup into dotnet/runtime. This will be using GitHub’s existing issue transfer feature in a bulk migration. This means all of the existing issue links will continue to function via redirects.\r\n\r\nThis does mean though that labels will not transfer with the issues. Labels will be re-applied as a post processing step by our engineering team once the issue migration completes.\r\n\r\nEven though our issues won’t be fully migrated until this time we’d like the community to begin filing issues on dotnet/runtime as soon as it’s public rather than continuing to file issues on the original repositories.\r\n\r\n### Migrating Commits\r\nThe dotnet/runtime repository will be a new commit history from the original repositories. We are using this consolidation as an opportunity to clean up our history with the goal of having a cleaner, smaller history as a starting point. This means commits will be rewritten in the following ways as they are migrated to dotnet/runtime:\r\n\r\n1.

With [.NET Standard 2.0](https://devblogs.microsoft.com/dotnet/announcing-net-standard-2-0/), we tried to make it much more viable to share code between .NET Framework, .NET Core, and Xamarin which resulted in approximately 38K .NET Frameworks APIs being available in .NET Core 2.0. We also built the [Windows Compatibility Pack](https://devblogs.microsoft.com/dotnet/announcing-the-windows-compatibility-pack-for-net-core/) which made another 21K .NET Framework APIs available to .NET Core, resulting in almost 60K additional APIs. And in .NET Core 3.0 we added WPF and WinForms, which increased the number of .NET Framework APIs ported to .NET Core to over 120k, which is more than half of all .NET Framework APIs.\r\n\r\nIt’s also worth pointing out that we added about 62K APIs to .NET Core that don’t exist in .NET Framework. If we compare their total number of APIs, .NET Core has about 80% of the API surface of .NET Framework.\r\n\r\n<p align=\"center\">\r\n<img src=\"https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/5169960/66777114-f8db7c80-ee7c-11e9-9161-acfe1c491586.png\" width=\"600\" align=\"center\">\r\n</p>\r\n\r\nWe announced that the [future of .NET](https://devblogs.microsoft.com/dotnet/net-core-is-the-future-of-net/) will be based on .NET Core. And at Build 2019, [Scott Hunter stated](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZlO1utbB2GQ&t=54m20s) that AppDomains, remoting, Web Forms, WCF server, and Windows Workflow won’t be ported to .NET Core.\r\n\r\nWith .NET Core 3.0, we’re at the point where we’ve ported all technologies that are required for modern workloads, be that desktop apps, mobile apps, console apps, web sites, or cloud services. That’s not to say that we don’t have any gaps or opportunities for new technologies, but we generally believe we won’t be finding them in the .NET Framework code base anymore. Moving forward, we’re focusing our resources on incorporating new technologies.\r\n\r\nSimultaneously, we’re looking into releasing more of the [.NET Framework code base under the MIT license](https://github.com/microsoft/referencesource) on GitHub to allow the community to create OSS projects for technologies we’re not intending to bring to .NET Core. For example, there already are community projects for [CoreWF](https://github.com/UiPath/corewf) and [CoreWCF](https://github.com/CoreWCF/CoreWCF).\r\n\r\nWe’d like to thank everyone who filed issues with requests for APIs being ported. Those issues allowed us to prioritize and close the gaps that prevented people from porting to .NET Core.\r\n\r\nBut since we generally no longer plan to bring existing technologies from .NET Framework to .NET Core we’ll be closing all issues that are [labeled with port-to-core](https://github.com/dotnet/corefx/issues?utf8=%E2%9C%93&q=is%3Aissue+is%3Aopen+label%3Aport-to-core).\r\n\r\n### Discussion\r\n\r\nTo discuss this issue, please comment on the corresponding issue at https://github.com/dotnet/corefx/issues/41769.","Url":"https://github.com/dotnet/announcements/issues/130","RelatedDescription":"Open issue \".NET Core 3.0 concludes the .NET Framework API porting project\" (#130)"},{"Id":"505445666","IsPullRequest":false,"CreatedAt":"2019-10-10T18:45:56","Actor":"TaraOverfield","Number":"129","RawContent":null,"Title":"October 2019 .NET Updates","State":"open","Body":"The following .NET updates were released on October 2019.

While this is still work in progress, we'd like to give you an update on where we are.\r\n\r\nSo far, we've identified the following repos:\r\n\r\n* dotnet/**runtime**\r\n\t- Will contain [coreclr](https://github.com/dotnet/coreclr), [corefx](https://github.com/dotnet/corefx), [core-setup](https://github.com/dotnet/core-setup), [aspnet/Extensions](https://github.com/aspnet/Extensions), and some of [mono/mono](https://github.com/mono/mono)\r\n* [dotnet/**sdk**](https://github.com/dotnet/sdk)\r\n\t- Will contain [toolset](https://github.com/dotnet/toolset), [sdk](https://github.com/dotnet/sdk), [cli](https://github.com/dotnet/cli)\r\n* dotnet/**installer**\r\n\t- Renamed from [core-sdk](https://github.com/dotnet/core-sdk)\r\n* dotnet/**aspnetcore**\r\n\t- Moved from [aspnet/AspNetCore](https://github.com/aspnet/AspNetCore) and will also contain [aspnet/AspNetCore-Tooling](https://github.com/aspnet/AspNetCore-Tooling)\r\n* dotnet/**efcore**\r\n\t- Moved from [aspnet/EntityFrameworkCore](https://github.com/aspnet/EntityFrameworkCore)\r\n* [dotnet/**winforms**](https://github.com/dotnet/winforms)\r\n\t- Unchanged, but listed for clarity \r\n* [dotnet/**wpf**](https://github.com/dotnet/wpf)\r\n\t- Unchanged, but listed for clarity\r\n\r\n### Name changes\r\n\r\nYou might notice that we changed our mind on naming from our [earlier announcement][ann]. Based on your feedback, we decided to go with **dotnet/runtime** instead of **dotnet/platform** and **dotnet/sdk** instead of **dotnet/cli**.\r\n\r\nSeveral people pointed out that the previous names weren't relatable to how we talk about the product, for example on download pages. So, we decided to match the product distributions as the primary design point for the new names. We generally refer to the bits you need to run your app as *the runtime* and the bits you need to build apps as *the SDK*. This also matches the naming chosen by other platforms.\r\n\r\n### New repos can't be used for .NET Core 3.x or earlier\r\n\r\nThe consolidated repositories are going to be about .NET 5 and going forward. It will not be possible to build .NET Core 3.1 or earlier from these repositories. As such, only the master branch from each of the repositories will be brought forward. There will be no porting of the individual release branches in the source repositories.\r\n\r\n### Personal names and email addresses\r\n\r\nSince we're planning on rebasing the history in the merged repositories, we can map your name and email address to new values as well. We primarily do this to support our friends in the LGBTQ+ community who have changed their names to reflect their identities. However, anybody is welcome to use this to change their email and name.\r\n\r\nWhatever your reason might be: we value your contributions and we hope this small gesture makes your life a little bit better. So if you changed your name/email – or simply prefer us to use different values – please [submit a request](mailto:dotnet@microsoft.com&subject=.NET%20repo%20consolidation%3A%20request%20for%20name%20change&body=Hey%2C%20%0A%0AI%E2%80%99d%20like%20to%20change%20my%20email%2Fdisplay%20name%20in%20the%20consolidated%20repo%20from%20%0A%0A%20%20%20%20%20%20%20%20My%20Old%20Name%20%3Cold.me%40example.org%3E%20%0A%0Ato%20%0A%0A%20%20%20%20%20%20%20%20My%20New%20Name%20%3Cnew.me%40example.org%3E%20%0A%0AThanks%21%20%0A).\r\n\r\n### More is coming\r\n\r\nWe'll share more updates in the upcoming months.

However, this separation has led to a variety of complications for contributors and maintainers alike.  For example:\r\n- **Confusion about where issues should be opened.**  It’s not always clear in which repo an issue should be reported, complicated by the fact that some implementations actually span repositories (e.g. a type might be exposed through a reference assembly and have its tests in corefx but actually be implemented in System.Private.CoreLib in coreclr).\r\n- **Difficulty sharing source.**  System.Private.CoreLib is intricately connected to the rest of the runtime, and thus has lived with the runtime code.  That, however, means that although corefx has been intended as the place to share as much core library code as possible across any underlying runtime, we’ve needed to keep a significant body of code in System.Private.CoreLib, which then has meant it’s needed to be “mirrored” to each runtime repo (coreclr, corert, mono) that needs to consume it as source; similarly, corefx has similarly required access to much of that source, for example to use the same interop DllImports that are employed elsewhere in the runtimes.  The automatic mirror that shares this source needs to be maintained, and even when it has been, it’s often led to lag.  It’s also complicated developer processes, where to validate a change in one repo generally requires manually mirroring the code to other local repos in order to validate the change and ensure merging into one repo won’t break the others.\r\n- **PRs spanning multiple repos.**  Because the runtime, CoreLib, and the core libraries are all intricately linked, changing runtime behaviors, adding new APIs, or changing various build processes (e.g. improving static analysis) often requires multiple PRs carefully staged across time and multiple repos.  For example, to add a new method to a type like Dictionary<>, a developer must first make the source changes in her local coreclr repo and the test and reference assembly changes in her local corefx repo.  When satisfied with the fix, the developer must submit a PR to coreclr as well as a PR to corefx, the latter of which will fail.  Eventually the coreclr PR will be merged, and the changes will mirror to the other runtimes that also require the update.  Eventually those mirror PRs will be merged, and builds will be created containing the fix for each runtime.  At some point later those builds will be consumed into the corefx repo, after which point the original corefx PR can be re-validated and eventually merged.  That’s the best case; things get more complicated in situations where there are bidirectional dependencies.\r\n- **Building an installable runtime.** Self-hosting a custom built .NET requires intricate knowledge of how all the repos work and interact.  A developer can’t just clone a single repo, make a desired change, and easily produce an installer.\r\n- **Consistency.**  One goal we had for more fine-grained repos was to enable isolation and independence for teams working within each repo’s confines, but this has led to non-trivial duplication of effort on things like build systems and CI, and then the resulting lack of consistency as each system ends up diverging from the others.\r\n\r\nThe issues go beyond the runtime.  For example, the ASP.NET maintainers and community did a great job in the past year or so consolidating from ~55 repos down to ~5 repos, but that’s still more repos than is desirable, leading to similar issues as cited above for the runtime.  On top of that, these ASP.NET repositories are in the aspnet GitHub org, which adds an additional set of issues, for example:\r\n- **Complications moving issues between repos.**  If a developer opens an issue in aspnet/aspnetcore and it’s determined that the cause of the issue is actually in dotnet/corefx, there is no GitHub mechanism to enable easily moving that issue across the aspnet to dotnet organizational boundary.\r\n- **Permissions.** Each organization’s permissions end up needing to be managed and maintained separately.\r\n\r\nThe issues extend into tooling as well.  For example, we currently have multiple repositories that all logically make up the dotnet CLI, but actually creating a working installer spans multiple repos.\r\n\r\n### Plan\r\n\r\nTo address these issues, we’re planning to make some changes to our repository structure:\r\n- **dotnet/platform.**  We plan to combine dotnet/coreclr, dotnet/corefx, dotnet/corert, dotnet/core-setup, and the relevant portions of mono/mono into a new dotnet/platform repo.  Everything needed to build and produce the Microsoft.NETCore.App shared framework will be in this repo.  We will no longer suffer from the complications of source mirroring.  Features like changing runtime behavior or adding an API will no longer require a complicated dance across multiple repos.  Etc.\r\n- **dotnet/aspnetcore.**  We plan to move the existing aspnet/aspnetcore repository into the dotnet organization.  Along with that, we aim to combine a variety of the other aspnet repositories into aspnetcore, such as aspnet/blazor.  Whether repos like entityframeworkcore remain separate or combined remains an open question.  A goal is that, just as dotnet/platform will be responsible for the creation of Microsoft.NETCore.App, dotnet/aspnetcore will be responsible for the creation of Microsoft.AspNETCore.App.\r\n- **dotnet/cli.**  We plan to combine dotnet/toolset and dotnet/sdk into the dotnet/cli repo.\r\n\r\n### FAQ\r\n\r\n#### Why are we merging repos?\r\n\r\nWe believe we can significantly improve several aspects of .NET on GitHub by combining repos, benefiting both maintainers and contributors.  These improvements will manifest in a variety of ways, such as in better issue management, much easier models of contribution, and easier and faster ways to build and install the resulting bits.\r\n\r\n####  What will happen to the aspnet org?\r\n\r\nThe aspnet org as a separate entity is legacy and artificial.  In time we hope to absorb it into the dotnet org and sunset the aspnet org.\r\n\r\n#### Will the coreclr and corefx repos go away?\r\n\r\nWith the help of GitHub, we plan to migrate all issues from these repos to the new dotnet/platform repo, and then lock down creation of additional issues, such that the repos will no longer be used for issue management.  We will also inhibit the creation of PRs to the master branch, which will effectively become an archive for read-only review of history.  In this sense, these repos will be archived, and no active development will happen with them.  However, we plan to continue servicing previous .NET Core releases out of these repos, so the various release branches (e.g. release/2.1, release/3.0, etc.) will continue to see (limited) activity.\r\n\r\n#### Will the mono repo go away?\r\n\r\nNo. mono/mono contains the source for the full mono stack and will continue to live on happily.  We will simply be moving the managed source associated with System.Private.CoreLib and copying the relatively small amount of source that makes up the native mono runtime to dotnet/platform.  We may choose to then use some mirroring technology to keep the runtime copy in sync (this will, however, not suffer from the same mirroring issues we currently experience, as we would not be mirroring between two components required to build the same binaries), or we may choose to let them diverge and manually sync only those changes deemed relevant to both implementations.\r\n\r\n#### Will the corert repo go away?\r\n\r\nYes.  We plan to retire/archive the corert repo.  Some of the technology in the corert repo will be migrated to the master branch of dotnet/platform, where it will be productized as part of .NET.  Other portions of the corert repo will be migrated to feature branches of dotnet/platform, where the experimentation can continue.  In this way, we will use feature branches to continue experimenting with the corert technology, while making it easier to share portions with its shipping counterpart and also graduate functionality into master if/when it’s ready.\r\n\r\n#### Does this mean there will be a single repo for all of .NET?\r\n\r\nNo.  We will be reducing the number of repos that contribute to .NET, but currently we do not believe that going all the way down to one is the right answer.\r\n\r\n#### Doesn’t this mean that issue and PR tracking will now be overwhelming?\r\n\r\nIt is already the case that the vast majority of issues in a given repo are not relevant to any individual developer, and with several thousand open issues in each repo and on the order of a hundred open PRs in each, we already need systems (e.g. labels) to successfully manage issues and PRs.  As such, we don’t believe the merging will have a significant impact on this aspect of developer productivity.  If it turns out to have an unexpectedly large negative impact, we will work with the community to find ways to mitigate the problem.  However, there are already a multitude of successful open source projects on GitHub with at least an order of magnitude more issues.\r\n\r\n#### What will happen to existing issues?\r\n\r\nWith the help of GitHub functionality, we plan to migrate all issues from old repos (e.g. dotnet/coreclr, dotnet/corefx) to the new repos (e.g. dotnet/platform).  We may also use this as a forcing function to revisit stale issues and either close those that are no longer relevant or reinvigorate those that are demanding of more immediate attention.\r\n\r\n#### What about git history?\r\n\r\nIn general, we plan to keep history, such that history from each constituent repo will be a part of the new repo.  However, we have made some mistakes in the past (e.g. large binaries, multitudes of automated PRs for flowing bits and source between repos, etc.), and we plan to rewrite history to correct those mistakes wherever possible and impactful.  Some rough calculations suggest this could end up significantly reducing the size of the repos as well as the time it takes to clone, which should not only help developers approaching the project but also CI.  This will end up meaning that SHAs may be different in the new repo than they were in the old repo; as previously mentioned, however, any references to the old SHAs in the old repos will continue to work, as those repos will remain accessible.\r\n\r\n#### Will I still show up in the contributor list due to previous contributions?\r\n\r\nYes.  We plan to merge all such history.\r\n\r\n#### Will this break debugging with SourceLink?\r\n\r\nNo.  The existing repos will continue to be accessible, and commit SHAs there will remain unchanged.\r\n\r\n#### Might plans change?\r\n\r\nSure.  Part of the goal of posting this announcement is to hear from you, hear about additional benefits you're excited about, and hear about additional concerns we may not have considered.  We will include such ideas in our planning and course correct as necessary.\r\n\r\n## Discussion\r\n\r\nTo discuss these plans, please comment on the corresponding issue at https://github.com/dotnet/coreclr/issues/26175.\r\n","Url":"https://github.com/dotnet/announcements/issues/119","RelatedDescription":"Open issue \"Consolidating .NET GitHub repos\" (#119)"},{"Id":"470434872","IsPullRequest":false,"CreatedAt":"2019-07-19T16:54:02","Actor":"richlander","Number":"118","RawContent":null,"Title":".NET Core master branches have switched to \"5.0\"","State":"open","Body":"# .NET Core master branches have switched to \"5.0\"\r\n\r\nVarious .NET Core repos have switched their `master` branches to \"5.0\", and will use 3.x branches for 3.0 and 3.1 projects.

This could prove to be especially problematic for technologies that share type names (e.g. `UserControl` in WinForms and WPF) and both are referenced by the project.\r\n* Optional parameters and `async`/`await` are usability cliffs\r\n    - Many were confused by optional parameters and tried to pass them in, even though they didn't have to.\r\n    - **[Action]** Talk to the Roslyn IDE team to see if we can visualize them better in VS.\r\n    - **[Action]** Try to avoid heavy use of optional parameters for mainline APIs.\r\n    - Async is a very steep cliff. People have no idea what to do in their code to make async work. While IntelliSense shows the usage by prefixing it with await, people didn't notice that.\r\n    - **[Action]** Unclear; this is a broader issue.\r\n* Virtually nobody used F1 to get help for APIs\r\n    - *Surprise*. I expected more people to use <kbd>F1</kbd>.\r\n* Virtually everyone used F12 to explore the API (\"metadata view\")\r\n    - *Surprise*. I expected most people to explore the type via the\r\n      IntelliSense completion\r\n* Nobody used Object Browser to explorer the APIs\r\n    - *Surprise*. I expected at least some people to.\r\n\r\n## Discussion\r\n\r\nFor a discussion, please go to https://github.com/dotnet/corefx/issues/39304.","Url":"https://github.com/dotnet/announcements/issues/117","RelatedDescription":"Open issue \"System.Text.Json usability study results\" (#117)"},{"Id":"465034831","IsPullRequest":false,"CreatedAt":"2019-07-08T03:13:38","Actor":"leecow","Number":"116","RawContent":null,"Title":"Updates to releases.json (.NET Core release metadata)","State":"open","Body":"**The changes described in this issue will be live with the .NET Core July update on 7/9/2019.**\r\n\r\nThe releases.json files (e.g. [2.2 releases.json](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dotnet/core/master/release-notes/2.2/releases.json)) are comprehensive metadata files which capture details of each .NET Core release. These files, along with the top level [releases-index.json](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dotnet/core/master/release-notes/releases-index.json), are becoming increasingly important .NET Core release assets. These files, one for each major.minor channel, are relied upon by many to detect when updates for .NET Core are available, discover security update details and other uses.\r\n\r\nChanges are sometimes necessary, and the growing dependencies require that we treat compatibility of the schema with the utmost care. This announcement describes an addition to the releases.json schema.\r\n\r\n## SDK Versions and Visual Studio\r\n\r\nBecause of current .NET Core SDK product construction dependencies, there is a hard link between the Runtime, SDK, toolset (compilers, MSBuild, NuGet, and other components), and Visual Studio. Simplistically, this means that when anything updates, everything updates. The unfortunate result of this linking is that multiple versions of the SDK are released with each monthly update for each supported versions of Visual Studio. For example, the May Update for .NET Core 2.2 included the 2.2.5 runtime, 2.2.107 SDK for Visual Studio 2017 and 2.2.204 for Visual Studio 2019 and yet another pair of SDK versions for .NET Core 2.1. An example of this is the [2.2.5 Release Notes](https://github.com/dotnet/core/blob/master/release-notes/2.2/2.2.5/2.2.5.md). \r\n\r\nThis is a confusing situation and we are working to mitigate the need to release multiple SDKs with .NET Core 3.0. The need for multiple SDK versions will persist for 2.1 LTS.\r\n\r\n## Adding the SDKS array\r\n\r\nTo appropriately model multiple SDKs per release, we are adding an SDKs array to releases.json, which will contain SDK objects. The top-level SDK object will represent the highest versioned SDK for a given update. Using the previous 2.2.5 update example, SDK 2.2.204 is in the top SDK object as well as duplicated in the SDKS array. All other applicable 2.2* SDK objects are included in the SDKS array. The SDK objects within the array will carry specific Visual Studio compatibility and version inclusion information to provide appropriate context.\r\n\r\nHere is an example of the new array based on the upcoming July update.\r\nAgain, this will be additive and the previous SDK object will include the highest SDK version for the release.\r\n\r\n```json\r\n{\r\n    \"sdk\": {\r\n        \"version\": \"2.2.301\",\r\n        \"version-display\": \"2.2.301\",\r\n        \"runtime-version\": \"2.2.6\",\r\n        \"vs-version\": \"16.1.3\",\r\n        \"vs-support\": \"Visual Studio 2019 (v16.1)\",\r\n        \"csharp-version\": \"7.3\",\r\n        \"fsharp-version\": \"4.5\",\r\n        \"vb-version\": null,\r\n        \"files\": []\r\n    },\r\n    \"sdks\": [\r\n        {\r\n            \"version\": \"2.2.301\",\r\n            \"version-display\": \"2.2.301\",\r\n            \"runtime-version\": \"2.2.6\",\r\n            \"vs-version\": \"16.1.3\",\r\n            \"vs-support\": \"Visual Studio 2019 (v16.1)\",\r\n            \"csharp-version\": \"7.3\",\r\n            \"fsharp-version\": \"4.5\",\r\n            \"vb-version\": null,\r\n            \"files\": []\r\n        },\r\n        {\r\n          \"version\": \"2.2.205\",\r\n          \"version-display\": \"2.2.205\",\r\n          \"runtime-version\": \"2.2.6\",\r\n          \"vs-version\": \"16.0.5\",\r\n          \"vs-support\": \"Visual Studio 2019 (v16.0)\",\r\n          \"csharp-version\": \"7.3\",\r\n          \"fsharp-version\": \"4.5\",\r\n          \"vb-version\": null,\r\n          \"files\": []\r\n        }\r\n    ]\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\n## vs-version and the Runtime\r\n\r\nThe same version of the runtime is included in multiple versions of Visual Studio. To account for this, the vs-version field is being updated to a comma-delimited string. The string will represent all versions of Visual Studio which first include the particular .NET Core update. Again, an example from the upcoming July Update.\r\n\r\n```json\r\n\"runtime\": {\r\n        \"version\": \"2.2.6\",\r\n        \"version-display\": \"2.2.6\",\r\n        \"vs-version\": \"15.9.13, 16.1.3, 16.2.0\",\r\n```\r\n\r\nThe same `vs-versions` changes will be seen in the `aspnetcore-runtime` object.\r\n\r\n## Future Enhancements\r\n\r\nThere are other improvements to the schema which have been suggested by the community which we are evaluating. Generally, theses enhancements are additive and should not represent compatibility compromises for existing parsers and similar announcements will be published ahead of any changes.\r\n\r\n","Url":"https://github.com/dotnet/announcements/issues/116","RelatedDescription":"Open issue \"Updates to releases.json (.NET Core release metadata)\" (#116)"},{"Id":"444065225","IsPullRequest":false,"CreatedAt":"2019-05-14T18:38:23","Actor":"TaraOverfield","Number":"114","RawContent":null,"Title":"May 2019 .NET Updates","State":"open","Body":"# May 2019 .NET Updates\r\n\r\nThe following .NET updates were released in May 2019.

Either target .NET Core 2.1 or lower, or use a version of the .NET SDK that supports .NET Core 2.2.`\r\n\r\nIf you downloaded the .NET Core SDK 2.2 between April 2 and April 12, 2019, the main [.NET downloads page](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/download/) included only 2.2.2nn. Starting April 12th, a new button marked \"Compatible with Visual Studio 2017\" is provided to target 2.2.1nn.

This article explains why this happens and how you can fix your installation.\r\n\r\nWhen Visual Studio can't find an appropriate version of the .NET Core SDK, you'll receive an error message. This may appear in the Error pane as NETSDK1045:\r\n\r\n\"The current .NET SDK does not support targeting .NET Core 2...\"\r\n\r\nYou can check what .NET Core SDKs you have on your machine with the following command:\r\n\r\n```bash\r\ndotnet --list-sdks\r\n```\r\n\r\nUnless you have a global.json file, when you use `dotnet` from the command line, the latest .NET Core SDK is used.\r\n\r\n> [TIP!] \r\n> Open a command prompt and try to build with `dotnet build`. If the command line build works, but Visual Studio doesn't suggestions in this article may help.\r\n\r\nThe last two digits of the .NET Core SDK version numbers are in the format are a patch number, which is represented by `nn` in this article because we will continue to service them to include the latest runtimes. To find out more, vist the [Overview of how .NET Core is versioned page](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/core/versions/).\r\n\r\n## Fixes for Common Problems\r\n\r\n### Visual Studio 2017 can't target .NET Core 2.2\r\n\r\nIf you receive the error message in Visual Studio 2017:\r\n\r\n`The current .NET SDK does not support targeting .NET Core 2.2… Either target .NET Core 2.1 or lower, or use a version of the .NET SDK that supports .NET Core 2.2.`\r\n\r\nUse `dotnet --list-sdks` to ensure you have .NET Core SDK 2.2.1nn. As an example, 2.2.106 would be a valid entry.\r\n\r\nIf you downloaded the .NET Core SDK 2.2 after April 2, 2019, version 2.2.2nn (such as 2.2.203) is listed first and is the highest version available. However, Visual Studio 2017 requires 2.2.1nn (such as 2.2.106). .NET Core SDK 2.2.2nn works with Visual Studio 2019. Visual Studio 2017 and Visual Studio 2019 can be installed side by side, but this requires both .NET Core SDK 2.2.1nn and .NET Core SDK 2.2.2nn to develop .NET Core 2.2 applications.\r\n\r\nTo download .NET Core SDK 2.2.2nn, visit the [.NET downloads page](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/download/dotnet-core/2.2).\r\n\r\n### Visual Studio 2017 can't target .NET Core 2.1\r\n\r\nIf you receive this error message in Visual Studio 2017:\r\n\r\n`The current .NET SDK does not support targeting .NET Core 2.1. Either target .NET Core 2.0 or lower, or use a version of the .NET SDK that supports .NET Core 2.1.`\r\n\r\nUse `dotnet --list-sdks` to ensure you have .NET Core SDK 2.1.5nn. As an example, 2.1.505 would be a valid entry. \r\n\r\nThis problem occurs of you manually uninstall the 2.1.5nn version.\r\n\r\nThe Visual Studio 2019 installation will not remove this file and Visual Studio 2017 will continue to work side by side.\r\n\r\nTo reinstall .NET Core SDK 2.1.5nn, visit the [.NET downloads page](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/download/dotnet-core/2.1).\r\n\r\n### Visual Studio 2019 can't target .NET Core 3.0 Preview\r\n\r\nIf you receive this error message in Visual Studio 2019:\r\n\r\n`The current .NET SDK does not support targeting .NET Core 2.1. Either target .NET Core 2.0 or lower, or use a version of the .NET SDK that supports .NET Core 2.1.`\r\n\r\nUse `dotnet --list-sdks` to ensure you have .NET Core SDK 3.0.100-preview... As an example, SDK 3.0.100-preview3-010431 would be a valid entry.\r\n\r\nTo install .NET Core SDK 3.0.1nn preview, visit the [.NET downloads page](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/download/dotnet-core/3.0).\r\n\r\nIn Visual Studio, go to `Tools\\Options\\Projects and Solutions\\.NET Core` and check the box `Use Previews of the .NET Core SDK`.\r\n\r\n> [NOTE!]\r\n> This option will be moving to `Tools\\Options\\Environment` and renamed `Preview Features` in Visual Studio 2019 version 16.1 Preview 2.\r\n\r\nIf you are targeting .NET Core 3.0 preview, the [C# language version will be C# 8.0 Preview by default](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/visualstudio/releases/2019/release-notes#csharp-defaults) allowing you to use new C# features.\r\n\r\n## Understand the relationship between .NET Core SDKs and Visual Studio build tools\r\n\r\nVisual Studio has its own copies of tools like MSBuild, NuGet and the compilers. If you install the .NET Core workload, it also installs the .NET Core SDK which has versions of these tools and provides tasks and targets. These two versions are built from the same repositories, but target .NET Framework and .NET Core respectively. \r\n\r\nWhen you build a .NET Core project in Visual Studio, it uses Visual Studio's copy of MSBuild, but the tasks and targets are supplied from the selected version of the .NET Core SDK. \r\n\r\nWhen you upgrade the .NET Core SDK, you get new tasks and targets. These new tasks and targets may contain features that are not supported by older versions of MSBuild. Like all of the .NET Core SDK, MSBuild is backwards compatible. It is not forwards compatible.\r\n\r\nThis generally works well, but requires a guarantee that the tasks and targets work with the MSBuild version. To ensure this, each .NET Core SDK indicates an MSBuild version range that is used by Visual Studio to determine compatibility. Versions of the .NET Core SDK that have a higher MSBuild identifier than expected are ignored by Visual Studio. In the normal case, this simply means you use the tasks and targets that were installed with your version of Visual Studio.\r\n\r\nBecause of this, you may have many versions of the .NET Core SDK on your machine and Visual Studio still fail to find one it considers appropriate. This is compounded by a poor error message, which we cannot fully correct because it is from the old version of the .NET Core SDK on your machine. Confusion is also compounded by a complex non-linear release matrix that makes it difficult to predict the right .NET Core SDK to select. We are working to improve all this. \r\n\r\n## The Visual Studio / .NET Core SDK support matrix\r\n\r\nThe last two digits of the .NET Core SDK version number are a patch number, which are represented by a `nn` in this table. You can learn more about .NET Core SDK and .NET Core Runtime versioning at the [Overview of how .NET Core is versioned page](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/core/versions/).\r\n\r\nThe following table shows which Visual Studio versions and .NET Core SDKs are compatible and how they are acquired if you are working with Visual Studio. \r\n\r\n| .NET Core SDK | .NET Core Runtime | Compatible Visual Studio | MSBuild | Notes                                     |\r\n|---------------|-------------------|--------------------------|---------|-------------------------------------------|\r\n| 2.1.5nn       | 2.1               | 2017                     | 15      | Installed as part of VS 2017 version 15.9 |\r\n| 2.1.6nn       | 2.1               | 2019                     | 16      | Installed as part of VS 2019              |\r\n| 2.2.1nn       | 2.2               | 2017                     | 15      | Installed manually                        |\r\n| 2.2.2nn       | 2.2               | 2019                     | 16      | Installed as part of VS 2019              |\r\n| 3.0.1nn       | 3.0 (Preview)     | 2019                     | 16      | Installed manually                        |\r\n\r\nVisual Studio 2017 cannot work with .NET Core SDK 2.1.6nn or 2.2.2nn.\r\n\r\nTo find out more about removing older versions of the .NET Core Runtime and .NET Core SDK, visit the [How to remove the .NET Core Runtime and SDK page](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/core/versions/remove-runtime-sdk-versions?tabs=macos).\r\n\r\nTo download the .NET Core SDK, visit the [.NET downloads page](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/download/dotnet-core).","Url":"https://github.com/dotnet/announcements/issues/108","RelatedDescription":"Open issue \".NET Core SDK 2.2.2nn and 2.1.6nn do not work with Visual Studio 2017\" (#108)"},{"Id":"432081093","IsPullRequest":false,"CreatedAt":"2019-04-11T15:16:43","Actor":"KathleenDollard","Number":"107","RawContent":null,"Title":"Limit DotNetCliToolReference Tools to .NET Core 2.2 and Below","State":"open","Body":"# Limit DotNetCliToolReference Tools to .NET Core 2.2 and Below\r\n\r\n.NET Core 3 takes the next step in the .NET Core tool strategy with local tools.

Restricting tools to target only .NET Core 2.2 and below means existing scenarios to continue to work (as well as they previously did), regardless of the framework version targeted by the project or the current .NET Core SDK. \r\n\r\nThe new .NET Core tool strategy avoids this flaw in restore strategy and offers other benefits, like the ability to author one type of tool and install it in different ways depending on project and user needs.\r\n\r\nWe look forward to your feedback on .NET Core Local Tools, and on challenges you face moving away from DotNetCliToolReference tools. \r\n\r\n[dotnet/sdk #3057](https://github.com/dotnet/sdk/pull/3057)","Url":"https://github.com/dotnet/announcements/issues/107","RelatedDescription":"Open issue \"Limit DotNetCliToolReference Tools to .NET Core 2.2 and Below\" (#107)"},{"Id":"431012407","IsPullRequest":false,"CreatedAt":"2019-04-09T14:51:18","Actor":"MichaelSimons","Number":"106","RawContent":null,"Title":".NET Core SDK container images now contain the Visual Studio 2019 toolset","State":"open","Body":"# .NET Core SDK container images now contain the Visual Studio 2019 toolset\r\n\r\n.NET Core SDK container images now include Visual Studio 2019 tools.
