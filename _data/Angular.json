I first noticed this in one of the latest 8.x releases.  I haven't checked all of the previous versions, but I suspect that it was working in 7.x (or an earlier Edge browser version) when I was more actively developing this project.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Description\r\nWhen posting to a remote server from localhost, an error is thrown in **Edge browser** but no other browser does this (tested on Edge, Firefox, Chrome).\r\n\r\nThe error itself appears to be invalid because the error object is a `ProgressEvent`. This may be because XHR on Edge browser has a different progress event being raised that other browsers don't have and that unexpected event causes an error.\r\n\r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/12199027/71175035-2ffc4e80-226f-11ea-8e6a-fe771cf6e990.png)\r\n\r\nIf you have the server also running on localhost then it succeeds in all browsers  (Edge, Firefox, Chrome).\r\n\r\nNote: _this isn't server-side CORS_ because other browsers don't get the error when calling the same server.  Also, in the example below, pure HTML/JS does not generate the error.\r\n\r\n## üî¨ Minimal Reproduction\r\nThis repo contains a demo Angular project and a Node Express server to accept uploaded files (it does nothing with the uploaded files, just returns 200 and a fixed message).\r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/JamesHough/angular-edge-progressevent-error\r\n\r\nRun `npm install` inside the root folder **and also** inside the \"node\" folder which has the Express REST api for testing.\r\n\r\n`npm start` will start the local REST server and the Angular app. _However_ you must copy the REST service to a different server and host it in Node in order to cause the problem to occur.  When you move it to a remote server, you will need to edit `any-old.service.ts` and also edit `index.html` to set the right remote server to use for testing.\r\n\r\nNote: This sample includes both an Angular solution and a plain HTML/JS solution that will both upload to the same Node Express service.  The HTML/JS example uses XHR and works on all browsers (Edge, Firefox, Chrome)\r\n\r\n## üî• Exception or Error\r\n<pre><code>{\r\n  error: ProgressEvent,\r\n  headers: Object,\r\n  message: \"Http failure response for http://remote-server-name:3000/api/excel-reader-api/api/ReadColumnHeaders: 0 Unknown Error\",\r\n  name: \"HttpErrorResponse\",\r\n  ok: false,\r\n  status: 0,\r\n  statusText: \"Unknown Error\",\r\n  url: \"http://remote-server-name:3000/api/excel-reader-api/api/ReadColumnHeaders\"\r\n}</code></pre>\r\n\r\n\r\n## üåç  Your Environment\r\n**Angular Version:**\r\n<pre><code>Angular CLI: 8.3.20\r\nNode: 12.5.0\r\nOS: win32 x64\r\nAngular: 8.2.14\r\n... animations, common, compiler, compiler-cli, core, forms\r\n... language-service, platform-browser, platform-browser-dynamic\r\n... router\r\n\r\nPackage                           Version\r\n-----------------------------------------------------------\r\n@angular-devkit/architect         0.803.20\r\n@angular-devkit/build-angular     0.803.20\r\n@angular-devkit/build-optimizer   0.803.20\r\n@angular-devkit/core              8.3.20\r\n@angular-devkit/schematics        8.3.20\r\n@angular/cli                      8.3.20\r\n@ngtools/webpack                  8.3.20\r\n@schematics/angular               8.3.20\r\n@schematics/update                0.803.20\r\nrxjs                              6.4.0\r\ntypescript                        3.5.3\r\nwebpack                           4.39.2</code></pre>\r\n\r\n**Anything else relevant?**\r\nThis only happens on the Edge browser when running on localhost and connecting to a remote server.

I've already made many fixes, and came across this one:\r\n```\r\nERROR Error: Uncaught (in promise): TypeError: Cannot read property '1' of null\r\nTypeError: Cannot read property '1' of null\r\n    at providersResolver (core.js:27364)\r\n    at Object.definition.providersResolver (core.js:27662)\r\n    at resolveDirectives (core.js:14641)\r\n    at elementStartFirstCreatePass (core.js:23429)\r\n    at …µ…µelementStart (core.js:23467)\r\n    at Module.…µ…µelement (core.js:23547)\r\n    at TestComp2Component_Template (test-comp2.component.html:2)\r\n    at executeTemplate (core.js:13974)\r\n    at renderView (core.js:13774)\r\n    at renderComponent (core.js:15214)\r\n    at resolvePromise (zone-evergreen.js:793)\r\n    at resolvePromise (zone-evergreen.js:752)\r\n    at zone-evergreen.js:854\r\n    at ZoneDelegate.invokeTask (zone-evergreen.js:400)\r\n    at Object.onInvokeTask (core.js:41410)\r\n    at ZoneDelegate.invokeTask (zone-evergreen.js:399)\r\n    at Zone.runTask (zone-evergreen.js:168)\r\n    at drainMicroTaskQueue (zone-evergreen.js:570)\r\n```\r\n\r\nThe template code that is failing is:\r\n```\r\n        <div [froalaEditor]=\"frOptions\" formControlName=\"NWTTextEditor\" id=\"NWTTextEditor\"\r\n          [NwRecordingValueDirective]=\"{\r\n            actionType: 'setValue',\r\n            configuration: { dataItem: 'NWTTextEditor'},\r\n            actions: ['formChange']\r\n          }\">\r\n        </div>\r\n```\r\nInside of this function:\r\n```\r\nexport function providersResolver<T>(\r\n    def: DirectiveDef<T>, providers: Provider[], viewProviders: Provider[]): void {\r\n  const lView = getLView();\r\n  const tView: TView = lView[TVIEW];\r\n  if (tView.firstCreatePass) {\r\n    const isComponent = isComponentDef(def);\r\n\r\n    // The list of view providers is processed first, and the flags are updated\r\n    resolveProvider(viewProviders, tView.data, tView.blueprint, isComponent, true);\r\n\r\n    // Then, the list of providers is processed, and the flags are updated\r\n    resolveProvider(providers, tView.data, tView.blueprint, isComponent, false);\r\n  }\r\n}\r\n```\r\nThe `lView` that is returned is null. Since the error is not clear, I am not yet sure of the cause. Once I find it, I'll leave a comment here.\r\n\r\nI have `angular-froala-wysiwg` imported locally (fork of https://github.com/froala/angular-froala-wysiwyg) since they don't have a release that works in Angular 9 yet (they latest release is still using the remove Angular Renderer). Package.json contents:\r\n```\r\n...\r\n\"angular-froala-wysiwyg\": \"file:../angular-froala-wysiwyg/dist\",\r\n...\r\n```\r\n\r\nThe issue seems to be coming from ngcc. If I change Angular to use a tgz file instead of the dist directory, it works.\r\n\r\n## üî¨ Minimal Reproduction\r\n\r\nRepo:\r\nhttps://github.com/arobinson/angular-bug-34478\r\n\r\nSteps:\r\n\r\n1. First build and run the app:\r\n```\r\ngit clone git@github.com:arobinson/angular-bug-34478.git\r\ncd angular-bug-34478/test-app\r\nnpm i\r\nng s -o\r\n```\r\n2. Open the chrome developer tools console\r\n3. Click on `Go to comp 2`\r\n4. Notice the error (page loads blank)\r\n\r\n### Example of it working\r\n\r\nRun this to see it working from the `test-app` directory:\r\n```\r\ngit checkout WorkingWithNpmPack\r\nnpm run rebuild.froala\r\nng s -o\r\n```\r\n\r\nNow it works. The main difference in the two branches this change to `package.json`:\r\n```\r\n@@ -24,7 +26,7 @@\r\n     \"@angular/platform-browser\": \"~9.0.0-rc.5\",\r\n     \"@angular/platform-browser-dynamic\": \"~9.0.0-rc.5\",\r\n     \"@angular/router\": \"~9.0.0-rc.5\",\r\n-    \"angular-froala-wysiwyg\": \"file:../angular-froala-wysiwyg/dist\",\r\n+    \"angular-froala-wysiwyg\": \"file:../angular-froala-wysiwyg/dist/angular-froala-wysiwyg-3.0.6.tgz\",\r\n     \"froala-editor\": \"^3.0.6\",\r\n     \"rxjs\": \"~6.5.3\",\r\n     \"tslib\": \"^1.10.0\",\r\n```\r\n\r\n\r\n## üî• Exception or Error\r\n<pre><code>\r\nERROR Error: Uncaught (in promise): TypeError: Cannot read property '1' of null\r\nTypeError: Cannot read property '1' of null\r\n    at providersResolver (core.js:27364)\r\n    at Object.definition.providersResolver (core.js:27662)\r\n    at resolveDirectives (core.js:14641)\r\n    at elementStartFirstCreatePass (core.js:23429)\r\n    at …µ…µelementStart (core.js:23467)\r\n    at Module.…µ…µelement (core.js:23547)\r\n    at TestComp2Component_Template (test-comp2.component.html:2)\r\n    at executeTemplate (core.js:13974)\r\n    at renderView (core.js:13774)\r\n    at renderComponent (core.js:15214)\r\n    at resolvePromise (zone-evergreen.js:793)\r\n    at resolvePromise (zone-evergreen.js:752)\r\n    at zone-evergreen.js:854\r\n    at ZoneDelegate.invokeTask (zone-evergreen.js:400)\r\n    at Object.onInvokeTask (core.js:41410)\r\n    at ZoneDelegate.invokeTask (zone-evergreen.js:399)\r\n    at Zone.runTask (zone-evergreen.js:168)\r\n    at drainMicroTaskQueue (zone-evergreen.js:570)\r\n</code></pre>\r\n\r\n\r\n## üåç  Your Environment\r\n\r\n**Angular Version:**\r\n<pre><code>\r\nAngular CLI: 9.0.0-rc.5\r\nNode: 12.13.1\r\nOS: darwin x64\r\n\r\nAngular: 9.0.0-rc.6\r\n... animations, common, compiler, compiler-cli, core, forms\r\n... language-service, platform-browser, platform-browser-dynamic\r\n... router\r\nIvy Workspace: Yes\r\n\r\nPackage                            Version\r\n------------------------------------------------------------\r\n@angular-devkit/architect          0.900.0-rc.5\r\n@angular-devkit/build-angular      0.900.0-rc.5\r\n@angular-devkit/build-ng-packagr   0.900.0-rc.5\r\n@angular-devkit/build-optimizer    0.900.0-rc.5\r\n@angular-devkit/build-webpack      0.900.0-rc.5\r\n@angular-devkit/core               9.0.0-rc.5\r\n@angular-devkit/schematics         9.0.0-rc.5\r\n@angular/cdk                       9.0.0-rc.4\r\n@angular/cli                       9.0.0-rc.5\r\n@ngtools/webpack                   9.0.0-rc.5\r\n@schematics/angular                9.0.0-rc.5\r\n@schematics/update                 0.900.0-rc.5\r\nng-packagr                         9.0.0-rc.2\r\nrxjs                               6.5.3\r\ntypescript                         3.6.4\r\nwebpack                            4.41.2\r\n</code></pre>\r\n\r\n**Anything else relevant?**\r\n<!-- ‚úçÔ∏èIs this a browser specific issue?

An example is creating a dialog. I see that angular material has [schematics](https://material.angular.io/guide/schematics). It would be nice if there was something for a dialog:\r\n`ng generate @angular/material:dialog <component-name>`\r\n\r\nThis would generate a component like so:\r\n\r\n```\r\nimport { Component, Inject, OnInit } from '@angular/core';\r\nimport { MAT_DIALOG_DATA, MatDialogRef } from '@angular/material';\r\n\r\n@Component({\r\n  selector: 'app-aggregate-dialog',\r\n  templateUrl: './aggregate-dialog.component.html',\r\n  styleUrls: ['./aggregate-dialog.component.scss']\r\n})\r\nexport class AggregateDialogComponent implements OnInit {\r\n  private _dialogRef: MatDialogRef<AggregateDialogComponent>;\r\n  constructor(dialogRef: MatDialogRef<AggregateDialogComponent>, @Inject(MAT_DIALOG_DATA) data: any) {\r\n    this._dialogRef = dialogRef;\r\n  }\r\n\r\n  ngOnInit() {\r\n  }\r\n\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nThis would also mean the dialog component would be added to the `entryComponents` in the module.\r\n\r\n#### Use Case\r\n\r\nDescribe the use case(s) that the proposed feature would enable.\r\nFor dialog-heavy applications, setting up dialogs require quite a few steps. It would be nice if this was a little more streamlined. Given that (I believe) if you want to use an Angular Material dialog, it _requires_ it's own component I think it would be useful for the proper (or common) references to be added when generated. It sounds like the `entryComponents` step won't be needed in `v9`, so that is nice.\r\n","Url":"https://github.com/angular/components/issues/17994","RelatedDescription":"Open issue \"Schematic for Angular Material Dialog\" (#17994)"},{"Id":"539113753","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2019-12-17T23:38:25","Actor":"devversion","Number":"17990","RawContent":null,"Title":"build: exclude devserver targets from ci test jobs","State":"closed","Body":"We don't want to build the runfile tree's for the executable\r\ndevserver targets.
