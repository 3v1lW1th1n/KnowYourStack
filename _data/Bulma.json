In this case `colorLuminance(#e20e76)` is roughly `0.19` whereas `lightness(#e20e76)` is 47%.  Which is what [`$target-l`](https://github.com/jgthms/bulma/blob/35e3ccbd042d137640420cc39f1e8e870b7db618/sass/utilities/functions.sass#L96) turns out to be here.\r\n\r\n### Steps to Reproduce\r\n\r\n1. Set a SASS property value to `findDarkColor(#e20e76)`.  E.g.\r\n\r\n```sass\r\nbody\r\n  color: findDarkColor(#e20e76)\r\n ```\r\n\r\n### Expected behavior\r\n\r\nI expect the resulting colour to be darker than the given one.\r\n\r\n### Actual behavior\r\n\r\nThe resulting colour is unchanged, i.e. #e20e76.\r\n","Url":"https://github.com/jgthms/bulma/issues/2678","RelatedDescription":"Open issue \"findDarkColor() not changing the colour\" (#2678)"},{"Id":"513351533","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2019-10-28T15:44:50","Actor":"kirillarutyunov","Number":"2677","RawContent":null,"Title":"✨ Fix </sbuttonan> tag in Button element documentation page #2676","State":"closed","Body":"This is about the Bulma **Docs**\r\n\r\nThere is some strange tag in the code example:\r\n```\r\n<button class=\"button is-danger is-outlined\">\r\n    <span>Delete</span>\r\n    <span class=\"icon is-small\">\r\n      <i class=\"fas fa-times\"></i>\r\n    </sbuttonan>\r\n```\r\n\r\nCode: \r\nhttps://github.com/jgthms/bulma/blob/master/docs/documentation/elements/button.html#L236","Url":"https://github.com/jgthms/bulma/pull/2677","RelatedDescription":"Closed or merged PR \"✨ Fix </sbuttonan> tag in Button element documentation page #2676\" (#2677)"},{"Id":"513350857","IsPullRequest":false,"CreatedAt":"2019-10-28T14:45:45","Actor":"kirillarutyunov","Number":"2676","RawContent":null,"Title":"[Documentation] Button element, code example with error","State":"open","Body":"This is about the Bulma **Docs**\r\n\r\nThere is some strange tag in the code example:\r\n```\r\n<button class=\"button is-danger is-outlined\">\r\n    <span>Delete</span>\r\n    <span class=\"icon is-small\">\r\n      <i class=\"fas fa-times\"></i>\r\n    </sbuttonan>\r\n```\r\n\r\nCode: \r\nhttps://github.com/jgthms/bulma/blob/master/docs/documentation/elements/button.html#L236","Url":"https://github.com/jgthms/bulma/issues/2676","RelatedDescription":"Open issue \"[Documentation] Button element, code example with error\" (#2676)"},{"Id":"513168685","IsPullRequest":false,"CreatedAt":"2019-10-28T08:43:43","Actor":"baba43","Number":"2675","RawContent":null,"Title":"Why did you increase controls size?","State":"open","Body":"Just a simple question, because I'd like to understand the reason.\r\n\r\nCommit: https://github.com/jgthms/bulma/commit/639e09e2c303062783bb017ac606e11d3d62f8fb\r\nChangelog: https://bulma.io/2019/10/15/light-dark-colors/#larger-form-controls","Url":"https://github.com/jgthms/bulma/issues/2675","RelatedDescription":"Open issue \"Why did you increase controls size?\" (#2675)"},{"Id":"512982186","IsPullRequest":false,"CreatedAt":"2019-10-27T16:18:03","Actor":"airblade","Number":"2674","RawContent":null,"Title":"How to use custom colors (v0.8.0)?","State":"closed","Body":"This is about **Bulma**.\r\n\r\n### Overview of the problem\r\n\r\nThis is about the Bulma **CSS framework**\r\nI'm using Bulma **version** [0.8.0]\r\nI am sure this issue is **not a duplicate**\r\n\r\n### Description\r\n\r\nI read the blog post about [light and dark colors](https://bulma.io/2019/10/15/light-dark-colors/#light-dark-colors) in v0.8.0 but I'm not quite sure how to take advantage of the new functionality.\r\n\r\nIt sounds like if I add a custom color, Bulma will calculate the inverted color, a light version, and a dark version.\r\n\r\nHowever I'm not sure how to get hold of these calculated colors.\r\n\r\n### Steps to Reproduce\r\n\r\n1. I made a `$custom-colors` map in my sass:\r\n\r\n```sass\r\n$custom-colors: (\"foo\": #f3488c)\r\n```\r\n\r\n2. I added some html which works:\r\n\r\n```html\r\n<a class=\"button is-foo\">this works as expected</a>\r\n<p class=\"has-text-foo\">this works too</p>\r\n```\r\n\r\n3. But this doesn't work:\r\n\r\n```html\r\n<a class=\"button is-foo-dark\">oh dear</a>\r\n<p class=\"has-text-foo-dark\">oh noes</p>\r\n```\r\n\r\nAm I wrong to expect that to work?\r\n\r\n4. I found another way to get at the calculated colors but it seems a bit roundabout.  In my sass:\r\n\r\n```sass\r\n.bar\r\n  color: nth(map-get($colors, 'foo'), 4)\r\n  // These don't compile because there's no such variable:\r\n  // color: $foo\r\n  // color: $foo-dark\r\n```\r\n\r\nThen in my html this works:\r\n\r\n```html\r\n<a class=\"button bar\">ok</a>\r\n<p class=\"bar\">also ok</p>\r\n```\r\n\r\nPlease can you tell me whether there's a better way?\r\n\r\nMany thanks in advance!\r\n","Url":"https://github.com/jgthms/bulma/issues/2674","RelatedDescription":"Closed issue \"How to use custom colors (v0.8.0)?\" (#2674)"},{"Id":"510827183","IsPullRequest":false,"CreatedAt":"2019-10-22T18:31:32","Actor":"LunaticMuch","Number":"2673","RawContent":null,"Title":"Burger doesn't work with Bulma 0.8.0","State":"closed","Body":"I am testing Bulma **0.8.0**.\r\n\r\nI've created an example with navbar and two menu entries, which I expect to be rendered by the hamburger when on mobile (or <1024px).
