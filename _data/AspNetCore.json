This utilizes the ServiceProvider instance. This occurs at the beginning of the method, and the service adds some more services to ServiceCollection which was preserved in the original ConfigureServices() call. The problem is that these new services are not available via the ServiceProvider instance. Creating another ServiceProvider instance from the ServiceCollection would lose previously modified and needed singletons.\r\n\r\n I downloaded the DependencyInjection, Metadata, and Hosting github repos. Digging into the ServiceProvider, ultimately revealed a reference to the ServiceCollection is preserved in the internal property and class CallSiteFactory inside the internal base class ServiceProviderEngine. The private method Populate() initializes the _descriptorLookup data member. It would be nice for ServiceProvider to have a Refresh() method that would call down into the CallSiteFactory and blow away and call Populate() to recreate the _descriptorLookup data member. If I am reading the code correctly, this would not affect the singleton instances, and the recreated cacheKey(s) would be the same.\r\n\r\nIf this would work and is acceptable, I would be glad to fork and try it out."},{"Id":"7323516131","Type":"IssuesEvent","CreatedAt":"2018-03-02T19:01:32","Actor":"Eilon","Repository":"aspnet/Home","Organization":"aspnet","RawContent":null,"RelatedAction":"closed","RelatedUrl":"https://github.com/aspnet/Home/issues/2916","RelatedDescription":"Closed issue \"Asp.Net Identity stores for firebase\" (#2916) at aspnet/Home","RelatedBody":"If you are intersted, I've implement [Asp.Net Identity stores for firebase](https://github.com/aguacongas/Identity.Firebase)\r\n\r\nRegards"},{"Id":"7321681407","Type":"IssuesEvent","CreatedAt":"2018-03-02T12:39:18","Actor":"skleanthous","Repository":"aspnet/Home","Organization":"aspnet","RawContent":null,"RelatedAction":"opened","RelatedUrl":"https://github.com/aspnet/Home/issues/2917","RelatedDescription":"Opened issue \"The link to contributor license agreement is not working\" (#2917) at aspnet/Home","RelatedBody":"The link to sign the contributor license agreement in https://github.com/aspnet/Home/blob/dev/CONTRIBUTING.md is not working."}],"ResultType":"GitHubEvent"},"SignalR":{"Events":[{"Id":"7324082267","Type":"IssuesEvent","CreatedAt":"2018-03-02T21:13:07","Actor":"madskristensen","Repository":"aspnet/SignalR","Organization":"aspnet","RawContent":null,"RelatedAction":"opened","RelatedUrl":"https://github.com/aspnet/SignalR/issues/1525","RelatedDescription":"Opened issue \"Publish signalr.js on cdnjs.com\" (#1525) at aspnet/SignalR","RelatedBody":"This will enable LibMan to provide the script file so developers don't have to use npm"},{"Id":"7323823184","Type":"IssuesEvent","CreatedAt":"2018-03-02T20:10:38","Actor":"anurse","Repository":"aspnet/SignalR","Organization":"aspnet","RawContent":null,"RelatedAction":"opened","RelatedUrl":"https://github.com/aspnet/SignalR/issues/1524","RelatedDescription":"Opened issue \"Review MessagePack library\" (#1524) at aspnet/SignalR","RelatedBody":"We need to review the MessagePack library we're using against others for quality and ensure it has the configuration options we need."},{"Id":"7323820073","Type":"IssuesEvent","CreatedAt":"2018-03-02T20:09:53","Actor":"anurse","Repository":"aspnet/SignalR","Organization":"aspnet","RawContent":null,"RelatedAction":"opened","RelatedUrl":"https://github.com/aspnet/SignalR/issues/1523","RelatedDescription":"Opened issue \"HMAC the Connection ID\" (#1523) at aspnet/SignalR","RelatedBody":"For additional security, we should HMAC the connection ID before sending it to the client.

The below issues affect Visual Studio 2015 Update 1 with ASP.NET 5 Release Candidate 1.\n#### tl;dr\n- Please fix nesting rules for `.less`, `.scss` and `.sass`, so those files are nested under `.html`.\n- Please fix incorrect nesting that sometimes appear after renaming/moving/copying files and folders.\n- Please provide an option to disable all file nesting, and eventually, options to configure nesting rules.\n- Please fix other critical Solution Explorer issues - this is just one of them, and there are many more.\n#### File nesting is inconsistent when nesting files under `.html`.\n\nThe `.less` and `.scss` files should be nested under `.html`. Those files compile to `.css` just like `.ts` compile to `.js` and they are just as much part of the view component. \n![less-not-nested-under-html](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/6388663/11942660/6452782c-a838-11e5-9a44-d7ab6a2e5fc9.png)\n![scss-not-nested-under-html](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/6388663/11942664/66bbd3a6-a838-11e5-8e3c-f1c369d5e1de.png)\nIn fact, if we only have a `.css` file in there, then it _is_ nested as expected, so clearly `.less` and `.scss` should also be nested:\n![css-is-nested-as-expected](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/6388663/11942670/6be4bdd4-a838-11e5-99b1-1dcc43238459.png)\n\nWhile the above is clearly a bug, and a very annoying one at that, the rules for other file types are less obvious, but should maybe also be considered... maybe `.json` should also be nested under `.html`?\nIt probably contains either settings, string resources, or data for that view component, so it seems resonable to me, although I consider this far less important than getting the style sheet nesting fixed.\n![json-not-nested-under-html](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/6388663/11939884/4a1bb224-a825-11e5-9ff6-631b4e8fed39.png)\n\nThose nesting rules have been inconsistent ever since they were introduced in ASP.NET 5, and **it really needs to be fixed**. Sure, everything compiles just fine, but I'm getting really pissed off looking at this mess in my Solution Explorer every day. Inconsistencies like this makes the whole concept of nesting seem like an annoyance more than a help, as it raises the obvious question \"if only some files are nested, then why nest anything at all - that's just an extra click to get to the .ts file\". Which brings me to...\n#### File nesting can be annoying\n\nWhile the fundamental idea of file nesting is not nessesarily bad, it can be _very_ annoying at times, which is why, as a _minimum_, **I want an option to disable all file nesting** - and ideally, options to configure the nesting rules.\n\nConsider this folder structure, where the folder already represents a container for the component:\n![file-nesting-is-annoying](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/6388663/11940913/ff28392a-a82b-11e5-86b4-571bc70d21bb.png)\nHere the file nesting provides no benefit at all, and actually just introduces a _really_ annoying extra click to get to the `.ts` file. A possible fix for this might be to only nest files if the folder name is different from the name of the `.html` file, but this might also be wrong - for example, a folder named `tabs` representing some fancy `tabs` component might actually contain multiple elements that work together, e.g. `tabs.html/js`, `tab-pane.html/js` and `tab-button.html/js`, and in this case we _do_ want nesting for all three of those. Therefore, I strongly believe an option to simply disable all nesting is the best option here - and it is very much needed, because despite this example, we do have projects in which the nesting provides absolutely no value and represents a major annoyance.\n\nOne could also argue that the `.html` file should actually be nested under the `.js` file.\nConsider an Angular 2 application, where the `.ts` file represents the actual Component, annotated with metadata specifying either the path to the `.html` file representing its view, or if the view is small, a string representing the markup of the view. Same for styles, where the metadata in the `.ts` file specifies either the path to the `.css` file, or a string representing the style rules. Here, both the view and the style sheet is clearly dependencies of the `.ts` file, so it would make sense to nest them below that...\n##### An alternative idea\n\nAlternatively, you could consider a completely different approach to nesting, where the part of the file name the files have in common, is used to show a \"virtual folder\" containing all the files - then file nesting could be used only for things like transpiler generated files. The image below is a concept I mocked up to illustrate this idea:\n![virtual-folder-concept](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/6388663/11942319/042b84ea-a836-11e5-80f1-b5941cfbdfa7.png)\nHere, all the files have the \"foo\" part of their name in common, and is therefore nested under a \"foo\" node in Solution Explorer. However, in the file system, the actual files are all located in the components folder, so in the code the path would be `app/components/foo.js` - nice an clean, works for any file type, and makes no assumptions about whether `.html` or `.js` is more important.\n\nGoing further with this idea, the IDE could also be smart, so when selecting this \"virtual folder\", it could maybe somehow open all the `foo.*` files in a split view (ignoring transpilation output of course), thus providing a quick way to see all the component code at once. Just a thought...\n### File nesting is broken\n\nNot only is file nesting inconsistent, and sometimes annoying, but it is also broken.\nHere are two cases of incorrect behavior I managed to reproduce - unfortunately, this does not seem to fail consistently, so it can be hard to reproduce - but it does happen often enough to be annoying.\n![file-nested-on-drag-copy](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/6388663/11943207/4749c9e8-a83c-11e5-9f15-304cb16e8419.png)\n![nesting-broken-when-folder-is-renamed](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/6388663/11943211/4c807074-a83c-11e5-8e71-4bed0bd4353c.png)\n\nPlease take those Solution Explorer issues seriously - I've provided feedback about multiple critical issues several several months ago, and thus far _nothing_ has improved. Solution Explorer still hangs or crashes the whole IDE when a large number of files is modified/moved/copied/renamed, it still has annoying, inconsistent and buggy file nesting, and it still constantly gets out of sync with the file system, crashing first the project system and eventually the whole IDE. I'm more that a little concerned about seeing a release candidate label on something this buggy and unpolished - if this is indeed what you intend to release, then we intend to find another IDE for our frontend development.\n"}],"ResultType":"GitHubEvent"},"Announcements":{"Events":[{"Id":"7215731126","Type":"IssuesEvent","CreatedAt":"2018-02-08T09:18:22","Actor":"SteveSandersonMS","Repository":"aspnet/Announcements","Organization":"aspnet","RawContent":null,"RelatedAction":"opened","RelatedUrl":"https://github.com/aspnet/Announcements/issues/289","RelatedDescription":"Opened issue \"Retiring the Microsoft.AspNetCore.SpaTemplates package (Aurelia/Knockout/Vue templates)\" (#289) at aspnet/Announcements","RelatedBody":"The `Microsoft.AspNetCore.SpaTemplates` package never shipped in the .NET Core SDK, and never reached an official level of support.
