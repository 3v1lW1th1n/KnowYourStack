The current flow is `Attempting to reconnect` -> `Failed to reconnect ... [Retry]` -> Click Retry -> `Attempting to reconnect`.\r\n- Found that in cases where the server went away entirely the reconnect event would through unexpectedly preventing the reconnect display from handling a failed reconnect. Added a separate error flow to understand when the server went away/could not start a SignalR connection to.\r\n- Could not find a great way to add tests for this scenario.\r\n- Fixed all issue requirements except for the last bullet point about auto-reloading. [The suggested approach would break development experiences](https://github.com/aspnet/AspNetCore/issues/12442#issuecomment-520000931); therefore, going to do a follow up if a better experience can be suggested/is viable.\r\n- One big issue that still exists is when the circuit gets forgotten or the server restarts entirely. We end up successfully connecting to the server but circuit connection fails resulting in a fast response failure to reconnect (shown in the end of the gif below). However, we do not let the user know that reconnect's are no longer feasible.

Fixes #12950","State":"open","Body":"This adds two new packages, both of which are part of the shared framework *and* ship as NuGet packages for client-side Blazor:\r\n\r\n * `Microsoft.AspNetCore.Components.Authorization`\r\n * `Microsoft.AspNetCore.Components.Forms`\r\n\r\n### Questions\r\n\r\n**For the authorization classes, should we use the namespace `Microsoft.AspNetCore.Components.Authorization`?**\r\nCurrently this retains their existing namespaces, so they are all in `M.A.Components`. This differs from all the forms classes, which already have the namespaces `M.A.Components.Forms`. Since the separation of packages is a user-visible feature (in client-side Blazor at least, since there's no shared framework), it now feels more justified to emphasise the seam by having a distinct namespace for `.Authorization`.\r\n\r\n**Should .Web reference .Authorization?**\r\nInitially that's what I did, as it's what we discussed before. But I think this change achieves more if we *don't* have that reference. I'm not sure why we'd want `.Web` to be an uber-package that bundles all the things, especially considering that client-side Blazor projects have to reference `.Web` and you want to minimize unused dependencies (even when using the linker). This PR currently does *not* have a reference from .Web to .Authorization, and it works perfectly well.\r\n\r\n**Should .Web reference .Forms?**\r\nCurrently in this PR it does, because .Web contains `InputText` etc. that depend on Forms APIs such as `EditContext`. If we want to take this a step further, we could also create a `M.A.Components.Forms.Web` package so that `.Web` itself doesn't have to reference `.Forms`. This means that transitively, default client-side Blazor projects wouldn't have to reference `System.ComponentModel.Annotations`. I haven't gone that far because I think this warrants more discussion about how far is too far when it comes to decoupling packages. Even if we do this, we might still want the default client-side template to reference `.Forms.Web` otherwise it's hard to discover how to do data editing, which is such a core scenario.","Url":"https://github.com/aspnet/AspNetCore/pull/12999","RelatedDescription":"Open PR \"Factor out auth and forms.

value","State":"open","Body":"This deals with #12667 in the case where the `<option>` element isn't embedded into a markup frame.\r\n\r\nThe remainder of the fix for #12667 would be to change the Razor compiler's markup pass to avoid recursing into `<select>` elements, as per [@rynowak's description](https://github.com/aspnet/AspNetCore/issues/12667#issuecomment-519604070). @ajaybhargavb, would it be possible for you to handle the remaining piece inside the Razor compiler? This is because I'm trying to maximise the amount of API-review changes I can get done in my remaining few days on preview 9 - not sure what your backlog currently looks like, @ajaybhargavb.\r\n\r\nFurther API review thought: if there's any reasonable way we could move `HtmlRenderer` out of `.Components` and into `.Web`, that would be much better. This whole concept is completely web-specific. I understand the limit there is that the MVC prerendering feature depends on this. @javiercn / @rynowak, do you know if anything stops us from making MVC prerendering depend on `M.A.Components.Web`?","Url":"https://github.com/aspnet/AspNetCore/pull/12996","RelatedDescription":"Open PR \"Prerender select elements with value\" (#12996)"},{"Id":"478876434","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2019-08-09T08:56:39","Actor":"303248153","Number":"12995","RawContent":null,"Title":"Improve performance when huge connections arrive within a short period","State":"open","Body":"The backlog parameter pass to listen() is too low, when huge connections arrive within a short period, many of them will result a very high latency or just timeout.\r\n\r\nTo improve, we could set the backlog parameter to the maximum value operation system allowed.\r\n\r\nAlso see: https://github.com/dotnet/corefx/issues/9680\r\n\r\n------------\r\n\r\nThe reason about why increase backlog parameter could improve latency:\r\n\r\nWhen using reactor style api (such as epoll),  accept requires READ event, when READ event arrive, the acceptor can accept up to $backlog connections, so the flow would like (notice epoll has an internal event queue):\r\n\r\n```\r\naccept 128 connections => handle 128 connections => accept 128 connections => handle 256 connections => ... accept 128 connections => handle 9600 connections => ...\r\n```\r\n\r\nThe time until accept a new connection will be longer and longer when more connections accepted. I don't know if this apply to iocp, but on linux it improves much.\r\n\r\n------------\r\n\r\nFollowing is benchmark results on ubuntu 18.04 (somaxconn = 65535):\r\n\r\nExecute Asp.NET Core

specify a converter for the new `System.Text.Json` serializer and so any request to an action using `JsonPatchDocument<T>` returns a 400 model valutation error.\r\n\r\n### To Reproduce\r\nSteps to reproduce the behavior:\r\n1. Using this version of ASP.NET Core '3.0.0-preview7'\r\n2. Use the System.Text.Json serializer, not Json.Net.\r\n3. Make an action with parameter `JsonPatchDocument<SomeModel>`\r\n4. Call the action with a simple patch, e.g. `[{\"op\":\"replace\",\"path\":\"/number\",\"value\":115}]`.\r\n5. See error 400 being returned\r\n\r\n### Expected behavior\r\nExcpect the parameter to be correctly bound to the patch and a status 200.\r\n\r\n### Additional context\r\nInclude the output of `dotnet --info`\r\n```\r\n.NET Core SDK (reflecting any global.json):\r\n Version:   3.0.100-preview7-012821\r\n Commit:    6348f1068a\r\n\r\nRuntime Environment:\r\n OS Name:     Windows\r\n OS Version:  10.0.18362\r\n OS Platform: Windows\r\n RID:         win10-x86\r\n Base Path:   C:\\Program Files (x86)\\dotnet\\sdk\\3.0.100-preview7-012821\\\r\n\r\nHost (useful for support):\r\n  Version: 3.0.0-preview7-27912-14\r\n  Commit:  4da6ee6450\r\n\r\n.NET Core SDKs installed:\r\n  3.0.100-preview7-012821 [C:\\Program Files (x86)\\dotnet\\sdk]\r\n\r\n.NET Core runtimes installed:\r\n  Microsoft.AspNetCore.App 3.0.0-preview7.19365.7 [C:\\Program Files (x86)\\dotnet\\shared\\Microsoft.AspNetCore.App]\r\n  Microsoft.NETCore.App 3.0.0-preview7-27912-14 [C:\\Program Files (x86)\\dotnet\\shared\\Microsoft.NETCore.App]\r\n  Microsoft.WindowsDesktop.App 3.0.0-preview7-27912-14 [C:\\Program Files (x86)\\dotnet\\shared\\Microsoft.WindowsDesktop.App]\r\n```","Url":"https://github.com/aspnet/AspNetCore/issues/12994","RelatedDescription":"Open issue \"Use JsonPatchDocument without Newtonsoft.Json\" (#12994)"},{"Id":"478772483","IsPullRequest":false,"CreatedAt":"2019-08-09T03:01:29","Actor":"kugarliyifan","Number":"12993","RawContent":null,"Title":"Razor TagHelper duplication Property Complie Error","State":"open","Body":"I use Vs2019 + asp.net core 2.1,I found that when two class contain same name property, on cshtml use the property and complie ,it will show a error msgbox,but the error list is empty\r\nmy code like this:\r\n```  \r\n    [HtmlTargetElement(\"auth\")]\r\n    [EditorBrowsable(EditorBrowsableState.Never)]\r\n    public class AuthTagHelper : TagHelper\r\n    {\r\n        /// <summary>\r\n        /// 权限项Code,,使用逗号分隔\r\n        /// </summary>\r\n        public string Codes { set; get; }\r\n\r\n        [ViewContext]\r\n        public ViewContext ViewContext { get; set; }\r\n    }\r\n\r\n    [HtmlTargetElement(\"auth\")]\r\n    [EditorBrowsable(EditorBrowsableState.Never)]\r\n    public class AuthTagHelper2 : TagHelper\r\n    {\r\n        public string[] Codes { set; get; }\r\n\r\n        [ViewContext]\r\n        public ViewContext ViewContext { get; set; }\r\n    }\r\n```\r\n\r\ncshtml:\r\n`<auth codes=\"str,str2\" t=\"@(new []{\"dddd\",\"ssss\"})\"></auth>`\r\n\r\nwhen i run the web project,it show:\r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/18448413/62751005-b9676d00-ba94-11e9-8875-d83987fe7ed2.png)\r\nbut in error list window not contain this error:\r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/18448413/62751040-d2701e00-ba94-11e9-8b8b-59bdf7ebd1b4.png)\r\n\r\n**my question is how can i find this error,when i import third-party ui library**\r\n","Url":"https://github.com/aspnet/AspNetCore/issues/12993","RelatedDescription":"Open issue \"Razor TagHelper duplication Property Complie Error\" (#12993)"},{"Id":"478728390","IsPullRequest":false,"CreatedAt":"2019-08-08T23:21:28","Actor":"rynowak","Number":"12991","RawContent":null,"Title":"Give `builder` a less discoverable name","State":"open","Body":"We use the generated name `builder` in our generate code without mangling it.

My problem is that its not doing what we would expect it to do.   \r\n\r\nManagement expects when a user logs in and clicks remember me that they will then not be required to type their login and password again for a month.

Based on the problem mentioned above, VS 2017 has no \"built in\" tooling when creating new ASP.NET Core 1.0/1.1 project, but the external tooling may help.

Initially integration with these frameworks was accomplished with ASP.NET Core specific components that handled scenarios like server-side prerendering and integration with webpack. But as time went on, industry standards changed and the SPA frameworks each released their own standard command-line interfaces (e.g., Angular CLI, create-react-app).\r\n\r\nWhen ASP.NET Core 2.1 was released in May 2018, we responded to the change in standards by providing a newer and simpler way to integrate with the SPA frameworks' own toolchains. This new integration mechanism exists in the package `Microsoft.AspNetCore.SpaServices.Extensions` and remains the basis of our Angular and React project templates since ASP.NET Core 2.1.\r\n\r\nTo clarify that the older ASP.NET Core specific components are not relevant or recommended, we are now officially obsoleting the pre-2.1 integration mechanism and marking the supporting NPM packages as deprecated.\r\n\r\nThe contents of the following NuGet packages have all been unnecessary since ASP.NET Core 2.1, and so are now being marked as obsolete:\r\n\r\n- Microsoft.AspNetCore.SpaServices\r\n- Microsoft.AspNetCore.NodeServices\r\n\r\nFor the same reason, the following NPM modules are being marked as deprecated:\r\n\r\n- aspnet-angular\r\n- aspnet-prerendering\r\n- aspnet-webpack\r\n- aspnet-webpack-react\r\n- domain-task\r\n\r\nThese packages will later be removed in .NET 5. If you are using these packages, please update your apps to use the functionality in Microsoft.AspNetCore.SpaServices.Extensions instead along with the functionality provided by the SPA frameworks you are using. To enable features like server-side prerendering and hot module reload please refer to the documentation for the corresponding SPA frameworks. The functionality in Microsoft.AspNetCore.SpaServices.Extensions is *not* obsolete and will continue to be supported.\r\n\r\nDiscussion for this issue is at aspnet/aspnetcore#12890\r\n","Url":"https://github.com/aspnet/Announcements/issues/379","RelatedDescription":"Open issue \"Obsoleting Microsoft.AspNetCore.SpaServices and Microsoft.AspNetCore.NodeServices\" (#379)"},{"Id":"474679821","IsPullRequest":false,"CreatedAt":"2019-07-30T16:19:27","Actor":"anurse","Number":"378","RawContent":null,"Title":"ASP.NET Core master branches have switched to \"5.0\"","State":"open","Body":"**This announcement is for contributors to ASP.NET Core repositories.

If you're using HttpResponse directly you should not need to make any code changes. Read further if you were wrapping or replacing HttpResponse.Body or accessing HttpContext.Features.\r\n\r\nVersion: 3.0.0-preview8\r\n\r\nBackground:\r\nHttpContext, HttpRequest, HttpResponse are backed by an abstraction called [Features](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/aspnet/core/fundamentals/request-features?view=aspnetcore-2.2). This allows functionality to be provided by different components in the pipeline without wrapping the entire HttpContext.\r\n\r\nIn 2.x there are three APIs associated with the response body: IHttpResponseFeature.Body, IHttpSendFileFeature.SendFileAsync, and IHttpBufferingFeature.DisableResponseBuffering, but the later two were rarely implemented or used.\r\n\r\nOver the course of 3.0 several new response body APIs were added:\r\nIHttpResponseBodyPipeFeature\r\nIHttpResponseStartFeature.StartAsync\r\nIHttpResponseCompleteFeature.CompleteAsync\r\n\r\nProblem: With so many APIs it became too hard for middleware to properly intercept the response body. It was also hard for calling code to rely on those features being present on all servers.\r\n\r\nFix: Consolidate the response body APIs onto a single new feature interface [IHttpResponseBodyFeature](https://github.com/aspnet/AspNetCore/blob/4aebd29abca80242f5ff9e89e07d4f1b28788a44/src/Http/Http.Features/src/IHttpResponseBodyFeature.cs). HttpResponse has been updated accordingly, and each server has been updated to provide at least a minimal implementation for all of these APIs. We'll iterate to provide more fully featured implementations in each server but that won't require any more API changes.\r\n\r\nNote if you replace HttpResponse.Body it will now replace the entire IHttpResponseBodyFeature with a wrapper around your given stream using StreamResponseBodyFeature to provide default implementations for all of the expected APIs. Setting back the original stream will undo this change.\r\nhttps://github.com/aspnet/AspNetCore/blob/4aebd29abca80242f5ff9e89e07d4f1b28788a44/src/Http/Http/src/Internal/DefaultHttpResponse.cs#L67-L89\r\n\r\nBreaking change https://github.com/aspnet/AspNetCore/pull/12328\r\n\r\nObsolete existing 2.x APIs\r\nIHttpResponseFeature.Body\r\nIHttpSendFileFeature\r\nIHttpBufferingFeature\r\n\r\nDeleted feature interfaces that were introduced earlier in 3.0.\r\nIHttpResponseBodyPipeFeature\r\nIHttpResponseStartFeature\r\nIHttpResponseCompleteFeature\r\n\r\nIn a future major release we plan to refactor the request body features as well https://github.com/aspnet/AspNetCore/issues/12620.\r\n\r\nSee https://github.com/aspnet/AspNetCore/issues/12635 for discussion.","Url":"https://github.com/aspnet/Announcements/issues/376","RelatedDescription":"Open issue \"HttpResponse body infrastructure changes\" (#376)"},{"Id":"473077311","IsPullRequest":false,"CreatedAt":"2019-07-25T21:25:57","Actor":"HaoK","Number":"375","RawContent":null,"Title":"Breaking change in IAuthorizationPolicyProvider","State":"open","Body":"As part of https://github.com/aspnet/AspNetCore/pull/9759 we added a new method to `IAuthorizationPolicyProvider.GetFallbackPolicyAsync` which is the policy that will be used by the authorization middleware when no policy is specified.","Url":"https://github.com/aspnet/Announcements/issues/375","RelatedDescription":"Open issue \"Breaking change in IAuthorizationPolicyProvider\" (#375)"},{"Id":"472946568","IsPullRequest":false,"CreatedAt":"2019-07-25T15:58:23","Actor":"HaoK","Number":"374","RawContent":null,"Title":"Breaking change in SignInManager constructor (new parameter)","State":"open","Body":"As part of adding support for new email/confirmation flows in Identity(https://github.com/aspnet/AspNetCore/issues/8356), we added a new `IUserConfirmation<TUser>` argument to the constructor of `SignInManager`\r\n\r\n\r\n","Url":"https://github.com/aspnet/Announcements/issues/374","RelatedDescription":"Open issue \"Breaking change in SignInManager constructor (new parameter)\" (#374)"},{"Id":"465890178","IsPullRequest":false,"CreatedAt":"2019-07-09T17:01:09","Actor":"blowdart","Number":"373","RawContent":null,"Title":"Microsoft Security Advisory CVE-2019-1075: ASP.NET Core Spoofing Vulnerability","State":"open","Body":"# Microsoft Security Advisory CVE-2019-1075: ASP.NET Core Spoofing Vulnerability\r\n\r\n## <a name=\"executive-summary\"></a>Executive summary\r\n\r\nMicrosoft is releasing this security advisory to provide information about a vulnerability in ASP.NET Core 2.1 and 2.2.

This advisory also provides guidance on what developers can do to update their applications to remove this vulnerability.\r\n\r\nMicrosoft is aware of a denial of service vulnerability exists when ASP.NET Core improperly handles web requests. An attacker who successfully exploited this vulnerability could cause a denial of service against an ASP.NET Core web application. The vulnerability can be exploited remotely, without authentication.\r\n\r\nA remote unauthenticated attacker could exploit this vulnerability by issuing specially crafted requests to the ASP.NET Core application.\r\n\r\nThe update addresses the vulnerability by correcting how the ASP.NET Core web application handles web requests.\r\n\r\n## Discussion\r\n\r\nDiscussion for this issue can be found at https://github.com/aspnet/AspNetCore/issues/10238\r\n\r\n### <a name=\"mitigation-factors\"></a>Mitigation factors\r\n\r\nMicrosoft has not identified any mitigating factors for this vulnerability.\r\n\r\n## <a name=\"affected-software\"></a>Affected software\r\n\r\nAny ASP.NET Core based application that uses any of following vulnerable packages:\r\n\r\nPackage name | Vulnerable versions | Secure versions\r\n------------ | ------------------- | -------------------------\r\nMicrosoft.AspNetCore.SignalR.Protocols.MessagePack | 1.0.0, 1.0.1, 1.0.2, 1.0.3, 1.0.4<br/>1.1.0 | 1.0.11<br/>1.1.5\r\n\r\n## <a name=\"advisory-faq\"></a>Advisory FAQ\r\n\r\n### <a name=\"how-affected\"></a>How do I know if I am affected?\r\n\r\nThe affected assemblies are also available separately as a NuGet package. If you are not using `Microsoft.AspNetCore.SignalR.Protocols.MessagePack` directly you may still be affected if you are using SignalR and the package is a transitive dependency.\r\n\r\n#### Direct dependencies\r\n\r\nDirect dependencies are discoverable by examining your `csproj` file. They can be fixed by [editing the project file](#fixing-direct-dependencies) or using NuGet to update the dependency.\r\n\r\n#### Transitive dependencies\r\n\r\nTransitive dependencies occur when you add a package to your project that in turn relies on another package. For example, if Contoso publishes a package `Contoso.Utility` which, in turn, depends on `Contoso.Internals` and you add the `Contoso.Utility` package to your project now your project has a direct dependency on `Contoso.Utility` and, because `Contoso.Utility` depends 'Contoso.Internals', your application gains a transitive dependency on the `Contoso.Internals` package.\r\n\r\nTransitive dependencies are reviewable in two ways:\r\n\r\n* In the Visual Studio Solution Explorer window, which supports searching.\r\n* By examining the `project.assets.json` file contained in the obj directory of your project for `csproj` based projects\r\n\r\nThe `project.assets.json` files are the authoritative list of all packages used by your project, containing both direct and transitive dependencies.\r\n\r\nThere are two ways to view transitive dependencies. You can either [use Visual Studio’s Solution Explorer](#vs-solution-explorer), or you can review [the `project.assets.json` file](#project-assets-json)).\r\n\r\n##### <a name=\"vs-solution-explorer\"></a>Using Visual Studio Solution Explorer\r\n\r\nTo use Solution Explorer, open the project in Visual Studio, and then press Ctrl+; to activate the search in Solution Explorer. Search for the [vulnerable package](#affected-software) and make a note of the version numbers of any results you find.\r\n\r\nFor example, searching for `Microsoft.AspNetCore.Mvc.Core` in an example project that contains a package that takes a dependency on `Microsoft.AspNetCore.Mvc` shows the following results in Visual Studio 2017:\r\n\r\n![Screenshot of search results in Visual Studio 2017](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/796298/25858816/8ecdc2b4-3491-11e7-9363-746804bb9832.png)\r\n\r\nThe search results appear as a tree. In the previous results, you can see that a reference to `Microsoft.AspNetCore.Mvc.Core` version 1.1.2 is discovered.\r\n\r\nUnder the Dependencies node is a NuGet node. Under the NuGet node is the list of packages you have directly taken a dependency on and their versions.\r\nIn screenshot, the application takes a direct dependency on `Microsoft.AspNetCore.Mvc`. `Microsoft.AspNetCore.Mvc` in turn has leaf nodes that list its dependencies and their versions.\r\nThe `Microsoft.AspNetCore.Mvc` package takes a dependency on a version of `Microsoft.AspNetCore.Mvc.ApiExplorer`, that in turn takes a dependency on a version of `Microsoft.AspNetCore.Mvc.Core`.\r\n\r\n##### <a name=\"project-assets-json\"></a> Manually reviewing project.assets.json\r\n\r\nOpen the *project.assets.json* file from your project’s obj directory in your editor. We suggest you use an editor that understands JSON and allows you to collapse and expand nodes to review this file.\r\nVisual Studio and Visual Studio Code provide JSON friendly editing.\r\n\r\nSearch the *project.assets.json* file for the [vulnerable package](#affected-software), using the format `packagename/` for each of the package names from the preceding table. If you find the assembly name in your search:\r\n\r\n* Examine the line on which they are found, the version number is after the `/`.\r\n* Compare to the [vulnerable versions table](#affected-software).\r\n\r\nFor example, a search result that shows `System.IO.Pipelines/4.5.0` is a reference to version 4.5.0 of `System.IO.Pipelines`.\r\n\r\nIf your *project.assets.json* file includes references to the [vulnerable package](#affected-software), then you need to fix the transitive dependencies.\r\n\r\nIf you have not found any reference to any vulnerable packages, this means either\r\n\r\n* None of your direct dependencies depend on any vulnerable packages, or\r\n* You have already fixed the problem by updating the direct dependencies.\r\n\r\n### <a name=\"how-fix\"></a>How do I fix the issue?\r\n\r\n#### <a name=\"fixing-direct-dependencies\"></a>Fixing direct dependencies\r\n\r\nOpen *projectname.csproj* in your editor. If you're using Visual Studio, right-click the project and choose **Edit projectname.csproj** from the context menu, where projectname is the name of your project. Look for `PackageReference` elements. The following shows an example project file:\r\n\r\n```xml\r\n<Project Sdk=\"Microsoft.NET.Sdk.Web\">\r\n  <PropertyGroup>\r\n    <TargetFramework>netcoreapp2.1</TargetFramework>\r\n  </PropertyGroup>\r\n  <ItemGroup>\r\n    <PackageReference Include=\"Microsoft.AspNetCore.SignalR.Protocols.MessagePack\" Version=\"1.0.0\" />\r\n  </ItemGroup>\r\n</Project>\r\n```\r\n\r\nThe preceding example has a reference to the [vulnerable package](#affected-software), as seen by the single `PackageReference` element. The name of the package is in the `Include` attribute.\r\nThe package version number is in the `Version` attribute. The previous example shows a single direct dependency on `System.IO.Pipelines` version 4.5.0\r\n\r\nTo update the version to the secure package, change the version number to the updated package version as listed on the table [previously](#affected-software).\r\nIn this example, update `System.IO.Pipelines` to the appropriate [fixed package number](#affected-software) for your major version. Save the *csproj* file. The example *csproj* now looks as follows:\r\n\r\n```xml\r\n<Project Sdk=\"Microsoft.NET.Sdk.Web\">\r\n  <PropertyGroup>\r\n    <TargetFramework>netcoreapp2.1</TargetFramework>\r\n  </PropertyGroup>\r\n  <ItemGroup>\r\n    <PackageReference Include=\"Microsoft.AspNetCore.SignalR.Protocols.MessagePack\" Version=\"1.0.11\" />\r\n  </ItemGroup>\r\n</Project>\r\n```\r\n\r\nIf you're using Visual Studio and you save your updated *csproj* file, Visual Studio will restore the new package version.\r\nYou can see the restore results by opening the **Output** window (Ctrl+Alt+O) and changing the **Show output from** drop-down list to **Package Manager**.\r\n\r\nIf you're not using Visual Studio, open a command line and change to your project directory. Execute the `dotnet restore` command to restore the updated dependencies.\r\n\r\nNow recompile your application. If after recompilation you see a *Dependency conflict warning*, you must update your other direct dependencies to versions that take a dependency on the updated package.\r\n\r\n#### <a name=\"transitive-dependencies\"></a>Fixing transitive dependencies\r\n\r\nIf your transitive dependency review found references to the [vulnerable package](#affected-software), you must add a direct dependency to the updated package to your *csproj* file to override the transitive dependency.\r\n\r\nOpen *projectname.csproj* in your editor. If you're using Visual Studio, right-click the project and choose **Edit projectname.csproj** from the context menu, where projectname is the name of your project.\r\nLook for `PackageReference` nodes, for example:\r\n\r\n```xml\r\n<Project Sdk=\"Microsoft.NET.Sdk.\">\r\n  <PropertyGroup>\r\n    <TargetFramework>net461</TargetFramework>\r\n  </PropertyGroup>\r\n  <ItemGroup>\r\n    <PackageReference Include=\"ThirdParty.NotUpdatedYet\" Version=\"2.0.0\" />\r\n  </ItemGroup>\r\n</Project>\r\n```\r\n\r\nYou must add a direct dependency to the updated version of the [vulnerable package](#affected-software) by adding it to the *csproj* file.\r\nYou do this by adding a new line to the dependencies section, referencing the fixed version.\r\nFor example, if your search showed a transitive reference to a vulnerable `System.ServiceModel.Http` version, you'd add a reference to the [fixed package number](#affected-software).\r\n\r\n```xml\r\n<Project Sdk=\"Microsoft.NET.Sdk.Web\">\r\n  <PropertyGroup>\r\n    <TargetFramework>net461</TargetFramework>\r\n  </PropertyGroup>\r\n  <ItemGroup>\r\n    <PackageReference Include=\"Microsoft.AspNetCore.SignalR.Protocols.MessagePack\" Version=\"1.0.11\" />\r\n    <PackageReference Include=\"ThirdParty.NotUpdatedYet\" Version=\"2.0.0\" />\r\n  </ItemGroup>\r\n</Project>\r\n```\r\n\r\nAfter you've added the direct dependency reference, save your *csproj* file.\r\n\r\nIf you're using Visual Studio, save your updated *csproj* file and Visual Studio will restore the new package versions.\r\nYou can see the restore results by opening the **Output** window (Ctrl+Alt+O) and changing the **Show output from** drop-down list to **Package Manager**.\r\n\r\nIf you're not using Visual Studio, open a command line and change to your project directory. Execute the `dotnet restore` command to restore the new dependencies.\r\n\r\n##### Rebuilding your application\r\n\r\nFinally, you must rebuild your application, test, and redeploy.\r\n\r\n## Other Information\r\n\r\n### Reporting Security Issues\r\n\r\nIf you have found a potential security issue in .NET Core, please email details to secure@microsoft.com.
