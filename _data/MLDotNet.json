I use a `FastTreeRegressor` model loaded from disk. I make individual predictions and not batch predictions because I need the absolute error histogram. At first, predicting works fine, but then, after what appears to be a random number of executions, the `Predict` method hangs without anything else happening.\r\n- I expect either `Predict` failing with some Exception, or better, fail for the same example or, even better, `Predict` to work for all my examples, which it should.\r\n\r\nBy _random_ I mean that I have a few million examples I have to go through, but predicting stops anywhere between after a few hundreds predictions or at best after a few thousands.\r\n\r\n### Source code / logs\r\n\r\nThe stripped down source code for `Program.cs`.
