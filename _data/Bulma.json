Reference that issue as well. -->\r\n\r\n### Proposed solution\r\n\r\nCurrently the navigation menu dropdown can only be toggled via JavaScript. With the use of a checkbox it is possible to avoid using JavaScript which leads to faster load time and better performance. \r\nThe current solution with toggling the `.is-active` class also works.\r\n\r\n### Usage\r\n1. Add an `input` with the attributes `type=\"checkbox\" class=\"navbar-checkbox\" id=\"navbar-checkbox\"` on top of the navbar\r\n\r\n2. Change the `<a>` tag of the navbar-burger to a `<label>` tag and add the attribute `for=\"navbar-checkbox\"` \r\n\r\nIt should look like this:\r\n```\r\n<nav class=\"navbar\" role=\"navigation\" aria-label=\"main navigation\">\r\n    <input type=\"checkbox\" class=\"navbar-checkbox\" id=\"navbar-checkbox\">\r\n    <div class=\"navbar-brand\">\r\n\r\n        <label class=\"navbar-burger burger\" aria-label=\"menu\" for=\"navbar-checkbox\"\r\n           data-target=\"navbarBasicExample\">\r\n            <span aria-hidden=\"true\"></span>\r\n            <span aria-hidden=\"true\"></span>\r\n            <span aria-hidden=\"true\"></span>\r\n        </label>\r\n    </div>\r\n\r\n    <div id=\"navbarBasicExample\" class=\"navbar-menu\">\r\n        ...\r\n    </div>\r\n</nav>\r\n```\r\n\r\n### Tradeoffs\r\n\r\nNone.\r\n\r\n### Testing Done\r\n\r\nTesting succeeded with the proposed changes to the basic example from the bulma docs.\r\n\r\n### Changelog updated?\r\n\r\nNo.\r\n\r\n<!-- Thanks! -->\r\n","Url":"https://github.com/jgthms/bulma/pull/2726","RelatedDescription":"Open PR \"Navbar improvement\" (#2726)"},{"Id":"531667810","IsPullRequest":false,"CreatedAt":"2019-12-03T02:31:32","Actor":"veryverygoodgood","Number":"2725","RawContent":null,"Title":"Part 3: What's with Jeremy Thomas closing important issues before we even get a chance to reply?","State":"closed","Body":"> It seems your ideas are not compatible with the very foundation of Bulma: CSS classes are independent from the underlying HTML.

While that's certainly true, it still has some way to go.\r\n\r\nhttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Semantic_HTML.\r\n\r\n@jgthms argues that semantic HTML does not apply to class names. That is simply not the case, as Bulma's classes need to be inside the HTML. \r\n\r\nGood semantic HTML means it should have tags and classes that reflect the structure or meaning of its content, and not its looks. Although the nature of CSS frameworks require us to use classes that represents looks, it doesn't mean we can't use meaningful names or have clean structures.\r\n\r\nIn the the far future, however, we might see CSS frameworks where classes being assigned to perfectly semantic HTML through some middle layer. But for now, let's clean up Bulma.\r\n\r\n- Bulma general requirement of tag inside tag inside tag is one example of it polluting the structure and meaning of the HTML.\r\n\r\n- Class names with unclear meaning such as `is-1`, `is-2` etc. These might need to work in tandem with other classes that provide more meaning, but alone they don't make any sense. Also, we should avoid using numbers where possible and use `small`, `medium`, `big` etc.\r\n\r\n- Another is the use of 90s style tags such as `<strong>`, `<small>`, `<hr>` etc. when these could be classes such as `has-strong-text`, `has-small-text`, `has-horizontal-ruler` etc.\r\n\r\n- Sometimes unclear where classes should be assigned. Directly on the element or through one of its parents? Depending on the situation, sometimes the former works and sometimes the latter. It should work on both.\r\n\r\n- There should be no need for unnecessary repetition of classes such as `navbar-item` when it should be obvious that items within the navbar are just that - items. In addition, in semantic HTML `<ul>` and `<li>` would be the more proper.\r\n\r\nIe. why can't this:\r\n\r\n```\r\n<section class=\"hero is-white\">\r\n  <div class=\"hero-head\">\r\n    <nav class=\"navbar is-transparent\">\r\n      <div class=\"container\">\r\n        <div class=\"navbar-brand\">\r\n          <a href=\"#\" class=\"title navbar-item\">MyLogo</a> <-- Bulma should know this is the logo since its parent's name is \"navbar-brand\"\r\n        </div>\r\n        <div class=\"navbar-menu\">\r\n          <div class=\"navbar-end\">\r\n            <a href=\"#\" class=\"navbar-item\">Link 1</a> <-- Same here, Bulma should know this is a navbar item\r\n            <a href=\"#\" class=\"navbar-item\">Link 2</a>\r\n          </div>\r\n        </div>\r\n      </div>\r\n    </nav>\r\n  </div>\r\n</section>\r\n```\r\n\r\nBe more like this:\r\n```\r\n<section>\r\n  <div class=\"container hero is-white is-transparent\">\r\n    <nav>\r\n      <div class=\"brand is-left\">\r\n        <a href=\"#\" class=\"title\">MyLogo</a> \r\n      </div>\r\n      <ul class=\"menu is-right\">\r\n        <li><a href=\"#\">Link 1</a></li>\r\n        <li><a href=\"#\">Link 2</a></li>\r\n      </ul>\r\n    </nav>\r\n  </div>\r\n</section>\r\n```\r\n\r\nHopefully Bulma, with all its funding and public backing, can make something like this happen in the near future.\r\n\r\nThanks!\r\n\r\n--VVGG\r\n\r\nP.S. Someone please make a subreddit or something so we can discuss cases like these without having our issues closed and therefore hidden from public view.","Url":"https://github.com/jgthms/bulma/issues/2719","RelatedDescription":"Closed issue \"[REQUEST] Making Bulma even cleaner and more structural\" (#2719)"},{"Id":"531076916","IsPullRequest":false,"CreatedAt":"2019-12-02T11:49:00","Actor":"mijuskovic","Number":"2720","RawContent":null,"Title":"Adding custom colors to bulma with sass","State":"open","Body":"How to add `is-light` version of custom color?","Url":"https://github.com/jgthms/bulma/issues/2720","RelatedDescription":"Open issue \"Adding custom colors to bulma with sass\" (#2720)"},{"Id":"530609078","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2019-11-30T20:25:15","Actor":"syn-zeta","Number":"2718","RawContent":null,"Title":"README: Remove height attr to make banner image responsive.

The goal was to stretch the divs to take up the complete hero body.  I found this article about how to do this with flexbox:\r\nhttps://css-tricks.com/boxes-fill-height-dont-squish/\r\n\r\nI created an example to illustrate.  The hero body has four divs.  The first and second divs do not have any modifiers, so they are sized normally to fit their content.  The third and fourth divs have a modifier class \"is-max-height,\" which divides all of the remaining vertical space between them, increasing their height.  The fourth also has a modifier class \"is-vertically-centered\" which makes the content centered vertically in the div.\r\nhttps://codepen.io/RobJacobson/pen/QWWJPWK\r\n\r\nThis seems like a common use-case.  Are there any existing modifiers in Bulma that allow this?  (I.e., am I reinventing the wheel?)  If not, I'd propose adding classes like these, along with supporting documentation/examples on the website.  I think this would  be quite useful.\r\n\r\nAlso, I'd like to suggest creating a layout control for full-page content that isn't a hero.  It seems to be a common practice to use a hero for full-page content, such as in the linked tutorial (which is excellent).  However, this seems to me like \"overloading\" the hero class when it's used as a general layout tool for full-page layouts.  It works, but it seems weird -- using a hero for something that doesn't have traditional \"hero\" content.\r\nhttps://scrimba.com/p/pV5eHk/cvrwyfR","Url":"https://github.com/jgthms/bulma/issues/2704","RelatedDescription":"Open issue \"[Feature Request] Classes to fill available vertical space\" (#2704)"},{"Id":"522790030","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2019-11-16T16:26:03","Actor":"afwn90cj93201nixr2e1re","Number":"2701","RawContent":null,"Title":"Add placeholders for extending in other frameworks.","State":"closed","Body":"Add placeholders for extending in other frameworks.\r\nFor example in buefy.\r\n\r\n<!-- PLEASE READ THE FOLLOWING INSTRUCTIONS -->\r\n<!-- DO NOT REBUILD THE CSS OUTPUT IN YOUR PR -->\r\n\r\n<!-- Choose one of the following: -->\r\nThis is a **new feature | improvement | bugfix | documentation fix**.\r\n<!-- New feature?

In your `mystyles.scss`, create a custom color map, e.g.\r\n```scss\r\n// Import default variables\r\n@import \"../node_modules/bulma/sass/utilities/initial-variables.sass\";\r\n\r\n// In this example, the color map for `.is-primary` will be replaced\r\n$custom-colors: (\"primary\": ($red, $white, $yellow, $green));\r\n\r\n// Import other Bulma code including derived-variables.sass\r\n// to merge the $custom-colors map to the regular $colors map\r\n@import \"../node_modules/bulma/sass/utilities/_all.sass\";\r\n@import \"../node_modules/bulma/sass/base/_all.sass\";\r\n@import \"../node_modules/bulma/sass/elements/button.sass\";\r\n```\r\n2. Create a [`mypage.html` file according to the documentation](https://github.com/jgthms/bulma/blob/d4c7731792e1a62d89d784544f7a50d7a6cfcd6d/docs/_includes/snippets/mypage.html) and make sure it contains a primary button:\r\n```html\r\n<a class=\"button is-primary\">Primary</a>\r\n```\r\n\r\n\r\n### Expected behavior\r\n\r\nWhen hovering, the `Primary` button, I expect the `background-color` to change from `$red` to `$green`, as this is the supposed color for `$primary-dark` in the `$custom-colors` map (which is merged into the `$colors` map).\r\n\r\n\r\n### Actual behavior\r\n\r\nWhen hovering, the background color changes to a 2.5% darker shade of `$red`. Currently, it's not possible to change this colour via SASS/CSS variables.\r\n\r\n\r\nI'd also like take the opportunity to thank you very much for your work on Bulma! :)","Url":"https://github.com/jgthms/bulma/issues/2702","RelatedDescription":"Open issue \"`$primary-dark` not used as `.button.is-primary:hover` color \" (#2702)"},{"Id":"522391940","IsPullRequest":false,"CreatedAt":"2019-11-13T18:19:18","Actor":"dlemper","Number":"2700","RawContent":null,"Title":"Change colors according prefers-color-scheme media query","State":"open","Body":"### Overview of the problem\r\n\r\n<!-- UNCOMMENT THE APPROPRIATE LINES -->\r\n\r\nThis is about the Bulma **CSS framework**\r\n<!-- This is about the Bulma **Docs** -->\r\nI'm using Bulma **version** 0.8.0\r\nMy **browser** is: Firefox/Chromium\r\n<!-- This is a **Sass** issue: I'm using version [x.x.x] -->\r\nI am sure this issue is **not a duplicate** as #2342 is about theming in general in my opinion\r\n\r\n### Description\r\n\r\nI would like to switch between a dark theme and the standard light theme automatically based on „ prefers-color-scheme“ media query.
