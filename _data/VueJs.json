But in my use-case I am building a Vue Compnent and I would like to allow the consumer-developer of the component to bind a sole config object that is divided to inner nested objects for example in my use-case a star rating mechanisem, its style property with its inner styles should be registeed like so --> config.style.color.\r\n\r\n### Before\r\nBinding a config object like so:\r\n```\r\ndata() {\r\n    return {\r\n      config: {\r\n        rating: 4.7,\r\n        isIndicatorActive: true,\r\n        starStyle: {\r\n          fullStarColor: \"#ed8a19\",\r\n          emptyStarColor: \"#737373\",\r\n          starWidth: 100,\r\n          starHeight: 100\r\n        }\r\n      }\r\n    };\r\n  },\r\n```\r\nAnd in the selector: `<stars-rating v-bind=\"config\"></stars-rating>`\r\n\r\nThen I register the properties in the `<stars-rating>` component like so:\r\n```\r\n props: {\r\n   // regular same hirearchy level props\r\n    rating: {\r\n      type: Number,\r\n      default: 4.3\r\n    },\r\n    isIndicatorActive: {\r\n      type: Boolean,\r\n      default: true\r\n    }\r\n  },\r\n// 2nd hirearchy level props inside style object\r\nfullStarColor: {\r\n    type: String,\r\n    default: \"#ed8a19\"\r\n},\r\nemptyStarColor: {\r\n    type: String,\r\n    default: \"#737373\"\r\n},\r\nstarWidth: {\r\n    type: Number,\r\n    default: 100\r\n},\r\nstarHeight: {\r\n    type: Number,\r\n    default: 100\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nSo far, by trying to accomplish the above, all four 2nd hirearchy level props are **not reactive** and do not override deafult values.\r\n\r\n### After\r\nBy running this code on the props before they are attached to the child component, all props are\r\nflattened recursievly and should work with current reactivity logic:\r\n```\r\nflattenProps(props) {\r\n    let flatProps = {};\r\n\r\n   for (let i in props) {\r\n        if (!ob,hasOwnProperty(i)) continue;\r\n\r\n        if(typeof props[i] == 'object') {\r\n            let flatObj = this.flattenProps(props[i]);\r\n            for(let x in flatObj) {\r\n               if (!flatObj.hasOwnProperty(x)) continue;\r\n\r\n               flatProps[i + 'i' + x] = flatObj[x];\r\n            }\r\n        } else {\r\n            flatProps[i] = props[i];\r\n        }\r\n    }\r\n    return flatProps;\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nI need to see the constraints and everything, but this is the general logic I would like to implement to flatten the props object before \"mounted\" or attached to the component\r\n\r\n**End User** \r\nAny vue developer building dynamic components for other develoeprs to use like me & any vue users who want minimal boilerplate and a simple easy-to-use configuration for various components they consume. \r\n- I tried to build a vue star rating component that is fully open-source and for the use of anyone, I then encountered the need to style the stars in it, and in the future its tooltip, and more. I would like to have a single `style` object as a property of the config object binded to this component. \r\n\r\n### What does the proposed API look like?\r\nI plan to add a sort of middleware function that will analyze the binded object that is passed to `v-bind`, this function would do the following:\r\n* Check for a nested property that is `typeof  'object'`\r\n* If finding such a type - the function will then `concat` the `object name` with each inner `property name` and place the designated value as new key/value pairs in the 1st hirearchial level thus, \"flattening\" the binded object.\r\n* To make it more efficient this function would be recursive - and handle any levels of nested objects\r\n\r\n<!-- generated by vue-issues.

Here `slot-scope` is placed on the `<bar>` component, but it's actually defining a scope variable provided by the default slot of `<foo>`.\r\n\r\nThis gets worse as the nesting deepens:\r\n\r\n``` html\r\n<foo>\r\n  <bar slot-scope=\"foo\">\r\n    <baz slot-scope=\"bar\">\r\n      <div slot-scope=\"baz\">\r\n        {{ foo }} {{ bar }} {{ baz }}\r\n      </div>\r\n    </baz>\r\n  </bar>\r\n</foo>\r\n```\r\n\r\nIt's not immediately clear which component is providing which variable in this template.\r\n\r\nSomeone suggested that we should allow using `slot-scope` on a component itself to denote its default slot's scope:\r\n\r\n``` html\r\n<foo slot-scope=\"foo\">\r\n  {{ foo }}\r\n</foo>\r\n```\r\n\r\nUnfortunately, this cannot work as it would lead to ambiguity with component nesting:\r\n\r\n``` html\r\n<parent>\r\n  <foo slot-scope=\"foo\"> <!-- provided by parent or by foo? -->\r\n    {{ foo }}\r\n  </foo>\r\n</parent>\r\n```\r\n\r\nThis is why I now believe allowing using `slot-scope` without a template was a mistake.\r\n\r\nIn 2.6, we are planning to introduce a new syntax for scoped slots.\r\n\r\n### Goals of the new proposal\r\n\r\n- Still provide succinct syntax for most common use cases of scoped slots (default slots)\r\n\r\n- Clearer connection between scoped variable and the component that is providing it.\r\n\r\n## Syntax Details\r\n\r\n- Introducing a new special attribute: `slot-props`.\r\n\r\n  - It can be used on a component to indicate that the component's default slot is a scoped slot, and that props passed to this slot will be available as the variable declared in its attribute value:\r\n\r\n    ``` html\r\n    <foo slot-props=\"{ msg }\">\r\n      {{ msg }}\r\n    </foo>\r\n    ```\r\n\r\n  - It can also be used on `<template>` slot containers (exactly the same usage as `slot-scope` in this case):\r\n\r\n    ``` html\r\n    <foo>\r\n      <template slot=\"header\" slot-props=\"{ msg }\">\r\n        {{ msg }}\r\n      </template>\r\n    </foo>\r\n    ```\r\n\r\n  - It **can NOT** be used on normal elements.\r\n\r\n- `slot-props` also has a shorthand syntax: `()`.\r\n\r\n  The above examples using shorthand syntax:\r\n\r\n  ``` html\r\n  <foo ()=\"{ msg }\">\r\n    {{ msg }}\r\n  </foo>\r\n\r\n  <foo>\r\n    <template slot=\"header\" ()=\"{ msg }\">\r\n      {{ msg }}\r\n    </template>\r\n  </foo>\r\n  ```\r\n\r\n  The shorthand is `()` because it resembles the starting parens of an arrow function and loosely relates to \"creating a scope\". An arrow function is also typically used for render props, the equivalent of scoped slots in JSX.\r\n\r\n### Comparison: New vs. Old\r\n\r\nLet's review whether this proposal achieves our goals outlined above:\r\n\r\n- Still provide succinct syntax for most common use cases of scoped slots (single default slot):\r\n\r\n  Can we get any more succinct than this?\r\n\r\n  ``` html\r\n  <foo ()=\"{ msg }\">{{ msg }}</foo>\r\n  ```\r\n\r\n- Clearer connection between scoped variable and the component that is providing it:\r\n\r\n  Let's take another look at the deep-nesting example using current syntax (`slot-scope`) - notice how slot scope variables provided by `<foo>` is declared on `<bar>`, and the variable provided by `<bar>` is declared on `<baz>`...\r\n\r\n  ``` html\r\n  <foo>\r\n    <bar slot-scope=\"foo\">\r\n      <baz slot-scope=\"bar\">\r\n        <div slot-scope=\"baz\">\r\n          {{ foo }} {{ bar }} {{ baz }}\r\n        </div>\r\n      </baz>\r\n    </bar>\r\n  </foo>\r\n  ```\r\n\r\n  This is the equivalent using the new syntax:\r\n\r\n  ``` html\r\n  <foo ()=\"foo\">\r\n    <bar ()=\"bar\">\r\n      <baz ()=\"baz\">\r\n        {{ foo }} {{ bar }} {{ baz }}\r\n      </baz>\r\n    </bar>\r\n  </foo>\r\n  ```\r\n\r\n  Notice that **the scope variable provided by a component is also declared on that component itself**. The new syntax shows a clearer connection between slot variable declaration and the component providing the variable.\r\n\r\nHere are [some more usage examples](https://gist.github.com/yyx990803/c6a7f63219825cb90105aad1a8a17e3b) using both the new and old syntax.\r\n\r\n## Q&A\r\n\r\n### Why a new attribute instead of fixing `slot-scope`?\r\n\r\nIf we can go back in time, I would probably change the semantics of `slot-scope` - but:\r\n\r\n1. That would be a breaking change now, and that means we will never be able to ship it in 2.x.\r\n\r\n2. Even if we change in in 3.x, changing the semantics of existing syntax can cause a LOT of confusion for future learners that Google into outdated learning materials. We definitely want to avoid that. So, we have to introduce a new attribute to differentiate from `slot-scope`.\r\n\r\n### What happens to `slot-scope`?\r\n\r\nIt's going to be soft-deprecated: it will be marked deprecated in the docs, and we would encourage everyone to use / switch to the new syntax, but we won't bug you with deprecation messages just yet because we know it's not a top priority for everyone to always migrate to the newest stuff.\r\n\r\nIn 3.0 we do plan to eventually remove `slot-scope`, and only support `slot-props` and its shorthand. We will start emitting deprecation messages for `slot-scope` usage in the next 2.x minor release to ease the migration to 3.0.\r\n\r\nSince this is a pretty well defined syntax change, we can potentially provide a migration tool that can automatically convert your templates to the new syntax.\r\n","Url":"https://github.com/vuejs/vue/issues/9306","RelatedDescription":"Closed issue \"RFC:

webpack","State":"open","Body":"### What problem does this feature solve?\r\nThe guide for Server-Side rendering creates 2 webpack builds, one for the client and one for the server. Then you create a file that imports the outputs from those 2 builds and returns the responses to whatever framework you use (e.g. express). Let's call this file the server handler.\r\nThe issue with this approach is that you would need a third webpack build to process the server handler through webpack as well. You might want to do that for a few different reasons:\r\n 1. To have the same flow for all your files\r\n 2. Because you use typescript/babel/minification or other transformations\r\n 3. To use the same style of imports (i.e. ES modules)\r\n\r\n### What does the proposed API look like?\r\nI can think of a few possible solutions:\r\n\r\n#### 1. Define the name of the server handler to emit\r\n\r\nThere could be a configuration option for `VueSSRServerPlugin` that defines one additional entry to emit in the Webpack configuration. This would mean that there could be at most 2 entries, one is used for creating the JSON bundle, the other one to emit the server handler\r\n\r\n```javascript\r\n// webpack.config.js\r\nconst VueSSRServerPlugin = require('vue-server-renderer/server-plugin')\r\n\r\nmodule.exports = {\r\n  // Point entry to your app's server entry file\r\n  entry: {\r\n     main: '/path/to/server-entry.js',\r\n     handler: '/path/to/server-handler.js'\r\n  },\r\n  resolve: {\r\n    alias: {\r\n      'client-manifest': '/path/to/dist/client/vue-ssr-client-manifest.json'\r\n    }\r\n  },\r\n  plugins: [\r\n    new VueSSRServerPlugin({ serverHandler: 'handler' })\r\n  ]\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nThe handler would look something like this:\r\n```javascript\r\n// server-handler.js\r\nimport clientManifest from 'client-manifest';\r\n// This alias could be created by the VueSSRServerPlugin itself\r\nimport serverBundle from 'server-bundle';\r\nimport { createBundleRenderer } from 'vue-server-renderer';\r\n\r\nconst template = `[...]`;\r\n\r\nconst renderer = createBundleRenderer(serverBundle, {\r\n  template,\r\n  clientManifest,\r\n  runInNewContext: false\r\n});\r\n\r\nexport function handler(event, context) {\r\n  // use the renderer in here\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nThe upside of this approach is that it should be relatively easy to accomplish this.\r\nAnother upside is that this would be backwards compatible.\r\nThe downside is that there would be quite a bit of configuration necessary to make it look nice — to avoid importing build outputs directly in code, which would add a dependency on our webpack configuration in the code.\r\n\r\n#### 2. Provide an alias that resolves to the renderer instead of emitting a JSON bundle\r\n\r\nAnother possible approach would be to change completely the way the VueSSRServerPlugin works to reduce the additional webpack configuration necessary. Here's how the webpack configuration would look like:\r\n\r\n```javascript\r\n// webpack.config.js\r\nconst VueSSRServerPlugin = require('vue-server-renderer/server-plugin')\r\n\r\nmodule.exports = {\r\n  // Point entry to your app's server entry file\r\n  entry: '/path/to/server-handler.js',\r\n  plugins: [\r\n    new VueSSRServerPlugin({\r\n      clientManifest: '/path/to/dist/client/vue-ssr-client-manifest.json',\r\n      serverEntry: '/path/to/server-entry.js',\r\n      template: '/path/to/template.html'\r\n    })\r\n  ]\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nAnd here is how the server handler would look like:\r\n\r\n```javascript\r\n// alias defined by the plugin, returns the renderer\r\nimport renderer from 'vue-ssr-server-renderer'\r\n\r\nexport function handler(event, context) {\r\n  // use renderer here\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nThe clear upside is the reduction of the boilerplate.\r\nThe first big downside is that this would not be backwards compatible. It could be implemented as a new, different plugin.\r\nThe second downside is that there might be other use cases I haven't considered. `createBundleRenderer` takes other arguments as well, and you might not want to instantiate it at the top level.\r\nA smaller downside is that some pieces are connected in webpack rather than in the code, making it unclear where the template is referenced from.\r\n\r\n#### 3. Use a loader to transform the server entry\r\n\r\nThis would be similar to the first proposal, but it would change the way `createBundleRenderer` works.\r\n\r\nStarting from the server handler this time, here is how the usage would look like:\r\n\r\n```javascript\r\nimport App from '/path/to/server-entry.js'\r\nimport clientManifest from 'client-manifest';\r\n// This function has the client manifest already pulled in by the plugin\r\nimport { createAppRenderer } from 'vue-server-renderer';\r\n\r\nconst template = `[...]`;\r\n\r\nconst renderer = createAppRenderer(app, {\r\n  clientManifest,\r\n  template,\r\n  runInNewContext: false\r\n});\r\n\r\nexport function handler(event, context) {\r\n  // use renderer here\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nAnd the webpack configuration would be something like this:\r\n\r\n```javascript\r\n// webpack.config.js\r\n\r\nmodule.exports = {\r\n  // Point entry to your app's server entry file\r\n  entry: '/path/to/server-handler.js',\r\n  module: {\r\n    rules: [\r\n      {\r\n        test: /entry-server\\.js$/,\r\n        loader: 'vue-ssr-loader'\r\n      }\r\n    ]\r\n  },\r\n  resolve: {\r\n    alias: {\r\n      'client-manifest': '/path/to/dist/client/vue-ssr-client-manifest.json'\r\n    }\r\n  }\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nThis approach would have the upside of not requiring magic to happen on the webpack entries, making it possible to have multiple entrypoints.\r\nThe second upside would be to just configure a loader where appropriate, instead of adding a plugin.\r\nThe first downside is that we still have to include the client manifest from the build.\r\nThe second downside is that is could not be feasible with a webpack loader.\r\n\r\n#### So which one?\r\nI believe this problem needs a deeper reflection on the implications for all possible use cases, so someone with a better understanding of the usages of this plugin should trace the path to follow. Other ideas could be possible that would in the future also lead to simpler usages that hide the complexity from the users.\r\n\r\n<!-- generated by vue-issues.

But in my use-case I am building a Vue Compnent and I would like to allow the consumer-developer of the component to bind a sole config object that is divided to inner nested objects for example in my use-case a star rating mechanisem, its style property with its inner styles should be registeed like so --> config.style.color.\r\n\r\n- I would like the framework to provide a built in way to bind through a nested object with ass many levels as wanted for maximum customization. \r\n\r\n- A possible solution would be to identify if there are nested objects in the binded object --> if so, run a js recursive flat function that will flatten everything so it could be properly registed as props in a consistent way within the binded component.\r\n\r\n- Assuming some users of the framework wouldn't want this behavior as a default behavior, or would like to turn it off/on - I would suggest adding a way to toggle between flattening & disabling it - if that would seem a reasonable approach\r\n\r\n- Assuming this issue would be accepted, I would love to help with providing a solution to the problem, discuss the trade-offs and help even with working on an other decided solution if so.\r\n\r\n<!-- generated by vue-issues.

Often, I found it is annoying when I \"time-traveled\", there is a side-effect being performed due to the component life cycle or routing middleware try to do their \"regular\" task... this resulted in a polluted mutation records...
