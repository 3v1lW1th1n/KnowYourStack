The downloaded package.json shows `\"core-js\": \"2.6.9\"` while a new empty local project package-lock.json shows `\"core-js\": \"3.2.1\"`.  A significant difference.  Further checking shows that the StackBlitz project was created with `Angular CLI version (7.0.7)`, while my local environment is `(8.3.1)`.  Obviously not directly compatible.\r\n\r\nAfter experimenting with ways to get the StackBlitz code updated to the newer environment for awhile, I hit on a simple solution.  Before deleting the `/src` folder from the new local project, save a copy of `/src/polyfills.ts`.  After moving the downloaded `/src` folder into the project, replace the downloaded `polyfills.ts` file with the saved version.  That gets the latest polyfill version, apparently upgrading everything to match the local environment.\r\n\r\nThe `polyfills.ts` file was never touched while creating the start application on StackBlitz.  It seems to have the default for the environment used there.  So it should be safe to simply replace it.  At least it worked for me, with no warnings about version differences.","Url":"https://github.com/angular/angular/issues/32527","RelatedDescription":"Open issue \"polyfill.ts in start application on StackBlitz too old for local build\" (#32527)"},{"Id":"490588012","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2019-09-07T04:02:25","Actor":"asvishnyakov","Number":"32526","RawContent":null,"Title":"fix(router): lazy loaded empty root path loads with auxiliary outlet","State":"open","Body":"## PR Checklist\r\nPlease check if your PR fulfills the following requirements:\r\n\r\n- [x] The commit message follows our guidelines: https://github.com/angular/angular/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md#commit\r\n- [ ] Tests for the changes have been added (for bug fixes / features)\r\n- [ ] Docs have been added / updated (for bug fixes / features)\r\n\r\n\r\n## PR Type\r\nWhat kind of change does this PR introduce?\r\n\r\n<!-- Please check the one that applies to this PR using \"x\". -->\r\n\r\n- [x] Bugfix\r\n- [ ] Feature\r\n- [ ] Code style update (formatting, local variables)\r\n- [ ] Refactoring (no functional changes, no api changes)\r\n- [ ] Build related changes\r\n- [ ] CI related changes\r\n- [ ] Documentation content changes\r\n- [ ] angular.io application / infrastructure changes\r\n- [ ] Other...

The downloaded zip file includes files `angular.json`, `package.json` and `tsconfig.json` outside of the source folder.  The deployment information should mention them, and what to do with them.  In this case they are ignored and thrown away, but I suspect that information from them will be needed if extra packages have been installed.  Since the zip file contains more than the `/src` folder, need to be a bit more careful just where it is unzipped.  My first attempt unzipped to the root folder for the local angular project, then `ng new ‚Ä¶` failed because it saw the json files, and refused to create a new project in what it saw as an existing project folder.  Including information about the files, and a brief description of what they are used for would avoid confusion.\r\n\r\n## üî¨ Minimal Reproduction\r\n\r\nDownload the start application from StackBlitz.

A lot of great capabitilies :raised_hands:. \r\nSome background:\r\nSince three weeks I'm working currently on something to enable the [micro frontends](https://martinfowler.com/articles/micro-frontends.html) approach with angular. \r\nThe first two weeks I spent with evaluating in how this is even possible together with angular:\r\n _Besides @angular/elements, I have the feeling that web components were never really the focus for the angular team, right?...._\r\n _**But!!!**..... it works. There are some pitfalls and little details, but all in all, I do have a solution so far, where I'm peacefully happy with to use on a larger environment in enterprise._ \r\nSome of the things I managed to solve:\r\n- **Share the @angular libraries** between the angular-elements instead of bundling and loading them for each one again.\r\n- **Make use of Ivy for compilation**. This works both for the shared vendor.bundle and for the angular\r\n- **Provide tooling for all of this** (builders, schematics etc.) <-- Spent the third week with\r\n\r\n(Yes, I am the one with [2kb angular element](https://twitter.com/simsek_dev/status/1168163228574277639), I'm willing to provide access to the private repo if needed. But I'm not going to make it public right now) \r\n\r\n#### My issue comes with the last point:\r\nOn one side, **you provide** great CLI API's for extensions and custom logic, \r\nbut on the other side, **you restrict** people which I don't really get why. \r\nWhat I'm talking about is the [json schema for the angular workspace](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli/blob/master/packages/angular/cli/lib/config/schema.json). \r\nAs long as we tinker with builders, everything is okay. But once you need little more than this, things get complicated:\r\n- [This](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli/blob/master/packages/angular/cli/lib/config/schema.json#L396) prevents us from extending the project schema definition\r\n- [This](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli/blob/master/packages/angular/cli/lib/config/schema.json#L398) small WTF\r\n- [This](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli/blob/master/packages/angular/cli/lib/config/schema.json#L402) prevents us to define a custom targets schema\r\n\r\n> ### Why though?\r\n\r\n**Let's assume** you have one project composited of mutliple subprojects. \r\nAll of the **sub-projects share** some same information, because \r\neven though they **can be independent** from each other, \r\n**they do** have some kind of **relation** \r\nwhen it comes to that **bigger composition project**.\r\n\r\n### Describe the solution you'd like\r\n<!-- ‚úçÔ∏è--> \r\nJust allow additionalProperties? In which way they disturb? :thinking:\r\nA builder may just use those properties he is interested in and ignore all the others.\r\n\r\n### Describe alternatives you've considered\r\n<!-- ‚úçÔ∏è--> \r\nSo far, that I'm started to code an own angular workspace parser with utilities, because **builder** are allowed to have additionalProperties (WTF!!!). \r\nAnd thats the gap I'm using currently to provide some shared information between my angular elements and the container project.\r\n\r\nI started to think about using a completely separate custom json for my configuration, which would be sad just because of some flags I'm not getting why they are set.\r\n\r\nKind regards\r\n","Url":"https://github.com/angular/angular-cli/issues/15547","RelatedDescription":"Open issue \"Enable extension of #/definitions/project & #/definitions/target\" (#15547)"},{"Id":"490356338","IsPullRequest":false,"CreatedAt":"2019-09-06T16:10:33","Actor":"dipamtech","Number":"15546","RawContent":null,"Title":"ERROR in Failed to list lazy routes: Unknown module 'P:/Ionic4FullApp-StartUp_4.7/src/app/app.module#AppModule'.","State":"closed","Body":"üõëüõëüõëüõëüõëüõëüõëüõëüõëüõëüõëüõëüõëüõëüõëüõëüõëüõëüõëüõëüõëüõëüõëüõëüõëüõëüõë\r\n\r\nPlease help us process issues more efficiently by filing an\r\nissue using one of the following templates:\r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/angular/angular-cli/issues/new/choose\r\n\r\nThank you!\r\n\r\nüõëüõëüõëüõëüõëüõëüõëüõëüõëüõëüõëüõëüõëüõëüõëüõëüõëüõëüõëüõëüõëüõëüõëüõëüõëüõëüõë\r\n","Url":"https://github.com/angular/angular-cli/issues/15546","RelatedDescription":"Closed issue \"ERROR in Failed to list lazy routes: Unknown module 'P:/Ionic4FullApp-StartUp_4.7/src/app/app.module#AppModule'.\" (#15546)"},{"Id":"490352439","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2019-09-06T14:16:46","Actor":"josephperrott","Number":"15545","RawContent":null,"Title":"ci: update saucelabs protractor config to run e2e tests in series rather than parallel","State":"open","Body":"Our combined CI usage is often hitting the max number of concurrent sessions on saucelabs.

This library comes with one minified `main.js` and `main.js.map`. `main.js` ends with `//# sourceMappingURL=main.js.map`.\r\n\r\nIn `angular.json` I have enabled `\"sourceMaps\": true` and I would expect all vendor source maps to be merged in the final `vendors.js.map`, but it does not seem to be the case. When I open `Developer Tools -> Debugger -> webpack` I see the original minified version of my external library, rather than the individual files inside it.\r\n\r\n## üî¨ Minimal Reproduction\r\n\r\n1. Create a simple library with 2 ts files and build it using tsc or webpack with sourcemaps. Run npm pack\r\n2. Create a simple Angular application using the library as a npm package. Enable source maps in `angular.json`\r\n3.

That missing `/` at the end is a very important difference.\r\n\r\nSo the real problem here is that back in Angular 7.1.3 my e2e were passing while making use of the `baseHref` build flag and now they are not in latest Angular 8 version. The reason why they are not passing is because `await browser.get('connect');` should navigate to `http://localhost:4200/ext/connect` but instead it is trying to navigate to `http://localhost:4200/connect`. This is because the `browser.baseUrl` is `http://localhost:4200/ext` and if you go into the [code of Protractor](https://github.com/angular/protractor/blob/5.4.1/lib/browser.ts#L859) you will see that it uses `browser.baseUrl` with the `url.resolve(...)` method. And `url.resolve('http://localhost:4200/ext', 'connect');` returns `'http://localhost:4200/connect'`.\r\n\r\nNote: my Angular.json build has this for the baseHref: `\"baseHref\": \"/ext/\"`\r\n\r\n\r\n## üî¨ Minimal Reproduction\r\n<!--\r\nSimple steps to reproduce this bug.\r\n\r\nPlease include: commands run (including args), packages added, related code changes.\r\n\r\nIf reproduction steps are not enough for reproduction of your issue, please create a minimal GitHub repository with the reproduction of the issue. \r\nA good way to make a minimal reproduction is to create a new app via `ng new repro-app` and add the minimum possible code to show the problem. \r\nShare the link to the repo below along with step-by-step instructions to reproduce the problem, as well as expected and actual behavior.\r\n\r\nIssues that don't have enough info and can't be reproduced will be closed.\r\n\r\nYou can read more about issue submission guidelines here: https://github.com/angular/angular-cli/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md#-submitting-an-issue\r\n-->\r\n1. Create a new Angular 8 project\r\n2. Modify the angular.json file so that the basic build option uses a `baseHref` of `/ext/`\r\n3. Add routes, pages, and components so that `http://localhost:4200/ext/connect` is a valid page\r\n4. Update `app.po.ts`'s `navigateTo()` method so that you use `return brwoser.get('connect');`\r\n5. Run `ng e2e`\r\n6. Observe that you get a 404 error because it tries to navigate to `http://localhost:4200/connect` instead of `http://localhost:4200/ext/connect`\r\n\r\n\r\n## üåç Your

Description\r\n\r\n<!-- ‚úçÔ∏è--> A clear and concise description of the problem...\r\n\r\n\r\nUsing `deploy-url` has no effect on font resources.\r\n\r\nTake the following example:\r\n\r\n```sccc\r\n@mixin flags-font($theme) {\r\n  @font-face {\r\n    font-family: \"BabelStone Flags\";\r\n    src: local(\"BabelStone Flags\"),\r\n        local(\"BabelStoneFlags\"),\r\n        url('/assets/fonts/BabelStoneFlags.ttf') format('truetype'),\r\n        url('/assets/fonts/BabelStoneFlags.woff') format('woff'),\r\n        url('/assets/fonts/BabelStoneFlags.woff2') format('woff2');\r\n  }\r\n\r\n  .flag {\r\n    font-family: \"BabelStone Flags\" !important;\r\n  }\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nIf i'm running the build with `--deploy-url=my-url/`:\r\n\r\n`/assets/fonts/BabelStoneFlags.ttf` I would expect that the CSS output will reference the \r\npath `my-url/assets/fonts/BabelStoneFlags.ttf`.\r\n\r\nThis was the case in version 7.\r\n\r\nFrom version 8 it's not working, the URL is not prefixed with the deploy url.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n## üåç Your Environment\r\n<pre><code>\r\n<!-- run `ng version` and paste output below
