This is a problem because:\r\n\r\n1. This is contrary to default browser behavior (the url would otherwise remain unchanged regardless of my base href).\r\n2. In the case that the request for the index.html page differs from the server location of the javascript and css files output from `ng build`, I need to set the base href if I need to load any of these static assets using relative urls. This would happen if I were using a CMS, if my index page were generated from something like dotnet MVC, or if I were using a CDN (depending on how my server and CDN were configured).\r\n\r\nThe same was reported in #20033, but was closed as the issue did not contain any reproduction of the problem.\r\n\r\n## üî¨ Minimal Reproduction\r\n\r\nI had to create a [repo](https://github.com/haydenbr/ng-hash-router-problem) since you can't change the base href in stackblitz.\r\n\r\n### Steps to reproduce\r\n\r\n1. clone the repo\r\n2. `npm install`\r\n3. `npm build`\r\n4. `npm server` (just runs a simple express server to mimic having to set base href)\r\n5. navigate to localhost:3000/Home in your browser (the server is serving the index.html file and javascript files from different locations. In particular, the javascript files are coming from `/dist/ng-hash-router-problem/` and the index.html file is coming from `/some-other-path/index.html`)\r\n\r\nI would expect the url to be `localhost:3000/Home/#/` after loading the application, but instead, the url is changed to `http://localhost:3000/dist/ng-hash-router-problem/#/`. So the url path was changed to the base href set in `/some-other-path/index.html`.\r\n\r\nIf I then try to refresh the page, by browser is hit `http://localhost:3000/dist/ng-hash-router-problem/#/` instead of the originally requested url, `localhost:3000/Home/#/`, and the page breaks because it cannot load the files from the server.\r\n\r\nAs a test, I removed the RouterModule from the app, and commented out any components or directives exported from the RouterModules so that app doesn't break, and the url path isn't changed, so it's definitely something in the RouterModule.\r\n\r\nSimilarly, if I set `initialNavigation: 'disabled'` in the RouterModule Extra Options, the url path is not changed until the first time I navigate.\r\n\r\n## üåç  Your Environment\r\n\r\n**Angular Version:**\r\n<pre><code>\r\nAngular CLI: 8.3.7\r\nNode: 10.15.3\r\nOS: darwin x64\r\nAngular: 8.2.9\r\n... animations, common, compiler, compiler-cli, core, forms\r\n... language-service, platform-browser, platform-browser-dynamic\r\n... router\r\n\r\nPackage                           Version\r\n-----------------------------------------------------------\r\n@angular-devkit/architect         0.803.7\r\n@angular-devkit/build-angular     0.803.7\r\n@angular-devkit/build-optimizer   0.803.7\r\n@angular-devkit/build-webpack     0.803.7\r\n@angular-devkit/core              8.3.7\r\n@angular-devkit/schematics        8.3.7\r\n@angular/cli                      8.3.7\r\n@ngtools/webpack                  8.3.7\r\n@schematics/angular               8.3.7\r\n@schematics/update                0.803.7\r\nrxjs                              6.4.0\r\ntypescript                        3.5.3\r\nwebpack                           4.39.2\r\n</code></pre>\r\n\r\n## Other notes\r\n\r\nMy express config is probably not \"correct\". Please don't comment on that. It's just a throw-together server to illustrate the problem that happens when I have to set base href. For the sake of the problem, please assume that I cannot change the server configuration or location of the files being served.\r\n\r\nIt shouldn't be a browser specific problem, but my Chrome version is 77.0.3865.90 (Official Build) (64-bit)\r\n\r\n### Existing work arounds\r\n\r\nI don't think I should have to take an extra step to get this to work because I am expecting to be able to use default browser behavior. Angular shouldn't prevent default browser behavior.\r\n\r\n1. I could probably get the url to behave like I want by implementing my own LocationStrategy, but this seems like an unnecessary extra step\r\n2. I could not set a base href and instead use `--deploy-url` when building (or set `buildUrl` in `angular.json`) but this is again an extra step that I shouldn't have to do if I could take advantage of default browser behavior. This is also a challenge because the deploy url might change per environment or per server. It's easier to set a base href because the server would know about any CDN configuration or where my files are expected to be located, but I might not have this knowledge per environment when building the front end. And this is also more configuration I have to be responsible for when otherwise the server could just set the base href.\r\n\r\n### Existing code\r\n\r\nI spent a lot of time sifting through the angular codebase, but couldn't nail down the cause. I did see in [location_stategy.ts](https://github.com/angular/angular/blob/1537791f06df5d85dd27e763836fd99bb1530991/packages/common/src/location/location_strategy.ts) where `PathLocationStrategy` gets the base href from the dom and uses this as the base of the url path, but I guess that would be expected for PathLocation.\r\n\r\nI could be wrong, but I couldn't find anything in [hash_location_strategy.ts](https://github.com/angular/angular/blob/1537791f06df5d85dd27e763836fd99bb1530991/packages/common/src/location/hash_location_strategy.ts) that was changing the url path. It _seems_ that HashLocationStrategy is leaving the url alone, but something else somewhere must be incorrectly changing the url path. This is again as I would expect since hash mode _should_ only be concerned with the url after the hash.\r\n\r\nI will continue to search the codebase as I have time and submit a PR to fix the issue if I can find it, but I wanted to make you all aware and validate that this is a defect that should be fixed. (I can't imagine why this behavior would be intentional).","Url":"https://github.com/angular/angular/issues/33000","RelatedDescription":"Open issue \"Angular router in hash mode shouldn't modify the url before the hash\" (#33000)"},{"Id":"502635136","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2019-10-04T13:23:57","Actor":"filipesilva","Number":"32999","RawContent":null,"Title":"feat(core): add postinstall ngcc migration","State":"open","Body":"## PR Checklist\r\nPlease check if your PR fulfills the following requirements:\r\n\r\n- [ ] The commit message follows our guidelines: https://github.com/angular/angular/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md#commit\r\n- [ ] Tests for the changes have been added (for bug fixes / features)\r\n- [x] Docs have been added / updated (for bug fixes / features)\r\n\r\n\r\n## PR Type\r\nWhat kind of change does this PR introduce?\r\n\r\n<!-- Please check the one that applies to this PR using \"x\". -->\r\n\r\n- [ ] Bugfix\r\n- [x] Feature\r\n- [ ] Code style update (formatting, local variables)\r\n- [ ] Refactoring (no functional changes, no api changes)\r\n- [ ] Build related changes\r\n- [ ] CI related changes\r\n- [ ] Documentation content changes\r\n- [ ] angular.io application / infrastructure changes\r\n- [ ] Other...

Add `fullTemplateTypeCheck: true` in `aio/tsconfig.json > angularCompilerOptions`.\r\n4. Run `yarn --cwd=aio && yarn --cwd=aio start`. _(You should see some nice template type-check error messages.)_\r\n5.

This would allow you to pass in a boolean that's maintained in your component to disable or enable a mat-step dynamically. \r\n\r\nUse Case: I've come across a situation where I need to navigate to the third step of a horizontal stepper on 'view'. So basically skip all the creation and editing steps and just go straight to the step that shows my summary of what I've done. I searched for a while to try to find a nice way to disable a mat-step. People were suggesting using the [completed] or [editable] properties but none of those disabled the step. I was able to still navigate to it if and edit fields if I clicked on it. What I ended up doing was dynamically hiding the headers using css and [ngClass]. Obviously this is a bit of a hacky workaround and I'd love to just be able to disable the step by passing it a 'viewMode' boolean which I'm doing for other areas of the component to show and hide content I want the user to see based on what mode they're in. The UX designers at my company want to be able to see the other steps even though we wouldn't be able to navigate to them to keep the same look and feel. So essentially just make the header of the mat-step not clickable. I've hidden all the headers now as a temporary solution when user is in viewMode. Another problem with my workaround is I'm having to add a bunch of other styles that will be applied in viewMode because the headers take up a good 1/8th of my MatDialog so when they're not there, I found that I had to use [ngClass] in multiple areas. \r\n\r\nI hadn't found a better workaround then [ngClass] for this problem I'm having.
