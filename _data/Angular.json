For performance reasons we were attaching listeners to existing events at head (always using first listener as an anchor), to avoid going through the list, thus breaking the order in which listeners are registered. In some scenarios this order might be important (for example with `ngModelChange` and `input` listeners), so this commit updates the logic to put new listeners at the end of the list. In order to avoid performance implications, we keep a pointer to the last listener in the list, so adding a new listener takes constant amount of time.\r\n\r\nThis PR resolves FW-1528.\r\n\r\n\r\n## PR Type\r\nWhat kind of change does this PR introduce?\r\n\r\n- [x] Bugfix\r\n\r\n\r\n## Does this PR introduce a breaking change?\r\n\r\n- [ ] Yes\r\n- [x] No","Url":"https://github.com/angular/angular/pull/32484","RelatedDescription":"Closed or merged PR \"fix(ivy): maintain coalesced listeners order\" (#32484)"},{"Id":"489674003","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2019-09-05T22:09:40","Actor":"petebacondarwin","Number":"32491","RawContent":null,"Title":"fix(core): improve the \"missing `$localize`\" error message","State":"closed","Body":"We need to be clearer to developers who upgrade to v9 (next) and get this\r\nerror, why they have a problem and what they have to do about it.\r\n\r\nOnce we have a better CLI schematics story, where this import will be\r\nincluded by default in new applications and a CLI migration will add it\r\nwhen upgrading apps to v9, we could simplify or remove this error message.\r\n\r\n## PR Checklist\r\nPlease check if your PR fulfills the following requirements:\r\n\r\n- [ ] The commit message follows our guidelines: https://github.com/angular/angular/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md#commit\r\n- [ ] Tests for the changes have been added (for bug fixes / features)\r\n- [ ] Docs have been added / updated (for bug fixes / features)\r\n\r\n\r\n## PR Type\r\nWhat kind of change does this PR introduce?\r\n\r\n<!-- Please check the one that applies to this PR using \"x\". -->\r\n\r\n- [ ] Bugfix\r\n- [ ] Feature\r\n- [ ] Code style update (formatting, local variables)\r\n- [ ] Refactoring (no functional changes, no api changes)\r\n- [ ] Build related changes\r\n- [ ] CI related changes\r\n- [ ] Documentation content changes\r\n- [ ] angular.io application / infrastructure changes\r\n- [ ] Other...

The easiest way to do that using the `ivy-ngcc` node script.\r\n\r\nThe default (e.g. with `npm run ivy-ngcc`) is to process all supported formats (even if they won't be used). This takes much more time than necessary. As a rouch estimate, the difference between `yarn ivy-ngcc` vs `yarn ivy-ngcc -p es2015 module` (which are the properties that `@angular/cli` essentially [cares about](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli/blob/e0073c0210547cd8e502fcd47a6cb6976f02b572/packages/angular_devkit/build_angular/src/angular-cli-files/models/webpack-configs/browser.ts#L69-L70)) is 2.5x faster on my laptop for `aio`.\r\n\r\nI believe it would make sense to get people to only compile the properties they care about by default. This would require to:\r\n1. Recommend this in documentation and/or have `@angular/cli` auto-generate a suitable `postinstall` npm script when scaffolding IVy apps.\r\n2. Determine the format properties we need to consider, based on the cli targets (and the `mainFields` used from the current version of `@angular/cli`). There are potentially going to be two sets of properties; one for es2015 and one for es5.\r\n3. Add support for compiling the first of two sets of `propertiesToConsider` (or run `ngcc` twice, once for es2015 and once for es5, but that would be significantly slower, I assume).\r\n\r\n##\r\n- [ ] &nbsp;\r\n> Investigate potential performance bottlenecks (e.g. why only a 2x/2.5x improvement via parallelization).\r\n> Incorporate tracking of various metrics (possibly with a special flag only, to avoid affecting performance) to help gain better insight on current performance/issues.

This library comes with one minified `main.js` and `main.js.map`. `main.js` ends with `//# sourceMappingURL=main.js.map`.\r\n\r\nIn `angular.json` I have enabled `\"sourceMaps\": true` and I would expect all vendor source maps to be merged in the final `vendors.js.map`, but it does not seem to be the case. When I open `Developer Tools -> Debugger -> webpack` I see the original minified version of my external library, rather than the individual files inside it.\r\n\r\n## 🔬 Minimal Reproduction\r\n\r\n1. Create a simple library with 2 ts files and build it using tsc or webpack with sourcemaps. Run npm pack\r\n2. Create a simple Angular application using the library as a npm package. Enable source maps in `angular.json`\r\n3. Run `ng serve` and check Developer Tools\r\n\r\n## 🌍 Your Environment\r\n<pre><code>\r\nAngular CLI: 7.3.8\r\nNode: 10.16.0\r\nOS: win32 x64\r\nAngular: 7.2.13\r\n... animations, common, compiler, compiler-cli, core, forms\r\n... http, language-service, platform-browser\r\n... platform-browser-dynamic, platform-server, router\r\n\r\nPackage                            Version\r\n------------------------------------------------------------\r\n@angular-devkit/architect          0.13.8\r\n@angular-devkit/build-angular      0.13.8\r\n@angular-devkit/build-ng-packagr   0.13.8\r\n@angular-devkit/build-optimizer    0.13.8\r\n@angular-devkit/build-webpack      0.13.8\r\n@angular-devkit/core               7.3.8\r\n@angular-devkit/schematics         7.3.8\r\n@angular/cdk                       7.3.7\r\n@angular/cli                       7.3.8\r\n@angular/material                  7.3.7\r\n@angular/material-moment-adapter   7.3.7\r\n@ngtools/json-schema               1.1.0\r\n@ngtools/webpack                   7.3.8\r\n@schematics/angular                7.3.8\r\n@schematics/update                 0.13.8\r\nng-packagr                         5.1.0\r\nrxjs                               6.4.0\r\ntypescript                         3.2.4\r\nwebpack                            4.29.0\r\n</code></pre>\r\n","Url":"https://github.com/angular/angular-cli/issues/15531","RelatedDescription":"Open issue \"External library source maps not included in the vendor chunk\" (#15531)"},{"Id":"489648069","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2019-09-05T09:50:41","Actor":"alan-agius4","Number":"15530","RawContent":null,"Title":"fix(@angular-devkit/build-angular): add trailing back slash to protr…","State":"open","Body":"…actor baseUrl\r\n\r\nFixes #15522","Url":"https://github.com/angular/angular-cli/pull/15530","RelatedDescription":"Open PR \"fix(@angular-devkit/build-angular): add trailing back slash to protr…\" (#15530)"},{"Id":"489528784","IsPullRequest":false,"CreatedAt":"2019-09-05T09:21:30","Actor":"BabuJoym1984","Number":"15527","RawContent":null,"Title":"Entrycomponents missing fromm Prod build","State":"closed","Body":"<!--🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅\r\n\r\nHi,\r\n\r\nI am using angular 8.

That missing `/` at the end is a very important difference.\r\n\r\nSo the real problem here is that back in Angular 7.1.3 my e2e were passing while making use of the `baseHref` build flag and now they are not in latest Angular 8 version. The reason why they are not passing is because `await browser.get('connect');` should navigate to `http://localhost:4200/ext/connect` but instead it is trying to navigate to `http://localhost:4200/connect`. This is because the `browser.baseUrl` is `http://localhost:4200/ext` and if you go into the [code of Protractor](https://github.com/angular/protractor/blob/5.4.1/lib/browser.ts#L859) you will see that it uses `browser.baseUrl` with the `url.resolve(...)` method. And `url.resolve('http://localhost:4200/ext', 'connect');` returns `'http://localhost:4200/connect'`.\r\n\r\nNote: my Angular.json build has this for the baseHref: `\"baseHref\": \"/ext/\"`\r\n\r\n\r\n## 🔬 Minimal Reproduction\r\n<!--\r\nSimple steps to reproduce this bug.\r\n\r\nPlease include: commands run (including args), packages added, related code changes.\r\n\r\nIf reproduction steps are not enough for reproduction of your issue, please create a minimal GitHub repository with the reproduction of the issue. \r\nA good way to make a minimal reproduction is to create a new app via `ng new repro-app` and add the minimum possible code to show the problem. \r\nShare the link to the repo below along with step-by-step instructions to reproduce the problem, as well as expected and actual behavior.\r\n\r\nIssues that don't have enough info and can't be reproduced will be closed.\r\n\r\nYou can read more about issue submission guidelines here: https://github.com/angular/angular-cli/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md#-submitting-an-issue\r\n-->\r\n1. Create a new Angular 8 project\r\n2. Modify the angular.json file so that the basic build option uses a `baseHref` of `/ext/`\r\n3. Add routes, pages, and components so that `http://localhost:4200/ext/connect` is a valid page\r\n4. Update `app.po.ts`'s `navigateTo()` method so that you use `return brwoser.get('connect');`\r\n5. Run `ng e2e`\r\n6.
