We recommend moving to [.NET Core 3.1](https://devblogs.microsoft.com/dotnet/announcing-net-core-3-1/), our long term support (LTS) release.\r\n\r\n- [Download .NET Core 3.1](https://www.microsoft.com/net/download/dotnet-core/3.1)\r\n- [.NET Core 2.2 end-of-life statement](https://devblogs.microsoft.com/dotnet/net-core-2-2-will-reach-end-of-life-on-december-23-2019/)\r\n\r\nWe've created an issue at [dotnet/core#4084](https://github.com/dotnet/core/issues/4084) for your questions and comments.\r\n\r\n## .NET Core 2.2 Lifecycle\r\n\r\n.NET Core releases belong to one of two [support lifecycles](https://www.microsoft.com/net/platform/support-policy): long term support (LTS) and Current. LTS releases are stable release which receive critical updates and are supported for at least three years. Current releases can include new features that may undergo future change based on feedback. Current releases are supported for three months after the subsequent .NET Core major or minor release. Both LTS and Current releases receive critical fixes throughout their lifecycle, for security, reliability, or to add support for new operating system versions. You must stay up-to-date with the latest patches to qualify for support. \r\n\r\n[.NET Core 2.2](https://devblogs.microsoft.com/dotnet/announcing-net-core-2-2/) was released in December 2018 as a Current release. Per the lifecycle policy, Current releases reach end of life 3 months after a subsequent release (Current or LTS). **.NET Core 3.0** released in **September 2019** and began the end of life countdown for .NET Core 2.2 that concluded on December 23, 2019. \r\n\r\n## .NET Core 2.2 Downloads\r\n\r\n.NET Core 2.2 installers, zips and tar.gzs will remain available, but unsupported. This includes existing releases available on Linux package feeds. Previous versions, including 2.2, will be accessible through the [Download Archives](https://www.microsoft.com/net/download/archives). \r\n\r\n## Policy Information\r\n\r\nAdditional lifecycle and support details  and background can be seen in the following:\r\n\r\n* [.NET Core Support Lifecycle](https://www.microsoft.com/net/platform/support-policy)\r\n* [Microsoft Support for .NET Core](https://github.com/dotnet/core/blob/master/microsoft-support.md)\r\n* [.NET Core OS Lifecycle Policy](https://github.com/dotnet/core/blob/master/os-lifecycle-policy.md)\r\n* [Support and Versioning](https://blogs.msdn.microsoft.com/dotnet/2016/07/26/net-support-and-versioning/)\r\n"},{"Id":"11137901850","Type":"IssuesEvent","CreatedAt":"2019-12-20T20:42:34","Actor":"vivmishra","Repository":"dotnet/announcements","Organization":"dotnet","RawContent":null,"RelatedAction":"opened","RelatedUrl":"https://github.com/dotnet/announcements/issues/146","RelatedDescription":"Opened issue \"Announcing Availability of Localized IntelliSense for .NET Core 3.0 and 3.1\" (#146) at dotnet/announcements","RelatedBody":"This week we released localized [IntelliSense](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/visualstudio/ide/using-intellisense?view=vs-2019) files for .NET Core 3.0 and 3.1, in following 10 Visual Studio supported languages: \r\n- Brazilian Portuguese\r\n- Chinese (simplified)\r\n- Chinese (traditional)\r\n- French\r\n- German\r\n- Italian\r\n- Japanese\r\n- Korean\t\r\n- Russian\r\n- Spanish\r\n\r\nThe files (in zip archives) are available for download from [**Download localized .NET Core IntelliSense files**](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/download/dotnet-core/intellisense).\r\n\r\n * [Checksums for 3.0 zip files](https://dotnetcli.blob.core.windows.net/dotnet/checksums/3.0.0-intellisense-sha.txt)\r\n * [Checksums for 3.1 zip files](https://dotnetcli.blob.core.windows.net/dotnet/checksums/3.1.0-intellisense-sha.txt)\r\n\r\nYou can see [the .NET Core Guide](https://aka.ms/dotnet-core-intellisense) for instructions on how to use these files with Visual Studio.\r\n\r\nBy default, when you're developing .NET Core projects, the SDK only includes the English version of the IntelliSense files. But now you can enhance your localized Visual Studio development experience by adding the localized IntelliSense files from the download site into your local development environment.\r\n\r\nLastly, with this release we have made the localized IntelliSense available as zip archives that does require you to manually extract and copy the files to respective SDK install folders.

This means some folks will lose their Collaborator badge and the ability to interact with the CI system.*\r\n\r\nOver the years, we’ve added a bunch of folks as collaborators with read permissions to our public repos. The rationale was that we wanted to be able to assign issues to community members because GitHub only allowed assigning issues to users with an explicit permission grant for the repository. However, they changed this in [June 2019](https://github.blog/2019-06-25-assign-issues-to-issue-commenters/). Now, we can assign issues to all users with explicit permissions as well as to users that have commented on the specific issue.\r\n\r\nAlso, we recently started to audit and tighten the permissions for our organizations. As a result, it became clear that large number of repo-specific permission grants are hard to review and audit. Internally, our goal is to grant all permissions via teams instead.\r\n\r\nHence, we plan to remove all collaborators from public repos that only have read permissions (folks with triage permissions will remain). The full list of affected repos is listed below.\r\n\r\nThis shouldn’t impact your ability to work with us, but losing explicit read-only has the following implications:\r\n\r\n-   **You’ll lose the contributor badge**. We understand that this is visually appealing and for some people it might have been a badge of honor. But given that GitHub also shows a Contributor bade for folks whose PRs got merged, we don’t think it this will be a major take back.    \r\n    ![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/5169960/70491508-43acf580-1ab6-11ea-94df-74ea2dde98b4.png)\r\n\r\n\r\n-   **You lose the ability to interact with the CI system**. As a collaborator, you can use comments to [send commands to the CI system](https://github.com/dotnet/runtime/blob/master/docs/project/pullrequest-builds.md). While this can be useful at times, we generally don’t expect (or desire) contributors to do that. Of course, anyone can still access the CI logs.\r\n\r\n| Public Repo                | \\#collaborators with read |\r\n|----------------------------|---------------------------|\r\n| arcade                     | 1                         |\r\n| BenchmarkDotNet            | 11                        |\r\n| cli                        | 2                         |\r\n| command-line-api           | 14                        |\r\n| coreclr                    | 18                        |\r\n| corefx                     | 180                       |\r\n| corefxlab                  | 4                         |\r\n| corert                     | 7                         |\r\n| core-sdk                   | 1                         |\r\n| docs                       | 3                         |\r\n| interactive-window         | 1                         |\r\n| machinelearning            | 1                         |\r\n| machinelearning-samples    | 1                         |\r\n| msbuild-language-service   | 1                         |\r\n| runtime                    | 128                       |\r\n| spark                      | 5                         |\r\n| standard                   | 1                         |\r\n| windowsdesktop             | 1                         |\r\n| winforms-datavisualization | 1                         |\r\n| Grand Total                | 381                       |\r\n\r\n### Discussion\r\n\r\nTo discuss this, please comment on the corresponding issue at https://github.com/dotnet/runtime/issues/718."}],"ResultType":"GitHubEvent"},"CoreCLR":{"Events":[{"Id":"11305605210","Type":"IssuesEvent","CreatedAt":"2020-01-18T07:11:56","Actor":"safern","Repository":"dotnet/coreclr","Organization":"dotnet","RawContent":null,"RelatedAction":"closed","RelatedUrl":"https://github.com/dotnet/coreclr/issues/26241","RelatedDescription":"Closed issue \"Test failed: tracing\\eventpipe\\providervalidation\\providervalidation\\providervalidation.cmd\" (#26241) at dotnet/coreclr","RelatedBody":"**Job:**\r\nhttps://helix.dot.net/api/2019-06-17/jobs/40a0c6d5-430e-4787-9f60-9317e3055a63/workitems/PayloadGroup0/console\r\n\r\n**Failed tests:**\r\ntracing\\eventpipe\\providervalidation\\providervalidation\\providervalidation.cmd\r\n\r\n**Log:**\r\n```\r\n tracing\\eventpipe\\providervalidation\\providervalidation\\providervalidation.cmd [FAIL]\r\n      \r\n      Return code:      1\r\n      Raw output file:      C:\\dotnetbuild\\work\\40a0c6d5-430e-4787-9f60-9317e3055a63\\Work\\2cf345e3-c30f-4727-90b8-5c1641ee9d44\\Exec\\tracing\\eventpipe\\Reports\\tracing.eventpipe\\providervalidation\\providervalidation\\providervalidation.output.txt\r\n      Raw output:\r\n      BEGIN EXECUTION\r\n       \"C:\\dotnetbuild\\work\\40a0c6d5-430e-4787-9f60-9317e3055a63\\Payload\\corerun.exe\" providervalidation.dll \r\n      TEST STARTING\r\n      TEST PASSED!\r\n      TEST STARTING\r\n      Test FAILED!\r\n      No events for provider \"Microsoft-DotNETCore-SampleProfiler\"\r\n      Configuration:\r\n      {\r\n      bufferSize: 1024,\r\n      providers: [\r\n      MyEventSource:0xFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFF:5,\r\n      Microsoft-DotNETCore-SampleProfiler:0xFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFF:5,\r\n      SentinelEventSource:0xFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFF:5,\r\n      ]\r\n      }\r\n      \r\n      Expected:\r\n      {\r\n      \"MyEventSource\" = 1000 +- 300\r\n      \"Microsoft-Windows-DotNETRuntimeRundown\" = -1 +- -0\r\n      \"Microsoft-DotNETCore-SampleProfiler\" = -1 +- -0\r\n      }\r\n      \r\n      Actual:\r\n      {\r\n      \"MyEventSource\" = 1000\r\n      \"Microsoft-DotNETCore-EventPipe\" = 1\r\n      \"Microsoft-Windows-DotNETRuntimeRundown\" = 1931\r\n      }\r\n      Expected: 100\r\n      Actual: -1\r\n      END EXECUTION -

We had changed the logic to match precisely what MSDN's documentation stated and to fix a possible data corruption bug; however, this broke a number of customers' applications by sending them into infinite loops.\r\n\r\nThis PR reverts that change.\r\n\r\n## Customer Impact\r\n\r\nIf customers were relying on the previous behavior of the _completed_ out parameter, their applications could end up in an infinite loop. What makes matters worse is that the sample code on the MSDN page for `Encoder.Convert` and `Decoder.Convert` is also susceptible to this pattern, so we suspect a large number of customers may have based their own application code on the sample.\r\n\r\n## Regression?\r\n\r\nYes, from .NET Framework 4.x and .NET Core 2.x. One half of this change was introduced in .NET Core 3.0 (see https://github.com/dotnet/coreclr/commit/43a5159d39bd52195c5095da4006183f791c696b); the other half was introduced in .NET Core 3.1 (see https://github.com/dotnet/coreclr/commit/c07ec4cd2f88c23edc87500893576d83c20f2e6d).\r\n\r\n## Testing\r\n\r\nThe reversion is already committed in the 5.0 branches (see https://github.com/dotnet/runtime/commit/d49b541ab156d992aeb4bbe410f7a816bb0ac039), so we have been getting test coverage on those nightlies. No notable regressions have been reported.\r\n\r\n## Risk\r\n\r\nSomewhere between minimal and moderate. It's possible that some applications may have taken a dependency on the new behavior. See for instance https://github.com/dotnet/aspnetcore/pull/17747, where ASP.NET appears to have unintentionally taken a dependency on the new behavior and had to proactively make a change so that they behave correctly both before and after this PR goes through.\r\n\r\n/cc @tarekgh @anurse @danmosemsft ","Url":"https://github.com/dotnet/coreclr/pull/27996","RelatedDescription":"Closed or merged PR \"[release/3.1] Port fix to revert EncoderNLS and DecoderNLS Convert changes\" (#27996)"},{"Id":"550396592","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2020-01-15T20:04:13","Actor":"dotnet-maestro-bot","Number":"27999","RawContent":null,"Title":"[automated] Merge branch 'release/3.0' => 'release/3.1'","State":"closed","Body":"I detected changes in the release/3.0 branch which have not been merged yet to release/3.1.

In my opinion, FromIDictionaryToCaseInsensitiveDictionaryTest should work because the type is CaseInsensitiveDictionary and implements IDictionary.  If I do NOT have the first conversion operator, the first test method fails with this exact same error message, \r\n\r\nWith this evidence, it seems to me that something is missing when the runtime is looking for the appropriate operator.  FromIDictionaryToCaseInsensitiveDictionaryTest should work either from the Dictionary operator or automatically work because it implements the IDictionary interface.  (I cannot create an operator for IDictionary conversion because that is illegal).  \r\n\r\nPlease let me know if this is expected behavior and if there is some workaround for it.  This issue seems to be present in all versions of C#.\r\n\r\nThanks!\r\n\r\n","Url":"https://github.com/dotnet/standard/issues/1659","RelatedDescription":"Closed issue \"Generic class operators derived from interface seems broken\" (#1659)"},{"Id":"526765953","IsPullRequest":false,"CreatedAt":"2019-11-25T02:23:45","Actor":"arizvisa","Number":"1657","RawContent":null,"Title":"packages.microsoft.com: signature check for netstandard-targeting-pack-2.1.0 failed","State":"closed","Body":"Hey guys, the signature check for this package seems to be failing.

This means [.NET Core 2.2](https://devblogs.microsoft.com/dotnet/announcing-net-core-2-2/) is no longer supported and updates will no longer be provided. We recommend moving to [.NET Core 3.1](https://devblogs.microsoft.com/dotnet/announcing-net-core-3-1/), our long term support (LTS) release.\r\n\r\n- [Download .NET Core 3.1](https://www.microsoft.com/net/download/dotnet-core/3.1)\r\n- [.NET Core 2.2 end-of-life statement](https://devblogs.microsoft.com/dotnet/net-core-2-2-will-reach-end-of-life-on-december-23-2019/)\r\n\r\nWe've created an issue at [dotnet/core#4084](https://github.com/dotnet/core/issues/4084) for your questions and comments.\r\n\r\n## .NET Core 2.2 Lifecycle\r\n\r\n.NET Core releases belong to one of two [support lifecycles](https://www.microsoft.com/net/platform/support-policy): long term support (LTS) and Current. LTS releases are stable release which receive critical updates and are supported for at least three years. Current releases can include new features that may undergo future change based on feedback. Current releases are supported for three months after the subsequent .NET Core major or minor release. Both LTS and Current releases receive critical fixes throughout their lifecycle, for security, reliability, or to add support for new operating system versions. You must stay up-to-date with the latest patches to qualify for support. \r\n\r\n[.NET Core 2.2](https://devblogs.microsoft.com/dotnet/announcing-net-core-2-2/) was released in December 2018 as a Current release. Per the lifecycle policy, Current releases reach end of life 3 months after a subsequent release (Current or LTS). **.NET Core 3.0** released in **September 2019** and began the end of life countdown for .NET Core 2.2 that concluded on December 23, 2019. \r\n\r\n## .NET Core 2.2 Downloads\r\n\r\n.NET Core 2.2 installers, zips and tar.gzs will remain available, but unsupported. This includes existing releases available on Linux package feeds. Previous versions, including 2.2, will be accessible through the [Download Archives](https://www.microsoft.com/net/download/archives). \r\n\r\n## Policy Information\r\n\r\nAdditional lifecycle and support details  and background can be seen in the following:\r\n\r\n* [.NET Core Support Lifecycle](https://www.microsoft.com/net/platform/support-policy)\r\n* [Microsoft Support for .NET Core](https://github.com/dotnet/core/blob/master/microsoft-support.md)\r\n* [.NET Core OS Lifecycle Policy](https://github.com/dotnet/core/blob/master/os-lifecycle-policy.md)\r\n* [Support and Versioning](https://blogs.msdn.microsoft.com/dotnet/2016/07/26/net-support-and-versioning/)\r\n","Url":"https://github.com/dotnet/announcements/issues/147","RelatedDescription":"Open issue \".NET Core 2.2 has reached end of life\" (#147)"},{"Id":"541189878","IsPullRequest":false,"CreatedAt":"2019-12-20T20:42:33","Actor":"vivmishra","Number":"146","RawContent":null,"Title":"Announcing Availability of Localized IntelliSense for .NET Core 3.0 and 3.1","State":"open","Body":"This week we released localized [IntelliSense](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/visualstudio/ide/using-intellisense?view=vs-2019) files for .NET Core 3.0 and 3.1, in following 10 Visual Studio supported languages: \r\n- Brazilian Portuguese\r\n- Chinese (simplified)\r\n- Chinese (traditional)\r\n- French\r\n- German\r\n- Italian\r\n- Japanese\r\n- Korean\t\r\n- Russian\r\n- Spanish\r\n\r\nThe files (in zip archives) are available for download from [**Download localized .NET Core IntelliSense files**](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/download/dotnet-core/intellisense).\r\n\r\n * [Checksums for 3.0 zip files](https://dotnetcli.blob.core.windows.net/dotnet/checksums/3.0.0-intellisense-sha.txt)\r\n * [Checksums for 3.1 zip files](https://dotnetcli.blob.core.windows.net/dotnet/checksums/3.1.0-intellisense-sha.txt)\r\n\r\nYou can see [the .NET Core Guide](https://aka.ms/dotnet-core-intellisense) for instructions on how to use these files with Visual Studio.\r\n\r\nBy default, when you're developing .NET Core projects, the SDK only includes the English version of the IntelliSense files. But now you can enhance your localized Visual Studio development experience by adding the localized IntelliSense files from the download site into your local development environment.\r\n\r\nLastly, with this release we have made the localized IntelliSense available as zip archives that does require you to manually extract and copy the files to respective SDK install folders.

This means some folks will lose their Collaborator badge and the ability to interact with the CI system.*\r\n\r\nOver the years, we’ve added a bunch of folks as collaborators with read permissions to our public repos. The rationale was that we wanted to be able to assign issues to community members because GitHub only allowed assigning issues to users with an explicit permission grant for the repository. However, they changed this in [June 2019](https://github.blog/2019-06-25-assign-issues-to-issue-commenters/). Now, we can assign issues to all users with explicit permissions as well as to users that have commented on the specific issue.\r\n\r\nAlso, we recently started to audit and tighten the permissions for our organizations. As a result, it became clear that large number of repo-specific permission grants are hard to review and audit. Internally, our goal is to grant all permissions via teams instead.\r\n\r\nHence, we plan to remove all collaborators from public repos that only have read permissions (folks with triage permissions will remain). The full list of affected repos is listed below.\r\n\r\nThis shouldn’t impact your ability to work with us, but losing explicit read-only has the following implications:\r\n\r\n-   **You’ll lose the collaborator badge**. We understand that this is visually appealing and for some people it might have been a badge of honor. But given that GitHub also shows a Contributor bade for folks whose PRs got merged, we don’t think it this will be a major take back.    \r\n    ![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/5169960/70491508-43acf580-1ab6-11ea-94df-74ea2dde98b4.png)\r\n\r\n-   ~~**You lose the ability to interact with the CI system**. As a collaborator, you can use comments to [send commands to the CI system](https://github.com/dotnet/runtime/blob/master/docs/project/pullrequest-builds.md). While this can be useful at times, we generally don’t expect (or desire) contributors to do that. Of course, anyone can still access the CI logs.~~\r\n\r\n- **You might lose the ability to interact with the CI system**. Based on your feedback we have decided to give externals access to interact with the CI system *on a case by case basis*. If you believe you need to have that ability, please [leave a comment like Kevin's](https://github.com/dotnet/runtime/issues/718#issuecomment-563717478).\r\n\r\n| Public Repo                | \\#collaborators with read |\r\n|----------------------------|---------------------------|\r\n| arcade                     | 1                         |\r\n| BenchmarkDotNet            | 11                        |\r\n| cli                        | 2                         |\r\n| command-line-api           | 14                        |\r\n| coreclr                    | 18                        |\r\n| corefx                     | 180                       |\r\n| corefxlab                  | 4                         |\r\n| corert                     | 7                         |\r\n| core-sdk                   | 1                         |\r\n| docs                       | 3                         |\r\n| interactive-window         | 1                         |\r\n| machinelearning            | 1                         |\r\n| machinelearning-samples    | 1                         |\r\n| msbuild-language-service   | 1                         |\r\n| runtime                    | 128                       |\r\n| spark                      | 5                         |\r\n| standard                   | 1                         |\r\n| windowsdesktop             | 1                         |\r\n| winforms-datavisualization | 1                         |\r\n| Grand Total                | 381                       |\r\n\r\n### Discussion\r\n\r\nTo discuss this, please comment on the corresponding issue at https://github.com/dotnet/runtime/issues/718.","Url":"https://github.com/dotnet/announcements/issues/144","RelatedDescription":"Open issue \"Removal of read-collaborator access\" (#144)"},{"Id":"532249858","IsPullRequest":false,"CreatedAt":"2019-12-03T20:36:29","Actor":"MichaelSimons","Number":"143","RawContent":null,"Title":".NET Core `latest` Docker tags updated to 3.1","State":"open","Body":"# .NET Core `latest` Docker tags updated to 3.1\r\n\r\nThe `latest` tags for the [dotnet/core](https://hub.docker.com/_/microsoft-dotnet-core) repos have been updated to reference [.NET Core 3.1](https://devblogs.microsoft.com/dotnet/announcing-net-core-3-1/).\r\n\r\n## Discussion\r\n \r\nYou can share your thoughts on this change or see what others are saying at:\r\n \r\n* [dotnet/dotnet-docker#1337](https://github.com/dotnet/dotnet-docker/issues/1511)\r\n\r\n## Details\r\n\r\n* [dotnet-docker#1509](https://github.com/dotnet/dotnet-docker/pull/1509)\r\n\r\nThe `latest` tags for the [dotnet/core](https://hub.docker.com/_/microsoft-dotnet-core) repos are always intended to reference the latest supported version of .NET Core.

Our planning has reached a point where we have a schedule for the coreclr, corefx and core-setupmoves into dotnet/runtime that we want to share out with the community.\r\n\r\n### November 13th\r\nWe’ll move all changes from the original repositories into dotnet/runtime up to 5PM PST on November 13th. We’ll try to help as many pull requests as possible get merged by then. At that point, if there’s any pull requests still open we’ll have to close them. If you’d still like to continue those pull requests, we’d encourage you to bring them to dotnet/runtime in a new pull request.\r\n\r\nThe repositories themselves will be effectively archived at this point. The state of the “master” branch will be recorded with a tag, named “master-archive”, but the branch itself will be deleted. The default branch for the repositories will be named “archive” and it will be a single commit with a README.md and CONTRIBUTING.md file pointing to our dotnet/runtime repository.\r\n\r\nThe repositories will remain active for servicing changes to .NET Core 3.1 and earlier hence we will not be using the GitHub archive capability. \r\n\r\n### November 22nd\r\nThe dotnet/runtime repository will be made public and available for community contribution. Even though the repository will be created on November 13th it will take several days to get it back into a working order: fixing up our build scripts, recreating our Azure Dev Ops build definitions, etc … Until those tasks are completed it will not be possible to accept pull request and hence the repository will remain private. Once we are in a state that pull requests can be merged again the repository will be made public.\r\n\r\nOur expectation is that will occur on November 22nd. If it is ready sooner it will be made public sooner. If the work takes longer than we planned then we will add an update to this announcement with a new expected date.\r\n\r\n### December 1st-2nd\r\nAll issues, open and closed, will be migrated from corefx, coreclr and core-setup into dotnet/runtime. This will be using GitHub’s existing issue transfer feature in a bulk migration. This means all of the existing issue links will continue to function via redirects.\r\n\r\nThis does mean though that labels will not transfer with the issues. Labels will be re-applied as a post processing step by our engineering team once the issue migration completes.\r\n\r\nEven though our issues won’t be fully migrated until this time we’d like the community to begin filing issues on dotnet/runtime as soon as it’s public rather than continuing to file issues on the original repositories.\r\n\r\n### Migrating Commits\r\nThe dotnet/runtime repository will be a new commit history from the original repositories. We are using this consolidation as an opportunity to clean up our history with the goal of having a cleaner, smaller history as a starting point. This means commits will be rewritten in the following ways as they are migrated to dotnet/runtime:\r\n\r\n1. Author information, contributor information, changed file list and time stamps from the original commit will be preserved.\r\n1. Links to issues, pull requests or commits in the repository using GitHub short links will be rewritten so they continue to point the original repository. \r\n1. Every commit will be appended with a link to the original commit it was mapped from.\r\n\r\nThe actual contents of the commit though will be updated to match the new directory layout of the dotnet/runtime repository.","Url":"https://github.com/dotnet/announcements/issues/133","RelatedDescription":"Open issue \"Repository Consolidation Timeline\" (#133)"},{"Id":"513963125","IsPullRequest":false,"CreatedAt":"2019-10-29T14:32:55","Actor":"mthalman","Number":"132","RawContent":null,"Title":"Release of Alpine 3.10 Docker images","State":"open","Body":"# .NET Core Alpine Docker images updated to Alpine 3.10\r\n\r\nDocker images for .NET Core have been released that support Alpine 3.10.

With [.NET Standard 2.0](https://devblogs.microsoft.com/dotnet/announcing-net-standard-2-0/), we tried to make it much more viable to share code between .NET Framework, .NET Core, and Xamarin which resulted in approximately 38K .NET Frameworks APIs being available in .NET Core 2.0. We also built the [Windows Compatibility Pack](https://devblogs.microsoft.com/dotnet/announcing-the-windows-compatibility-pack-for-net-core/) which made another 21K .NET Framework APIs available to .NET Core, resulting in almost 60K additional APIs. And in .NET Core 3.0 we added WPF and WinForms, which increased the number of .NET Framework APIs ported to .NET Core to over 120k, which is more than half of all .NET Framework APIs.\r\n\r\nIt’s also worth pointing out that we added about 62K APIs to .NET Core that don’t exist in .NET Framework. If we compare their total number of APIs, .NET Core has about 80% of the API surface of .NET Framework.\r\n\r\n<p align=\"center\">\r\n<img src=\"https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/5169960/66777114-f8db7c80-ee7c-11e9-9161-acfe1c491586.png\" width=\"600\" align=\"center\">\r\n</p>\r\n\r\nWe announced that the [future of .NET](https://devblogs.microsoft.com/dotnet/net-core-is-the-future-of-net/) will be based on .NET Core. And at Build 2019, [Scott Hunter stated](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZlO1utbB2GQ&t=54m20s) that AppDomains, remoting, Web Forms, WCF server, and Windows Workflow won’t be ported to .NET Core.\r\n\r\nWith .NET Core 3.0, we’re at the point where we’ve ported all technologies that are required for modern workloads, be that desktop apps, mobile apps, console apps, web sites, or cloud services. That’s not to say that we don’t have any gaps or opportunities for new technologies, but we generally believe we won’t be finding them in the .NET Framework code base anymore. Moving forward, we’re focusing our resources on incorporating new technologies.\r\n\r\nSimultaneously, we’re looking into releasing more of the [.NET Framework code base under the MIT license](https://github.com/microsoft/referencesource) on GitHub to allow the community to create OSS projects for technologies we’re not intending to bring to .NET Core. For example, there already are community projects for [CoreWF](https://github.com/UiPath/corewf) and [CoreWCF](https://github.com/CoreWCF/CoreWCF).\r\n\r\nWe’d like to thank everyone who filed issues with requests for APIs being ported.

While this is still work in progress, we'd like to give you an update on where we are.\r\n\r\nSo far, we've identified the following repos:\r\n\r\n* dotnet/**runtime**\r\n\t- Will contain [coreclr](https://github.com/dotnet/coreclr), [corefx](https://github.com/dotnet/corefx), [core-setup](https://github.com/dotnet/core-setup), [aspnet/Extensions](https://github.com/aspnet/Extensions), and some of [mono/mono](https://github.com/mono/mono)\r\n* [dotnet/**sdk**](https://github.com/dotnet/sdk)\r\n\t- Will contain [toolset](https://github.com/dotnet/toolset), [sdk](https://github.com/dotnet/sdk), [cli](https://github.com/dotnet/cli)\r\n* dotnet/**installer**\r\n\t- Renamed from [core-sdk](https://github.com/dotnet/core-sdk)\r\n* dotnet/**aspnetcore**\r\n\t- Moved from [aspnet/AspNetCore](https://github.com/aspnet/AspNetCore) and will also contain [aspnet/AspNetCore-Tooling](https://github.com/aspnet/AspNetCore-Tooling)\r\n* dotnet/**efcore**\r\n\t- Moved from [aspnet/EntityFrameworkCore](https://github.com/aspnet/EntityFrameworkCore)\r\n* [dotnet/**winforms**](https://github.com/dotnet/winforms)\r\n\t- Unchanged, but listed for clarity \r\n* [dotnet/**wpf**](https://github.com/dotnet/wpf)\r\n\t- Unchanged, but listed for clarity\r\n\r\n### Name changes\r\n\r\nYou might notice that we changed our mind on naming from our [earlier announcement][ann]. Based on your feedback, we decided to go with **dotnet/runtime** instead of **dotnet/platform** and **dotnet/sdk** instead of **dotnet/cli**.\r\n\r\nSeveral people pointed out that the previous names weren't relatable to how we talk about the product, for example on download pages. So, we decided to match the product distributions as the primary design point for the new names. We generally refer to the bits you need to run your app as *the runtime* and the bits you need to build apps as *the SDK*. This also matches the naming chosen by other platforms.\r\n\r\n### New repos can't be used for .NET Core 3.x or earlier\r\n\r\nThe consolidated repositories are going to be about .NET 5 and going forward. It will not be possible to build .NET Core 3.1 or earlier from these repositories. As such, only the master branch from each of the repositories will be brought forward. There will be no porting of the individual release branches in the source repositories.\r\n\r\n### Personal names and email addresses\r\n\r\nSince we're planning on rebasing the history in the merged repositories, we can map your name and email address to new values as well. We primarily do this to support our friends in the LGBTQ+ community who have changed their names to reflect their identities. However, anybody is welcome to use this to change their email and name.\r\n\r\nWhatever your reason might be: we value your contributions and we hope this small gesture makes your life a little bit better. So if you changed your name/email – or simply prefer us to use different values – please [submit a request](mailto:dotnet@microsoft.com&subject=.NET%20repo%20consolidation%3A%20request%20for%20name%20change&body=Hey%2C%20%0A%0AI%E2%80%99d%20like%20to%20change%20my%20email%2Fdisplay%20name%20in%20the%20consolidated%20repo%20from%20%0A%0A%20%20%20%20%20%20%20%20My%20Old%20Name%20%3Cold.me%40example.org%3E%20%0A%0Ato%20%0A%0A%20%20%20%20%20%20%20%20My%20New%20Name%20%3Cnew.me%40example.org%3E%20%0A%0AThanks%21%20%0A).\r\n\r\n### More is coming\r\n\r\nWe'll share more updates in the upcoming months.
