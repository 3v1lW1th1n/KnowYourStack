However in some instances a developer may want to load the object through a name reference rather than a type reference so as to facilitate \"Interface\" based DI. In Spring IoC a object can be wired based on Type or Name. It would be handy to do the same in Ng in conjuction with the 'provideIn' property. Currently the only way to do this is by registering 2 providers for the same Injectable.\r\n\r\n```\r\n@NgModule( {\r\n    imports: [\r\n    ],\r\n    providers: [\r\n        AppUserApiService,\r\n        { provide: 'AppUserApiService', useExisting: AppUserApiService },\r\n    ]\r\n}\r\n```\r\nRegistering an injectable as above allows you to get a reference to the Injector object and retreieve the service by name,\r\n```\r\nlet objectApiService : IAbstractService = this.injector.get('AppUserApiService ');\r\n```\r\n### Describe the solution you'd like\r\n<!-- ✍️--> If we added a new property called \"name\" to the @Injectable annotation that would tell the DI system to define a second string based reference to the injectable then we would do away with the need to define that second reference explicitly in a module .\r\n\r\n```\r\n@Injectable(\r\nprovidedIn:'XXX',\r\nname:'AppUserApiService'\r\n)\r\nexport class AppUserApiService extends IAbstractService<AppUser> {\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\n### Describe alternatives you've considered\r\n<!-- ✍️--> \r\nThe ability to provide a second  configuration for a injectable service is available but requires explicit registration in a module. Using the provideIn property excludes the ability to reference the Injectable by name.","Url":"https://github.com/angular/angular/issues/36848","RelatedDescription":"Open issue \"Enhance the @Injectable annotation to allow developers to configure a string based name that can be used to load the object\" (#36848)"},{"Id":"608725593","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2020-04-29T02:01:04","Actor":"sonukapoor","Number":"36847","RawContent":null,"Title":"Service worker invalid resource","State":"open","Body":"## PR Checklist\r\nPlease check if your PR fulfills the following requirements:\r\n\r\n- [X] The commit message follows our guidelines: https://github.com/angular/angular/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md#commit\r\n- [X] Tests for the changes have been added (for bug fixes / features)\r\n- [ ] Docs have been added / updated (for bug fixes / features)\r\n\r\n\r\n## PR Type\r\nWhat kind of change does this PR introduce?\r\n\r\n<!-- Please check the one that applies to this PR using \"x\". -->\r\n\r\n- [X] Bugfix\r\n- [ ] Feature\r\n- [ ] Code style update (formatting, local variables)\r\n- [ ] Refactoring (no functional changes, no api changes)\r\n- [ ] Build related changes\r\n- [ ] CI related changes\r\n- [ ] Documentation content changes\r\n- [ ] angular.io application / infrastructure changes\r\n- [ ] Other...

The behavior was broken in 0.7.0, but did not exist in 0.6. It continues to be broken in the latest builds of zone.js.\r\n\r\n### Description\r\n\r\nzone.js is published as a UMD module, but does not correctly call `define()` when in an AMD environment.\r\n\r\nThe [AMD spec](https://github.com/amdjs/amdjs-api) defines the behavior of AMD modules. The UMD module format is a wrapper around AMD that checks whether a library is running in an AMD-compatible environment (with `window.define` present). If in such an environment, it calls `define(factory)`.\r\n\r\nThe AMD spec calls for a module's [factory function](https://github.com/amdjs/amdjs-api/blob/master/AMD.md#factory-) to provide a value for the module. This can be done in one of two ways:\r\n\r\n1. The factory function is given an `exports` object, which it modifies with the modules exports. [spec](https://github.com/amdjs/amdjs-api/blob/master/AMD.md#using-require-and-exports)\r\n2. The factory function may return a value, which is used as the AMD module. [spec](https://github.com/amdjs/amdjs-api/blob/master/AMD.md#factory-)\r\n\r\n**zone.js does neither of those things**, which results in AMD loaders not having the ZoneJS module available as an export.\r\n\r\n\"*But zone.js is always a global variable - it should never be used as an AMD module*\"\r\n\r\nI agree that ZoneJS should always create a global variable. However, by bundling to UMD it is saying that it is also a valid AMD module. As such, it should follow the AMD spec by providing that global variable as the exported value of its AMD module.\r\n\r\nTwo options to fix:\r\n\r\n1. Change zone.js to not compile to UMD, but to iife. This can be done with rollup's `output.format` option.\r\n2. Change zone.js to properly invoke `define()` as an AMD module, by returning the Zone function from its `factory` function\r\n\r\n^ Either option would be great\r\n\r\n## 🔬 Minimal Reproduction\r\n\r\nhttps://codesandbox.io/s/serverless-dawn-lotul?file=/index.html\r\n\r\n## 🔥 Exception or Error\r\n\r\n`TypeError: Cannot read property 'subscribe' of undefined`\r\n\r\nOriginal discussion about the error: https://stackoverflow.com/questions/53466406/angular-7-ssr-problems-with-ngzone\r\n\r\n## 🌍  Your Environment\r\n\r\n**Angular Version:**\r\nzone.js@0.10.3\r\nAngular versions irrelevant, since Angular is not required to demonstrate this bug\r\n\r\n**Anything else relevant?**\r\nApplies to any browser and any AMD loader (not just SystemJS)","Url":"https://github.com/angular/angular/issues/36827","RelatedDescription":"Open issue \"zone.js is not loadable as an AMD library\" (#36827)"},{"Id":"607969034","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2020-04-28T02:07:00","Actor":"ayazhafiz","Number":"36826","RawContent":null,"Title":"feat(compiler): add name spans for property reads and method calls","State":"open","Body":"ASTs for property read and method calls contain information about\r\nthe entire span of the expression, including its receiver.

Most commonly, developers may use `ngOnInit()` to subscribe to an `Observable`, but they should also unsubscribe in `ngOnDestory()`. If they forget to do this, they will not receive any error in testing or at runtime, but will have a potential memory leak and use unnecessary resources.\r\n\r\n### Describe the solution you'd like\r\nThe two solutions I can think of, include:\r\n\r\n* A conformance test for all components to assert that after the component is destroyed, there should not be any active `Observable` subscriptions.\r\n    * `TestBed.configureTestingModule()` could perhaps add this assertion to the end of all tests? Or maybe some other `addAngularConformanceTests()` could be added somewhere in the test file.\r\n    * This way, everyone implicitly tests for this invariant without thinking about it.\r\n    * Downside is that this only really works for components.\r\n* Some kind of `expectNoActiveSubscriptions();`\r\n    * This would allow users to test services and other non-component code.\r\n    * Users must manually add this assertion and remember to test for it.\r\n    * Not sure the best way of pointing the user to the offending `Observable`. Maybe some O(n) check for the class under test (or all injectable objects) to see if the `Observable` is still referenced somewhere?\r\n\r\nI'm not sure the best way of actually implementing either of these. The only way I can think of is spying on `Observable.prototype.subscribe()` and `Observable.prototype.unsubscribe()`, which is a pretty hacky solution to the problem. It might be worth a FR to RxJS to support this use case more explicitly.\r\n\r\n### Describe alternatives you've considered\r\nI think the current workaround is to spy on `Observable.prototype.{,un}subscribe()` manually. I think https://github.com/awerlang/observable-profiler can do this, though it requires more work for the user.\r\n\r\n### Links to users asking for this feature\r\n[b/155107643](http://b/155107643)\r\nhttps://stackoverflow.com/questions/54588424/how-to-test-is-all-subscription-unsubscribed-in-angular\r\nhttps://stackoverflow.com/questions/52364687/how-do-i-unit-test-unsubscribe-in-angular-and-jasmine","Url":"https://github.com/angular/angular/issues/36824","RelatedDescription":"Open issue \"Assert all `Observables` unsubscribed\" (#36824)"},{"Id":"607876554","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2020-04-27T21:48:43","Actor":"rockument69","Number":"36823","RawContent":null,"Title":"[WIP] docs: Refactor-homepage-architecture","State":"open","Body":"Home page does not adequately describe the reasons for a developer to use Angular,\r\nand there are no code samples.\r\nIssue Number: DOCS-696\r\nThe home page now includes new key points to describe reasons for using Angular,\r\nand a highlighted code sample.\r\n\r\n## PR Checklist\r\nPlease check if your PR fulfills the following requirements:\r\n\r\n- [x] The commit message follows our guidelines: https://github.com/angular/angular/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md#commit\r\n- [ ] Tests for the changes have been added (for bug fixes / features)\r\n- [ ] Docs have been added / updated (for bug fixes / features)\r\n\r\n\r\n## PR Type\r\nWhat kind of change does this PR introduce?\r\n\r\n<!-- Please check the one that applies to this PR using \"x\". -->\r\n\r\n- [ ] Bugfix\r\n- [ ] Feature\r\n- [ ] Code style update (formatting, local variables)\r\n- [ ] Refactoring (no functional changes, no api changes)\r\n- [ ] Build related changes\r\n- [ ] CI related changes\r\n- [x] Documentation content changes\r\n- [ ] angular.io application / infrastructure changes\r\n- [ ] Other...

I am using 8.2.14 at the moment.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Is this a regression?\r\nI don't know as this is the first version I have used.\r\n\r\n### Description\r\nIf I use the object notation on an element using [ngClass] like so:\r\n\r\n`<ul [ngClass]=\"{'hidden': activeLoc}\">`\r\n\r\n`activeLoc` is a number in my case. In some cases it is undefined.\r\n\r\nIE 11 reports a very vague error saying `Object expected` and after I dug around in the stack trace it pointed to this function in vendor-es5.js on line 82596 (I know that line number will be different for other folk). This error causes the rest of the application not to work by the way.\r\n\r\n```\r\n    function iterateListLike$1(obj, fn) {\r\n      if (Array.isArray(obj)) {\r\n        for (var i = 0; i < obj.length; i++) {\r\n          fn(obj[i]);\r\n        }\r\n      } else {\r\n        /** @type {?} */\r\n        var iterator = obj[getSymbolIterator()]();\r\n        /** @type {?} */\r\n\r\n        var item;\r\n\r\n        while (!(item = iterator.next()).done) {\r\n          fn(item.value);\r\n        }\r\n      }\r\n    }\r\n```\r\nI ended up adding a console log in this vendor file to see what `obj` was and the stack trace in IE11 was an object with a 'hidden': undefined property in it. The fix for me was to use a ternary function. After I did this and rebuilt, the error went away in IE 11.\r\n\r\n`<ul [ngClass]=\"(activeLoc) ? 'hidden' : ''\">`\r\n\r\n\r\n## 🔥 Exception or Error\r\n<pre><code>\r\nERROR TypeError: Object expected\r\n</code></pre>\r\n\r\nThen after expanding the stack says:\r\n<pre><code>\r\nTypeError: Object expected at iterateListLike$1 on line 82596\r\n</code></pre>\r\n\r\n## 🌍  Your Environment\r\n```\r\nAngular CLI: 8.3.25\r\nNode: 12.4.0\r\nOS: darwin x64\r\nAngular: 8.2.14\r\n... animations, common, compiler, compiler-cli, core, elements\r\n... forms, language-service, platform-browser\r\n... platform-browser-dynamic, router\r\n\r\nPackage                           Version\r\n-----------------------------------------------------------\r\n@angular-devkit/architect         0.803.25\r\n@angular-devkit/build-angular     0.803.25\r\n@angular-devkit/build-optimizer   0.803.25\r\n@angular-devkit/build-webpack     0.803.25\r\n@angular-devkit/core              8.3.25\r\n@angular-devkit/schematics        8.3.25\r\n@angular/cli                      8.3.25\r\n@ngtools/webpack                  8.3.25\r\n@schematics/angular               8.3.25\r\n@schematics/update                0.803.25\r\nrxjs                              6.5.4\r\ntypescript                        3.5.3\r\nwebpack                           4.39.2\r\n```\r\n","Url":"https://github.com/angular/angular/issues/36817","RelatedDescription":"Open issue \"[ngClass] object notation causes Object Expected error in IE11 breaking the app.\" (#36817)"}],"ResultType":"GitHubIssue"},"AngularCli-Issues":{"Issues":[{"Id":"608782800","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2020-04-29T05:12:28","Actor":"renovate[bot]","Number":"17571","RawContent":null,"Title":"build: update style-loader to version 1.2.1","State":"open","Body":"This PR contains the following updates:\n\n| Package | Type | Update | Change |\n|---|---|---|---|\n| [style-loader](https://togithub.com/webpack-contrib/style-loader) | dependencies | patch | [`1.2.0` -> `1.2.1`](https://renovatebot.com/diffs/npm/style-loader/1.2.0/1.2.1) |\n\n---\n\n### Release Notes\n\n<details>\n<summary>webpack-contrib/style-loader</summary>\n\n### [`v1.2.1`](https://togithub.com/webpack-contrib/style-loader/blob/master/CHANGELOG.md#&#8203;121-httpsgithubcomwebpack-contribstyle-loadercomparev120v121-2020-04-28)\n\n[Compare Source](https://togithub.com/webpack-contrib/style-loader/compare/v1.2.0...v1.2.1)\n\n</details>\n\n---\n\n### Renovate configuration\n\n:date: **Schedule**: \"after 10pm every weekday,before 4am every weekday,every weekend\" in timezone America/Tijuana.\n\n:vertical_traffic_light: **Automerge**: Disabled by config.

Also, there’s now [an example](https://togithub.com/puppeteer/puppeteer/blob/master/examples/cross-browser.js) showing how to launch Firefox with Puppeteer.\n-   File uploads are generally more reliable ([#&#8203;5363](https://togithub.com/puppeteer/puppeteer/issues/5363)) and `elementHandle.uploadFile(...filePaths)` now triggers a `change` event, matching the old behavior in Puppeteer v1.20.0. ([#&#8203;5389](https://togithub.com/puppeteer/puppeteer/issues/5389))\n-   Node.js v8.x.x is no longer supported. ([#&#8203;5136](https://togithub.com/puppeteer/puppeteer/issues/5136))\n\n#### Behind the scenes\n\n-   Puppeteer is migrating to TypeScript. Although this doesn't affect the way developers can consume Puppeteer, it improves the quality of the Puppeteer type definitions which can be used by modern editors.\n-   Our custom test runner framework has been removed in favor of Mocha, reducing maintenance overhead.\n-   Our CI setup and the way we deal with test flakiness is being reworked in order to increase our confidence of landing PRs without breaking anything.\n\n#### Raw notes\n\n[`6760b92`](https://togithub.com/puppeteer/puppeteer/commit/6760b92) -

Our library uses the `crypto` API which is not implemented in `jsdom`, so we need a shim for this API. We did it as it's indicated in its docs:\r\n\r\n```js\r\nconst dom = new JSDOM(`<p>Hello</p>`, {\r\n  beforeParse(window) {\r\n    window.document.childNodes.length === 0;\r\n    window.someCoolAPI = () => { /* ... */ };\r\n  }\r\n});\r\n```\r\nLuckely the `karma-json-launcher` offers the posibility to configure the `jsdom` instance throught `karma.conf.js` file:\r\n\r\n```js\r\n// karma.conf.js\r\nconst jsdom = require(\"jsdom\");\r\n \r\nmodule.exports = function(config) {\r\n  config.set({\r\n    browsers: ['jsdom'],\r\n    jsdomLauncher: {\r\n      jsdom: {\r\n        beforeParse(window) {\r\n          window.someCoolAPI = () => { /* ... */ };\r\n        }\r\n      }\r\n    }\r\n  });\r\n};\r\n```\r\nThe karma plugin creates the jsdom [instance correctly](https://github.com/badeball/karma-jsdom-launcher/blob/3c364d8988a7a1bc8d4687ec76810cb530adfffe/index.js#L28-L40) with the passed options, and it tries to parse the url where karma is running. But unfortunalety the `someCoolAPI` is not present in test context inside `window` property and test fails with a `ReferenceError: someCoolAPI is not defined`\r\n\r\nOn the other hand, when you try to manually create your own `jsdom` instance (same way `karma-json-launcher does`), with `someCoolAPI` polyfill, and parse any html document which use that API inside  it works, jsdom parses the document and the scripst are executed correctly, so that makes me think is not a `jsdom` or `karma-jsdom-launcher` problem. Can be an issue with the CLI, or Karma itself?\r\n\r\n\r\n## 🔬 Minimal Reproduction\r\n<!--\r\nSimple steps to reproduce this bug.\r\n\r\nPlease include: commands run (including args), packages added, related code changes.\r\n\r\nIf reproduction steps are not enough for reproduction of your issue, please create a minimal GitHub repository with the reproduction of the issue. \r\nA good way to make a minimal reproduction is to create a new app via `ng new repro-app` and add the minimum possible code to show the problem. \r\nShare the link to the repo below along with step-by-step instructions to reproduce the problem, as well as expected and actual behavior.\r\n\r\nIssues that don't have enough info and can't be reproduced will be closed.\r\n\r\nYou can read more about issue submission guidelines here: https://github.com/angular/angular-cli/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md#-submitting-an-issue\r\n-->\r\n1.\r\n```sh\r\n$ ng new foo\r\n$ cd foo\r\n$ npm install karma-jsdom-launcher jsdom\r\n```\r\n2. Configure `angular.json` file as @badeball indicates [here ](https://github.com/badeball/karma-jsdom-launcher#i-am-using-angular-cli-and-the-test-suite-hangs-indefinitely) due to #11561 and #13580\r\n3. Configure `karma.config.js` file as `karma-jsdom-launcher` docs indicates:\r\n```js\r\n// karma.config.js\r\n...\r\nplugins: [\r\n  ....\r\n  require('karma-jsdom-launcher'),\r\n  ....\r\n],\r\n...\r\nbrowsers: ['jsdom'],\r\njsdomLauncher: {\r\n  jsdom: {\r\n    beforeParse(window) {\r\n        window.someCoolAPI = () => { /* ... */ };\r\n     }\r\n  }\r\n},\r\n...\r\n```\r\n4.
