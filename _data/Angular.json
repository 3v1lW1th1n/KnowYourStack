In order for an event to be successfully reported, the event must meet at least one of two criteria:\r\n1. The event explicitly contains context.reportLocation, or\r\n2. The event contains a message with a properly formatted stack trace.\r\n\r\nFor JavaScript, the endpoint expects the message to \"be the value of [error.stack](https://github.com/v8/v8/wiki/Stack-Trace-API) as returned by V8.\"\r\n\r\nWhen sending the zone.js rewritten stack as the message for an event, stackdriver responds with:\r\n```\r\n{\r\n  \"error\": {\r\n    \"code\": 400,\r\n    \"message\": \"ReportedErrorEvent.context must contain a location unless `message` contain an exception or stacktrace.\",\r\n    \"status\": \"INVALID_ARGUMENT\"\r\n  }\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nIf instead I send error.originalStack as the message, the response is 200 and the event is reported.\r\n\r\nWhile there's no issue here that cannot be worked around, I think it's an unexpected gotcha that you cannot use error.stack in the message, particularly because this process of rewriting the stack isn't particularly easy to find in documentation.\r\n\r\n## üî¨ Minimal Reproduction\r\nAvailable by request.

When Ivy is enabled the `AngularCompilerPlugin` runs the `NgccProcessor` which is supposed to compile the `node_modules` for Ivy on the first run, however in my case any subsequent builds are slowed down as well.\r\n\r\nI have a hacky way to disable the `NgccProcessor` which I've used to measure the differences in build times. Here's what it looks like:\r\n\r\n```ts\r\nclass MyAngularCompilerPlugin extends AngularCompilerPlugin {\r\n    public apply(compiler: Compiler): void {\r\n        super.apply(compiler);\r\n        \r\n        compiler.hooks.environment.tap('angular-compiler', () => {\r\n            (this as any)._compilerHost.ngccProcessor = undefined;\r\n        });\r\n    }\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nHere are the timings for 5 production builds on my own machine. Note that these times **are after `ngcc` has been run once** over the `node_modules` in a `postinstall` script. \r\n\r\n```\r\n// Without ngcc (80737ms on average)\r\n84520ms\r\n72547ms\r\n81733ms\r\n85043ms\r\n79844ms\r\n------------------------\r\n// With ngcc (94208ms on average)\r\n93741ms\r\n93714ms\r\n92922ms\r\n97220ms\r\n93444ms\r\n```\r\n\r\nThe 15s slower build time for a production build isn't a big deal locally, however the difference becomes even larger when running it on our CI server. For our production builds we need to run about 30 Webpack builds (10 at a time in parallel), about 20 which go through the `AngularCompilerPlugin`. Disabling the `NgccProcessor` on our CI server reduced our build time from around **10 minutes to about 6 minutes**. Furthermore keeping the `NgccProcessor` led to some flakiness in our builds, presumably because 10 different `ngcc` processes were trying to access file at the same time. Our build script looks something like this:\r\n\r\n1. Run `npm ci`.\r\n2. Run `ngcc` programmatically as follows:\r\n```ts\r\nconst ngcc = require('@angular/compiler-cli/ngcc');\r\nngcc.process({\r\n    basePath: path.join(projectRoot, 'node_modules'),\r\n    compileAllFormats: false,\r\n    propertiesToConsider: ['browser', 'module', 'main'],\r\n    createNewEntryPointFormats: true\r\n});\r\n```\r\n3. Run `webpack --mode=production` 30 times by splitting them into chunks of 10 that are run concurrently. We have some logic that tries to make sure that we always run the maximum number of builds, but it stays the same no matter whether `ngcc` is enabled so it shouldn't have an effect on the times.\r\n\r\nI can see a couple of ways to get around this:\r\n\r\n1. Short term: add an option to the `AngularCompilerPlugin` config that allows users that know what they're doing to disable the `NgccProcessor`.\r\n2. Long term: rework either `ngcc` or `NgccProcessor` so that it doesn't have to spend time analyzing the `node_modules` after it has been run already.\r\n\r\ncc @filipesilva \r\n","Url":"https://github.com/angular/angular-cli/issues/15078","RelatedDescription":"Closed issue \"NgccProcessor slowing down subsequent builds with AngularCompilerPlugin\" (#15078)"},{"Id":"468717668","IsPullRequest":false,"CreatedAt":"2019-07-16T17:06:10","Actor":"fareshan","Number":"15094","RawContent":null,"Title":"mime types are not set with version 8","State":"closed","Body":"#14468 üêû Bug report\r\n\r\n### Command (mark with an `x`)\r\n<!-- Can you pin-point the command or commands that are effected by this bug? -->\r\n<!-- ‚úçÔ∏èedit: -->\r\n```\r\n- [ ] new\r\n- [X] build\r\n- [ ] serve\r\n- [ ] test\r\n- [ ] e2e\r\n- [ ] generate\r\n- [ ] add\r\n- [ ] update\r\n- [ ] lint\r\n- [ ] xi18n\r\n- [ ] run\r\n- [ ] config\r\n- [ ] help\r\n- [ ] version\r\n- [ ] doc\r\n```\r\n\r\n### Is this a regression?\r\nI had this issue after upgrading from angular 7 to 8\r\n\r\n### Description\r\nIn previous version, the generated JS files were indexed in index.html like this:\r\n```\r\n<script type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"runtime.xxx.js\"></script>\r\n```\r\nNow, I am getting it without the mime-types:\r\n```\r\n<script src=\"runtime.xxx.js\"></script>\r\n```\r\n\r\nAnd this is giving this error in the browser:\r\nMIME type ('text/html') is not executable, and strict MIME type checking is enabled\r\n\r\n\r\n## üî¨ Minimal Reproduction\r\nng build --prod\r\n\r\n## üî• Exception or Error\r\n<pre><code>\r\nMIME type ('text/html') is not executable, and strict MIME type checking is enabled\r\n</code></pre>\r\n\r\n\r\n## üåç Your Environment\r\n<pre><code>\r\nAngular CLI: 8.1.1\r\nNode: 10.16.0\r\nOS: darwin x64\r\nAngular: 8.1.1\r\n... animations, cli, common, compiler, compiler-cli, core, forms\r\n... language-service, platform-browser, platform-browser-dynamic\r\n... router, service-worker\r\n\r\nPackage                           Version\r\n-----------------------------------------------------------\r\n@angular-devkit/architect         0.801.1\r\n@angular-devkit/build-angular     0.801.1\r\n@angular-devkit/build-optimizer   0.801.1\r\n@angular-devkit/build-webpack     0.801.1\r\n@angular-devkit/core              8.1.1\r\n@angular-devkit/schematics        8.1.1\r\n@angular/http                     7.2.15\r\n@angular/pwa                      0.801.1\r\n@ngtools/webpack                  8.1.1\r\n@schematics/angular               8.1.1\r\n@schematics/update                0.801.1\r\nrxjs                              6.5.2\r\ntypescript                        3.4.5\r\nwebpack                           4.35.2\r\n</code></pre>\r\n","Url":"https://github.com/angular/angular-cli/issues/15094","RelatedDescription":"Closed issue \"mime types are not set with version 8\" (#15094)"},{"Id":"468467962","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2019-07-16T16:58:44","Actor":"alan-agius4","Number":"15090","RawContent":null,"Title":"fix(@schematics/angular): add commonjs module to universal tsconfig","State":"closed","Body":"The universal tsconfig extends the application tsconfig which by default it's module format is ES2015.

With this setup it means that both `CdkNestedTreeNode` and `MatNestedTreeNode` are trying to write to the same `nodeOutlet` property and it's by pure coincidence that it works. This is very fragile and it isn't guaranteed to work in future versions of the framework.\r\n\r\nThese changes fix the issue by removing the query from the `MatNestedTreeNode` and providing the `MatTreeNodeOutlet` as a `CdkTreeNodeOutlet` so that the query on the `CdkNestedTreeNode` can pick it up.\r\n\r\ncc @pkozlowski-opensource ","Url":"https://github.com/angular/components/pull/16540","RelatedDescription":"Open PR \"refactor(tree): avoid improper query usage\" (#16540)"},{"Id":"468814951","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2019-07-16T19:06:12","Actor":"jelbourn","Number":"16539","RawContent":null,"Title":"chore: bump version to 8.1.1 w/ changelog","State":"closed","Body":"","Url":"https://github.com/angular/components/pull/16539","RelatedDescription":"Closed or merged PR \"chore: bump version to 8.1.1 w/ changelog\" (#16539)"},{"Id":"468800835","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2019-07-16T18:41:26","Actor":"devversion","Number":"16538","RawContent":null,"Title":"fix(ng-update): material update fails due to circular dependency","State":"closed","Body":"Currently running `ng update` for both Material and CDK fails because there\r\nis a circular dependency in the CDK schematics that cause the update-tool\r\nexports to be not available to the Material ng-update schematic.\r\n\r\nWithout putting to much effort into ensuring no circular dependencies, this\r\ncommit also sets up Madge to avoid such issues in the future.\r\n\r\n![test](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/4987015/61322266-8d4a2a80-a80d-11e9-86ce-440941bd26ac.png)\r\n","Url":"https://github.com/angular/components/pull/16538","RelatedDescription":"Closed or merged PR \"fix(ng-update): material update fails due to circular dependency\" (#16538)"},{"Id":"468529376","IsPullRequest":false,"CreatedAt":"2019-07-16T18:26:46","Actor":"RunfastCoder","Number":"16531","RawContent":null,"Title":"Mat-tab-group arrows","State":"closed","Body":"There is a problem with Mat-tab-group arrows and virtual keyboard (when using it on phone)\r\nThe arrows are not showing after the virtual keyboard is open.\r\n\r\nAny idea how to fix it ?\r\n\r\nThanks.","Url":"https://github.com/angular/components/issues/16531","RelatedDescription":"Closed issue \"Mat-tab-group arrows\" (#16531)"},{"Id":"468791692","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2019-07-16T18:06:45","Actor":"Aboisier","Number":"16537","RawContent":null,"Title":"fix(drag-drop): fix drag start delay behavior to allow scrolling (#16224)","State":"open","Body":"I tried fixing the scrolling issue on mobile devices with my previous PR (#16228), but it did not work on iOS.

In order to allow the tracking of multiple things at the same time, you can pass a `key?: string | symbol | object` argument to `isLoading$()` which customizes the returned observable to only track the loading of \"loading things\" also associated with that key.\r\n\r\nFor example:\r\n\r\n```ts\r\n// get Observable<boolean> to track loading associated with the \"create-user\" key\r\nconst loadingObservable = this.isLoadingService.isLoading$({key: 'create-user'})\r\n// => loadingObservable initially emits false\r\n\r\nisLoadingService.add({key: 'create-user'})\r\n// => loadingObservable emits true\r\n\r\nisLoadingService.remove({key: 'create-user'})\r\n// => loadingObservable emits false\r\n\r\nisLoadingService.add(subscription, {key: 'create-user'})\r\n// => loadingObservable emits true and then emits false when `subscription` closes\r\n\r\nisLoadingService.add(promise, {key: 'create-user'})\r\n// => loadingObservable emits true and then emits false when `promise` resolves\r\n\r\nisLoadingService.add({key: 'create-user'})\r\n// => loadingObservable emits true\r\nisLoadingService.add({key: 'create-user'})\r\nisLoadingService.remove({key: 'create-user'})\r\nisLoadingService.remove({key: 'create-user'})\r\n// => loadingObservable emits false\r\n\r\n// etc\r\n```\r\n\r\nBy adding a service like this one to `@angular/cdk`, a follow up PR could also add a directive which integrates with the service and which simplifies the process of, say, styling or disabling a button while loading requests are in flight.\r\n\r\nFor example, today to accomplish the process of styling/disabling a button you would need to manage a separate `creatingUser` variable in a template. For example:\r\n\r\n```ts\r\n@Component({\r\n  template: `\r\n  <button\r\n    id=\"create-user-form-button\"\r\n    mat-button\r\n    [ngClass]=\"{'cdk-is-loading': createUser}\"\r\n    [disabled]=\"creatingUser\"\r\n  >\r\n    Submit form\r\n  </button>\r\n  `\r\n})\r\nexport MyComponent {\r\n  creatingUser = false;\r\n\r\n  async submit(data: any) {\r\n    this.creatingUser = true;\r\n    await this.userService.createUser(data);\r\n    this.creatingUser = false;\r\n  }\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nBut a service + directive like this could simply the component down to:\r\n\r\n```ts\r\n@Component({\r\n  template: `\r\n<button\r\n  id=\"create-user-form-button\"\r\n  mat-button\r\n  cdkIsLoading=\"create-user\"\r\n>\r\n  Submit form\r\n</button>\r\n  `\r\n})\r\nexport MyComponent {\r\n  submit(data: any) {\r\n    const promise = this.userService.createUser(data);\r\n\r\n    this.isLoadingService.add(promise, {key: 'create-user'})\r\n  }\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\n#### Use Case\r\n\r\nDisplaying loading indicators is a common need but surprisingly tricky to get right. The issue is that you want an action to trigger a specific type of loading. e.g. \"create-user\" loading or \"page-navigation\" loading. You can also have multiple requests in flight and associated with the same \"create-user\" loading indicator. If multiple \"create-user\" requests are happening, you want the loading indicator to continue displaying until they are all done.\r\n\r\nMost async requests associated with loading will provide an observable or promise value. You want the ability to automatically indicate that loading has stopped when that observable / promise completes.\r\n\r\nOther loading instances are more complex, and you want the ability to manually indicate that loading has started or stopped. For example:\r\n\r\n```typescript\r\nthis.router.events\r\n      .pipe(\r\n        filter(\r\n          event =>\r\n            event instanceof NavigationStart ||\r\n            event instanceof NavigationEnd ||\r\n            event instanceof NavigationCancel ||\r\n            event instanceof NavigationError,\r\n        ),\r\n      )\r\n      .subscribe(event => {\r\n        if (event instanceof NavigationStart) {\r\n          this.isLoadingService.add();\r\n          return;\r\n        }\r\n\r\n        this.isLoadingService.remove();\r\n      });\r\n```\r\n\r\n#### Implementation example\r\n\r\nI created a library which implements an API like this: https://gitlab.com/service-work/is-loading. I think it would be valuable if a service like this were simply included in Angular CDK because:\r\n\r\n1. This is addressing a very common need in a generic way.\r\n2. It would be easier for 3rd party libraries to integrate with the service as a peer dependency if it is part of `@angular/cdk`.\r\n3. It would make adoption easier for developers.\r\n","Url":"https://github.com/angular/components/issues/16516","RelatedDescription":"Closed issue \"feat: CDK \"is loading?\" service\" (#16516)"},{"Id":"468238013","IsPullRequest":false,"CreatedAt":"2019-07-15T18:18:24","Actor":"emiber","Number":"16523","RawContent":null,"Title":"mat-slide-toggle labelPossition","State":"closed","Body":"#### Reproduction\r\nSteps to reproduce:\r\n1.
