For more information, contact the package author.\r\n========== Finished ==========\r\nTime Elapsed: 00:00:14.9037093\r\n```\r\n\r\nRight off the gate we can tell NuGet that our `project target` is targeting `MonoAndroid,Version=v6.0`.  Otherwise known as `monoandroid60`. However inside these logs, there is no mention of what `target` is trying to be installed. Ideally I should be able to see that `monoandroid70` is trying to be installed into a project that is currently targeting `monoandroid60`. However to find that information out, I would have to:\r\n\r\n1) Go to the NuGet page: https://www.nuget.org/packages/Xamarin.Android.Support.v4/ \r\n\r\n2) Download the `.nupkg` - https://www.nuget.org/api/v2/package/Xamarin.Android.Support.v4/24.2.1\r\n\r\n3) Extract the `.nupkg`\r\n\r\n4) Go inside the `lib` folder and see this library only supports `MonoAndroid70`.\r\n\r\nNow let's look at the error we get:\r\n\r\n`Could not install package 'Xamarin.Android.Support.Compat 24.2.1'. You are trying to install this package into a project that targets 'MonoAndroid,Version=v6.0', but the package does not contain any assembly references or content files that are compatible with that framework. For more information, contact the package author.`\r\n\r\nThis doesn't really help me at all other than tell me that `MonoAndroid60` is an incorrect target. It also tells me to contact the package author which I think most package authors wouldn't really appreciate over simple installation issues.\r\n\r\n**Proposal:**\r\n\r\nI believe these types of error messages need to be empowered. They need to tell the user a couple of things:\r\n\r\n1) What the project `target` is currently (In this case `monoandroid60`)\r\n\r\n2) What the potential \"to-be-installed\" package `target`(s) were found (In this case `monoandroid70`)\r\n\r\n3) If there is a mismatch of `target`(s), the user should be warned that it will not install in their project as it is not a supported framework.\r\n\r\n4) If the user is warned and proceeds, the error message should be more friendly such as:\r\n\r\n`Could not install package 'Xamarin.Android.Support.Compat 24.2.1' with targets 'MonoAndroid,Version=v7.0'. You are trying to install this package into a project that targets 'MonoAndroid,Version=v6.0', but the package does not contain any assembly references or content files that are compatible with that framework. You may need to change your project that targets 'MonoAndroid,Version=v6.0' to `MonoAndroid,Version=v7.0` for this package to install correctly.  For more information, contact the package author.`\r\n\r\nThis is also a problem in other frameworks, but since I mainly work in Xamarin, I figured the use case would be more appropriate.\r\n\r\n**EDIT 1**\r\n\r\nI did come across a tool that would be somewhat ideal for this situation and explain it better:\r\n\r\nhttp://nugettoolsdev.azurewebsites.net/3.5.0-beta2-1484/framework-compatibility?project=monoandroid60&package=monoandroid70\r\n\r\nFor example in this case, because the project framework is lower than the package framework it is `unsupported`. It would be nice if there's a way to get the `package framework` from metadata so that it's easier to validate these scenarios. I looked through the source code and API docs, but I couldn't figure out a sane way to get the `package framework` that uses the `lib/` structure."},{"Id":"6635430617","Type":"IssuesEvent","CreatedAt":"2017-09-25T22:29:37","Actor":"mistakenot","Repository":"NuGet/Home","Organization":"NuGet","RawContent":null,"RelatedAction":"opened","RelatedUrl":"https://github.com/NuGet/Home/issues/5935","RelatedDescription":"Opened issue \" GetMetadataAsync() throws \"'0.0.0-~3' is not a valid version string\"\" (#5935) at NuGet/Home","RelatedBody":"Retrieving Metadata for particular packages, in this case \"MassTransit.RavenDbIntegration\", causes the .NET client to throw an exception when enumerating the results:\r\n\r\nSystem.ArgumentException occurred\r\n  HResult=-2147024809\r\n  Message='0.0.0-~3' is not a valid version string.\r\n  Source=NuGet.Versioning\r\n  StackTrace:\r\n       at NuGet.Versioning.VersionRange.Parse(String value, Boolean allowFloating)\r\n       at NuGet.Protocol.PackageDependencyGroupConverter.LoadDependency(JToken dependency)\r\n       at System.Linq.Enumerable.WhereSelectEnumerableIterator`2.MoveNext()\r\n       at System.Collections.Generic.List`1..ctor(IEnumerable`1 collection)\r\n       at System.Linq.Enumerable.ToList[TSource](IEnumerable`1 source)\r\n       at NuGet.Protocol.PackageDependencyGroupConverter.ReadJson(JsonReader reader, Type objectType, Object existingValue, JsonSerializer serializer)\r\n       at Newtonsoft.Json.Serialization.JsonSerializerInternalReader.DeserializeConvertable(JsonConverter converter, JsonReader reader, Type objectType, Object existingValue)\r\n       at Newtonsoft.Json.Serialization.JsonSerializerInternalReader.PopulateList(IList list, JsonReader reader, JsonArrayContract contract, JsonProperty containerProperty, String id)\r\n       at Newtonsoft.Json.Serialization.JsonSerializerInternalReader.CreateList(JsonReader reader, Type objectType, JsonContract contract, JsonProperty member, Object existingValue, String id)\r\n       at Newtonsoft.Json.Serialization.JsonSerializerInternalReader.CreateValueInternal(JsonReader reader, Type objectType, JsonContract contract, JsonProperty member, JsonContainerContract containerContract, JsonProperty containerMember, Object existingValue)\r\n       at Newtonsoft.Json.Serialization.JsonSerializerInternalReader.SetPropertyValue(JsonProperty property, JsonConverter propertyConverter, JsonContainerContract containerContract, JsonProperty containerProperty, JsonReader reader, Object target)\r\n       at Newtonsoft.Json.Serialization.JsonSerializerInternalReader.PopulateObject(Object newObject, JsonReader reader, JsonObjectContract contract, JsonProperty member, String id)\r\n       at Newtonsoft.Json.Serialization.JsonSerializerInternalReader.CreateObject(JsonReader reader, Type objectType, JsonContract contract, JsonProperty member, JsonContainerContract containerContract, JsonProperty containerMember, Object existingValue)\r\n       at Newtonsoft.Json.Serialization.JsonSerializerInternalReader.CreateValueInternal(JsonReader reader, Type objectType, JsonContract contract, JsonProperty member, JsonContainerContract containerContract, JsonProperty containerMember, Object existingValue)\r\n       at Newtonsoft.Json.Serialization.JsonSerializerInternalReader.Deserialize(JsonReader reader, Type objectType, Boolean checkAdditionalContent)\r\n       at Newtonsoft.Json.JsonSerializer.DeserializeInternal(JsonReader reader, Type objectType)\r\n       at Newtonsoft.Json.Linq.JToken.ToObject(Type objectType, JsonSerializer jsonSerializer)\r\n       at Newtonsoft.Json.Linq.JToken.ToObject[T](JsonSerializer jsonSerializer)\r\n       at NuGet.Protocol.PackageMetadataResourceV3.ParseMetadata(JObject metadata)...\r\n\r\nCode to repoduce is:\r\n\r\n````\r\nvar resource = _sourceRepository.GetResource<PackageMetadataResource>();\r\nvar metadata = await resource.GetMetadataAsync(id, true, false, new NullLogger(), CancellationToken.None);
