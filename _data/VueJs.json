Open fiddle\r\n2. Click run\r\n\r\n### What is expected?\r\nIn the default function, I access `this.$parent`, which [is listed as an an instance property](https://vuejs.org/v2/api/#Instance-Properties).\r\n\r\nThe [docs about default and validator functions](https://vuejs.org/v2/guide/components-props.html#Prop-Validation) say:\r\n\r\n> Note that props are validated before a component instance is created, so instance properties (e.g. data, computed, etc) will not be available inside default or validator functions.\r\n\r\nTherefore I expected my fiddle to fail.\r\n\r\n### What is actually happening?\r\nThe fiddle works.\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\nI highly appreciate that it works, because that solved [my question I posted on StackOverflow](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/53649690/set-vue-props-default-to-parents-options/53649772#53649772).\r\n\r\nHowever, the docs are misleading. The way it's worded I thought that NO instance property would be available to a default function, but obviously at least `$parent` (I didn't test any other) IS available.\r\n\r\nPlease update the \"default and validator function\" doc section accordingly.\r\n\r\n<!-- generated by vue-issues.

Often, I found it is annoying when I \"time-traveled\", there is a side-effect being performed due to the component life cycle or routing middleware try to do their \"regular\" task... this resulted in a polluted mutation records... Consider the fact that some component can be delayed rendered by `v-if=state` (so components may be mounted/unmounted during time-traveling), the same may also happen if the one uses `@vue/vuex-router-sync`, this feature is good to have.\r\n\r\n### What does the proposed API look like?\r\nWhen we click \"time travel to the state\" in the dev tool, Vuex internally have a mechanism to silent and ignore any dispatch or commit to be performed (or prevent state to be mutated during time-traveling).  This locking mechanism can be unlocked if we decide to either **revert** or **traverse** to the latest state (they are basically the same).  While I have little clue how we are going to implement this or should we have this, after discussed with my colleagues, I think it would be beneficial to open this discussion.\r\n\r\n** the reason I post this here is due to the fact that the devTool have to touch the vuex core if we want to have this.\r\n\r\n<!-- generated by vue-issues.

Overuse string when using `mapState`, `mapGetters`, `mapActions`\r\n2. Duplicated namespace in components\r\n\r\nlike this:\r\n_my-component.vue_ (AS-IS version)\r\n\r\n```js\r\nexport default {\r\n  computed: {\r\n    ...mapState(\"todos\", {\r\n      allItems: ({ items }) => items,\r\n    }),\r\n    ...mapGetters(\"todos\", {\r\n      doneItems: \"doneItems\",\r\n      activeItems: \"activeItems\",\r\n    }),\r\n  }\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nIn this code, `\"doneItmes\"` is written by string. It will cause bug easily.\r\nAnd there are duplicated namespace called `\"todos\"`. It will inhibit maintainabillity.\r\n\r\n### What does the proposed API look like?\r\nThe way to introduce it is not to suggest a new API, but to use the existing API properly.\r\nWe can use `createNamespacedHelpers` API with constants in store directory!\r\n\r\n### Example\r\n\r\n_@/store/todos/types.js_\r\n\r\n```js\r\nexport const NAMESPACE = \"todos\";\r\n```\r\n\r\n_@/store/todos/index.js_\r\n\r\n```js\r\nimport { createNamespacedHelpers } from\"vuex\";\r\nimport { NAMESPACE } from \"./types\";\r\n\r\n// Key point !\r\nconst { mapState, mapGetters, mapActions } = createNamespacedHelpers(NAMESPACE);\r\n\r\nexport { mapState, mapGetters, mapActions };\r\n\r\nexport default { /* namespaced, state, getters, mutations, actions */ }\r\n```\r\n\r\n_@/store/todos/getters.js_\r\n\r\n```js\r\n// Key point !\r\nexport const DONE_ITEMS = \"DONE_ITEMS\";\r\nexport const ACTIVE_ITEMS = \"ACTIVE_ITEMS\";\r\n\r\nexport default {\r\n  [DONE_ITEMS]: state => state.items.filter(todo => todo.isDone),\r\n  [ACTIVE_ITEMS]: state => state.items.filter(todo => !todo.isDone)\r\n};\r\n```\r\n\r\nIf we do this, we can use customized binding helpers.\r\n\r\n_my-component.vue_ (TO-BE version)\r\n\r\n```js\r\nimport * as todos from '@/store/todos'; // Key point !\r\nimport * as getters from '@/store/todos/getters'; // Key point !\r\nimport * as actions from '@/store/todos/types'; // Key point !\r\n\r\nexport default {\r\n  computed: {\r\n    ...todos.mapState({\r\n      allItems: ({ items }) => items,\r\n    }),\r\n    ...todos.mapGetters([\r\n      getters.DONE_ITEMS,\r\n      getters.ACTIVE_ITEMS,\r\n    ])\r\n  },\r\n  methods: {\r\n    ...todos.mapActions([\r\n      actions.ADD_ITEM,\r\n    ]),\r\n  }\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nHow about this? If you do not mind this, I would like to post it on the official Vuex document.\r\nYou can see the all example code in [this repository](https://github.com/JaeYeopHan/vuex-best-practice-lab)\r\n\r\nThanks!\r\n\r\n<!-- generated by vue-issues.
