While Server Core normally isn't suited to run GUI applications, you can install the [**Server Core App Compatibility Feature on Demand (FOD)**](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-server/get-started-19/install-fod-19) package that improves compatibility for GUI applications by installing additional components, including `explorer.exe` (as file browser).\r\n\r\nWhile that package normally also installs the COM components required to show the Vista file dialog, in some cases (e.g. after installing certain Windows Updates) these components can become unavailable again, and the Vista File Dialog will no longer work. \r\n\r\n**Actual behavior:** <!-- callstack for crashes / exceptions -->\r\nWhen the COM components required for the Vista file dialog are not available, calling `OpenFileDialog.ShowDialog()` results in a `COMException` (`CLASS_E_CLASSNOTAVAILABLE`):\r\n\r\n```\r\nSystem.Runtime.InteropServices.COMException (0x80040111): Creating an instance of the COM component with CLSID {DC1C5A9C-E88A-4DDE-A5A1-60F82A20AEF7} from the IClassFactory failed due to the following error: 80040111 ClassFactory cannot supply requested class (0x80040111 (CLASS_E_CLASSNOTAVAILABLE)).\r\n   at System.Windows.Forms.OpenFileDialog.CreateVistaDialog()\r\n   at System.Windows.Forms.FileDialog.RunDialogVista(IntPtr hWndOwner)\r\n   at System.Windows.Forms.FileDialog.RunDialog(IntPtr hWndOwner)\r\n   at System.Windows.Forms.CommonDialog.ShowDialog(IWin32Window owner)\r\n   at System.Windows.Forms.CommonDialog.ShowDialog()\r\n```\r\n\r\nA similar stack occurs for `FolderBrowserDialog.ShowDialog()`:\r\n```\r\nSystem.Runtime.InteropServices.COMException (0x80040111): Creating an instance of the COM component with CLSID {DC1C5A9C-E88A-4DDE-A5A1-60F82A20AEF7} from the IClassFactory failed due to the following error: 80040111 ClassFactory cannot supply requested class (0x80040111 (CLASS_E_CLASSNOTAVAILABLE)).\r\n   at System.Windows.Forms.FolderBrowserDialog.RunDialogVista(IntPtr owner)\r\n   at System.Windows.Forms.FolderBrowserDialog.RunDialog(IntPtr hWndOwner\r\n   at System.Windows.Forms.CommonDialog.ShowDialog(IWin32Window owner)\r\n   at System.Windows.Forms.CommonDialog.ShowDialog()\r\n```\r\n\r\n\r\n**Expected behavior:**\r\nWhen instantiating the COM object fails, I think the dialog should automatically fall back to the legacy file dialog, which seems to be done by most native applications like `notepad.exe` (see repro steps).\r\nThis will allow WinForms applications using a `FileDialog` or `FolderBrowserDialog` to work correctly on Windows Server Core with App Compatibility FOD installed, instead of crashing due to the `COMException`.\r\n\r\n\r\n**Minimal repro:**\r\n* Install Windows Server 2019 (using ISO image from [MS Evaluation Center](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/evalcenter/evaluate-windows-server-2019)), using option `Windows Server 2019 Standard Evaluation` (not with \"Desktop Experience\").\r\n* After installation is finished, install the [Server Core App Compatibility FOD](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-server/get-started-19/install-fod-19) in Powershell with `Add-WindowsCapability -Online -Name ServerCore.AppCompatibility~~~~0.0.1.0`, and then restart the machine.\r\n* On another machine, create a new WinForms app with `dotnet new winforms` and use the following code in `Program.cs`:\r\n```c#\r\nusing System;\r\nusing System.Windows.Forms;\r\n\r\nclass Program\r\n{\r\n    [STAThread]\r\n    static void Main()\r\n    {\r\n        Application.EnableVisualStyles();\r\n        Application.SetCompatibleTextRenderingDefault(false);\r\n\r\n        var dialog = new OpenFileDialog();\r\n        dialog.ShowDialog();\r\n    }\r\n}\r\n```\r\n* Publish the app with `dotnet publish -f netcoreapp5.0 -r win-x64`.\r\n* Copy the published app to the Windows Server machine and run it.\r\n* Notice the file dialog is correctly shown using the Vista file dialog. Also, when you start `notepad.exe` and select `File`->`Open`, it shows the Vista file dialog:\r\n![grafik](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/13289184/70863732-5b1f2f00-1f4b-11ea-9486-b974fc86f084.png)\r\n* Now download and install [`2019-12 Cumulative Update for Windows Server 2019 for x64-based Systems (KB4530715)`](https://www.catalog.update.microsoft.com/Search.aspx?q=KB4530715), and restart the machine.\r\n* Run the app again. Notice it fails with a **`COMException`** (see stacktrace above).\r\n* When running `notepad.exe` and selecting `File`->`Open`, you can see that the legacy file dialog is shown:\r\n![grafik](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/13289184/70863741-8d309100-1f4b-11ea-92cb-b5a6d9cda9cc.png)\r\n\r\n**Workaround**\r\n\r\nYou can work around the issue by catching `COMException` and disabling `AutoUpgradeEnabled`:\r\n```c#\r\n        try\r\n        {\r\n            dialog.ShowDialog();\r\n        }\r\n        catch (COMException) when (dialog.AutoUpgradeEnabled)\r\n        {\r\n            dialog.AutoUpgradeEnabled = false;\r\n            try\r\n            {\r\n                dialog.ShowDialog();\r\n            }\r\n            finally\r\n            {\r\n                dialog.AutoUpgradeEnabled = true;\r\n            }\r\n        }\r\n```\r\n\r\n\r\n","Url":"https://github.com/dotnet/winforms/issues/2506","RelatedDescription":"Open issue \"FileDialog/FolderBrowserDialog should fall back to legacy dialog on COMException\" (#2506)"},{"Id":"538048101","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2019-12-15T13:47:07","Actor":"dotnet-maestro[bot]","Number":"2505","RawContent":null,"Title":"[master] Update dependencies from dotnet/arcade","State":"closed","Body":"This pull request updates the following dependencies\r\n\r\n[marker]: <> (Begin:4d0c844d-0758-4fc5-c1ad-08d6354da8a8)\r\n## From https://github.com/dotnet/arcade\r\n- **Build**: 20191214.1\r\n- **Date Produced**: 12/14/2019 1:54 PM\r\n- **Commit**: 64e95735b49d37b6cf908cfa5228ff65bee6dfff\r\n- **Branch**: refs/heads/master\r\n- **Updates**:\r\n  -

This prevents WinForms work from flowing into [dotnet/windowsdesktop](https://github.com/dotnet/windowsdesktop) and ultimately into [dotnet/core-sdk](https://github.com/dotnet/core-sdk). \r\n\r\nWPF currently ingests `Microsoft.NETCore.App` version `5.0.0-alpha1.19514.1` - this can be seen in the LHS of `eng/Version.Detail.xml` in https://github.com/dotnet/wpf/pull/2118/files. This version comes from WinForms through a `CoherentParentDependency` like this: \r\n\r\n```xml\r\n    <Dependency Name=\"Microsoft.NETCore.App\" Version=\"5.0.0-alpha1.19514.1\" CoherentParentDependency=\"Microsoft.Private.Winforms\">\r\n```\r\n\r\nIf WinForms repo were moved back temporarily to this version of `Microsoft.NETCore.App`, then the packages it would subsequently flow into WPF ought to build cleanly, and then flow all the way to dotnet/windowsdesktop and later onto dotnet/core-sdk. \r\n\r\nOnce WPF gets fixes for C++ compiler and corresponding updates for CoreCLR (which could take a while), WinForms can fast-forward to building against latest versions of CoreFx/CoreCLR. \r\n\r\n\r\n/cc @RussKie, @AdamYoblick, @merriemcgaw \r\n/cc @rladuca
