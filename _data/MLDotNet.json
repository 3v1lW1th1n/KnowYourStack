It exists, as far as I can tell, to give some sort of \"name\" to various types of entry-point nodes. These mostly serve to decorate specific `IComponentFactory` subinterfaces. However, because we need to attach this attribute to a definite type, we have the following implication: that we've littered our codebase with a bunch of interfaces as subinterfaces of `IComponentFactory`, and these exist only so we can attach attributes to them. To take just one example:\r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/dotnet/machinelearning/blob/7e21afa4612ddca53bbf9d67b84df2b58d4636c2/src/Microsoft.ML.Data/Utils/LossFunctions.cs#L84-L87\r\n\r\nThat's fairly obnoxious. From an API user's perspective, this represents a completely pointless complication -- all an API user really wants to do is be able to set a loss function. But because we have this other \"entry point\" thing we also have to work through this generic way to create subcomponents (this `IComponentFactory` thing, which is subideal but possibly OK), but then because we also wanted to attach an attribute to this \"type\" of set of component factories which we did through attributes on the type, which required creating this empty interface that otherwise has no reason to exist -- etc., etc. Anyway, we see that things have piled up.\r\n\r\nWhat I might like instead is the following:\r\n\r\n1. In all cases, never exposing the empty `IComponentFactory` derived empty interfaces that exist just for the sake of this attribute never be publicly accessible.\r\n\r\n2. Ideally have some alternative for entry-points that does not intersect with the public surface of the API in such a visible way. I am having difficulty with suggesting a specific course here, since I am having difficulty finding anyone that knows why this attribute was introduced in the first place, or how it is used in entry-points. (Though, it seems *to* be used.)\r\n\r\n3. Where possibly and reasonable, replace the public surface of the API of `IComponentFactory<Foo>` with ` Foo` directly. As seen above for the case of loss functions, there is no reason not to do this. Indeed, in some places we have done this, which is good:\r\n\r\n   https://github.com/dotnet/machinelearning/blob/7e21afa4612ddca53bbf9d67b84df2b58d4636c2/src/Microsoft.ML.StaticPipe/SdcaStaticExtensions.cs#L170\r\n\r\n   Yet there are too many places in the code where we have not, e.g., here:\r\n   https://github.com/dotnet/machinelearning/blob/7e21afa4612ddca53bbf9d67b84df2b58d4636c2/src/Microsoft.ML.StandardLearners/StandardLearnersCatalog.cs#L42\r\n   or here:\r\n \r\n \r\n https://github.com/dotnet/machinelearning/blob/7e21afa4612ddca53bbf9d67b84df2b58d4636c2/src/Microsoft.ML.StandardLearners/Standard/SdcaBinary.cs#L1600\r\n\r\n   The reasons for this are somewhat historical, in that we had the attitude for a while that the statically typed API would be the public face, but if the dynamic API is to be the public face then it should be a little less terrible than it is now.","Url":"https://github.com/dotnet/machinelearning/issues/1973","RelatedDescription":"Open issue \"TlcModule.ComponentKind and the curse of the empty interfaces\" (#1973)"},{"Id":"394479115","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2018-12-27T20:11:31","Actor":"jignparm","Number":"1972","RawContent":null,"Title":"[WIP] Jignparm/onnxtransform Linux support","State":"open","Body":"Test out OnnxTransform Linux support","Url":"https://github.com/dotnet/machinelearning/pull/1972","RelatedDescription":"Open PR \"[WIP] Jignparm/onnxtransform Linux support\" (#1972)"},{"Id":"394343767","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2018-12-27T09:31:31","Actor":"codemzs","Number":"1971","RawContent":null,"Title":"WIP End of an era - Delete Microsoft.ML.Legacy and related tests.","State":"open","Body":"I still need to remove all those baseline files that are no longer used and then document all the tests that may need to be re-written using the new API such as ONNX converter test and FSharp test.

Regarding FastTree/LightGBM we may want to refine the public prediction/learned model surface a bit more.\r\n\r\nThe structures exposed here, including [`TreeEnsemble`](https://github.com/dotnet/machinelearning/blob/00577c06ff99ad07006ca8c58cf974943cb1971f/src/Microsoft.ML.FastTree/TreeEnsemble/TreeEnsemble.cs#L21) but especially [`RegressionTree`](https://github.com/dotnet/machinelearning/blob/00577c06ff99ad07006ca8c58cf974943cb1971f/src/Microsoft.ML.FastTree/TreeEnsemble/RegressionTree.cs#L22), are dual use structures in the sense that they are used for both training and prediction. This means it is irretreivably mutable (as it must be during training) even during prediction. It is polymorphic in its structure, in the sense that various structures are active and populated during training than are used during prediction -- worse, in some cases the *same* structures are used, but have distinct meanings. (E.g., the feature indices during training are distinct from those used during prediction, since if FastTree determines it can only use a subset of features, it will during training not even consider the unusable features to exist, until it is done with training and maps the structure back to the original feature space so it is usable by ML.NET.) There are other serious but (in context) comparatively minor notes, like not being either sealed or abstract, disobeying more .NET naming and implementation guidelines than I care to enumerate, etc.\r\n\r\nYet, we cannot avoid exposing *some* structure, since of course people want to inspect the trees they have learnt. And, we use this structure to represent the trained ensembles of both the FastTree and LightGBM learner, and, if we ever clean up our XGBoost wrapper so it can be open sourced (or, perhaps even, someone implements a fresh wrapper for us), maybe it will wind up using exactly that same structure. This will also serve them better since this class's structure is, for the same reasons enumerated above, incomprehensible, since about half the members on it are things people shouldn't use. (Since they are used as explained above exclusively during training.)\r\n\r\nWhat should be done instead is the following: during training there is an internal class, in fact, probably more or less the same class that exists now, with a separate *immutable* class that is exposed as the model during training, created out of instances of this class. This also implies a separate training/prediction structure of what is currently called `TreeEnsemble`, and of course the quantile trees will have to be fashioned in some way. Much of the code supporting prediction and the standard ML.NET interfaces would move into *that* set of immutable classes.","Url":"https://github.com/dotnet/machinelearning/issues/1960","RelatedDescription":"Open issue \"Make FastTree/LightGBM learned model suitable for public consumption\" (#1960)"},{"Id":"393694338","IsPullRequest":false,"CreatedAt":"2018-12-22T18:35:09","Actor":"ganik","Number":"1959","RawContent":null,"Title":" internal static partial class Utils is not accessible anymore from NimbusML","State":"open","Body":"This is a breaking changes in ML.NET 0.8 or later for NimbusML\r\nPls advise\r\n\r\n","Url":"https://github.com/dotnet/machinelearning/issues/1959","RelatedDescription":"Open issue \" internal static partial class Utils is not accessible anymore from NimbusML\" (#1959)"},{"Id":"393693702","IsPullRequest":false,"CreatedAt":"2018-12-22T18:25:16","Actor":"ganik","Number":"1958","RawContent":null,"Title":"ArgumentAttribute is inaccessible due to its protection level from NimbusML","State":"open","Body":"ML.Runtime.CommandLine.ArgumentAttribute is inaccessible anymore from NimbusML. \r\nPlease advise how to proceed\r\n\r\nthx","Url":"https://github.com/dotnet/machinelearning/issues/1958","RelatedDescription":"Open issue \"ArgumentAttribute is inaccessible due to its protection level from NimbusML\" (#1958)"},{"Id":"393693371","IsPullRequest":false,"CreatedAt":"2018-12-22T18:20:51","Actor":"ganik","Number":"1957","RawContent":null,"Title":"Contracts is internal and inaccessible from NimbusML","State":"open","Body":"NimbusML has DotNetBridge that uses Microsoft.ML.Runtime.Contracts(..) throughout its code base.
