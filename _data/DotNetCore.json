This advisory also provides guidance on what developers can do to update their applications correctly.\r\n\r\nMicrosoft is aware of a Denial of Service vulnerability in all public versions of .NET core due to improper processing of XML documents. An attacker who successfully exploited this vulnerability could cause a denial of service against a .NET application. A remote unauthenticated attacker could exploit this vulnerability by issuing specially crafted requests to a .NET Core application.\r\n\r\nThe update addresses the vulnerability by correcting how .NET core handles XML document processing.\r\n\r\nSystem administrators are advised to update their .NET Core runtimes to versions 1.0.9, 1.1.6 and 2.0.5. Developers are advised to update their .NET Core SDK to version 2.1.4 or 1.1.7. These runtime and SDK versions will also address CVE-2018-0786,  https://github.com/dotnet/announcements/issues/51\r\n\r\n### Discussion\r\n\r\nPlease use **** TODO: FILL IN ISSUE LINK *** for discussion of this advisory.\r\n\r\n## Affected Software\r\nThe vulnerability affects any Microsoft .NET Core project if it uses any of affected runtime versions listed below\r\n\r\n Runtime Version | Fixed runtime version\r\n----------------| -------------------------\r\n1.0.0, 1.0.1, 1.0.2, 1.0.3, 1.0.4, 1.0.5, 1.0.7, 1.0.8 | 1.0.9\r\n1.1.0, 1.1.1, 1.1.2, 1.1.4, 1.1.5 | 1.1.6\r\n2.0.0, 2.0.3, 2.0.4 |  2.0.5\r\n\r\n### Advisory FAQ\r\n#### How do I know if I am affected?\r\n\r\nTo check the runtimes installed on a computer you must view the contents of the runtime folder. By default these are\r\n\r\n| Operating System          | Location          |\r\n|---------------------------|-------------------|\r\n| Windows | C:\\Program Files\\dotnet\\shared\\Microsoft.NETCore.App\\ |\r\n| macOS | /usr/local/share/dotnet/shared/Microsoft.NETCore.App/    |\r\n| Supported Linux platforms | /usr/share/dotnet/shared/Microsoft.NETCore.App/   |\r\n\r\nEach runtime version is installed in its own directory, where the directory name is the version number. If you do not have a directory for 1.0.9, 1.1.6 or 2.0.2 then any applications targeting .NET Core will be vulnerable. Downloads for all supported platforms can be acquired from https://www.microsoft.com/net/download/\r\n\r\n#### How do I fix my affected application?\r\nApplications can be fixed by installing the latest runtimes or SDKs. Typically application servers only install a runtime package, developer machines install SDKs. Installers can be downloaded from the [Runtime and SDK download archive](https://github.com/dotnet/core/blob/master/release-notes/download-archive.md). Runtime version 1.1.6 will also install runtime version 1.0.9.\r\n\r\nIf you have built a [self-contained application](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/core/deploying/#self-contained-deployments-scd) you must install the new runtime and SDK, recompile your application and redeploy.\r\n\r\n## Other Information\r\n### Reporting Security Issues\r\n\r\nIf you have found a potential security issue in .NET Core, please email details to secure@microsoft.com. Reports may qualify for the .NET Core Bug Bounty. Details of the .NET Core Bug Bounty including Terms and Conditions are at [https://aka.ms/corebounty](https://aka.ms/corebounty).\r\n\r\n### Support\r\nYou can ask questions about this issue on GitHub in the .NET Core or ASP.NET Core organizations.

This should be treated as a temporary measure and the application updated to work with the patched versions of the framework.\r\n\r\nNote that this file is optional, you may need to create it for each application alongside the executable.\r\n\r\n### External Links\r\n\r\n[CVE-2018-0764](https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2018-0764)\r\n\r\n### Revisions\r\n\r\nV1.0 (Jan 9, 2018): Advisory published.\r\n\r\n_Version 1.0_\r\n_Last Updated 2018-01-09_\r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  "}],"ResultType":"GitHubEvent"},"CoreCLR":{"Events":[{"Id":"7260112637","Type":"PullRequestEvent","CreatedAt":"2018-02-18T04:52:16","Actor":"kouvel","Repository":"dotnet/coreclr","Organization":"dotnet","RawContent":null,"RelatedAction":"opened","RelatedUrl":"https://github.com/dotnet/coreclr/pull/16437","RelatedDescription":"Opened pull request \"Disable tiered compilation for collectible assemblies\" (#16437) at dotnet/coreclr","RelatedBody":"- An assembly can be marked collectible with methods not marked as dynamic\r\n- The method desc and code can be deleted and a new method desc reallocated in the same location, code versioning doesn't handle this at the moment"},{"Id":"7260039126","Type":"PullRequestEvent","CreatedAt":"2018-02-18T03:42:23","Actor":"brunotag","Repository":"dotnet/coreclr","Organization":"dotnet","RawContent":null,"RelatedAction":"opened","RelatedUrl":"https://github.com/dotnet/coreclr/pull/16436","RelatedDescription":"Opened pull request \"Update UsingYourBuild.md\" (#16436) at dotnet/coreclr","RelatedBody":"a bit more specific after https://github.com/dotnet/coreclr/pull/16344"},{"Id":"7259939431","Type":"PullRequestEvent","CreatedAt":"2018-02-18T02:08:17","Actor":"benaadams","Repository":"dotnet/coreclr","Organization":"dotnet","RawContent":null,"RelatedAction":"closed","RelatedUrl":"https://github.com/dotnet/coreclr/pull/16435","RelatedDescription":"Closed pull request \"Inlinable IsNullOrWhiteSpace for null and empty\" (#16435) at dotnet/coreclr","RelatedBody":"Common values for `IsNullOrWhiteSpace` are null and empty;

I was just asking since these issues are generally problems that should be logged on `dotnet\\coreclr` (not always the case, but generally).\r\n\r\nI (or someone else) will probably get around to checking this sometime in the next few hours and will let you know.\n\n---\n\n@tannergooding commented on [Fri Aug 04 2017](https://github.com/dotnet/roslyn/issues/21323#issuecomment-320357741)\n\n@branko-d, So I am not currently getting this to repro.\r\n\r\nI downloaded the project, switched to release mode, validated that `Prefer 32-bit` was not checked (also validated the program does run as 64-bit).\r\n\r\nI did try various versions of the compiler and it still succeeds no matter which I use.\r\n\r\nDo you know which version of the .NET Framework you have installed? Also could you provide which OS you are using and the version?\r\n\r\nVisual Studio should display your .NET Framework version in the `Help->About` dialog.\n\n---\n\n@tannergooding commented on [Fri Aug 04 2017](https://github.com/dotnet/roslyn/issues/21323#issuecomment-320357895)\n\nI tested on `Windows 10.0.15063` with `.NET Framework 4.7.02046` on Visual Studio 15.2 and Visual Studio 15.3 Preview 7.\n\n---\n\n@branko-d commented on [Sat Aug 05 2017](https://github.com/dotnet/roslyn/issues/21323#issuecomment-320432705)\n\nMicrosoft Visual Studio Professional 2017 \r\nVersion 15.2 (26430.16) Release\r\nVisualStudio.15.Release/15.2.0+26430.16\r\nMicrosoft .NET Framework\r\nVersion 4.7.02046\r\n\r\nInstalled Version: Professional\r\n\r\nVisual Basic 2017   00369-60000-00001-AA547\r\nMicrosoft Visual Basic 2017\r\n\r\nVisual C# 2017   00369-60000-00001-AA547\r\nMicrosoft Visual C# 2017\r\n\r\nVisual C++ 2017   00369-60000-00001-AA547\r\nMicrosoft Visual C++ 2017\r\n\r\nVisual F# 4.1   00369-60000-00001-AA547\r\nMicrosoft Visual F# 4.1\r\n\r\nApplication Insights Tools for Visual Studio Package   8.6.00404.2\r\nApplication Insights Tools for Visual Studio\r\n\r\nASP.NET and Web Tools 2017   15.0.30503.0\r\nASP.NET and Web Tools 2017\r\n\r\nASP.NET Web Frameworks and Tools 2017   5.2.50303.0\r\nFor additional information, visit https://www.asp.net/\r\n\r\nAzure App Service Tools v3.0.0   15.0.30209.0\r\nAzure App Service Tools v3.0.0\r\n\r\nCommon Azure Tools   1.9\r\nProvides common services for use by Azure Mobile Services and Microsoft Azure Tools.\r\n\r\nJavaScript Language Service   2.0\r\nJavaScript Language Service\r\n\r\nJavaScript Project System   2.0\r\nJavaScript Project System\r\n\r\nJavaScript UWP Project System   2.0\r\nJavaScript UWP Project System\r\n\r\nJetBrains ReSharper Ultimate 2017.1.2    Build 108.0.20170428.75743\r\nJetBrains ReSharper Ultimate package for Microsoft Visual Studio.
