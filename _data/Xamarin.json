(with apologies to 48e3fc26)\r\n**MOAR** Unit tests!\r\n\r\nSpecifically, we want to run the BCL unit tests which mono generates:\r\n\r\n        $ cd external/mono/mcs/class/corlib\r\n        $ make PROFILE=monodroid test\r\n        # creates `monodroid_corlib_test.dll`\r\n\r\nCreation of `monodroid_*_test.dll` assemblies and the\r\n`make PROFILE=monodroid test` target is a relatively recent\r\ndevelopment, for which I need to buy the #runtime team some beers.\r\n\r\nIn terms of `mono-runtimes.targets`, we can build *all* of the BCL\r\nunit test assemblies with:\r\n\r\n        $ cd external/mono/mcs/class\r\n        $ make -i do-test PROFILE=monodroid\r\n\r\nNow that we can create them, how do we *use* them? That's the trickier\r\nbit: they need to be built within mono, as part of the existing BCL\r\nbuild process. This in turn means that the BCL unit test assemblies\r\nneed to be distributed as part of the mono bundle, as we don't want to\r\nrebuild the mono repo \"from scratch\" just for the unit tests.\r\n\r\nUpdate `build-tools/mono-runtimes/ProfileAssemblies.projitems` to\r\ninclude a new `@(MonoTestAssembly)` item group which contains all of\r\nthe BCL unit test assemblies and related files which should be\r\nincluded into `bundle-*.zip`. Additionally, add\r\n`ProfileAssemblies.projitems` to `@(VersionFile)` witihin\r\n`bundle-path.targets`, so that if anything within\r\n`ProfileAssemblies.projitems` changes, we rebuild the bundle.\r\n\r\nOnce we *have* the BCL unit test assemblies, and their dependencies,\r\nwe need to *run* them. The new `Xamarin.Android.Bcl-Tests.csproj`\r\nproject is a Xamarin.Android application project which will execute\r\nthe unit tests.\r\n\r\nThere's just one small problem: Xamarin.Android apps want to use\r\n`Xamarin.Android.NUnitLite.dll`. The BCL unit test assemblies instead\r\nbuild against their own `nunitlite.dll`, which has no Xamarin.Android\r\nintegration or support. How do we use the new test assemblies?\r\n\r\n*Force* a fix by using `remap-assembly-ref` to \"rename\" the\r\n`nunitlite` assembly reference to `Xamarin.Android.NUnitLite.dll`.\r\nThis *cannot* be done as part of the `mono-runtimes.mdproj` build, as\r\n`Xamarin.Android.NUnitLite.dll` won't yet exist. Instead, remap the\r\nassemblies within `Xamarin.Android.Bcl-Tests.targets`, and distribute\r\nthe remapped assemblies with the application.\r\n\r\nFinally, address one other \"small\" problem: not all of the unit tests\r\npass! Some of these are for reasons we don't know, and others will\r\nrequire changes to `mono`.\r\n\r\nUpdate `Xamarin.Android.NUnitLite` to allow *filtering* of tests:\r\n\r\n        namespace Xamarin.Android.NUnitLite {\r\n\r\n                partial class TestSuiteActivity {\r\n                        public  ITestFilter   Filter          {get; set;}\r\n\r\n                        public  virtual void  UpdateFilter ();\r\n                }\r\n\r\n                partial class TestSuiteInstrumentation {\r\n                        public  ITestFilter   Filter          {get; set;}\r\n\r\n                        public  virtual void  UpdateFilter ();\r\n                }\r\n        }\r\n\r\n`TestSuiteActivity.UpdateFilter()` is called by\r\n`TestSuiteActivity.OnCreate()`, *after* `GetIncludedCategories()` and\r\n`GetExcludedCategories()` are called, to allow subclasses to alter the\r\n`ITestFilter` which is used to determine which tests are executed.\r\n\r\n`TestSuiteInstrumentation.UpdateFilter()` is called by\r\n`TestSuiteInstrumentation.OnStart()`, *after*\r\n`GetIncludedCategories()` and `GetExcludedCategories()` are called, to\r\nallow subclasses to alter the `ITestFilter` which is used to determine\r\nwhich tests are executed.\r\n\r\n`Xamarin.Android.Bcl_Tests` overrides both of these and updates the\r\n`Filter` property so that \"known failing\" tests are excluded. This\r\nallows us to skip failing tests, giving us time to properly fix them\r\nin time while allowing the rest of this PR to be merged.\r\n\r\nThe skipped tests include:\r\n    \r\n* MonoTests.System.Reflection.AssemblyTest.GetReferencedAssemblies\r\n* MonoTests.System.ServiceModel.Description.WebInvokeAttributeTest.RejectTwoParametersWhenNotWrapped\r\n"},{"Id":"6666863858","Type":"PullRequestEvent","CreatedAt":"2017-10-03T10:03:47","Actor":"dellis1972","Repository":"xamarin/xamarin-android","Organization":"xamarin","RawContent":null,"RelatedAction":"opened","RelatedUrl":"https://github.com/xamarin/xamarin-android/pull/912","RelatedDescription":"Opened pull request \"[Xamarin.Android.Build.Tests] Reworks tests to use msbuild.
