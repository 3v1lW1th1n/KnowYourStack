This was not a problem before Angular 8 because the MIME type was set by Angular. See issue #30835 \r\n\r\nThere is some discussion about MIME types in golang here: https://github.com/golang/go/issues/32351\r\n\r\n## 🔬 Minimal Reproduction\r\n\r\n### What's the affected URL?**\r\nhttps://angular.io/guide/deployment#server-configuration\r\nScroll down to this: \"Golang: create a Golang server using (gorilla/mux) with a basic Golang file that configures the server main.go\"\r\n\r\n### Reproduction Steps**\r\nInstall Golang and Angular with a hello world app for Angular. Copy and paste the suggested code snipped for golang. Build (go build). Start the application (it should have generated an executable). Navigate to localhost:80 and notice that in Chrome, nothing loads. Open Developer Tools and observe the folly of man.\r\n\r\n### Expected vs Actual Behavior**\r\nI expect a documented method for serving Angular to work. You have several options to fix this. You could remove this documented method, include code to adjust the generated ./dist files such that Go can serve them (did not work for me - see \"Attempts to Find a Solution\"), find a way to adjust the go server such that it sends the proper MIME type for you (I do not see how this is possible - again see below), or you could fix #30835\r\n\r\n## 🔥 Exception or Error\r\nFailed to load module script: The server responded with a non-JavaScript MIME type of \"text/plain\".

Magic APIs are a no-no. \r\n\r\n### Describe the proposed API\r\n\r\nEither something like\r\n\r\n-  `'@mediumDate'`, where `@mediumDate` would throw an error saying that it's an unknown format, and it knows it's a format because of the prefix `@` \r\n- or another way to clearly state that you want a custom format, or a predefined format, so an error can be thrown instead of doing a silent fallback to something incomprehensible because of a typo.\r\n\r\nThe best course of actions would be to type check predefined formats on the compiler level (TypeScript), so we'd even get autocomplete, but then the format must either be a different parameter or a different type (not a string).\r\n\r\nBased on the above reasoning, the following comes to mind as the best solution, but is again not backwards-compatible.\r\n\r\nSeparate \"format\" and \"customFormat\" to separate arguments. Only if the argument is \"custom\", interpret the second argument as the custom format string.

The variable for the extra `@angular/core` is correctly `global.ng.core` like usual, but the variable for the extra `@ngrx/store` is `global.@ngrx/store` which is invalid syntax.\r\n\r\nFor example in the `store-testing.umd.js` file `ngcc` converts:\r\n```\r\n(function (global, factory) {\r\n     typeof exports === 'object' && typeof module !== 'undefined' ? factory(exports, require('tslib'), require('@angular/core'), require('rxjs'), require('@ngrx/store'), require('@angular/core/testing')) :\r\n     typeof define === 'function' && define.amd ? define('@ngrx/store/testing', ['exports', 'tslib', '@angular/core', 'rxjs', '@ngrx/store', '@angular/core/testing'], factory) :\r\n     (global = global || self, factory((global.ngrx = global.ngrx || {}, global.ngrx.store = global.ngrx.store || {}, global.ngrx.store.testing = {}), global.tslib, global.ng.core, global.rxjs, global['@ngrx/store'], global.ng.core.testing));\r\n }(this, function (exports, tslib_1, core, rxjs, store, testing) { 'use strict'; \r\n```\r\n\r\ninto:\r\n\r\n```\r\n(function (global, factory) {\r\n    typeof exports === 'object' && typeof module !== 'undefined' ? factory(exports, require('tslib'), require('@angular/core'), require('rxjs'), require('@ngrx/store'), require('@angular/core/testing'),require('@angular/core'),require('@ngrx/store')) :\r\n    typeof define === 'function' && define.amd ? define('@ngrx/store/testing', ['exports', 'tslib', '@angular/core', 'rxjs', '@ngrx/store', '@angular/core/testing','@angular/core','@ngrx/store'], factory) :\r\n    (global = global || self, factory((global.ngrx = global.ngrx || {}, global.ngrx.store = global.ngrx.store || {}, global.ngrx.store.testing = {}), global.tslib, global.ng.core, global.rxjs, global['@ngrx/store'], global.ng.core.testing,global.ng.core,global.@ngrx/store));\r\n}(this, function (exports, tslib_1, core, rxjs, store, testing,ɵngcc0,ɵngcc1) { 'use strict';\r\n```\r\n\r\nNote the invalid `global.@ngrx/store` syntax at the end of the `factory(...)` args which `ngcc` added.\r\n\r\n## 🔬 Minimal Reproduction\r\nhttps://github.com/jbedard/angular-bazel-examples/tree/af68213db7fe2470f254aac6861bd8b6bd264a8c\r\n\r\nJust running `yarn` and looking at `node_modules/@ngrx/store/bundles/store-testing.umd.js` shows the error.\r\n\r\nIf you want to see it at runtime run `bazel run //:devserver` for the devserver with UMD bundles to see the error.

The type\r\nchecker has two strategies for dealing with such type constructors:\r\n\r\n1. They can be emitted local to the type check block/type check file.\r\n2. They can be emitted as static `ngTypeCtor` field into the directive\r\nitself.\r\n\r\nThe first strategy is preferred, as it avoids having to update the\r\ndirective type which would cause a more expensive rebuild. However, this\r\nstrategy is not suitable for directives that have constrained generic\r\ntypes, as those constraints would need to be present on the local type\r\nconstructor declaration. This is not trivial, as it requires that any\r\ntype references within a type parameter's constraint are imported into\r\nthe local context of the type check block.\r\n\r\nFor example, lets consider the `NgForOf` directive from '@angular/core'\r\nlooks as follows:\r\n\r\n```typescript\r\nimport {NgIterable} from '@angular/core';\r\n\r\nexport class NgForOf<T, U extends NgIterable<T>> {}\r\n```\r\n\r\nThe type constructor will then have the signature:\r\n`(o: Pick<i1.NgForOf<T, U>, 'ngForOf'>) => i1.NgForOf<T, U>`\r\n\r\nNotice how this refers to the type parameters `T` and `U`, so the type\r\nconstructor needs to be emitted into a scope where those types are\r\navailable, _and_ have the correct constraints.\r\n\r\nPreviously, the template type checker would detect the situation where a\r\ntype parameter is constrained, and would emit the type constructor\r\nusing strategy 2; within the directive type itself. This approach makes\r\nany type references with the generic type constraints lexically\r\navailable:\r\n\r\n```typescript\r\nexport class NgForOf<T, U extends NgIterable<T>> {\r\n  static ngTypeCtor<T = any, U extends NgIterable<T> = any>\r\n    (o: Pick<NgForOf<T, U>, 'ngForOf'>): NgForOf<T, U> { return null!; }\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nThis commit introduces the ability to reify a type parameter with\r\nconstraints into a different context, under the condition that it can\r\nbe imported from an absolute module. This allows a generic type\r\nconstructor to be emitted into a type check block or type check file\r\naccording to strategy 1, as its generic types can be reconstructed using\r\nthe reification mechanism:\r\n\r\n```typescript\r\nimport * as i0 from '@angular/core';\r\nimport * as i1 from '@angular/common';\r\n\r\nconst _ctor1: <T = any, U extends i0.NgIterable<T> = any>\r\n  (o: Pick<i1.NgForOf<T, U>, 'ngForOf'>) => i1.NgForOf<T, U> = null!;\r\n```\r\n\r\nNotice how the generic type constraint of `U` has resulted in an import\r\nof `@angular/core`, and the `NgIterable` is transformed into a qualified\r\nname during the reification process.\r\n\r\nResolves FW-1739","Url":"https://github.com/angular/angular/pull/34021","RelatedDescription":"Open PR \"perf(ivy): support simple generic type constraints in local type ctors\" (#34021)"},{"Id":"527718979","IsPullRequest":false,"CreatedAt":"2019-11-24T16:02:45","Actor":"Anderman","Number":"34020","RawContent":null,"Title":"http interceptor should complete after canceled request","State":"open","Body":"\r\n### Affected Package\r\n<!-- Can you pin-point one or more @angular/* packages as the source of the bug? -->\r\n<!-- ✍️edit: --> The issue is caused by package @angular/....\r\nhttpmodule\r\n\r\n### Description\r\n\r\nProblem exist when the client use client use cors.

The second commit filters out files which were marked asynchronous from the `initial` bundle.\r\n* Differential builds were included in the same size, so the `main` size was including both the ES2015 **and** ES5 sizes together, which isn't what the user would want. The third commit updates the relevant budgets to output two sizes, one for each differential build, rather than including them together.\r\n\r\nI made separate commits performing each of these steps individually to make the logic a little easier to follow and understand.","Url":"https://github.com/angular/angular-cli/pull/16268","RelatedDescription":"Open PR \"fix(@angular-devkit/build-angular): fix budget checks\" (#16268)"},{"Id":"527401200","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2019-11-22T21:36:32","Actor":"gregmagolan","Number":"16267","RawContent":null,"Title":"refactor(@angular-devkit/build-angular): allow @angular/core version 0.0.0","State":"closed","Body":"Allow version \"0.0.0\" for integration testing in the angular/angular repository with the generated development @angular/core npm package which is versioned \"0.0.0\".\r\n\r\nThis is a pre-req for https://github.com/angular/angular/pull/33927 which runs integration tests against the bazel generated npm packages.\r\n\r\nTo green up that PR I have a patch that does the same thing https://github.com/angular/angular/pull/33927/files#diff-817b74474f8a65162b6115d04a6f43c7 which will get removed once this change makes it in to the next release","Url":"https://github.com/angular/angular-cli/pull/16267","RelatedDescription":"Closed or merged PR \"refactor(@angular-devkit/build-angular): allow @angular/core version 0.0.0\" (#16267)"},{"Id":"527388264","IsPullRequest":false,"CreatedAt":"2019-11-22T20:00:19","Actor":"mucbits","Number":"16266","RawContent":null,"Title":"Live Reload not working with --basehref","State":"open","Body":"# 🐞 Bug report\r\n\r\n### Command (mark with an `x`)\r\n\r\n- [ ] new\r\n- [ ] build\r\n- [x] serve\r\n- [ ] test\r\n- [ ] e2e\r\n- [ ] generate\r\n- [ ] add\r\n- [ ] lint\r\n- [ ] update\r\n- [ ] xi18n\r\n- [ ] run\r\n- [ ] config\r\n- [ ] help\r\n- [ ] version\r\n- [ ] doc\r\n\r\n\r\n### Is this a regression?\r\n\r\nYes, the previous version in which this bug was not present was: 0.803.13\r\n\r\n\r\n### Description\r\nLive Reload stopped working after this change:\r\nhttps://github.com/angular/angular-cli/commit/5260bbb9a3d17aefb90bcf1b660e252996cf68df#diff-6c0b312b8bd33db747e50549a66f7ab1\r\n\r\n`https://localhost:xxxx/admin/sockjs-node/info` returns 404\r\n\r\nwhile `https://localhost:xxxx/admin/admin/sockjs-node/info` exists.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n## 🔬 Minimal Reproduction\r\nng serve app --base-href /admin/  --deploy-url /admin/\r\n\r\n## 🔥 Exception or Error\r\n`https://localhost:xxxx/admin/sockjs-node/info` returns 404\r\n\r\n","Url":"https://github.com/angular/angular-cli/issues/16266","RelatedDescription":"Open issue \"Live Reload not working with --basehref\" (#16266)"},{"Id":"527123128","IsPullRequest":false,"CreatedAt":"2019-11-22T11:53:56","Actor":"Dok11","Number":"16265","RawContent":null,"Title":"SessionNotCreatedError: session not created: This version of ChromeDriver only supports Chrome version 76","State":"closed","Body":"<!--🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅\r\n\r\nOh hi there! 😄\r\n\r\nTo expedite issue processing please search open and closed issues before submitting a new one.\r\nExisting issues often contain information about workarounds, resolution, or progress updates.\r\n\r\n🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅-->\r\n\r\n\r\n# 🐞 Bug report\r\n\r\n### Command (mark with an `x`)\r\n<!-- Can you pin-point the command or commands that are effected by this bug? -->\r\n<!-- ✍️edit: -->\r\n\r\n- [x] e2e\r\n\r\n\r\n### Description\r\n\r\nCommand `npm run e2e` doesnt work and throw error into a terminal.\r\nGoogle Chrome showing for a split second and close immediately.

Sorry for the long list this time!\n\n-   `web_package` rule has been renamed to `pkg_web` and is now a public API\n\nUpdate your load statements from\n\n```python\nload(\"@&#8203;build_bazel_rules_nodejs//internal/web_package:web_package.bzl\", \"web_package\")\n```\n\nto\n\n```python\nload(\"@&#8203;build_bazel_rules_nodejs//:index.bzl\", \"pkg_web\")\n```\n\n-   `ts_devserver` and `pkg_web` (previously `web_package`) no longer have an `index_html` attribute.\n\nThey expect an index.html file to be among the assets, and to already\nhave the script and link tags needed for the app to work.\n\nThe feature where those tags were injected into the html dynamically has\nbeen moved to its own rule, inject_html.\n\nWe are in a transition state where the `inject_html` rule is not published, because we want this to be a plain npm package and not Bazel-specific. We will publish this functionality soon. If you depend on it, you may want to delay this upgrade.\n\n-   internal/rollup_bundle rule is removed. see <https://github.com/bazelbuild/rules_nodejs/wiki> for migration instructions\n\n-   Removed the expand_location_into_runfiles helper from //internal:node.bzl\n    Load it from //internal/common:expand_into_runfiles instead\n\n-   npm karma deps for karma_web_test and karma_web_suite are now peer deps so that the versions used can be chosen by the user.\n\nThis PR also removes the built-in  `@io_bazel_rules_webtesting//browsers/sauce:chrome-win10` saucelabs support. It is not very useful as it only tests a single browser and it difficult to use. In the angular repo, saucelabs support was implemented with a custom karma config using karma_web_test. This is the recommended approach.\n\n-   `--define=DEBUG=1` is no longer functional to request debugging outputs. Use `-c dbg` instead (this matches Bazel's behavior for C++).\n\n-   We renamed some of the generated targets in the `@nodejs//` workspace:\n\n`bazel run @&#8203;nodejs//:npm` is replaced with `bazel run @&#8203;nodejs//:npm_node_repositories` and `bazel run @&#8203;nodejs//:yarn` is replaced with `bazel run @&#8203;nodejs//:yarn_node_repositories`. `@nodejs//:yarn` and `@nodejs//:npm` now run yarn & npm in the current working directory instead of on all of the `package.json` files in `node_repositories()`.\n\n`@nodejs//:bin/node` & `@nodejs//:bin/node.cmd` (on Windows) are no longer valid targets. Use `@nodejs//:node` instead on all platforms. You can still call the old targets in their platform specific node repositories such as `@nodejs_darwin_amd64//:bin/node`.\n\n`@nodejs//:bin/yarn` & `@nodejs//:bin/yarn.cmd` (on Windows) are no longer valid targets. Use `@nodejs//:yarn` instead on all platforms. You can still call the old targets in their platform specific node repositories such as `@nodejs_darwin_amd64//:bin/yarn`.\n\n`@nodejs//:bin/npm` & `@nodejs//:bin/npm.cmd` (on Windows) are no longer valid targets. Use `@nodejs//:npm` instead on all platforms. You can still call the old targets in their platform specific node repositories such as `@nodejs_darwin_amd64//:bin/npm`.\n\n##### Bug Fixes\n\n-   **builtin:** allow .tsx entry_point in node binary/test ([313d484](https://togithub.com/bazelbuild/rules_nodejs/commit/313d484)), closes [#&#8203;1351](https://togithub.com/bazelbuild/rules_nodejs/issues/1351)\n-   **terser:** call terser binary instead of uglifyjs ([#&#8203;1360](https://togithub.com/bazelbuild/rules_nodejs/issues/1360)) ([a100420](https://togithub.com/bazelbuild/rules_nodejs/commit/a100420))\n-   **terser:** remove ngDevMode & ngI18nClosureMode global_defs from default terser config ([98c8dbc](https://togithub.com/bazelbuild/rules_nodejs/commit/98c8dbc))\n\n##### chore\n\n-   remove deprecated re-export file ([148bf8a](https://togithub.com/bazelbuild/rules_nodejs/commit/148bf8a))\n-   remove old rollup_bundle ([9a824ac](https://togithub.com/bazelbuild/rules_nodejs/commit/9a824ac)), closes [#&#8203;740](https://togithub.com/bazelbuild/rules_nodejs/issues/740)\n\n##### Code Refactoring\n\n-   move injector feature to own rule ([be06d23](https://togithub.com/bazelbuild/rules_nodejs/commit/be06d23))\n\n##### Features\n\n-   node-patches\\\\filesystem patcher.
