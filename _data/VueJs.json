I might be confused on the development process, but the [contribution file](https://github.com/vuejs/vue/blob/dev/.github/CONTRIBUTING.md) says \"make sure `npm test` passes\", under \"Pull Request Guidelines\", so I would expect `npm test` to pass on a fresh pull\r\n\r\n### What is actually happening?\r\nThis is the tail of `npm test`:\r\n\r\n```\r\nFinished in 25.953 secs / 25.514 secs @ 21:13:50 GMT 0100 (CET)\r\n\r\nSUMMARY:\r\n✔ 1056 tests completed\r\n✖ 1 test failed\r\n\r\nFAILED TESTS:\r\n  Transition mode\r\n    ✖ transition out-in on async component (resolve after leave complete)\r\n      PhantomJS 2.1.1 (Linux 0.0.0)\r\n    Expected 1 to be 0.\r\n    webpack:///test/unit/features/transition/transition-mode.spec.js:480:44 <- index.js:159373:44\r\n    shift@webpack:///test/helpers/wait-for-update.js:24:32 <- index.js:95787:36\r\n\r\n\r\n=============================== Coverage summary ===============================\r\nStatements   : 99.98% ( 4110/4111 )\r\nBranches     : 94.67% ( 3340/3528 )\r\nFunctions    : 99.82% ( 568/569 )\r\nLines        : 99.98% ( 4004/4005 )\r\n================================================================================\r\nnpm ERR! code ELIFECYCLE\r\nnpm ERR! errno 1\r\nnpm ERR! vue@2.5.8 test:cover: `karma start test/unit/karma.cover.config.js`\r\nnpm ERR!

I'm running Ubuntu on i3wm, using fish shell, both of which might maybe not be considered in the test cases in some way. What should be done about this?\r\n\r\n<!-- generated by vue-issues.
