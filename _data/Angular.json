I know that I can use debouce (i.e. `ngForm.valueChanges.pipe(debounceTime(300))`); in this simple case when I update the student is more than enough, but maybe I want to do something else with my `student` model and using deboude will (for example) cause a bad user experience.\r\n\r\nNote that the `x` parameter from `subscribe` is not the model object (i.e. the `student` object).\r\n\r\nHow about adding an Ouput  (or an observable to `ngForm`)  called `ngFormModelChange` (or whatever) which will be called **after** the model is changed, not before (like `valueChanges` does)","Url":"https://github.com/angular/angular/issues/28758","RelatedDescription":"Open issue \"Add something like ngModelChange to ngForm\" (#28758)"},{"Id":"410733834","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2019-02-15T11:49:19","Actor":"marclaval","Number":"28757","RawContent":null,"Title":"fix(docs-infra): all examples should get Ivy boilerplate","State":"open","Body":"This fixes FW-1068","Url":"https://github.com/angular/angular/pull/28757","RelatedDescription":"Open PR \"fix(docs-infra): all examples should get Ivy boilerplate\" (#28757)"},{"Id":"410726982","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2019-02-15T11:30:10","Actor":"pkozlowski-opensource","Number":"28756","RawContent":null,"Title":"DebugNode.componentInstance","State":"open","Body":"This PR documents in test behaviour of both view engine and ivy when it comes to `DebugNode. componentInstance ` logic. \r\n\r\nThe ve semantics seems to be, for a given `DebugNode`:\r\n\r\n* if a node is a host for a component, return this component instance\r\n* if a node has no associated component move to a parent node and go back to the previous step;\r\n* if there are no more parent nodes to check return a component that created a given `DebugNode`.\r\n\r\n\r\nTo be honest I find the view engine behaviour rather confusing and I've got no idea why we would go into the business of traversing up the nodes tree - after all we are asking for something associated with a given node and not some random node upwards.\r\n\r\nFor me the current ivy implementation makes much more sense (just return a component instance if a given node is a host node for a component).

I found that we must pass the `$event` to child components in order to react to a submit event despite having already sent the FormGroup.\r\n```\r\n<form (ngSubmit)=\"onSubmit($event)\"...\r\n    <app-validator [formGroup]=\"form\" [parentEvent]=\"evt\"></app-validator>\r\n```\r\n\r\n### Describe the solution you'd like\r\nFormGroup's `statusChanges` could include a `submitted` flag.\r\n\r\nI do realize that `submitted` does not denote success. However, this seems to be the same logic where some validators do not trigger an `INVALID` FormGroup status.\r\n\r\nTo be able to tie our endpoint/observable response to the form to create a `submitted:success` flag as well sounds helpful. But that may out of scope to my request.\r\n\r\n1. `submitted:true` be added to FormGroup's `statusChanges` when the form has been submitted by the user and ngSubmit has triggered a `submit` event.\r\n2. `submitted:invalid` could denote that a form submission has been attempted while a form control(s) was invalid.\r\n3. `submitted:finished` when the application has returned from the server and the application updates the form's statusChanges that a successful round trip has occurred.\r\nReferencing RESTful best practice perhaps even going as far as error codes or `submitted: GET/POST/PUT/DELETE` or even our own custom codes? \r\n\r\nForm usage after _finished_ could typically trigger setting the form to pristine and `submitted:null` to start the UX process over.\r\n\r\nI wrote more on my proposed solution on [Medium](https://medium.com/@BenRacicot/success-handling-is-everyones-responsibility-40d844e6cc42). If I'm off I'd like to be corrected and shown the best way. Thank you.\r\n\r\n### Describe alternatives you've considered\r\n- ControlValueAccessor does not seem to have access to the form events\r\n- FormControl and FormGroup have `errors` and `statusChanges` but do not include a \"submitted\" event\r\n- There is no safe way to \"ViewParent\" from a component which is what others have mentioned on StackOverflow\r\n- Event emmitting adds overhead to components where the parent must work with the child, sometimes defeating the purpose of reusable components.

This bug is also happening for `@angular/core` where we generated an invalid `core.metadata.json` file and ship it to NPM.\r\n\r\ne.g. see: https://unpkg.com/@angular/core@7.2.2/core.metadata.json\r\n\r\nThe problem is that the metadata references static symbols using relative paths which are no longer valid due to the metadata being bundled at the package root next to the flat module index file.\r\n\r\ne.g. search for `../../di` which should be something like `./src/di/index`.\r\n\r\nThis is happening because the `bunder` in the `@angular/compiler-cli` does not rewrite relative URLs within static class members into the corresponding package-relative paths. This seems to be an **oversight** in the metadata bundler that now causes issues with Ivy where **static class members** can be used to declare injectables.\r\n\r\nFor example:\r\n```ts\r\nexport class KeyValueDiffers {\r\n  /** @nocollapse */\r\n  static ngInjectableDef = defineInjectable({\r\n    providedIn: 'root',\r\n    factory: () => new KeyValueDiffers([new DefaultKeyValueDifferFactory()])\r\n  });\r\n``` \r\n\r\n---> The resulting summary file from that corrupt metadata file looks like that:\r\n\r\n```js\r\n\"metadata\": {\r\n  \"__symbolic\": \"class\",\r\n  \"members\": {\r\n    \"__ctor__\": [\"...\"],\r\n    \"find\": [\"...\"]\r\n  },\r\n  \"statics\": {\r\n    \"ngInjectableDef\": {\r\n      \"__symbolic\": \"call\",\r\n      \"expression\": {\r\n        \"__symbolic\": \"error\",\r\n        \"message\": \"Could not resolve ../../di/defs relative to [object Object].\",\r\n        \"fileName\": \"@angular\\\\core\\\\core.ts\"\r\n      },\r\n      \"arguments\": [\"...\"]\r\n    },\r\n```\r\n\r\nNotice how it couldn't resolve `../../di/defs`. This is because this path is not valid when considered relative to the `@angular/core/core.d.ts` file. \r\n\r\n## üåç  Your Environment\r\n\r\n**Angular Version:**\r\n<pre><code>v8.0.0-beta.3</code></pre>\r\n\r\n**Anything else relevant?**\r\n\r\nThis is fixed with Ivy/`ngtsc`, but it can currently cause unexpected behavior when the AOT compiler tries to resolve the references from incorrect module paths. e.g. it resolves `../../di` to another node module that is called `di`. Causing an exception like:\r\n\r\n```\r\n: Error: Could not resolve di/lib/index from\r\n /bazel_integration_test/external/npm/node_modules/@angular/core/core.d.ts\r\n```\r\n\r\nThis can only happen if the `di` node module is part of the TypeScript compilation though. So the severity is extremely low, but it seems hard to work around this because TypeScript naturally uses the resolved module (and there is no easy for us to exclude that).","Url":"https://github.com/angular/angular/issues/28741","RelatedDescription":"Open issue \"Invalid metadata for flat module indices with static class members\" (#28741)"}],"ResultType":"GitHubIssue"},"AngularCli-Issues":{"Issues":[{"Id":"411015080","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2019-02-16T02:20:17","Actor":"clydin","Number":"13687","RawContent":null,"Title":"fix(@angular-devkit/build-angular): improve webpack loader resolution","State":"open","Body":"Previously, all loaders either needed to be in the workspace's node modules directory or a node modules directory directly within the build angular package.

The previous behavior of the Angular CLI prevented this from occuring and resulted in an inability to reference stylesheet assets in this manner.  The initial reason for this behavior is no longer present in the internal implementation of the Angular CLI.  Therefore, this now unnecessary and non-standard behavior is being phased out.  If an application currently relies on this behavior, a compatibility option `rebaseRootRelativeCssUrls` has been provided for the 8.x release cycle to facilitate transition away from this non-standard and limiting behavior.  The recommended method to transition is to use relative paths within the source stylesheet.

custom ones (just edit the ``builder`` nodes; I don't think that the mentioned builders need to exist for this reproduction)\r\n- ng add @angular/pwa\r\n- Find out that the ``index.html`` has NOT been

At the moment the module is created as a library and the main application is being used as a demo. The library is built and exported when requesting the module from this repo. (https://bitbucket.org/joseph118/ng-module-x/src/master/)\r\nBitBucket Repo B - Application which makes use of \"BitBucket Repo A\" (installs the library) and more (Web app).

This will end up throwing 'module not found' but checking the node_modules folder, I can verify that everything seems to be in order.\r\n\r\n\r\n## üî¨ Minimal Reproduction\r\nReplication Steps: \r\n1.
