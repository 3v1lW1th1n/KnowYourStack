Please describe.\r\n\r\nWhen the SemVer 2.0.0 changes were introduced to the V2 and V3 protocol, they are intended to mitigate the impact of SemVer 2.0.0 packages breaking old clients, e.g. suppose a very popular package released a SemVer 2.0.0 version. In such a case a 2.x customer would fail to restore a package because the version parsing would explode. So we make SemVer 2.0.0 packages \"opt-in\". \r\n\r\nThis protocol change meant that SemVer 2.0.0 packages were hidden in most of our APIs for clients that predate NuGet version 4.3. 4.3 is when the SemVer 2.0.0 protocol was implemented. At that same time we put a warning banner on nuget.org.\r\n\r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/94054/73881689-a223f500-4815-11ea-8717-653f6302cc65.png)\r\nhttps://www.nuget.org/packages/NuGet.Versioning/5.5.0-preview.2.6382\r\n\r\nA similar warning is also visible during UI upload and during package push. And during pack (NU5105).\r\n\r\nSince 4.3 was shipped so long ago, most clients now support the SemVer 2.0.0 protocol and this warning is more noisy than helpful.\r\n\r\nRange | Percent | Note\r\n-- | -- | --\r\n≥ 4.3 | ~96.4% | Supports SemVer 2.0.0 protocol\r\n≥ 3.0 && < 4.3 | ~3.6% | Partial SemVer 2.0.0 but not SemVer 2.0.0 protocol `*`\r\n< 3.0 | ~0.0% | Does not support SemVer 2.0.0\r\n\r\n`*` =\r\n- Anything before 4.3 will not see SemVer 2.0.0 in search or in the PM UI.\r\n- 3.5.0 and on supported SemVer 2.0.0 restore in packages.config so people can hand edit to work-around.\r\n- PackageReference always supported SemVer 2.0.0 from what I can tell so people could hard-code a SemVer 2.0.0 package in their .csproj and still restore.\r\n- V3 feeds always return SemVer 2.0.0 packages from flat container so packages can be found prior to SemVer 2.0.0. protocol support\r\n\r\n### Describe the solution you'd like\r\n\r\nRemove these warnings entirely.\r\n\r\n### Additional details\r\n\r\nPrompted by https://twitter.com/SimonCropp/status/1169447145939685376, https://github.com/NuGet/NuGetGallery/pull/7772, and https://github.com/NuGet/Home/issues/5201.\r\n\r\n/cc @nkolev92 @SimonCropp @agr @karann-msft \r\n"}],"ResultType":"GitHubEvent"},"Home":{"Events":[{"Id":"11649906683","Type":"IssuesEvent","CreatedAt":"2020-03-02T03:58:10","Actor":"cristinamanum","Repository":"NuGet/Home","Organization":"NuGet","RawContent":null,"RelatedAction":"closed","RelatedUrl":"https://github.com/NuGet/Home/issues/9238","RelatedDescription":"Closed issue \"Centrally managing NuGet packages and versions] Design document for Visual Studio - Project System API requirements.\" (#9238) at NuGet/Home","RelatedBody":"Design doc section for the Project System API requirements to support all the scenarios for Visual Studio Package Reference updates when projects that are opt-in CPVM.\r\n\r\nThis work item includes any necessary prototype work needed.\r\n\r\nRelated : https://github.com/NuGet/Home/issues/9016 "},{"Id":"11649882698","Type":"IssuesEvent","CreatedAt":"2020-03-02T03:51:57","Actor":"cristinamanum","Repository":"NuGet/Home","Organization":"NuGet","RawContent":null,"RelatedAction":"opened","RelatedUrl":"https://github.com/NuGet/Home/issues/9238","RelatedDescription":"Opened issue \"Centrally managing NuGet packages and versions] Design document for Visual Studio - Project System API requirements.\" (#9238) at NuGet/Home","RelatedBody":"Design doc section for the Project System API requirements to support all the scenarios for Visual Studio Package Reference updates when projects that are opt-in CPVM.\r\n\r\nThis work item includes any necessary prototype work needed.\r\n\r\nRelated : https://github.com/NuGet/Home/issues/9016 "},{"Id":"11649770919","Type":"IssuesEvent","CreatedAt":"2020-03-02T03:26:17","Actor":"cristinamanum","Repository":"NuGet/Home","Organization":"NuGet","RawContent":null,"RelatedAction":"opened","RelatedUrl":"https://github.com/NuGet/Home/issues/9237","RelatedDescription":"Opened issue \"[Centrally managing NuGet packages and versions] Define all the API requirements for Project System to support add / update package reference\" (#9237) at NuGet/Home","RelatedBody":"Add in the design doc add all the API requirements to support all the scenarios for Visual Studio Package Reference updates for projects that are opt-in CPVM.\r\n\r\nThis work item includes any necessary prototype work needed."},{"Id":"11649669572","Type":"IssuesEvent","CreatedAt":"2020-03-02T03:01:23","Actor":"cristinamanum","Repository":"NuGet/Home","Organization":"NuGet","RawContent":null,"RelatedAction":"opened","RelatedUrl":"https://github.com/NuGet/Home/issues/9236","RelatedDescription":"Opened issue \"[Centrally managing NuGet packages and versions] Integrate PackageVerison information for non-sdk style project in VS restore scenraios.\" (#9236) at NuGet/Home","RelatedBody":"For non sdk style scenarios the project system data comes from a different pipeline.
