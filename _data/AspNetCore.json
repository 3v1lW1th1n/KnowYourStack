(Typically your Program class) If you don't have this method ```WebApplicationTestFixture<TStartup>``` won't be able to initialize your app in the same way it is done on a normal run. You can configure the WebHostBuilder yourself by overriding CreateWebHostBuilder on ```WebApplicationTestFixture<TStartup>```.\r\n\r\n### The test infrastructure needs to know the content root of the application under test\r\nTo set the content root for your app, ```WebApplicationTestFixture<TStartup>``` first locate your solution file ```(.sln)``` and then make a guess about where project might be. The Content Root of the application is defined by convention as ```<<SolutionFolder>>/<<ProjectAssemblyName>>```. For example, based on the folder structure defined below, the content root of the application is defined as ```c:\\work\\MyApp```. This is important because if not set correctly to the root folder of your application under test all views and static files will not be found.\r\n\r\n```\r\nc:/work/\r\n    MyApp.sln\r\n    MyApp/MyApp.csproj\r\n    MyApp.FunctionalTests/MyApp.FunctionalTests.csproj\r\n```\r\n\r\nThe process for determining the folder to use as the content root when running the tests is the following:\r\n* ```WebApplicationTestFixture<TStartup>``` starts on the bin folder of the test project, in the example above ```c:/work/MyApp.FunctionalTests/MyApp.FunctionalTests/bin/<<Configuration>>/<<Framework>>```\r\n* It navigates to the parent folder until it finds a ```.sln``` file.\r\n* It appends ```<<AssemblyName>>``` to the folder in which it found the ```.sln``` file and set that as the content root.\r\n\r\nIf you happen to be using a different convention for the layout of your projects, you can inherit from WebApplicationTestFixture and pass in the relative path from your solution to the application under test when calling the constructor. For example ```\"/src/MyApp\"```\r\n\r\n```csharp\r\npublic class MyAppTestFixture<TStartup> : WebApplicationTestFixture<TStartup> where TStartup : class\r\n{\r\n    public MyAppTestFixture(string solutionRelativePath)\r\n        : base(\"/src/MyApp\") { }\r\n}\r\n```"},{"Id":"6754805124","Type":"IssuesEvent","CreatedAt":"2017-10-23T21:16:00","Actor":"Eilon","Repository":"aspnet/Announcements","Organization":"aspnet","RawContent":null,"RelatedAction":"opened","RelatedUrl":"https://github.com/aspnet/Announcements/issues/274","RelatedDescription":"Opened issue \"ASP.NET/EF Core 2.0.3 patch pre-release test feed\" (#274) at aspnet/Announcements","RelatedBody":"Hi, we now have a public test feed that you can use to try out the ASP.NET/EF Core 2.0.3 patch!\r\n\r\nYou can test this pre-release patch by adding the following feed to your app's or machine's NuGet.config file:\r\n* `https://dotnet.myget.org/F/aspnet-2-0-2-october2017-patch-public/api/v3/index.json`\r\n   * ![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/202643/31913542-4757d2a0-b7fc-11e7-9bf7-7157bd18a6ca.png)\r\n   * (please ignore the *name* of the feed; it is incorrect 😦)\r\n\r\n## Update your project\r\n1.
