For large applications, sometimes we may not be able to specify every possible `loadChildren` paths. Sometimes these variables in the path are coming from a database - and it may also have a corresponding `loadChildren`. But specifying all these combinations hard-coded in the app doesn't feel like a scalable solution.\r\n\r\nFor clarity, the above code sample can be a replacement for:\r\n```ts\r\nconst routes: Routes = [\r\n  {\r\n    path: 'theme-builder/theme-1',\r\n    loadChildren:\r\n      'src/app/theme-builders/theme-1-builder.module#BuilderModule'\r\n  },\r\n  {\r\n    path: 'theme-builder/theme-2',\r\n    loadChildren:\r\n      'src/app/theme-builders/theme-2-builder.module#BuilderModule'\r\n  },\r\n  ...\r\n]\r\n```\r\n### Describe the solution you'd like\r\n\r\nI'm aware of the AOT. I think I can specify these individual lazy loaded modules in the `angular.josn` to compile them ahead of time.\r\n\r\n```\r\n{\r\n  \"architect\":{\r\n    \"build\":{\r\n      \"options\":{\r\n        \"lazyModules\": [\r\n          \"src/app/theme-builders/theme-1-builder.module\",\r\n          \"src/app/theme-builders/theme-2-builder.module\"\r\n          ...\r\n          // or even better a glob pattern\r\n        ]\r\n      }\r\n    }\r\n  }\r\n}\r\n```\r\n### Describe alternatives you've considered\r\n\r\nI came across this nice [article](https://netbasal.com/the-need-for-speed-lazy-load-non-routable-modules-in-angular-30c8f1c33093). But it seems to be more complex and doesn't support in-module-routing (I think).","Url":"https://github.com/angular/angular/issues/29747","RelatedDescription":"Open issue \"Lazy load modules based on variables in path\" (#29747)"},{"Id":"430059292","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2019-04-06T17:53:35","Actor":"daem0ndev","Number":"29746","RawContent":null,"Title":"fix(router): hide emptyoutlet from consumers","State":"open","Body":"## PR Checklist\r\nPlease check if your PR fulfills the following requirements:\r\n\r\n- [x] The commit message follows our guidelines: https://github.com/angular/angular/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md#commit\r\n- [x] Tests for the changes have been added (for bug fixes / features)\r\n- [x] Docs have been added / updated (for bug fixes / features)\r\n\r\n\r\n## PR Type\r\nWhat kind of change does this PR introduce?\r\n\r\n<!-- Please check the one that applies to this PR using \"x\". -->\r\n\r\n- [x] Bugfix\r\n- [ ] Feature\r\n- [ ] Code style update (formatting, local variables)\r\n- [ ] Refactoring (no functional changes, no api changes)\r\n- [ ] Build related changes\r\n- [ ] CI related changes\r\n- [ ] Documentation content changes\r\n- [ ] angular.io application / infrastructure changes\r\n- [ ] Other...

This in and of itself, is not the concern. The issue is that, in this particular context, AOT and JIT behave similarly but differ without compiler warnings or errors in one particular case.\r\n\r\nIf I define a function on a route's `data` field, it will appear with JIT on `ActivatedRoute.snapshot.firstChild.data`. However, with AOT, it silently drops this field. No compiler error, no compiler warning. This seems to go against the precedent that has been set, wherein both AOT and JIT give compiler errors if you attempt to build with lambda expressions or non exported functions.\r\n\r\nSee example code below.\r\n\r\n## 🔬 Minimal Reproduction\r\n<!--\r\nSimple steps to reproduce this bug.\r\n\r\nPlease include: commands run (including args), packages added, related code changes.\r\n\r\nIf reproduction steps are not enough for reproduction of your issue, please create a minimal GitHub repository with the reproduction of the issue. \r\nA good way to make a minimal reproduction is to create a new app via `ng new repro-app` and add the minimum possible code to show the problem. \r\nShare the link to the repo below along with step-by-step instructions to reproduce the problem, as well as expected and actual behavior.\r\n\r\nIssues that don't have enough info and can't be reproduced will be closed.\r\n\r\nYou can read more about issue submission guidelines here: https://github.com/angular/angular-cli/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md#-submitting-an-issue\r\n-->\r\n\r\nServe commands with arguments I used.\r\n \r\n```\r\nng serve -c=debug\r\nng serve -c=debug --aot\r\n```\r\n\r\nExample Route\r\n\r\n```\r\n  {\r\n    path: 'someroute',\r\n    component: SomeComponent,\r\n    pathMatch: 'full',\r\n    data: {\r\n      pageTitle: 'Some | Title',\r\n      doesShowUpWithAOT: doesShowUpWithAOT,\r\n      // throwsCompileErrorWithAndWithoutAOT: throwsCompileErrorWithAndWithoutAOT, this behaves as expected\r\n      doesNotShowUpWithAOTAndDoesNotThrowCompilerError() { // behaves inconsistently between JIT and AOT\r\n        console.log('foo');\r\n      },\r\n      // alsoThrowsCompilerErrorWithAndWithoutAOT: () => console.log('foo') this behaves as expected\r\n    }\r\n```\r\n\r\n```\r\n// code from within some class\r\nconstructor(private _route: ActivatedRoute, private _router: Router) {\r\n   this._router.events\r\n      .subcribe(event => {\r\n         if(event instanceof NavigationEnd) {\r\n               const data = this._route.snapshot.firstChild.data;\r\n               const functionMember = data['doesNotShowUpWithAOTAndDoesNotThrowCompilerError']; // is null with AOT, properly defined with JIT\r\n         }\r\n      })\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nI would argue, for the sake of consistency and explicitness, that both AOT and JIT should throw compiler errors, instead of the function making it through in JIT, and dropping away silently in AOT. I believe this would save development time by cutting down on debugging.\r\n\r\nOf course, I am always open to an explanation.\r\n\r\nThanks!\r\n\r\n## 🔥 Exception or Error\r\n<pre><code>\r\n<!-- If the issue is accompanied by an exception or an error, please share it below: -->\r\n<!-- ✍️-->\r\nIn this particular case, there is none, which what I contend the bad behavior (bug) is.\r\n</code></pre>\r\n\r\n\r\n## 🌍 Your Environment\r\nOS: Windows 10 Enterprise, 64-bit\r\n<pre><code>\r\n<!-- run `ng version` and paste output below -->\r\n<!-- ✍️-->\r\n@angular-devkit/architect         0.12.1\r\n@angular-devkit/build-angular     0.12.1\r\n@angular-devkit/build-optimizer   0.12.1\r\n@angular-devkit/build-webpack     0.12.1\r\n@angular-devkit/core              7.2.1\r\n@angular-devkit/schematics        7.2.1\r\n@angular/cli                      7.2.1\r\n@ngtools/webpack                  7.2.1\r\n@schematics/angular               7.2.1\r\n@schematics/update                0.12.1\r\nrxjs                              6.3.3\r\ntypescript                        3.2.2\r\nwebpack                           4.23.1\r\n</code></pre>\r\n\r\n**Anything else relevant?**\r\n<!-- ✍️Is this a browser specific issue?

Also a way to detect window re-activation as opposed to user selection of an element.\r\n\r\n#### What is the use-case or motivation for this proposal?\r\nWhen a browser window loses focus, document.activeElement is *not* changed.  From the DOM's point of view, there is still an \"active\" element, but the FocusMonitor treats this the same as if the user had simply clicked somewhere else on the page.  There are cases where we don't want to blur the state of the page just because it is no longer the active window, and cases where we don't want to go through a re-focus process just because the window became active again.\r\n\r\n#### Is there anything else we should know?\r\nThis change could easily be implemented with minimal breakage by using undefined to mean window deactivated (as both undefined and null are falsey).  'window' could then be added as a FocusOrigin value to signal window activation.\r\n\r\n#### The implementation below has been working well in my own project, but it seems useful enough to merge into the base FocusMonitor.\r\n\r\n`\r\nexport type FocusOriginEx = FocusOrigin | 'window' | undefined;\r\n\r\n@Injectable()\r\nexport class FocusMonitorEx extends FocusMonitor {\r\n\r\n\tconstructor(ngZone: NgZone, platform: Platform) {\r\n\t\tsuper(ngZone, platform);\r\n\t}\r\n\tprivate inactiveElement: Element;\r\n\r\n\t/**\r\n\t * @see #monitor\r\n\t * The difference for this Ex (aka Extended) routine is to be able to also detect window de/re-activation.\r\n\t * This activity might affect how the item displays itself, but it does not mean the document's activeElement was changed.\r\n\t * This is important for instance with a matInput that has a mat-autocomplete currently open.\r\n\t * If focus was shifted elsewhere in the document, null will be emitted (as before).\r\n\t * However, if the window was deactivated but document.activeElement remains unchanged, this will emit undefined (closest thing to null).\r\n\t * When the window is re-activated, but document.activeElement remains *unchanged*, 'window' will be emitted (instead of the original source (e.g. mouse, keyboard, etc.)\r\n\t */\r\n\tmonitorEx(element: HTMLElement | ElementRef<HTMLElement>, checkChildren?: boolean): Observable<FocusOriginEx> {\r\n\t\treturn super.monitor(<any>element, checkChildren).pipe(map((origin: FocusOrigin) => {\r\n\t\t\tif (origin === null) {\r\n\t\t\t\tlet elem = element;\r\n\t\t\t\tif (elem instanceof ElementRef)\r\n\t\t\t\t\telem = elem.nativeElement;\r\n\t\t\t\tlet matchesMonitor = function (e: Element): boolean {\r\n\t\t\t\t\tif (e === null)\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\treturn false;\r\n\t\t\t\t\tif (e === elem) // This is guaranteed by the standard to be equivalent to Node.isSame (but Node.isSame is not supported everywhere).\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\treturn true;\r\n\t\t\t\t\tif (checkChildren && e.parentElement)\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\treturn matchesMonitor(e.parentElement);\r\n\t\t\t\t\treturn false;\r\n\t\t\t\t};\r\n\t\t\t\tif (matchesMonitor(document.activeElement)) {\r\n\t\t\t\t\tthis.inactiveElement = document.activeElement;\r\n\t\t\t\t\treturn undefined;\r\n\t\t\t\t}\r\n\t\t\t} else if (this.inactiveElement) {\r\n\t\t\t\tdelete this.inactiveElement;\r\n\t\t\t\treturn 'window';\r\n\t\t\t}\r\n\t\t\treturn origin;\r\n\t\t}));\r\n\t}\r\n}\r\n`\r\n","Url":"https://github.com/angular/material2/issues/15744","RelatedDescription":"Open issue \"Enhance FocusMonitor to communicate window deactivation vs other forms of focus loss \" (#15744)"},{"Id":"429596939","IsPullRequest":false,"CreatedAt":"2019-04-06T13:40:40","Actor":"mrnateriver","Number":"15727","RawContent":null,"Title":"mat-checkbox checkmark SVG issue when using Ivy","State":"closed","Body":"Checkmark is invisible inside checkbox when using Ivy.\r\nTo be precise, SVG element has 0x0 size, doesn't have styles from its class for some reason and Chrome/Firefox don't even allow setting them manually for the element (this is a really peculiar issue).\r\n\r\n[Screenshot 1](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/mrnateriver/angular-material-checkbox-issue/master/angular_material_checkbox_issue1.png)\r\n[Screenshot 2: Chrome DevTools](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/mrnateriver/angular-material-checkbox-issue/master/angular_material_checkbox_issue2.png)\r\n\r\n#### Bug, feature request, or proposal:\r\nBug.\r\n\r\n#### What is the expected behavior?\r\nCheckmark should be shown.\r\n\r\n#### What is the current behavior?\r\nIt isn't.\r\n\r\n#### What are the steps to reproduce?\r\nhttps://github.com/mrnateriver/angular-material-checkbox-issue\r\n1) `yarn install` or `npm install`;\r\n2) Open `node_modules\\@angular\\common\\fesm5\\http.js` and comment out the last line (`export {HttpClientXsrfModule};`) - this fixes [a problem](https://github.com/angular/angular/issues/28068) in `ivy-ngcc` in Angular 7.x;\r\n3) Run `ng serve`.\r\n\r\n#### Which versions of Angular, Material, OS, TypeScript, browsers are affected?\r\nChrome 73.0.3683.86 and Firefox 66.0.2.\r\n@angular/core 7.2.12\r\n@angular/platform-browser 7.2.12\r\n@angular/material 7.3.7\r\n","Url":"https://github.com/angular/material2/issues/15727","RelatedDescription":"Closed issue \"mat-checkbox checkmark SVG issue when using Ivy\" (#15727)"},{"Id":"430029547","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2019-04-06T12:35:07","Actor":"crisbeto","Number":"15743","RawContent":null,"Title":"refactor: remove mixin classes from public api","State":"open","Body":"Removes the base classes that are being used to apply mixins from the public API.
