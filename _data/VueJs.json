This is illustrated by `countPlusTwo` computed in the example.\r\n\r\nPossible full fix would involve either traversing the full dependency graph to `dirtify` all deep dependants first, or collecting the the array of `dependants of my dependants` like in previous implementation.\r\n\r\n<!-- generated by vue-issues.

Signals are usually carried as events and reacted to via `vm.$on()` resp. `vm.$once()`.\r\nNow that we have `async/await`, we could improve developer ergonomy greatly by having a Promise returned from `vm.$once()` – similar to `vm.$nextTick()`.\r\n\r\n### What does the proposed API look like?\r\n> **Note:** I've omitted any additional boilerplate from the examples below. Please assume each example is executed in the context of an `async` Vue method.\r\n\r\nSo what we'd want to do is deferring the execution of our code until the `signal` event is emitted by our Vue instance.\r\n\r\nA quick recap how this could currently be done:\r\n```javascript\r\n// Old School: Use a callback\r\nthis.$once('signal', (...payload) => {\r\n  // Could lead to some callback hell though\r\n})\r\n\r\n// Alternatively: Wrap in a Promise\r\nconst payload = await new Promise(resolve =>\r\n  this.$once('signal', (...payload) => resolve(payload))\r\n)\r\n// However, this is an awful lot of boilerplate, and it gets incredibly messy if we'd want to await various different signals\r\n```\r\n\r\nHow this would look with the proposed change:\r\n```javascript\r\n// The following $once() call got no callback parameter, so it returns a Promise (which resolves to an array of the event parameters)\r\nconst payload = await this.$once('signal')\r\n\r\n// This is effectively equivalent to the Promise wrap example from above\r\n\r\n// Bonus: Multiple different signals\r\nconst payloads = await Promise.all([\r\n  this.$once('signal-1'),\r\n  this.$once('signal-2'),\r\n  this.$once('signal-3')\r\n])\r\n```\r\n\r\nNote that a Promise would only be returned if the callback parameter was omitted, so the following still works:\r\n```javascript\r\n// Inside some method\r\nthis\r\n  .$once('signal', (...payload) => {\r\n    // This $once() call still returns the Vue instance, no change to current behaviour\r\n  })\r\n  .$on('other-event', () => {\r\n    // That means we can still chain event listeners and avoid a practical breaking change\r\n  })\r\n```\r\n\r\nWhile this is technically a breaking change, it's a rather soft one since previously using the `$once()` method without a callback had no use case.\r\n\r\nTo me, this change sounds like pretty low-hanging fruit.

Great! However, when an anchor tag is appended to trigger an app behavior (e.g. www.my-vue-spa.com/playlist-1234#fullview), the router pushes this as part of the history so that the back-button undoes the anchor state instead of returning to the previous page.\r\n\r\n### What does the proposed API look like?\r\nThe proposed solution would be to enforce what the current documentation currently suggests: to not let anchor tags drive routing history.

The only action in our entire application that does not have such effects is our scroll to effect.  As it is the only transition-free state change, it often is jarring to users when it occurs.  Adding a simple scroll effect to the scroll behavior would go a long way to making the user experience for many Vue applications more seamless.\r\n\r\n### What does the proposed API look like?\r\nHonestly I have no idea what this would look like as I have only just begun looking into your docs today.

But right now it can (accidentally) be circumvented with closures, by adding a function to the state.\r\n\r\n```javascript\r\n// Create a closure\r\nconst myFunctionFactory = () => {\r\n\tconst myValues = {\r\n\t\tfoo: 0,\r\n\t};\r\n\r\n\treturn () => {\r\n\t\tmyValues.foo  = 1;\r\n\t\treturn myValues.foo;\r\n\t};\r\n};\r\n\r\n// Get the function inside the closure\r\nconst myFunction = myFunctionFactory();\r\n\r\n// Add the function to the state\r\nVue.set( state, 'myFunction', myFunction );\r\n\r\n// New each time the function is called, a different result is returned\r\nstate.myFunction(); // => 1;\r\nstate.myFunction(); // => 2;\r\nstate.myFunction(); // => 3;\r\nstate.myFunction(); // => 4;\r\n```\r\n\r\nThis can introduce really subtle bugs and also makes time travel unusable. There also seems to be no way to prevent this, except for not allowing functions in state at all.\r\n\r\nIt would be great to hear other peoples opinions on the subject.\r\n\r\n### What does the proposed API look like?\r\nIn my opinion adding functions to the state should be discouraged in docs.\r\n\r\nIn dev mode it would be great if an error could be thrown if a function is discovered in the state - at least if strict mode is enabled or something like that.\r\n\r\n<!-- generated by vue-issues.
