In my current case, this is a problem, because my word doc template is 27 megs, but has numerous conditionals (especially around large images I need to hide/show based on data). \r\n\r\nAfter the doc is assembled, I expect the assembled file to only be around 5 megs. Testing this assertion, I can open the 27 meg assembled document into MS Word, make a small change (add a space for example), save it, and now the saved file is only around 5 megs. This can make a huge difference in user experience, for example, when my users attempt to use my generated document as attachments in mail systems with attachment size limits."},{"Id":"7177141433","Type":"IssuesEvent","CreatedAt":"2018-01-31T12:36:13","Actor":"mesteves","Repository":"OfficeDev/Open-Xml-PowerTools","Organization":"OfficeDev","RawContent":null,"RelatedAction":"opened","RelatedUrl":"https://github.com/OfficeDev/Open-Xml-PowerTools/issues/201","RelatedDescription":"Opened issue \"Images Support\" (#201) at OfficeDev/Open-Xml-PowerTools","RelatedBody":"\r\nHi any plans to include something image support like this fork \r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/krembf/Open-Xml-PowerTools/commit/3779fc4f8ed11432b81f133a095f0fc3fe84c86e\r\n\r\nThanks in advance!"},{"Id":"7114740250","Type":"PullRequestEvent","CreatedAt":"2018-01-18T02:27:51","Actor":"lpperras","Repository":"OfficeDev/Open-Xml-PowerTools","Organization":"OfficeDev","RawContent":null,"RelatedAction":"opened","RelatedUrl":"https://github.com/OfficeDev/Open-Xml-PowerTools/pull/200","RelatedDescription":"Opened pull request \"Safe HTML to wml\" (#200) at OfficeDev/Open-Xml-PowerTools","RelatedBody":"Check for properties that could be null when HTML is parsed."}],"ResultType":"GitHubEvent"}},"RunOn":"2018-02-11T05:30:27.0979008Z","RunDurationInMilliseconds":1567}
