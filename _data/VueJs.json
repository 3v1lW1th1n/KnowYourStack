Why would anyone design an API (I'm talking about web standard) where you can't properly track the user movements...?? Fail? I'm so enraged by this, I just don't understand and I suppose I missed something.\r\n\r\nCurrently, when a user triggers the back or forward button, it triggers the same `onpopstate` event and gives absolutely no information aside from a 'key' in a state object. So from there I thought about manually tracking the history state key and guessing where the user has been but I guess it wouldn't be cross-compatible, and also it's heavy code to lift.\r\n\r\nHere is my question: How would you do it? Am I missing some key element in the API?\r\n\r\nThank you in advance!"},{"Id":"6639259392","Type":"IssuesEvent","CreatedAt":"2017-09-26T16:02:19","Actor":"posva","Repository":"vuejs/vue-router","Organization":"vuejs","RawContent":null,"RelatedAction":"closed","RelatedUrl":"https://github.com/vuejs/vue-router/issues/1763","RelatedDescription":"Closed issue \"Add official support for module loader\" (#1763) at vuejs/vue-router","RelatedBody":"### What problem does this feature solve?\r\nAs a developer to optimize the final chunk size and better organize my Vuex modules, I only want to load my components and inject its modules when it's rendered.
