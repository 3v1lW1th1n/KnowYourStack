I've also added support for this to the label tag helper via the `asp-for-value` attribute (and the `idModifier` parameter in the `IHtmlGenerator`'s code\n\nFor the checkbox support with the backing array, I've created a `CollectionInputTagHelper`, which can generate a radio button or a checkbox, backed by a collection (any array, enumerable, list etc) property. It uses the code that generates a radio button, and sets the `checked` property if the value of the input is present in the collection.\n\nTo optimise this check, the `value` of the input is bound to an object (unlike the string based value that's bound in `InputTagHelper`). This way I don't have to convert every value of the array when checking for a match.

Here is some sample code that we use to achieve it:\r\n\r\n        public static string Base64UrlEncode(byte[] input)\r\n        {\r\n            var output = Convert.ToBase64String(input)\r\n                .Replace('+', '-')\r\n                .Replace('/', '_')\r\n                .Replace(\"=\", string.Empty);\r\n            return output;\r\n        }\r\n\r\n        public static byte[] Base64UrlDecode(string input)\r\n        {\r\n            var output = input;\r\n            // 62nd char of encoding\r\n            output = output.Replace('-', '+');\r\n            // 63rd char of encoding\r\n            output = output.Replace('_', '/');\r\n            // Pad with trailing '='s\r\n            switch(output.Length % 4)\r\n            {\r\n                case 0:\r\n                    // No pad chars in this case\r\n                    break;\r\n                case 2:\r\n                    // Two pad chars\r\n                    output += \"==\"; break;\r\n                case 3:\r\n                    // One pad char\r\n                    output += \"=\"; break;\r\n                default:\r\n                    throw new InvalidOperationException(\"Illegal base64url string!\");\r\n            }\r\n\r\n            // Standard base64 decoder\r\n            return Convert.FromBase64String(output);\r\n        }"},{"Id":"7662609604","Type":"IssuesEvent","CreatedAt":"2018-05-11T18:07:18","Actor":"AdamAnandUS","Repository":"aspnet/Identity","Organization":"aspnet","RawContent":null,"RelatedAction":"opened","RelatedUrl":"https://github.com/aspnet/Identity/issues/1787","RelatedDescription":"Opened issue \"Invalid Token Error when hosted on thrid-party Server\" (#1787) at aspnet/Identity","RelatedBody":"var result = await _userManager.ConfirmEmailAsync(user, code);\r\n\r\nThis code will never work and always ends up with \"Invalid Token\" when hosted from a third-party hosting provider where there is no RDP and where I cannot change any IIS Server Settings.

This proposal is to create a design-time directive in the Razor language.  The design time directive indicates that the file contents following the directive will be modified by some process. The design-time directive provides hooks and extension points into a cshtml file to enable actions to take place at design time. These can be trigged manually, by Visual Studio, or other processing.\r\n## Design-Time Directive\r\nThe design-time directive is used to communicate with parsers, file processors, and the Razor Engine.\r\n\r\n- It takes the general form: `@[...]`\r\n- It can take parameters: `@[parser, action, parameters]`\r\n- It can have scope: `@[...]{  ...  }`\r\n\r\nThe design-time directive indicates to a process (external or internal) that an area of the file will/can be modified by the process. The directive has no impact on it's own.\r\n\r\nIt is removed at compile time by the Razor Engine from the resulting html.\r\n## Examples\r\n\r\n### Substitution\r\nThe most trivial use of the directive is to insert a group of characters into the file.\r\nGiven - `@[myText] = \"This is some text to repeat.\"`\r\nUsing - `@[myText]`\r\nProduces => `This is some text to repeat.`\r\nThe directive isn't actually replaced. The text is inserted after the directive.\r\nAny characters can be used - text, tags, code.\r\nIn initial cshtml:\r\n```\r\n  @[myText] \r\n```\r\nAfter the substitution process runs, in cshtml:\r\n```\r\n  @[myText]\r\n  This is some text to repeat.\r\n```\r\nIn html:\r\n```\r\n  This is some text to repeat.\r\n```\r\nChanging the text in the assignment changes the results in all files using the directive when the process runs again. Though the directive doesn't technically have impact on it's own, some features like substitution would be built into the environment.\r\n\r\n### Merging\r\nRazor is especially interesting because it can be a mix of many languages - cs, css, js, html. Setting aside the \"correctness\" of putting css or js in an cshtml file, they provide fair examples. In an html/cshtml file, we can include `<script></script>` and `<style></style>` blocks. For the sake of argument, let's say we have a compelling reason to include content inside them in the file. Writing the code in the page is messy, and can be problematic. Worse, many of us prefer Less and Typescript, which we can't write in-page. The `@[]` directive helps.\r\n\r\nWe can write our css in a Less file - `styles.less`, that compiles into `styles.css`, and our js in `scripts.ts`, that compiles into `scripts.js`. We get full editor and intellisense support. In our `Page.cshml` we can include the results.\r\n```\r\n  @[style, \"~/styles.css\"]\r\n     ... The contents of styles.css are copied into the page here, in a <style> block.\r\n  @[script, \"~/scripts.js]\r\n     ... The contents of scripts.js are copied into the page here in a <script> block.\r\n```\r\nThis happens during design - the file content is modified, triggered manually, by the IDE, or an extension. For example, after Web Essentials compiles a Less file into css, it could also update the pages that reference the css file through design-time directives. Though the end result is much like `@render`, we get a local copy that provides access to the internals, and allows modification if we turn \"auto-update\" off.\r\n\r\nSelectors help keep files small. If we just need a couple of styles or functions, we can only copy them.\r\n```\r\n  @[style, \"~/styles.css\", { .form-controls-block, .nav-link } ]\r\n  @[script, \"~/scripts.js\", { datepicker } ]\r\n```\r\nThis would pull the two styles and single function out of the files, and insert them into the page inside`<style>` and `<script>` blocks. This can be helpful in building small, self-contained, and lightweight components.\r\n\r\n### Templates\r\nHtml Templating is another other possibility. This can be used in regular files or in template/scaffolding engines. An overly simple example is the common label-input-validation set - \r\n  `<label asp-for=\"ModelProperty\"><input asp-for=\"ModelProperty\"></input><...validationstuff...`\r\nThere are many ways to approach this, but one could be (in a cshtml) \r\n```\r\n@[]{\r\n  form-line = \"<label asp-for=\"@[param]\" ... \" \r\n}\r\n\r\n@[form-line, param=\"ModelProperty\"]\r\n   ... Fragment is expanded here, with replacement.\r\n```\r\nTemplates are like advanced, dynamic Snippets, and can be defined in the page or in shared files. They can auto update, or be manually triggered.\r\n\r\n### Targeting\r\nWhen we know we are running a file processor over the file, we can define targets. This can make the processor more efficient, and the file easier to parse. The processor can look for tagged areas to process, or even exclude.\r\n```\r\n  @[fileProcessorName, processingAction, exclude] {\r\n       ... This section is skipped by fileProcessorName when executing processingAction \r\n         - if it is aware of design-time directives.\r\n  }\r\n```\r\n## Discussion Scope\r\nThis proposal isn't about any of the specific examples, but about the concept of being able to provide information to processes that manipulate code files. And if so, is `@[]` a good construct to use? More and more, we run processes against these files - from built-in formatting processes, to refactoring, to analysis processes. A standard way to communicate with these processors might be valuable. \r\n\r\n## Outside the Proposal\r\nThe concept can also extend into other languages.\r\nThough advanced, this could allow things like name refactoring for related items in different technologies. For example, a C# class and Typescript class could have a design-time association. Changing one triggers changes to the other. This is a design-time change - the files are modified directly. The association doesn't exist at compile or run time. This would be a long time coming, but shows possible potential of the overall concept. \r\n"},{"Id":"7663458056","Type":"IssuesEvent","CreatedAt":"2018-05-11T21:25:00","Actor":"mkArtakMSFT","Repository":"aspnet/Razor","Organization":"aspnet","RawContent":null,"RelatedAction":"closed","RelatedUrl":"https://github.com/aspnet/Razor/issues/2342","RelatedDescription":"Closed issue \"View Components cannot be included, mystery exception references irrelevant model.\" (#2342) at aspnet/Razor","RelatedBody":"This is a follow up to https://github.com/aspnet/Docs/issues/6278 A quest trying to figure out what is the default search path for ViewComponents\r\n\r\nProbably I am doing something wrong, but I cannot get ViewComponent to be included in a page. \r\n\r\n\r\nI have a folder structure:\r\n```\r\n- Pages\r\n  - Components\r\n    - ExternalSystems\r\n      - Default.cshtml\r\n- Views\r\n  - Shared\r\n    - Components\r\n      - ExternalSystems\r\n        - Default.cshtml\r\n```\r\n\r\nwithin `Pages/Index.cshtml` i'v tried to include this component by trial & error (i'm learning this stuff after all):\r\n```\r\n@await Component.InvokeAsync(\"ExternalSystems\");\r\n@await Component.InvokeAsync(\"/Pages/Components/ExternalSystems\");\r\n@await Component.InvokeAsync(\"/Pages/Components/ExternalSystems/Default\");\r\n@await Component.InvokeAsync(\"/Pages/Components/ExternalSystems/Default.cshtml\");\r\n@await Component.InvokeAsync(\"/Views/Shared/ExternalSystems\");\r\n```\r\n\r\nI expected that exception will show places searched like it does for `@Html.Partial`:\r\n> InvalidOperationException: The partial view 'none' was not found.

Direct dependencies are dependencies where you specifically add a package to your project, transitive dependencies occur when you add a package to your project that in turn relies on another package.\r\n\r\nFor example, the `Microsoft.AspNetCore.Mvc` package depends on the `Microsoft.AspNetCore.Mvc.Core` package. When you add a dependency on `Microsoft.AspNetCore.Mvc` in your project, you're taking a transitive dependency on `Microsoft.AspNetCore.Mvc.Core`.\r\n\r\nAny application that has a direct or transitive dependency on the [affected packages](#affected-software) can be exposed to the vulnerability.\r\n\r\n### How do I fix the issue?\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\nIf you're targeting .NET Core 2.x and the `Microsoft.AspNetCore.All` \"metapackage\":\r\n\r\n* Update its version number to 2.0.8 if you have targetted 2.0.x *OR*\r\n* Update its version number to 2.1.0-rc1-final if you have targetted previews of 2.1\r\n\r\nUpdating the metapackage will update the [affected packages](#affected-software)\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n.NET Core projects have two types of dependencies: direct and transitive. You must update your projects using the following instructions to address both types of dependency.\r\n\r\n#### Direct dependencies\r\n\r\nDirect dependencies are discoverable by examining your *csproj* file. They can be fixed by [editing the csproj file](#direct-dependencies) or using NuGet to update the dependency.\r\n\r\n#### Transitive dependencies\r\n\r\nTransitive dependencies occur when you add a package to your project that in turn relies on another package. For example, if Contoso publishes a package `Contoso.Utility` which, in turn, depends on `Contoso.Internals` and you add the `Contoso.Utility` package to your project now your project has a direct dependency on `Contoso.Utility` and, because `Contoso.Utility` depends 'Contoso.Internals', your application gains a transitive dependency on the `Contoso.Internals` package.\r\n\r\nTransitive dependencies are reviewable in two ways:\r\n\r\n* In the Visual Studio Solution Explorer window, which supports searching.\r\n* By examining the *project.assets.json* file contained in the obj directory of your project.\r\n\r\nThe *project.assets.json* files are the authoritative list of all packages used by your project, containing both direct and transitive dependencies.\r\n\r\n#### <a name=\"direct-dependencies\"></a>Fixing direct dependencies\r\n\r\nOpen *projectname.csproj* in your editor. If you're using Visual Studio, right-click the project and choose **Edit projectname.csproj** from the context menu, where projectname is the name of your project. Look for `PackageReference` elements. The following shows an example project file:\r\n\r\n```xml\r\n<Project Sdk=\"Microsoft.NET.Sdk\">\r\n  <PropertyGroup>\r\n    <TargetFramework>netcoreapp2.0</TargetFramework>\r\n  </PropertyGroup>\r\n  <ItemGroup>\r\n    <PackageReference Include=\"Microsoft.AspNetCore.Server.Kestrel.Core\" Version=\"2.0.1\" />\r\n  </ItemGroup>\r\n</Project>\r\n```\r\n\r\nThe preceding example has a reference to a [vulnerable package](#affected-software), as seen by the single `PackageReference` element. The name of the package is in the `Include` attribute.\r\nThe package version number is in the `Version` attribute. The previous example shows a single direct dependency on `Microsoft.AspNetCore.Server.Kestrel.Core` version 2.0.1.\r\n\r\nTo update the version to the secure package, change the version number to the updated package version as listed on the table [previously](#affected-software).\r\nIn this example, update `Microsoft.AspNetCore.Server.Kestrel.Core` to a [fixed package number](#affected-software). Save the *csproj* file. The example *csproj* now looks as follows:\r\n\r\n```xml\r\n<Project Sdk=\"Microsoft.NET.Sdk\">\r\n  <PropertyGroup>\r\n    <TargetFramework>netcoreapp2.0</TargetFramework>\r\n  </PropertyGroup>\r\n  <ItemGroup>\r\n    <PackageReference Include=\"Microsoft.AspNetCore.Server.Kestrel.Core\" Version=\"2.0.3 />\r\n  </ItemGroup>\r\n</Project>\r\n```\r\n\r\nIf you're using Visual Studio and you save your updated *csproj* file, Visual Studio will restore the new package version.\r\nYou can see the restore results by opening the **Output** window (Ctrl+Alt+O) and changing the **Show output from** drop-down list to **Package Manager**.\r\n\r\nIf you're not using Visual Studio, open a command line and change to your project directory. Execute the `dotnet restore` command to restore the updated dependencies.\r\n\r\nNow recompile your application. If after recompilation you see a *Dependency conflict warning*, you must update your other direct dependencies to versions that take a dependency on the updated package.\r\n\r\nAfter you've addressed all of your direct dependencies, you must review your transitive dependencies.\r\n\r\n#### Discovering and fixing transitive dependencies\r\n\r\nThere are two ways to view transitive dependencies. You can either [use Visual Studio’s Solution Explorer](#vs-solution-explorer), or you can [review the *project.assets.json* file](#project-assets-json).\r\n\r\n##### <a name=\"vs-solution-explorer\"></a>Using Visual Studio Solution Explorer\r\n\r\nTo use Solution Explorer, open the project in Visual Studio 2017, and then press Ctrl+; to activate the search in Solution Explorer. Search for each of the [vulnerable packages](#affected-software) and make a note of the version numbers of any results you find.\r\n\r\nFor example, searching for `Microsoft.AspNetCore.Mvc.Core` in an example project that contains a package that takes a dependency on `Microsoft.AspNetCore.Mvc` shows the following results in Visual Studio 2017:\r\n\r\n![Screenshot of search results in Visual Studio 2017](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/796298/25858816/8ecdc2b4-3491-11e7-9363-746804bb9832.png)\r\n\r\nThe search results appear as a tree. In the previous results, you can see that a reference to `Microsoft.AspNetCore.Mvc.Core` version 1.1.2 is discovered.\r\n\r\nUnder the Dependencies node is a NuGet node. Under the NuGet node is the list of packages you have directly taken a dependency on and their versions.\r\nIn screenshot, the application takes a direct dependency on `Microsoft.AspNetCore.Mvc`. `Microsoft.AspNetCore.Mvc` in turn has leaf nodes that list its dependencies and their versions.\r\nThe `Microsoft.AspNetCore.Mvc` package takes a dependency on a version of `Microsoft.AspNetCore.Mvc.ApiExplorer`, that in turn takes a dependency on a version of `Microsoft.AspNetCore.Mvc.Core`.\r\n\r\n##### <a name=\"project-assets-json\"></a>Manually reviewing project.assets.json\r\n\r\nOpen the *project.assets.json* file from your project’s obj directory in your editor. We suggest you use an editor that understands JSON and allows you to collapse and expand nodes to review this file.\r\nVisual Studio and Visual Studio Code provide JSON friendly editing.\r\n\r\nSearch the *project.assets.json* file for the [vulnerable package](#affected-software), using the format `packagename/` for each of the package names from the preceding table. If you find the assembly name in your search:\r\n\r\n* Examine the line on which they are found, the version number is after the `/`.\r\n* Compare to the [vulnerable versions table](#affected-software).\r\n\r\nFor example, a search result that shows `System.Security.Cryptography.Xml/4.4.0` is a reference to version 4.4.0 of `System.Security.Cryptography.Xml`.\r\nIf your *project.assets.json* file includes references to the [vulnerable package](#affected-software), then you need to fix the transitive dependencies.\r\n\r\n##### Fixing transitive dependencies\r\n\r\nIf you have not found any reference to any vulnerable packages, this means either\r\n\r\n* None of your direct dependencies depend on any vulnerable packages, or\r\n* You have already fixed the problem by updating the direct dependencies.\r\n\r\nIf your transitive dependency review found references to the [vulnerable package](#affected-software), you must add a direct dependency to the updated package to your *csproj* file to override the transitive dependency.\r\n\r\nOpen *projectname.csproj* in your editor. If you're using Visual Studio, right-click the project and choose **Edit projectname.csproj** from the context menu, where projectname is the name of your project.\r\nLook for `PackageReference` nodes, for example:\r\n\r\n```xml\r\n<Project Sdk=\"Microsoft.NET.Sdk.\">\r\n  <PropertyGroup>\r\n    <TargetFramework>net461</TargetFramework>\r\n  </PropertyGroup>\r\n  <ItemGroup>\r\n    <PackageReference Include=\"ThirdParty.NotUpdatedYet\" Version=\"2.0.0\" />\r\n  </ItemGroup>\r\n</Project>\r\n```\r\n\r\nYou must add a direct dependency to the updated version of the [vulnerable package](#affected-software) by adding it to the *csproj* file.\r\nYou do this by adding a new line to the dependencies section, referencing the fixed version.\r\nFor example, if your search showed a transitive reference to a vulnerable `Microsoft.AspNetCore.Server.Kestrel.Core` version, you'd add a reference to the [fixed package number](#affected-software).\r\n\r\n```xml\r\n<Project Sdk=\"Microsoft.NET.Sdk.Web\">\r\n  <PropertyGroup>\r\n    <TargetFramework>net461</TargetFramework>\r\n  </PropertyGroup>\r\n  <ItemGroup>\r\n    <PackageReference Include=\"Microsoft.AspNetCore.Server.Kestrel.Core\" Version=\"2.0.3\" />\r\n    <PackageReference Include=\"ThirdParty.NotUpdatedYet\" Version=\"2.0.0\" />\r\n  </ItemGroup>\r\n</Project>\r\n```\r\n\r\nAfter you've added the direct dependency reference, save your *csproj* file.\r\n\r\nIf you're using Visual Studio, save your updated *csproj* file and Visual Studio will restore the new package versions.\r\nYou can see the restore results by opening the **Output** window (Ctrl+Alt+O) and changing the **Show output from** drop-down list to **Package Manager**.\r\n\r\nIf you're not using Visual Studio, open a command line and change to your project directory. Execute the `dotnet restore` command to restore the new dependencies.\r\n\r\n#### Rebuilding your application\r\n\r\nFinally you must rebuild your application, test, and redeploy.\r\n\r\n## Other Information\r\n\r\n### Reporting Security Issues\r\n\r\nIf you have found a potential security issue in .NET Core, please email details to secure@microsoft.com.
