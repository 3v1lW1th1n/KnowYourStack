Support for type inference of usage of generic-typed components is coming next.\r\n\r\nYou can define type parameters on a component with the new `@typeparam` directive. There is currently no support for type constraints when defining generic-typed components from Razor.\r\n\r\nIf you are defining a component from C# then everything should 'just work' the way you'd expect.\r\n\r\nMost of the work and tricky cases are related to making it possible to consume generic-typed components in generated code.\r\n\r\n## How does it work\r\n\r\nWhen we discover a generic-typed component, we synthesize an extra 'type-argument' attribute for each type-parameter. This gives us intellisense and completion support for specifying types when using the component. The type argument must be a nominal type (like the inside of a `typeof(...)` expression.. ie, it can't be a variable.\r\n\r\nOnce we've bound the component tree and processed cross-cutting features like event handlers and `bind` we find each generic-typed component and process the type parameters. We rewrite the type name of the component and the type name of each parameter that's set (for type-checking) and do code generation with the type-arguments substituted in.\r\n\r\nThis approach obviously won't be used for type-inference, but it's an important feature to provide for cases where you want to (or need to) be specific. \r\n\r\n## Misc\r\n\r\nWhen setting a generic-typed parameter, you won't get support for the shorthand the Razor supports for `string` attributes.\r\n\r\nEx: `<Generic TValue=string Value=\"Foo\" />`\r\nIn this example if `Value` is of type `TValue` then `Foo` will be interpreted as C# not as the contents of a string. \r\n\r\n--\r\n\r\nWhen using generics, there's always the possibility that the error messages could be confusing or misleading when the generic types can't be figured out. I've tried my best to minimize the error cases that you'll get in the editor, so that you can clearly see the error that Blazor reports about missing generic types. If you hit cases where the error messages are misleading, please let us know.","Url":"https://github.com/aspnet/Blazor/pull/1417","RelatedDescription":"Closed or merged PR \"Add support for
