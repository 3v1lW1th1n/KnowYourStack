An example:\r\n\r\n[Terms of use](/#) | [Privacy policy](/#)\r\n\r\nFor lack of an available component, some Bulma-based sites are currently hard-coding such an element. An example is the bottom-of-page menu at https://www.saashub.com.\r\n\r\nBulma currently ships with several similar components:\r\n\r\n* [Breadcrumb](https://bulma.io/documentation/components/breadcrumb/)\r\n* [Navbar](https://bulma.io/documentation/components/navbar/)\r\n* [[Horizontal] Menu](https://bulma.io/documentation/components/menu/)\r\n\r\nHowever, none is a direct fit for a menu bar.\r\n\r\n### Proposed solution\r\nIntroduce a new component, `menubar`. This would be closely modelled on `breadcrumb` with the following differences:\r\n\r\n* Default separator character is vertical bar (|) rather than solidus (/).\r\n* Default value for horizontal item padding is 0.5em rather than 0.75\r\n`$menubar-item-padding-horizontal: 0.5em !default`.\r\n* Separator options include `.has-solidus-separator` to use the solidus but not `.has-arrow-separator` or `.has-succeeds-separator` as these imply a hierarchy which isn't applicable here.","Url":"https://github.com/jgthms/bulma/issues/2464","RelatedDescription":"Open issue \"Add new menubar component\" (#2464)"},{"Id":"432834828","IsPullRequest":false,"CreatedAt":"2019-04-28T11:36:32","Actor":"HJain13","Number":"2447","RawContent":null,"Title":"Image overflows even after setting size","State":"closed","Body":"This is about **Bulma**.\r\n\r\nThis is a possible **Bug/Feature**.\r\nIt's not a browser bug. \r\n\r\n### Overview of the problem\r\nThis is about the Bulma **CSS framework**\r\nI'm using Bulma **0.7.2** \r\nMy **browser** is: Google Chrome v74\r\nI am sure this issue is **not a duplicate**\r\n\r\n### Description\r\nAfter setting image size to be 64x64.

I ran into the minor issue of skimming the page and thinking these shortened names would be the actual class names to use. This also improves consistency with the rest of the page where the prefix is always included.\r\n\r\n### Comparison\r\n**Current state:**\r\n- `block`\r\n- `flex`\r\n- `inline`\r\n- `inline-block`\r\n- `inline-flex`\r\n\r\n**Proposed state:**\r\n- `is-block`\r\n- `is-flex`\r\n- `is-inline`\r\n- `is-inline-block`\r\n- `is-inline-flex`\r\n\r\n### Tradeoffs\r\nAdding the `is-` prefix is arguably a little bit more verbose and redundant in the list. However, I believe it is more valuable to read the literal class name.\r\n\r\n### Testing Done\r\nYes, I built and served the documentation locally to confirm that the modified page is not broken somehow.\r\n","Url":"https://github.com/jgthms/bulma/pull/2454","RelatedDescription":"Closed or merged PR \"Add is- prefix to list of display helper classes\" (#2454)"},{"Id":"434292182","IsPullRequest":false,"CreatedAt":"2019-04-17T13:47:34","Actor":"DerekCrosson","Number":"2453","RawContent":null,"Title":"Question - Modal Animation Prop","State":"closed","Body":"How do I remove the animation prop from a modal?
