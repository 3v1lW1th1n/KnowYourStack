Every micro frontend is lazy loaded dynamically at runtime, no static dependency at build time. \r\nRight now we are struggling with global vs local styles. \r\nThe requirement is that every micro frontend is separated as much as possible. \r\nAll styles from Beta micro frontend shoudn't interfere with Alpha's styles (when loaded in the Gateway together). \r\n\r\nOne solution is to avoid global styles (empty `styles.scss`) and provide something like `global.scss` which is then included in the every component ([example](https://github.com/Marfusios/micro-frontend-beta/blob/master/src/entry/buttons-example/buttons-example.component.scss)). It works fine, styles are encapsulated, but it brings undesirable code duplication, every style is duplicated to every component. \r\nIf we want to use some large design library, like Angular Material (DevExtreme, Clarity Design), it would bloat really fast. \r\n\r\nDo you have any idea, with current Angular features, how to do this?\r\n* Alpha micro frontend will use DevExtreme design library\r\n* Beta micro frontend will use Clarity design library\r\n* after loading and displaying in the Gateway the styles won't interfere\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n### Describe the solution you'd like\r\nFor example, inside `angular.json`: \r\n```\r\n            \"encapsulatedStyles\": [\r\n              \"src/global.scss\"\r\n            ]\r\n```\r\nThen it will use global shadowing for the whole application. \r\nRuntime example: \r\n`.my-class[_nghost-xxx]` \r\n`h1[_nghost-xxx]` \r\nwhere `xxx` could be randomly generated hash or name of the application. \r\n\r\n","Url":"https://github.com/angular/angular/issues/28236","RelatedDescription":"Open issue \"Shared ViewEncapsulation for all global styles in the application\" (#28236)"},{"Id":"400735938","IsPullRequest":false,"CreatedAt":"2019-01-18T13:59:07","Actor":"BaggersIO","Number":"28235","RawContent":null,"Title":"@.disabled with infinite child animations freezes the tab / process","State":"open","Body":"<!--üîÖüîÖüîÖüîÖüîÖüîÖüîÖüîÖüîÖüîÖüîÖüîÖüîÖüîÖüîÖüîÖüîÖüîÖüîÖüîÖüîÖüîÖüîÖüîÖüîÖüîÖüîÖüîÖüîÖüîÖüîÖ\r\n\r\nOh hi there! üòÑ\r\n\r\nTo expedite issue processing please search open and closed issues before submitting a new one.\r\nExisting issues often contain information about workarounds, resolution, or progress updates.\r\n\r\nüîÖüîÖüîÖüîÖüîÖüîÖüîÖüîÖüîÖüîÖüîÖüîÖüîÖüîÖüîÖüîÖüîÖüîÖüîÖüîÖüîÖüîÖüîÖüîÖüîÖüîÖüîÖüîÖüîÖüîÖüîÖüîÖüîÖ-->\r\n\r\n\r\n# üêû bug report\r\n\r\n### Affected Package\r\n```\r\n@angular/animations\r\n@angular/platform-browser/animations\r\n```\r\n\r\n### Is this a regression?\r\n\r\nNo.\r\n\r\n### Description\r\n\r\n1. I played with infinite animations. One approach was to trigger a random state after `animation.done` for replay. This works fine.\r\n\r\n2. Now I want to disable the animation using `@.disabled` in a parent element. This freezes the tab / browser.\r\n\r\n__What happens?__\r\n\r\nWhen using `@.disabled` Angular starts the child animation and stops it instantly. This triggers animation.start and animation.done even the animation should be 'disabled'. \r\nIn my example `animation.done` generates a new state which kicks off another animation; but it will be canceled by the parent `@.disabled` and so on. This results in infinite animation start/stop events and freezes the client.\r\n\r\n\r\n## üî¨ Minimal Reproduction\r\n\r\nAdd the `@.disabled` attribute to the parent div in line one to reproduce the bug.\r\n\r\nhttps://stackblitz.com/edit/angular-disabled-animation-bug?file=src%2Fapp%2Fapp.component.html\r\n\r\n## üî• Exception or Error\r\n\r\nNo error thrown but the tab/process freezes.\r\n\r\n## üåç  Your Environment\r\n\r\n**Angular Version:**\r\n<pre><code>\r\nAngular CLI: 7.2.1\r\nNode: 10.14.2\r\nOS: darwin x64\r\nAngular: 7.2.0\r\n... animations, common, compiler, compiler-cli, core, forms\r\n... language-service, platform-browser, platform-browser-dynamic\r\n... router\r\n\r\nPackage                           Version\r\n-----------------------------------------------------------\r\n@angular-devkit/architect         0.12.1\r\n@angular-devkit/build-angular     0.12.1\r\n@angular-devkit/build-optimizer   0.12.1\r\n@angular-devkit/build-webpack     0.12.1\r\n@angular-devkit/core              7.2.1\r\n@angular-devkit/schematics        7.2.1\r\n@angular/cli                      7.2.1\r\n@ngtools/webpack                  7.2.1\r\n@schematics/angular               7.2.1\r\n@schematics/update                0.12.1\r\nrxjs                              6.3.3\r\ntypescript                        3.2.2\r\nwebpack                           4.23.1\r\n</code></pre>\r\n\r\n**Anything else relevant?**\r\n\r\nMacOS Mojave 10.14.2 \r\nAffects Chrome 71, Brave 71, Firefox, Safari\r\n","Url":"https://github.com/angular/angular/issues/28235","RelatedDescription":"Open issue \"@.disabled with infinite child animations freezes the tab / process\" (#28235)"},{"Id":"400728968","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2019-01-18T13:40:17","Actor":"alikadir","Number":"28234","RawContent":null,"Title":"changed webpack configuration sample","State":"open","Body":"\"mode\" parameter must be set value in \"none\", \"development\" or \"production\" in webpack.server.config.js file\r\n\r\n## PR Checklist\r\nPlease check if your PR fulfills the following requirements:\r\n\r\n- [ ] The commit message follows our guidelines: https://github.com/angular/angular/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md#commit\r\n- [ ] Tests for the changes have been added (for bug fixes / features)\r\n- [ ] Docs have been added / updated (for bug fixes / features)\r\n\r\n\r\n## PR Type\r\nWhat kind of change does this PR introduce?\r\n\r\n<!-- Please check the one that applies to this PR using \"x\". -->\r\n\r\n- [ ] Bugfix\r\n- [ ] Feature\r\n- [ ] Code style update (formatting, local variables)\r\n- [ ] Refactoring (no functional changes, no api changes)\r\n- [ ] Build related changes\r\n- [ ] CI related changes\r\n- [x] Documentation content changes\r\n- [ ] angular.io application / infrastructure changes\r\n- [ ] Other...

It would be nice to be able to create a tree from a [glob pattern](https://docs.python.org/2/library/glob.html) url.\r\n\r\nMy use case was moving a `package.json` file from one directory to another by using a schematics \"factory\".\r\n\r\n```ts\r\nexport function movePackage( _options: Options ): Rule {\r\n  return ( _host: Tree, _context: SchematicContext ) => {\r\n    return mergeWith( apply( url( 'path/to/app/root' ), [\r\n      filter( ( path: Path ) => {\r\n        // This will visit and check EVERY file in the directory\r\n        return path === '/package.json';\r\n      } ),\r\n      move( '.', 'some/destination/path' ),\r\n    ] ) );\r\n  };\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\n```ts\r\nexport function movePackage( _options: Options ): Rule {\r\n  return ( _host: Tree, _context: SchematicContext ) => {\r\n    return mergeWith( apply( url( 'path/to/app/root/*.json' ), [\r\n      filter( ( path: Path ) => {\r\n        // This will visit only .json files in the top level of the directory\r\n        return path === '/package.json';\r\n      } ),\r\n      move( '.', 'some/destination/path' ),\r\n    ] ) );\r\n  };\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nThe difference is that you are able to pass the `url` function a glob path to build a tree only based on the files that match that pattern. Then I could filter on a subset of files, rather than having schematics look through every file, including `node_modules` just to move the file(s) I want.\r\n```diff\r\nexport function movePackage( _options: Options ): Rule {\r\n  return ( _host: Tree, _context: SchematicContext ) => {\r\n-    return mergeWith( apply( url( 'path/to/app/root' ), [\r\n+    return mergeWith( apply( url( 'path/to/app/root/*.json' ), [\r\n      filter( ( path: Path ) =>  path === '/package.json' ),\r\n      move( '.', 'some/destination/path' ),\r\n    ] ) );\r\n  };\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nCurrently, the `url` function calls the `createSourceFromUrl` method which ignores any glob path and creates a new null host tree. `createSourceFromUrl` could be refactored to return a tree of files only for a given glob path.\r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/angular/angular-cli/blob/c5de8e3b0e5c1499a0a17da0208297cd82b36095/packages/angular_devkit/schematics/src/rules/url.ts#L12-L16\r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/angular/angular-cli/blob/c5de8e3b0e5c1499a0a17da0208297cd82b36095/packages/angular_devkit/schematics/tools/file-system-engine-host-base.ts#L269-L283\r\n\r\n> Through my research of this implementation I was unable to find any other way of achieving this. If someone has an idea other than this implementation that is currently supported, I would love to be enlightened.

following:\r\n```\r\ncd testproject\r\nng serve\r\n``` \r\n\r\n4) Create a new file \"src/styles-variables.sccs\" containing following (but contents doesn't really matter):\r\n```\r\n$grid-breakpoints: (\r\n  xs: 0,\r\n  sm: 576px,\r\n  md: 768px,\r\n  lg: 992px,\r\n  xl: 1200px\r\n);\r\n```\r\n5) Add following line to the end of \"src/styles.sccs\" (a stub file being generated by the cli) to import the previous file:\r\n```\r\n@import \"styles-variables\";\r\n```\r\n6) Run \"ng serve\" again\r\n```\r\ncd testproject\r\nng serve\r\n``` \r\nAnd now it
