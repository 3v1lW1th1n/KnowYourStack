It used to work work fine in both Chrome and IE (Edge, 10, 11) till I ran the `ng-build --prod` for the first time to deploy it on the server. Since then the app is breaking in all of the IE versions, but still works fine in Chrome. I traced the bug and narrowed it down to the following function:\r\n\r\n```\r\n  init(): Promise<boolean> {\r\n        return new Promise<boolean>((resolve, reject) => {\r\n            this._sessionService.getCurrentLoginInformations().toPromise().then((result: GetCurrentLoginInformationsOutput) => {\r\n                this._application = result.application;\r\n                this._user = result.user;\r\n                this._tenant = result.tenant;\r\n                resolve(true);\r\n            }, (err) => {\r\n                reject(err);\r\n            });\r\n        });\r\n    }\r\n```\r\nThe issue is that in IE nothing is getting populated for neither of the result variable properties. but again all is good when running it in Chrome! \r\nDo I need to refactor the above code some how to make it digestible for IE?\r\n\r\nNote: In the error below the 'version' is a property for the 'application' property of the 'GetCurrentLoginInformationsOutput'\r\n\r\nNot quite sure if it relevants but I also get the following prompt in IE console:\r\n\r\n> Could not locate webpack:///(webpack)-dev-server/client* specified in source map \r\n\r\n## üî• Exception or Error\r\n<pre><code>\r\n<!-- If the issue is accompanied by an exception or an error, please share it below: -->\r\n[object Error]: {description: \"Uncaught (in promise): TypeError: Unable to get property 'version' of undefined or null reference TypeError: Unable to get property 'version' of undefined or null reference at AccountComponent (eval code:31:9) at createClass (eval code:12653:13) at createDirectiveInstance (eval code:12496:5) at createViewNodes (eval code:13954:21) at createRootView (eval code:13843:5) at callWithDebugContext (eval code:15268:9) at debugCreateRootView (eval code:14551:5) at ComponentFactory_.prototype.create (eval code:11448:9) at ComponentFactoryBoundToModule.prototype.create (eval code:4235:9) at ViewContainerRef_.prototype.createComponent (eval code:11645:9)\", message: \"Uncaught (in promise): TypeError: Unable to get property 'version' of undefined or null reference TypeError: Unable to get property 'version' of undefined or null reference at AccountComponent (eval code:31:9) at createClass (eval code:12653:13) at createDirectiveInstance (eval code:12496:5) at createViewNodes (eval code:13954:21) at createRootView (eval code:13843:5) at callWithDebugContext (eval code:15268:9) at debugCreateRootView (eval code:14551:5) at ComponentFactory_.prototype.create (eval code:11448:9) at ComponentFactoryBoundToModule.prototype.create (eval code:4235:9) at ViewContainerRef_.prototype.createComponent (eval code:11645:9)\", promise: Object, rejection: Object, stack: \"Error: Uncaught (in promise): TypeError: Unable to get property 'version' of undefined or null reference TypeError: Unable to get property 'version' of undefined or null reference at AccountComponent (eval code:31:9) at createClass (eval code:12653:13) at createDirectiveInstance (eval code:12496:5) at createViewNodes (eval code:13954:21) at createRootView (eval code:13843:5) at callWithDebugContext (eval code:15268:9) at debugCreateRootView (eval code:14551:5) at ComponentFactory_.prototype.create (eval code:11448:9) at ComponentFactoryBoundToModule.prototype.create (eval code:4235:9) at ViewContainerRef_.prototype.createComponent (eval code:11645:9) at resolvePromise (eval code:824:25) at resolvePromise (eval code:795:17) at Anonymous function (eval code:873:17) at ZoneDelegate.prototype.invokeTask (eval code:423:13) at onInvokeTask (eval code:4952:17) at ZoneDelegate.prototype.invokeTask (eval code:423:13) at Zone.prototype.runTask (eval code:192:21) at drainMicroTaskQueue (eval code:602:25) at ZoneTask.invokeTask (eval code:503:21) at invokeTask (eval code:1540:9)\"...}\r\n\r\ndescription: \"Uncaught (in promise): TypeError: Unable to get property 'version' of undefined or null reference TypeError: Unable to get property 'version' of undefined or null reference at AccountComponent (eval code:31:9) at createClass (eval code:12653:13) at createDirectiveInstance (eval code:12496:5) at createViewNodes (eval code:13954:21) at createRootView (eval code:13843:5) at callWithDebugContext (eval code:15268:9) at debugCreateRootView (eval code:14551:5) at ComponentFactory_.prototype.create (eval code:11448:9) at ComponentFactoryBoundToModule.prototype.create (eval code:4235:9) at ViewContainerRef_.prototype.createComponent (eval code:11645:9)\"\r\nmessage: \"Uncaught (in promise): TypeError: Unable to get property 'version' of undefined or null reference TypeError: Unable to get property 'version' of undefined or null reference at AccountComponent (eval code:31:9) at createClass (eval code:12653:13) at createDirectiveInstance (eval code:12496:5) at createViewNodes (eval code:13954:21) at createRootView (eval code:13843:5) at callWithDebugContext (eval code:15268:9) at debugCreateRootView (eval code:14551:5) at ComponentFactory_.prototype.create (eval code:11448:9) at ComponentFactoryBoundToModule.prototype.create (eval code:4235:9) at ViewContainerRef_.prototype.createComponent (eval code:11645:9)\"\r\n\r\n\r\n</code></pre>\r\n\r\n\r\n## üåç Your Environment\r\n<pre><code>\r\n<!-- run `ng version` and paste output below -->\r\n<!-- ‚úçÔ∏è-->\r\n\r\n</code></pre>\r\n\r\n**Anything else relevant?**\r\n<!-- ‚úçÔ∏èIs this a browser specific issue?

The usage guidelines are pretty clear: use checkbox when the change is pending form submission and toggle button when the change is effective immediately.\r\n\r\nmat-slide-toggle sits in the middle ground in terms of apparent semantics and can plausibly be used in both situations.

To tell assistive technologies that a button is a toggle button, specify a value for the attribute aria-pressed. For example, a button labeled mute in an audio player could indicate that sound is muted by setting the pressed state true. Important: it is critical the label on a toggle does not change when its state changes. In this example, when the pressed state is true, the label remains \"Mute\" so a screen reader would say something like \"Mute toggle button pressed\". Alternatively, if the design were to call for the button label to change from \"Mute\" to \"Unmute,\" the aria-pressed attribute would not be needed.\r\n\r\n#### Is there anything else we should know?\r\n\r\nI looked at google3 examples of mat-slide-toggle especially in Cloud Console, and it's pretty split down the middle whether it's a part of a form or effectively a button with immediate action.","Url":"https://github.com/angular/material2/issues/14949","RelatedDescription":"Open issue \"mat-slide-toggle add option to behave as an ARIA toggle button rather than a checkbox\" (#14949)"},{"Id":"402466866","IsPullRequest":false,"CreatedAt":"2019-01-24T21:09:06","Actor":"scriptsure","Number":"14936","RawContent":null,"Title":"mat-list-item' is not a known element","State":"closed","Body":"Getting following issue when trying to import list:\r\n\r\nERROR Error: Uncaught (in promise): Error: Template parse errors:\r\n'mat-list-item' is not a known element:\r\n1.
