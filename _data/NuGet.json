Client handles this differently based on whether -SkipDuplicate is provided as part of the push.\r\n\r\n**snupkg behavior:** snupkg duplicates can sometimes behaves differently than nupkg duplicates (as is the case with nuget.org):\r\n\r\n- If a snupkg already exists when pushed,  nuget.org will simply overwrite it, validation will be re-ran on this snupkg, and a success response (HTTP-201) is returned. \r\n\r\n- A special case is if server validation is currently executing on this snupkg (as it does immediately after a push), another push of the snupkg causes the server to return this duplicate error:\r\n\r\n`Response status code does not indicate success: 409 (It looks like there is another copy of this symbols package pending validation(s). Please wait for the validation(s) to finish before trying to replace the symbols package.).`\r\n\r\n### Describe the solution you'd like\r\nIt should be discussed whether nuget.org should continue overwriting snupkgs when they are pushed. At a minimum, the existing experience is inconsistent with nupkgs.\r\n\r\nSome initial thoughts and discussion points:\r\n**Minimal use-case:** The (only?) scenario where updating (\"patching\") an existing snupkg is if you didn't include all the PDBs in the original snupkg, and subsequently added them. Is this scenario common? Should we require them to Delete their symbols through \"Delete Symbols\" button on nuget.org before they can then push the snupkg again without a 409 Conflict?\r\n\r\n**Version guidance:** Assumption here is that we prefer to not require a new package version when adding additional symbols to a snupkg. Thus, a user can incrementally fill a snupkg with PDBs as long as they don't modify the DLL.\r\n\r\n**Server workload concern:**  pushing N nupkgs (say N=100) will involuntarily update <=100 snupkgs and trigger <=100 validations of symbols that have already been through validation (assuming this trigger happens even if there are no changes to the snupkg). \r\n\r\n### Additional context\r\nNuGet Client Issue where this discussion came up: https://github.com/NuGet/Home/issues/8148\r\nDiscussion that lead to this issue by: @cristinamanum, @karann-msft, @rrelyea, @donnie-msft "},{"Id":"10794864003","Type":"IssuesEvent","CreatedAt":"2019-11-05T23:01:12","Actor":"joelverhagen","Repository":"NuGet/NuGetGallery","Organization":"NuGet","RawContent":null,"RelatedAction":"opened","RelatedUrl":"https://github.com/NuGet/NuGetGallery/issues/7680","RelatedDescription":"Opened issue \"Lightning does not treat package IDs as case insensitive\" (#7680) at NuGet/NuGetGallery","RelatedBody":"This in rare cases could lead to concurrency issues when two workers are updating the same hive at the same time.\r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/NuGet/NuGet.Services.Metadata/blob/e921a7eef360ee6bcc11b7ca9f94d96e93193a1c/src/Ng/Jobs/LightningJob.cs#L262"},{"Id":"10794742721","Type":"PullRequestEvent","CreatedAt":"2019-11-05T22:42:30","Actor":"scottbommarito","Repository":"NuGet/NuGetGallery","Organization":"NuGet","RawContent":null,"RelatedAction":"opened","RelatedUrl":"https://github.com/NuGet/NuGetGallery/pull/7679","RelatedDescription":"Opened pull request \"Newly pushed packages that are vulnerable should be marked vulnerable on upload/push\" (#7679) at NuGet/NuGetGallery","RelatedBody":"https://github.com/nuget/nugetgallery/issues/7649"},{"Id":"10794356032","Type":"PullRequestEvent","CreatedAt":"2019-11-05T21:50:21","Actor":"loic-sharma","Repository":"NuGet/NuGetGallery","Organization":"NuGet","RawContent":null,"RelatedAction":"merged","RelatedUrl":"https://github.com/NuGet/NuGetGallery/pull/7672","RelatedDescription":"Merged pull request \"[ReleasePrep][2019.11.04]RI of dev into master\" (#7672) at NuGet/NuGetGallery","RelatedBody":""},{"Id":"10793708103","Type":"PullRequestEvent","CreatedAt":"2019-11-05T20:30:00","Actor":"scottbommarito","Repository":"NuGet/NuGetGallery","Organization":"NuGet","RawContent":null,"RelatedAction":"opened","RelatedUrl":"https://github.com/NuGet/NuGetGallery/pull/7678","RelatedDescription":"Opened pull request \"Manage Package page forms should link back to the Manage page\" (#7678) at NuGet/NuGetGallery","RelatedBody":"https://github.com/nuget/nugetgallery/issues/7567\r\nhttps://github.com/nuget/nugetgallery/issues/7495\r\n\r\nCurrently, when you submit a form on the Manage Package page (Deprecation, Listing, Documentation) you are linked back to the package details page.

Subsequently, we plan to **disable the `OData` queries starting Feb 5th, 2020**.\r\n\r\n**Call to Action: Transition to V3 APIs**\r\n\r\nHere are some resources to help you with the migration:\r\n* [NuGet Server `V3 APIs` reference](https://devblogs.microsoft.com/nuget/switching-from-wcf-odata-to-web-api/)\r\n* [Guide to transition from NuGet `V2 API` to `V3 API`](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/nuget/guides/api/query-for-all-published-packages). \r\n* [Blog post: Switching from WCF OData to Web API](https://devblogs.microsoft.com/nuget/switching-from-wcf-odata-to-web-api/)\r\n\r\nIf you need further help in moving your use case to `V3 APIs`, do reach out to us at [support@nuget.org](mailto:support@nuget.org).\r\n"}],"ResultType":"GitHubEvent"},"Twitter":{"ResultType":"TwitterTimeline","Tweets":[{"Id":"1190360390980395008","CreatedAt":"2019-11-01T20:10:07+00:00","UserScreenname":"nuget","Text":"The issue with the publishing pipeline has been resolved and packages are now being published normally. https://t.co/NdK8mVk7UF","Source":"<a href=\"https://about.twitter.com/products/tweetdeck\" rel=\"nofollow\">TweetDeck</a>","RetweetCount":3,"FavoriteCount":0,"RawContent":null},{"Id":"1190331936293572608","CreatedAt":"2019-11-01T18:17:03+00:00","UserScreenname":"nuget","Text":"We are experiencing an issue with our publishing pipeline causing a delay in the publishing of new packages.
