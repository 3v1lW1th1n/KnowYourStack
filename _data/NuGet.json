Rather than showing an error, it says that it packed version 1.0.0.0. If you run `-verbosity detailed`, you'll see an inconspicuous error:` Could not load file or assembly 'NuGet, Version=5.4.0.0, Culture=neutral, PublicKeyToken=b03f5f7f11d50a3a' or one of its dependencies. The system cannot find the file specified.`\r\n\r\nDiscovered this while trying to repro https://github.com/NuGet/Home/issues/8497\r\n\r\nNuGet product used: NuGet.exe\r\nNuGet Version: 5.1.0.6013\r\n\r\nVS version (if appropriate): 16.3.0-pre.3.0+29229.4.d16.3 and 15.9.15+28307.812.\r\nWorked before?: No\r\n\r\n## Detailed repro steps so we can see the same problem\r\n\r\n1. Create new C# class library, .NET framework 4.6.2\r\n\r\n2. Build the library and pack it.\r\n\r\n3. Upgrade the library to a newer version, e.g. 1.0.1\r\n\r\n4. Build the library.\r\n\r\n5. Rename NuGet.exe to a different name (eg, nuget4.exe).\r\n\r\n6. Pack the library\r\n\r\n## Expected result\r\nYou should now have a package with the new assembly version (eg, 1.0.1).\r\n\r\n## Actual result\r\nThe output indicates success, even though it did not create the new version of the package. The version is incorrectly 1.0.0.0:\r\n`Id: Repro8497\r\nVersion: 1.0.0.0\r\nAuthors: <username>\r\nDescription: Description\r\nDependencies:`\r\n...\r\n`Successfully created package 'NuGet.Client\\artifacts\\NuGet.CommandLine\\16.0\\bin\\Debug\\net472\\Repro8497.1.0.0.nupkg'.`\r\n\r\n\r\n## Sample project\r\n[Repro8497.zip](https://github.com/NuGet/Home/files/3575969/Repro8497.zip)\r\n"},{"Id":"11988730490","Type":"IssuesEvent","CreatedAt":"2020-04-08T00:41:01","Actor":"nkolev92","Repository":"NuGet/Home","Organization":"NuGet","RawContent":null,"RelatedAction":"closed","RelatedUrl":"https://github.com/NuGet/Home/issues/3146","RelatedDescription":"Closed issue \"nuget pack does not work if you change the name of the exe\" (#3146) at NuGet/Home","RelatedBody":"Repros in 3.5.0-beta2 and nightly builds. \n\nThrows the error:\nCould not load file or assembly 'NuGet, Version=3.5.0.0, Culture=neutral, PublicKeyToken=null' or one of its dependencies.
