Angular's DI also helps put that logic into your components. \r\n\r\nWhile it's pretty good, it is a unique style of DI and has limitations. Limitations like a lack of dependency inversion. We depend on concrete implementations, and as a result there is a testing suite built by the Angular team to facilitate this.\r\n\r\n_What I **love**, and I mean absolutely **love**_ about Angular is how phenomenal its templating syntax is. I'm not joking, it's honestly the most ergonomic expression of presentational concerns I have ever worked with.\r\n\r\nWhat I dislike is that when I write an application, it's an Angular application.

Edit workspace (`angular.json`) to change `\"defaultProject\": \"tmp\"` to `\"defaultProject\": \"web-app\"`\r\n 1. `ng add @angular/material` and respond to prompts\r\n \r\n#### Expected Behavior\r\n[The `ng add` docs](https://angular.io/cli/add) state\r\n> Adds the npm package for a published library to your workspace, and configures your default app project to use that library,\r\n\r\n> The default app project is the value of `defaultProject` in `angular.json`.\r\n\r\nThus it is expected to add Angular Material to the default project, `web-app`.\r\n\r\n#### Actual Behavior\r\n```bash\r\nSkipping installation: Package already installed\r\n? Choose a prebuilt theme name, or \"custom\" for a custom theme: Custom\r\n? Set up HammerJS for gesture recognition? Yes\r\n? Set up browser animations for Angular Material? Yes\r\nUPDATE package.json (1473 bytes)\r\nUPDATE src/main.ts (391 bytes)\r\nUPDATE src/app/app.module.ts (423 bytes)\r\nUPDATE src/styles.scss (1418 bytes)\r\nUPDATE src/index.html (484 bytes)\r\n```\r\nAs you can see, it configured the initial app project in the workspace (`\"tmp\"`) for Angular Material instead of the default project (`\"web-app\"`).\r\n\r\n#### Environment\r\n```bash\r\nAngular CLI: 8.2.1\r\nNode: 10.15.3\r\nOS: darwin x64\r\nAngular: 8.2.1\r\n... animations, cli, common, compiler, compiler-cli, core, forms\r\n... language-service, platform-browser, platform-browser-dynamic\r\n... router\r\n\r\nPackage                            Version\r\n------------------------------------------------------------\r\n@angular-devkit/architect          0.802.1\r\n@angular-devkit/build-angular      0.802.1\r\n@angular-devkit/build-ng-packagr   0.802.1\r\n@angular-devkit/build-optimizer    0.802.1\r\n@angular-devkit/build-webpack      0.802.1\r\n@angular-devkit/core               8.2.1\r\n@angular-devkit/schematics         8.2.1\r\n@angular/cdk                       8.1.2\r\n@angular/material                  8.1.2\r\n@ngtools/webpack                   8.2.1\r\n@schematics/angular                8.2.1\r\n@schematics/update                 0.802.1\r\nng-packagr                         5.4.3\r\nrxjs                               6.4.0\r\ntypescript                         3.5.3\r\nwebpack                            4.38.0\r\n```\r\n\r\nRan into this while reviewing PR https://github.com/angular/components/pull/16654.","Url":"https://github.com/angular/components/issues/16743","RelatedDescription":"Open issue \"schematic(add): does not respect workspace's defaultProject \" (#16743)"},{"Id":"479309412","IsPullRequest":false,"CreatedAt":"2019-08-10T21:51:31","Actor":"orphen92","Number":"16742","RawContent":null,"Title":"customize mat-menu-panel panel of Matmenu","State":"open","Body":"Hello whats is the solution for have my custom style for the mat-menu-panel panel of Matmenu.\r\n\r\ni have try this for now:\r\nclass\r\npanelClass\r\nbackdropClass\r\n\r\nthe class appears to the mat-menu-panel but i can't add my style because of shadowDom i think.\r\nI don't want to remove view.encapsulation if its possible.\r\n\r\nhave you a solution for me please?
