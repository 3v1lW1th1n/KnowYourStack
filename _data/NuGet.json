It comes about because we can happily call code that is in indirectly referenced packages, not just in the top level ones.\r\n\r\nDetailed Scenario:\r\n\r\n3 packages: PackA, PackB and PackC (all .net standard 1.4 in my case)\r\n\r\nOne app: App1 (.net framework or .net core)\r\n\r\n1. PackA has no dependencies\r\n\r\n2. PackB v1.0.0 has PackageReference to PackA (doesn't matter if it actually uses it or not)\r\n\r\n3. PackC has PackageReference to PackB (v1.0.0) but directly uses method in PackA. It is unfortunately able to do this even though it doesn't explicitly list PackA as a PackageReference. Maybe the developer uses PackB so adds that and doesn't realise they were then also using PackA (easy to do with internal company packages as you tend to remember what functions exist more than what packages they live in).\r\n\r\n4. App1 has PackageReference to PackC and PackB (v.1.0.0).\r\n\r\n5. Everything works nicely but then...\r\n\r\n6. PackB v1.0.1 is released, which removes the PackageReference to PackA.\r\n\r\n7. App1 updates PackB to v1.0.1\r\n\r\n8. App1 compiles but when it calls PackC which then tries to call PackA, it fails with FileNotFoundException because PackA is not known to be a dependency so does not get included in the build. \r\n\r\nMy thought is that the ideal way to fix this would be a compiler error or warning at step 3, but open to other suggestions. This could be done through some secondary type of DLL reference that couldn't be directly bound to.\r\n\r\nI'm concerned we will hit this a lot with our internal packages as we try to remove indirect packages when we convert from packages.config to PackageReference.\r\n\r\nVS version (if appropriate): 2017.2 and 2017.3\r\n\r\nSample project attached in broken state having updated PackB to 1.0.1\r\n\r\n[IndirectPackageReferences.zip](https://github.com/NuGet/Home/files/1206163/IndirectPackageReferences.zip)\r\n\r\n\r\n"},{"Id":"6587284777","Type":"IssueCommentEvent","CreatedAt":"2017-09-13T20:28:57","Actor":"mungojam","Repository":"NuGet/Home","Organization":"NuGet","RawContent":null,"RelatedAction":"created","RelatedUrl":"https://github.com/NuGet/Home/issues/5715#issuecomment-329287471","RelatedDescription":"Commented on issue \"There is no warning when using code from indirect package reference leading to potential runtime errors\" (#5715) at NuGet/Home","RelatedBody":"Moved to https://github.com/dotnet/roslyn/issues/22095 as I think it should be fixed at compiler level"},{"Id":"6587216703","Type":"IssueCommentEvent","CreatedAt":"2017-09-13T20:12:59","Actor":"natidea","Repository":"NuGet/Home","Organization":"NuGet","RawContent":null,"RelatedAction":"created","RelatedUrl":"https://github.com/NuGet/Home/issues/5868#issuecomment-329283346","RelatedDescription":"Commented on issue \"automatic nuget restore in visual studio for custom project system\" (#5868) at NuGet/Home","RelatedBody":"@zivkan it may be easier to use a bare bones Project System like the examples in VSProjectSystem because the .NET project system probably does a lot more that what you need. However if you want to get nominate/restore working, you can do so on an instance of VS that has the .NET project system installed by leveraging **Capabilities** to MEF import our assemblies. \r\n\r\nI've been experimenting with this and got restore and dependencies tree working on a barebones CPS project. Review [this diff to NuGetizer](https://github.com/NuGet/NuGet.Build.Packaging/compare/dev...natidea:packageRef) for examples of the changes needed. To summarize the steps you will need to replicate this:\r\n\r\n1. Add the _PackageReferences_ and _DependenciesTree_ capabilities to your project, and copy [these rules from .NET Project system](https://github.com/NuGet/NuGet.Build.Packaging/compare/dev...natidea:packageRef#diff-e418ff90840f18d695d653aa56e9ca98)\r\n2. You will also need a modified version of .NET Project System that leverages this capability. You could try building this branch: [packRefCapability](https://github.com/natidea/roslyn-project-system/tree/packRefCapability), and unzipping the ProjectSystem.vsix to `%VSINSTALLDIR%Common7\\IDE\\Extensions\\<extension>`\r\n3. Projects created with your project-system will also need to reference the Sdk (or a subset of it). I do this [here](https://github.com/NuGet/NuGet.Build.Packaging/compare/dev...natidea:packageRef#diff-2b7d1b66f423104d6e9a34343698307bL2), except using a stripped down version of the Sdk that only references the file [Microsoft.PackageDependencyResolution.targets](https://github.com/dotnet/sdk/blob/master/src/Tasks/Microsoft.NET.Build.Tasks/build/Microsoft.PackageDependencyResolution.targets). (You can create your own SDK by copying `%VSINSTALLDIR%MSBuild\\Sdks\\Microsoft.NET.Sdk` and removing unneeded targets)\r\n\r\nEventually we hope to provide a formal way to do this on top of CPS (tracked by https://github.com/dotnet/project-system/issues/2491 and https://github.com/dotnet/project-system/issues/1984)."},{"Id":"6587182854","Type":"IssueCommentEvent","CreatedAt":"2017-09-13T20:04:51","Actor":"denfromufa","Repository":"NuGet/Home","Organization":"NuGet","RawContent":null,"RelatedAction":"created","RelatedUrl":"https://github.com/NuGet/Home/issues/4163#issuecomment-329281328","RelatedDescription":"Commented on issue \"PackageReference doesn't work on .NET 4.5.2 console app\" (#4163) at NuGet/Home","RelatedBody":"@markusgud deleting project.assets.json worked great!

It has a following dependency:\r\n`Owin (>= 1.0.0-prerelease && <= 1.0.0)`\r\n\r\nAnd everything worked fine and everyone was happy. Until one day, the Owin-team unlisted the prerelease-version of the package from NuGet. Now my users started to get build errors.\r\n\r\n1.0 is still there. Do you consider all pre-release versions are better than release versions?\r\n\r\nA repository to reproduce the issue is here:\r\nhttps://github.com/jomonson/OwinCompressionDependencyIssue\r\n\r\n\n\n---\n\n@joelverhagen commented on [Tue Sep 12 2017](https://github.com/NuGet/NuGetGallery/issues/4663#issuecomment-328885891)\n\nThanks for reporting this issue @Thorium. The available versions on nuget.org are 0.5.0, 0.7.0, 0.11.0, 0.12.0, 0.14.0, and 1.0.0. The 1.0.0 version of Owin is the only version that satisfies the version range in your Owin.Compression package. I am not familiar with a 1.0.0-prerelease version of the Owin package. Perhaps it was on some CI or secondary source like MyGet?\r\n\r\nConcerning the build failure, I was only able to reproduce a build warning in Visual Studio 2017:\r\n```\r\nwarning NU1603: Owin.Compression 1.0.16 depends on Owin (>= 1.0.0-prerelease && <= 1.0.0) but Owin 1.0.0-prerelease was not found.

But let me describe my use-case.\r\n\r\nOn my local machine I have two projects both are libraries with different release cycles (e.g. LibA and LibB). LibB depends on LibA and consumes nuget-packages from it. It depends on some version of LibA in csproj:\r\n\r\n    <PackageReference Include=\"LibA\" Version=\"3.0.0\" />\r\n\r\nBoth libs are being developed in parallel. So at a time we have some dev (unreleased) version of LibA which is being consumed in LibB (at a moment of LibB releasing that LibA version should become released). To propagate new changes of LibA to LibB I build LibA packages and do restore in LibB.\r\n\r\nLibA packages are built into a folder which is used as package source for LibB restore. \r\n\r\nDespite @emgarten said:\r\n\r\n>In general, re-using the same id/version of a package is not a supported scenario for NuGet.\r\n\r\nit worked pretty well with \"old\" nuget for years.\r\n\r\n    nuget.exe restore LibB.sln -Source \"%~dp0..\\..\\..\\LibA\\Release\" -NoCache\r\n\r\nIn LibB I had `.nuget\\nuget.config` with repositoryPath: \r\n\r\n\t<config>\r\n\t\t<add key=\"repositoryPath\" value=\"../../../packages\" />\r\n\t</config>\r\n\r\nSo all packages for LibB are put inside that folder. And it's being used during build both via msbuild/nuget and VS. If I needed to refresh a package I just went and delete it inside \"packages\" folder in LibB, then run restore.\r\n\r\nNow with \"new\" nuget and dotnet cli I have headache. It's simply not working at all.\r\n\r\nrepositoryPath is ignored. All restored packages are put inside a new global \"cache\" (which is not a cache as it turned out) - I mean C:\\Users\\UserName\\.nuget\\packages.\r\n\r\n`dotnet restore --no-cache -f ` is simply useless, it does something but not what is expected - getting a package from a source and use it for building.\r\n\r\nOverriding a `.nuget` folder with `--packages` flags works in some way:\r\n\r\n    dotnet restore --no-cache -f --packages ../../../packages\r\n\r\nAll packages are put inside the specified folder. But VS won't see that folder and continue to use global `.nuget`. So it's also useless.\r\n\r\nSo currently I have to go and delete manually my packages in global `.nuget` folder. Needless to say how tedious it is. \r\n\r\nMoreover I have no idea what to do in CI scenario (on build-server). It seems that the only workaround is clearing the global `.nuget` \"cache\" on every build :(\r\n\r\nIf supporting `repositoryPath` isn't possible (btw why?) then please at least implement meaningful behavior for `--no-cache` option (override packages in `.nuget` \"cache\" with downloaded ones)."},{"Id":"6586188915","Type":"IssueCommentEvent","CreatedAt":"2017-09-13T16:20:54","Actor":"emgarten","Repository":"NuGet/Home","Organization":"NuGet","RawContent":null,"RelatedAction":"created","RelatedUrl":"https://github.com/NuGet/Home/issues/4781#issuecomment-329220745","RelatedDescription":"Commented on issue \"Add support for pre restore MSBuild target that Visual Studio triggers\" (#4781) at NuGet/Home","RelatedBody":"The NuGet restore changes will be part of 15.4 if it still makes it in.
