Developers are advised to update their .NET Core SDK to versions 1.1.8 or 2.1.101.\r\n\r\n## Discussion\r\n\r\nUse *TBD* for discussion of this advisory.\r\n\r\n### Mitigation Factors\r\nNone\r\n\r\n### Affected Software\r\n\r\nAny application running against .NET Core 1.0.9 or lower versions, 1.1.6 or lower minor versions or 2.0.5 or lower minor versions is affected. \r\n\r\n### Advisory FAQ\r\n#### How do I know if I am affected?\r\nAny application running against .NET Core 1.0.9 or lower versions, 1.1.6 or lower minor versions or 2.0.5 or lower minor versions is affected. \r\n\r\nA complete list of runtimes can be discovered by performing a directory listing in the install root directories. The default root directories are listed in the following table:\r\n\r\n| Operating System | Location |\r\n|------------------|----------|\r\n| Windows\t| `C:\\Program Files\\dotnet\\shared\\Microsoft.NETCore.App\\` |\r\n| macOS\t| `/usr/local/share/dotnet/shared/Microsoft.NETCore.App/` |\r\n| Supported Linux platforms\t| `/usr/share/dotnet/shared/Microsoft.NETCore.App/` |\r\n\r\nEach runtime version is installed in its own directory, where the directory name is the version number. If you don't have a directory for 1.0.10, 1.1.7 and 2.0.6, then any applications targeting the respective major/minor versions, 1.0 or 1.1 or 2.0 of .NET Core are vulnerable.\r\n\r\nAdditionally, if you've deployed self-contained applications targeting any of the impacted versions, these applications are also vulnerable and must be recompiled and redeployed.\r\n\r\n#### How do I fix my affected application?\r\n\r\nApplications can be fixed by installing the latest .NET Core runtimes or SDKs. Typically, application servers only have runtime packages installed and developer machines have the SDKs installed. \r\nInstallers for the runtimes can be downloaded from the [Runtime and SDK download archive](https://github.com/dotnet/core/blob/master/release-notes/download-archive.md). \r\n.NET Core 1.1.8 SDK installs both versions 1.0.10 and 1.1.7 of the .NET Core runtime.\r\n\r\nIf you've built a self-contained application, you must install the new runtime and SDK, recompile your application and redeploy.\r\n\r\n#### What if the update breaks my application?\r\nAn application can be pinned to a previous version of the runtime by editing the `application.runtime.config` file for that application. Set the framework version to the desired version and the `rollForward` property to false. These settings should be treated as a temporary measure and the application updated to work with the patched versions of the framework.\r\n\r\nSince the `application.runtime.config` file is an optional file, you may need to create one for each application and add it alongside the executable.\r\n\r\n### Acknowledgments\r\n[Ben Adams](https://twitter.com/ben_a_adams) of [Illyriad Games](https://www.illyriad.co.uk/)\r\n\r\n### External Links\r\n[CVE-2018-0875](https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2018-0875)\r\n\r\n### Revisions\r\n\r\nV1.0 (Mar 13, 2018): Advisory published.\r\n\r\n_Version 1.0_\r\n_Last Updated 2018-03-13_\r\n"},{"Id":"7301596554","Type":"IssuesEvent","CreatedAt":"2018-02-27T06:10:33","Actor":"mairaw","Repository":"dotnet/announcements","Organization":"dotnet","RawContent":null,"RelatedAction":"opened","RelatedUrl":"https://github.com/dotnet/announcements/issues/61","RelatedDescription":"Opened issue \"New offline books released for Visual Studio 2017\" (#61) at dotnet/announcements","RelatedBody":"# New offline books released for Visual Studio 2017\r\n\r\nEarlier this month, we released an update to Offline Books for the Visual Studio 2017 Help Viewer.\r\n\r\nThis release includes new .NET books, including .NET Core Guide, .NET Guide, .NET Framework Guide and the .NET API Reference.

See the [initial platform intrinsics design](https://github.com/dotnet/designs/blob/master/accepted/platform-intrinsics.md) for more information.\r\n\r\nWe have decided that it makes the most sense for this intrinsics feature to ship in a “preview” status in the .NET Core 2.1 RTM timeframe.  This means that the runtime support we are implementing will be included, but the assembly exposing the intrinsics will only be available to projects via explicit reference to a “preview-only” package.  These APIs won’t be included in the official .NET Core 2.1 packages.\r\n\r\nGiven our limited time and resources, recent changes in the approach we take to expose the intrinsics, and API changes prompted by design feedback from the community, we don’t believe there is enough time to settle these APIs for 2.1. We plan to follow the pattern of other recent features like Span<T> and Memory<T> that first shipped in preview before formally joining the supported API surface.  Not only would we expect the next version of .NET Core to support more intrinsics than could be supported in 2.1, but we expect to have real usage examples in CoreFX and higher level components as well.  These real world examples, as well as feedback from customers who opt in to the preview, should give us the confidence we need to officially support the APIs going forward.\r\n\r\n## Discussion\r\n\r\nPlease share your thoughts on this change and see what others are saying at:\r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/dotnet/corefx/issues/27486\r\n\r\n## Details\r\n\r\nIn the coming days, we plan on removing System.Runtime.Intrinsics.dll from the Microsoft.NETCore.App package.  This means any libraries/applications that are using these APIs will no longer compile by default, and will not run on new builds of .NET Core 2.1.\r\n\r\nAt the same time, we will start producing a new System.Runtime.Intrinsics.Experimental NuGet package.  In order to continue using these APIs on .NET Core 2.1, a project will need to add a reference to this new package.\r\n\r\nAs its name implies, this package is experimental and should only be used for preview purposes.  It isn’t expected to be used in production scenarios.  Future version of .NET Core (after 2.1) will be allowed to break this package. This enables us respond to future feedback that requires the APIs to be modified.\r\n\r\nIn the future, when we are confident we have the intrinsic APIs right, we will stop producing the System.Runtime.Intrinsics.Experimental package. The platform intrinsics APIs will then be added back to Microsoft.NETCore.App and will be officially supported."},{"Id":"7273056222","Type":"IssuesEvent","CreatedAt":"2018-02-21T02:28:03","Actor":"KathleenDollard","Repository":"dotnet/announcements","Organization":"dotnet","RawContent":null,"RelatedAction":"opened","RelatedUrl":"https://github.com/dotnet/announcements/issues/57","RelatedDescription":"Opened issue \"Manually Uninstall .NET Core SDK 2.2.0-Preview Nightly Builds\" (#57) at dotnet/announcements","RelatedBody":"# Manually Uninstall .NET Core SDK 2.2.0-Preview Nightly Builds\r\n\r\n[A change in the version number strategy for .NET Core SDK](https://github.com/dotnet/designs/pull/29) resulted in some nightly builds having a higher version number.
