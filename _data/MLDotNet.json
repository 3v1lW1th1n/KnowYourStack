To change column type of database, I had to change the program that generates it (in many places) and to setup a new database.\r\nIndeed with data type real instead of float the program works incl. evaluating, training etc. With one exception: Trying to save the model to a zip file for later use on end fails. Reason: One table column is type datetime (in SQL). During generation of the data view this is converted into string, and training works. Saving the model attempts to change these column data back from string to datetime, so an exception is thrown.\r\nIs this as should be? If model saving tries to reconstruct the original data types, so I think it should be able to parse a string as datetime.\r\nIn fact I could store the timestamps as simple strings in the database. But many database queries use datetime arithmetics, e. g. retrieving all data between two timestamps (SQL can do this very easy, while the date arithmetics on strings would be a little tricky).\r\n\r\n_Originally posted by @FranzBl in https://github.com/dotnet/machinelearning-samples/issues/744#issuecomment-556653945_\n\n","Url":"https://github.com/dotnet/machinelearning/issues/4493","RelatedDescription":"Open issue \"model saving can't handle datetime columns\" (#4493)"},{"Id":"526282350","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2019-11-21T05:22:19","Actor":"codemzs","Number":"4492","RawContent":null,"Title":"Disable tests on macOS that depend on GDI+ library.","State":"closed","Body":"Disabling bitmap related tests temporarily on macOS to unblock PRs that are stalled because macOS CI images don't seem to have GDI+ or related library.","Url":"https://github.com/dotnet/machinelearning/pull/4492","RelatedDescription":"Closed or merged PR \"Disable tests on macOS that depend on GDI+ library.\" (#4492)"},{"Id":"525965178","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2019-11-20T17:42:58","Actor":"antoniovs1029","Number":"4489","RawContent":null,"Title":"Test MacOS pipeline problem","State":"open","Body":"Do not approve this branch.\r\n\r\nIt's only meant for testing the problems with the MacOS pipeline\r\n","Url":"https://github.com/dotnet/machinelearning/pull/4489","RelatedDescription":"Open PR \"Test MacOS pipeline problem\" (#4489)"},{"Id":"525111121","IsPullRequest":false,"CreatedAt":"2019-11-19T16:14:00","Actor":"mayoatte","Number":"4487","RawContent":null,"Title":"QuestionL Handling Comma Separated List Of Ids Per Row","State":"open","Body":"### System information\r\n\r\n- **OS version/distro**: Windows 10\r\n- **.NET Version (eg., dotnet --info)**:  3.0.0\r\n\r\n### Issue\r\n\r\n**I'm trying to use the FieldAwareFactorizationMachine for classification.

If both have the same visibility then it should throw an exception.\r\n\r\nFor this to happen, I modified the `ComponentCatalog ` to work as described. I also had to change the visibility of several methods and constructors to work as described. Since, as per @yaeldekel 's instructions, the create method should be called instead of the constructor in all cases, then I did the following:\r\n1. For most classes, the case was that both the conflictive constructor and create method were private, so I simply made the create method internal.\r\n2. For LabelIndicatorTransform and SkipTakeFilter the conflictive constructors and create methods were public, so I made the constructors internal.\r\n3.

If that byte is false, it outputs raw values else it outputs probability values normalized to one. \r\nThe sample code in this bug uses AutoML to request a softmax output. The code currently only checks whether the output type is ImplDist which excludes softmax output.\r\n\r\nThis PR changes the saved model format in a backward compatible way by continuing to write a single byte for output type and continues to use 0 for raw output, 1 for probability normalization but also adds 2 to indicate SoftMax.
