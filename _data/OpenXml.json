We are using Open XML SDK version 2.5 to do some document merging in our application, and as standard is fine, however, if the Mergefield contains any sort of formatting in the .DOCX, eg bold, italics font change,  Word is automatically converting it, from a simple mergefield to a complex mergefield.\r\n\r\nWhen we run our code we’re parsing the XML for Mergefield XML Elements, but it’s not finding the complex mergefields, so the merge is not working. It just brings over the field in plain text eg [[CO_COMPANYNAME]] as opposed to the actual
