Browsers know which module to load by the 'nomodule' and 'type=module' attributes.\r\n\r\nHowever this won't work for IE (Internet Explorer 10/11). \r\nIn order to enable IE support we need to add the essential polyfills in the polyfill.ts file and enable IE support in the browserslist configuration. \r\n\r\nThe issue here is, that after doing so, the polyfill-es2015 file will now be bloated with the polyfills imported only for IE.\r\n\r\nA simple reproduction can be achieved by creating a fresh project with the angular-cli and turn IE support on and off and look at the created polyfill files.\r\n\r\nThe results would be similar to this:\r\nno IE support:\r\npolyfill-ie5 - 638kB\r\npolyfill-ie2015 - 141kB\r\n\r\nwith IE support:\r\npolyfill-ie5 - 698kB\r\npolyfill-ie2015 - 532kB\r\n\r\nThis values will of course shrink when minified but the polyfil-es-2015 file will still be significantly larger with IE11 support active than without.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Describe the solution you'd like\r\nIt would be nice if the IE polyfills would only be loaded by IE or at least only by older browsers and not pollute the polyfill file which is meant for newer browsers. \r\n\r\nMaybe a Switch to determine if a polyfill is supposed to be provided for older or newer browsers (i.E an annotation if it is module or nomodule relevant).\r\n\r\n### Describe alternatives you've considered\r\n\r\nI've considered to create an IE-only polyfill file manually and load it by the index.html. simillar to the solution mentioned in Fabrizio Fortunatos blog post: https://izifortune.com/angular-polyfill-strategies/\r\n","Url":"https://github.com/angular/angular-cli/issues/16336","RelatedDescription":"Closed issue \"IE polyfills should not bloat polyfill file for newer browsers\" (#16336)"},{"Id":"530582341","IsPullRequest":false,"CreatedAt":"2019-12-02T14:47:47","Actor":"jorgeucano","Number":"16321","RawContent":null,"Title":"Schematics move function does not work in v9.rc4","State":"closed","Body":"<!--üîÖüîÖüîÖüîÖüîÖüîÖüîÖüîÖüîÖüîÖüîÖüîÖüîÖüîÖüîÖüîÖüîÖüîÖüîÖüîÖüîÖüîÖüîÖüîÖüîÖüîÖüîÖüîÖüîÖüîÖüîÖ\r\n\r\nOh hi there! üòÑ\r\n\r\nTo expedite issue processing please search open and closed issues before submitting a new one.\r\nExisting issues often contain information about workarounds, resolution, or progress updates.\r\n\r\nüîÖüîÖüîÖüîÖüîÖüîÖüîÖüîÖüîÖüîÖüîÖüîÖüîÖüîÖüîÖüîÖüîÖüîÖüîÖüîÖüîÖüîÖüîÖüîÖüîÖüîÖüîÖüîÖüîÖüîÖüîÖüîÖüîÖ-->\r\n\r\n\r\n# üêû Bug report\r\n\r\n### Command (mark with an `x`)\r\n<!-- Can you pin-point the command or commands that are effected by this bug? -->\r\n<!-- ‚úçÔ∏èedit: -->\r\n\r\n- [ ] new\r\n- [ ] build\r\n- [ ] serve\r\n- [ ] test\r\n- [ ] e2e\r\n- [x] generate\r\n- [ ] add\r\n- [ ] update\r\n- [ ] lint\r\n- [ ] xi18n\r\n- [ ] run\r\n- [ ] config\r\n- [ ] help\r\n- [ ] version\r\n- [ ] doc\r\n\r\n\r\n### Is this a regression?\r\nno\r\n\r\n\r\n### Description\r\nUpdate my schematics to Angular 9rc4 and the move function does nothing.

The prompt works quite good now but using the command line for multi selections will cause an error:\r\n\r\n```text\r\nError: Schematic input does not validate against the Schema: {\"name\":\"paul\"}\r\nErrors:\r\n\r\n  Data path \".name\" should be array.\r\n...\r\n```\r\n\r\nAt first I opened an issue for the docs because I thought it's just not documented: https://github.com/angular/angular/issues/33851 But after checking the implementation of the angular guard schematic which has `--implements` parameter (which works) and creating the minimal reproduction repo (see underneath), I think it's a bug somewhere in `@angular-devkit/schematics-cli`. \r\n\r\n## üî¨ Minimal Reproduction\r\nI created a very minimal repo for reproduction:\r\nhttps://github.com/d-koppenhagen/ngx-multi-select-schematic\r\n\r\n```bash\r\nnpm i -g @angular-devkit/schematics-cli@next\r\ngit clone git@github.com:d-koppenhagen/ngx-multi-select-schematic.git\r\ncd ngx-multi-select-schematic\r\nnpm i\r\n```\r\n\r\n**‚úÖ Using prompt works good:**\r\n```bash\r\nschematics .:hello --debug=false\r\n?

I'd like to introduce a feature that allows us to define a `prebuild` script in `angular.json`.\r\nThat is useful and powerful for solving build process issues like this:\r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/angular/angular-cli/issues/4318\r\n\r\nCurrently, Angular CLI doesn't have hooks on its commands. To execute preprocessing scripts like code-generation before `ng build`, developers have to do it manually.\r\n\r\nIn general, `ng build` is often aliased as `npm run build`. And for production build, often `ng build --prod` is aliased as a different command like `npm run build:prod`. Then my `package.json` becomes like below;\r\n\r\n```json\r\n{\r\n  \"scripts\": {\r\n    \"build\": \"ng build\",\r\n    \"build:prod\": \"ng build --prod\"\r\n  }\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nIn that case, for adding preprocess script, I have to add it into each scripts like this;\r\n\r\n```json\r\n{\r\n  \"scripts\": {\r\n    \"build\": \"npm run codegen && ng build\",\r\n    \"build:prod\": \"npm run codegen && ng build --prod\",\r\n    \"codegen\": \"...\"\r\n  }\r\n}\r\n```\r\nI can use `pre-` hook of npm-scripts, however, a problem is there are two build scripts. It brings a lot of scripts in `package.json`. \r\n\r\n```json\r\n{\r\n  \"scripts\": {\r\n    \"prebuild\": \"npm run codegen\",\r\n    \"build\": \"ng build\",\r\n    \"prebuild:prod\": \"npm run prebuild\",\r\n    \"build:prod\": \"ng build --prod\",\r\n    \"codegen\": \"...\"\r\n  }\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nThis problem can be more serious in a workspace having multiple projects. Each build commands have to take project identifier and often these are separated as different npm-scripts.\r\n\r\n```json\r\n{\r\n  \"scripts\": {\r\n    \"build:appA\": \"ng build appA\",\r\n    \"build:appA:prod\": \"ng build appA --prod\",\r\n    \"build:appB\": \"ng build appB\",\r\n    \"build:appB:prod\": \"ng build appB --prod\",\r\n  }\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nToo many npm-scripts are hard to maintain. So I'd like to propose Angular CLI's command hook feature.\r\n\r\n### Describe the solution you'd like\r\n\r\n**CLI command hook** is a mechanism to execute a script before/after running CLI's command. It is not only for `ng build` but all command. \r\n\r\nWith the hook, pre-build code-generation is able to be configured in `angular.json` like below;\r\n\r\n```json\r\n{\r\n  \"projects\": {\r\n    \"appA\": {\r\n      \"architect\": {\r\n        \"build\": {\r\n          \"hooks\": {\r\n            \"pre\": \"npm run codegen\"\r\n          },\r\n          \"configurations\": {\r\n             \"production\": {\r\n                \"hooks\": {\r\n                   \"pre\": \"npm run codegen:prod\",\r\n                 }\r\n              }\r\n           }\r\n        }\r\n      }\r\n    }\r\n  }\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nOnce configuring this, it can work with `--prod` or any `--configuration`s because each configuration can have its own `hooks` option to override.\r\nAnd any architect commands can be configured as well as `build`. Each architect author doesn't have to know about that.\r\n\r\nEach hook script will be executed at the location of `angular.json`. The initial `CWD` is the workspace root.","Url":"https://github.com/angular/angular-cli/issues/16308","RelatedDescription":"Closed issue \"Proposal: pre/post-commands for Angular CLI\" (#16308)"}],"ResultType":"GitHubIssue"},"material2-Issues":{"Issues":[{"Id":"530745391","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2019-12-03T01:04:25","Actor":"crisbeto","Number":"17850","RawContent":null,"Title":"fix(youtube-player): avoid clobbering api loaded callback","State":"closed","Body":"The YouTube player component adds a global callback for when the API is loaded, however if one existed already it'll be overwritten.

Current implementation of LiveAnnouncer uses a single DOM element for the announcement, so second message overrides the first one and screen reader users hear only the second message.\r\n\r\n2) Consequent announcement of the same message. Current implementation will announce only distinct messages, i.e. clicking the button multiple times will produce only one message for the screen reader. That's not always convenient. For example, if you have a table on the page and you do some polling which updates the table 5 times, we need to be able to announce every of those updates so that screen reader users know what's happening on the page.\r\n\r\n#### Implementation\r\n\r\nWe already have an implementation of a queued LiveAnnouncer which was used in GCP for the last 5 months, it alowed to fix a lot of accessibility problems on pages with heavy UIs.
