There I built my dynamic component, where the dynamic svgs get loaded.\r\nThe svgs can only be loaded with a svg-loader. You can see my implementation in the vue.config.js.\r\n\r\n### What is expected?\r\nLoading the correct file and showing the icon.\r\n\r\n### What is actually happening?\r\nThe build runs without errors and creates a <number>.js file for every chunk - perfect.\r\n\r\nWhen I try to import the model in another vue project and use the <icon name=\"trash\"></icon> component, the following error appears and the icon will not be loaded:\r\n\r\nFailed to resolve async component: function(){return n(\"2eab\")(\"./\".concat(i,\".svg\"))}\r\nReason: Error: Loading chunk 11 failed.\r\n(missing: http://localhost:8080/v-icon.umd.min.11.js)\r\n\r\nIt parses the file right but it can't be found.\r\n\r\n---\r\nThe code sandbox repo is not working! the component is just a lib.

Unlike the other issue I found (https://github.com/vuejs/vue-router/issues/954) where it appeared the user wanted to destroy and create a new router in the same application, the issue I am having is completely separate. \r\n\r\nI have a massive application that essentially uses pjax methodologies to be able to run several SPAs (vue being one) that create the full site. When we navigate away from one SPA to another, the SPA needs to destroy itself so it's code does not interfere with the other SPAs. However, because the vue router cannot be destroyed; it's attempting to execute logic for routing even when the SPA that created it is destroyed. The issue compounds when we have more than 1 vue application running, as there are now 2 instances of vue-router (or more) running at a time. \r\n\r\nSpecifically, we are using the hash version of routing. It looks like the router just attaches an event to the window and listens for popstates, but things get weird when more than one event does something with popstate (an understandably oddball behavior).  I would appreciate reconsideration for allowing vue-router to destroy itself when appropriate. Thanks!\r\n\r\n[edited for spelling/grammar]\r\n\r\n<!-- generated by vue-issues.
