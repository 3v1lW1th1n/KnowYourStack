This is suboptimal since it doesn't allow users to provide their own store type.\r\n\r\nBy utilizing TS2.8's conditional type, we can write a `PermissiveAny<T>` type which allows users to customize interface with `any` as fall-back. It can provide **opt-in** type safety for store.\r\n\r\nThe store type is parameterized by `State`. By introducing a global `RootState` interface, we can annotate `$store` as `Store<PermissiveAny<RootState>>`. If users don't augment `RootState`, the $store type is equivalent to `Store<any>`. On the other hand, if users do augment `RootState`, the store type will be changed to `Store<RootState>`.\r\n\r\nEffectively, this feature allows users to manual annotate store type, but without breaking existing code.\r\n\r\ncc @blake-newman @ktsn "}],"ResultType":"GitHubEvent"},"Vue-Issues":{"Issues":[{"Id":"306200664","IsPullRequest":false,"CreatedAt":"2018-03-17T23:58:57","Actor":"Azperin","Number":"7853","RawContent":null,"Title":"Different vision for global variables in development and minified version.","State":"open","Body":"### Version\r\n2.5.16\r\n\r\n### Reproduction link\r\n[https://codepen.io/anon/pen/PRGvZy](https://codepen.io/anon/pen/PRGvZy)\r\n\r\n### Steps to reproduce\r\nJust change from vue.min.js to vue.js\r\n\r\n### What is expected?\r\nShowing global variable\r\n\r\n### What is actually happening?\r\nError that variable is not defining\r\n\r\n---\r\neasy to reproduce test, so nothing additional\r\n\r\n<!-- generated by vue-issues.

I wasted hours trying various variants of the syntax because, while I will certainly use a binding in a live application, I was trying out the integer-range support in the `v-for` directive for the first time and had plonked multiple instances of the component I was building onto a page with different values of the `value` property, all set as constants.\r\n\r\n## Suggested Resolution\r\n\r\nI propose that either `v-for` is changed so that it works in all three cases *or* that the documentation (https://vuejs.org/v2/guide/list.html#v-for-with-a-Range) is updated to reflect this requirement that, if a component property is used as the range parameter, that property cannot be set to a literal and must be bound.\r\n\r\nI am not sure how to phrase the latter but I guess that simply updating the docs would be the responsible course of action.","Url":"https://github.com/vuejs/vue/issues/7844","RelatedDescription":"Closed issue \"`v-for` directive with integer range does not work with constant attribute but only works with binding\" (#7844)"},{"Id":"305868918","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2018-03-16T10:07:43","Actor":"Hanks10100","Number":"7843","RawContent":null,"Title":"feat(weex): invoke handlers on virtual component instance","State":"open","Body":"**What kind of change does this PR introduce?**\r\n\r\n- [x] Feature\r\n\r\n**Does this PR introduce a breaking change?**\r\n\r\n- [x] No\r\n\r\n**Other information:**\r\n\r\n> **These modifications only take effects on Weex platform.**\r\n\r\nThis is a partial feature of recycle-list.\r\n\r\nBecause of there is no virtual dom in virtual components, the event handler can only be bind on the virtual component template, but the event handler should be executed in the virtual component context (refer to this [brief explanation](https://segmentfault.com/a/1190000013697211#articleHeader13)). So at least two processes should be changed to support this feature.\r\n\r\n**1. Using dynamic `this` for the event handler**\r\n\r\nWhen compiling the `v-on` directive, the expression will be compiled into a handler function. Along with the `with(this){}` magic, the handler function's context (`this`) always be same as the render function. But it should be dynamic for virtual components, the real context of the event handler could be re-assigned at runtime.\r\n\r\nTo achieve this, I added an explicit `this` to the event handlers which are used in recyclable components.

On initial creation, the value returned by the getter is not made reactive since #7302 makes sure not to fetch it and `observe(val)` is a no-op.  However, if the value is set again after the property has been made reactive, it is made reactive as well since `observe(newVal)` in `set` is not gated on missing a getter.  (The premise justifying the change in #7280 that \"why should we get the value of the property in walk, despite the fact, that it is used only if the property has no getter\" is wrong, as the value was used in the call to `observe` even if the property had a getter.)\r\n\r\nWith the present change, properties that _only_ have a getter will still not have their value fetched and won't be made reactive, which should continue to satisfy @DeyLak's needs IIUC.  However, properties that have both a getter and a setter will continue to behave like they did before, being made recursively reactive, and their initial value treated consistently with subsequently set ones.\r\n\r\nIf you think that treating getter vs getter/setter properties differently is confusing, then you may want to revert #7302 instead so all values are made recursively reactive, irrespective of how the property is defined.  This may be easier for developers to understand but would break @DeyLak's use case.\r\n","Url":"https://github.com/vuejs/vue/pull/7828","RelatedDescription":"Open PR \"fix(observer): invoke getters on initial observation if setter defined.

This (in my opinion) is fairly important for routing.  Fortunately, this is actually possible for certain cases.  For example:\r\n\r\n```\r\n{\r\n  routes: [\r\n    {path: \"\", component: \"Index\"},\r\n    {path: \"/settings\", component: \"Settings\"},\r\n    {path: \"*\", component: \"NotFound\"},\r\n  ]\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nThe above config will render the \"NotFound\" for routes such as `/doesntexist`.  For routes that are not dynamic, this is trivial to implement.  The problem comes when attempting to accomplish this same behavior when using navigation guards to determine if a path should be displayed to the user or not.  This could be because of failure to load data, or something like authorization.  The current examples do not actually accomplish this and instead actually change the path via redirection.\r\n\r\nCurrently, the navigation guard api only seems to support a few different actions that can be taken in response to a route being called.  These are:\r\n\r\n - Continue to the next route by calling `next()`\r\n - Fail to load the next route by never calling `next()` (probably not something that should be done)\r\n - Fail to load the next route by calling `next(false)`\r\n - Fail to load the next route by calling `next(<Error>)`\r\n - Redirect by pushing path `next({ path/name: \"xxx\")`\r\n - Redirect by replacing path `next({ path/name: \"xxx\", replace: true)`\r\n\r\nNone of these behave in a way similar to the Github example initially mentioned.\r\n\r\n### What does the proposed API look like?\r\nI would propose that when calling `next()` in a navigation guard (or possibly anywhere a `location` can be received) that there be an option that would allow the instance to be replaced without changing the URL.  This could be a property like `changeURL: Boolean (default false)`.  I am honestly not sure what the best name would be but it seems simple enough.  Another option might be something like calling next with something indicating it should behave as if it failed to match a route (not prevent matching another route).\r\n\r\n<!-- generated by vue-issues.

This is suboptimal since it doesn't allow users to provide their own store type.\r\n\r\nBy utilizing TS2.8's conditional type, we can write a `PermissiveAny<T>` type which allows users to customize interface with `any` as fall-back. It can provide **opt-in** type safety for store.\r\n\r\nThe store type is parameterized by `State`. By introducing a global `RootState` interface, we can annotate `$store` as `Store<PermissiveAny<RootState>>`. If users don't augment `RootState`, the $store type is equivalent to `Store<any>`. On the other hand, if users do augment `RootState`, the store type will be changed to `Store<RootState>`.\r\n\r\nEffectively, this feature allows users to manual annotate store type, but without breaking existing code.\r\n\r\ncc @blake-newman @ktsn ","Url":"https://github.com/vuejs/vuex/pull/1192","RelatedDescription":"Open PR \"[feat] [WIP] Store augmentation\" (#1192)"},{"Id":"305675539","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2018-03-15T18:44:43","Actor":"DannyFeliz","Number":"1191","RawContent":null,"Title":"Update object spread operator stage","State":"open","Body":"Ref: https://github.com/tc39/proposal-object-rest-spread#status-of-this-proposal","Url":"https://github.com/vuejs/vuex/pull/1191","RelatedDescription":"Open PR \"Update object spread operator stage\" (#1191)"},{"Id":"305255470","IsPullRequest":false,"CreatedAt":"2018-03-14T17:24:15","Actor":"corsarioll","Number":"1190","RawContent":null,"Title":"push element in to state ","State":"closed","Body":"I try to add an element to an array but it returns this error\r\n\r\nTypeError: Cannot add property 5, object is not extensible\r\n    at Array.push (<anonymous>)\r\n    at Store.addProjectsMutation (store.js?adc6:67)\r\n    at wrappedMutationHandler (vuex.esm.js?358c:697)\r\n    at commitIterator (vuex.esm.js?358c:389)\r\n    at Array.forEach (<anonymous>)\r\n    at eval (vuex.esm.js?358c:388)\r\n    at Store._withCommit (vuex.esm.js?358c:495)\r\n    at Store.commit (vuex.esm.js?358c:387)\r\n    at Object.boundCommit [as commit] (vuex.esm.js?358c:335)\r\n    at eval (store.js?adc6:120)\r\n\r\neste es mi codigo \r\n\r\n`addProjectsMutation (state,newValue){\r\n            var test = {\r\n                name : \"jeisson\",\r\n                email : \"test@email.com\",\r\n                logoImage : \"https://files.genial.guru/files/news/part_2/20205/1215060-4-1-650-a542d8629a-1501787353.jpg\",\r\n                description : \"test description con espacios y saltos de linea   asd  asd  das  dasd\"\r\n            }\r\n            console.log(state.projects)\r\n            state.projects.push(test)\r\n        },\r\n`","Url":"https://github.com/vuejs/vuex/issues/1190","RelatedDescription":"Closed issue \"push element in to state \" (#1190)"},{"Id":"305156527","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2018-03-14T13:24:40","Actor":"Jinjiang","Number":"1189","RawContent":null,"Title":"[docs] fixed text cut issue (close #1179)","State":"open","Body":"Ref: #1179 ","Url":"https://github.com/vuejs/vuex/pull/1189","RelatedDescription":"Open PR \"[docs] fixed text cut issue (close #1179)\" (#1189)"},{"Id":"304920407","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2018-03-13T20:19:35","Actor":"alexswiontek","Number":"1188","RawContent":null,"Title":"simplify getter","State":"open","Body":"","Url":"https://github.com/vuejs/vuex/pull/1188","RelatedDescription":"Open PR \"simplify getter\" (#1188)"},{"Id":"304734995","IsPullRequest":false,"CreatedAt":"2018-03-13T14:25:14","Actor":"GMounir","Number":"1187","RawContent":null,"Title":"common state namespace","State":"closed","Body":"### Version\r\n3.0.0\r\n\r\nI have state with common objects for example:\r\n\r\n```\r\nexport default {\r\n\tresource: {\r\n\t\tall: [],\r\n\t\tselected: null\r\n\t},\r\n        ....\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\ni import the state to use in components  \r\n\r\n```\r\nimport state from '@common/store/state'\r\n\r\nexport default {\r\n\tnamespaced: true,\r\n\tstate,\r\n\tgetters,\r\n\tactions,\r\n\tmutations\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nafter that i use namespace in every component everything working, but one thing i don't know if is right or not:\r\n\r\ni'm working in namespace **test1**\r\nif i did an action to resource for example fill **resource.all[...]**\r\nthe namespace **test2** also is filled.\r\ni tried _.clone(), _.assign() not working or i did not used right.\r\nPlease someone help me...\r\n\r\n\r\n### What is expected?\r\nexpected: fill only the state that i'm woking in\r\n\r\n### What is actually happening?\r\nhappening: fill all states\r\n\r\n<!-- generated by vue-issues.

As someone who has worked with Redux before, I appreciated just how much more simple VueX was in comparison to the over-engineered and complicated Redux library.\r\n\r\nAs it currently stands, VueX is tightly coupled to Vue. This means VueX cannot be used with any other framework or library. Would it ever be a consideration to make VueX a standalone library and remove the Vue dependency?\r\n\r\nAt the end of the day, VueX allows the user to work with a bunch of data inside of a single object tree. I have not done the investigative work just yet to see how much VueX relies on Vue, but I would love to know if the team are open to making it a standalone state management solution? It's one of the best state management libraries I have ever used.\r\n\r\n### What does the proposed API look like?\r\nThe proposed API would resemble that of the current plugin. In-fact, the only thing I could see being different is that you do not register the plugin using `Vue.use(Vuex)` and just instantiate it directly and assign the result to a variable/constant called `store` or whatever.\r\n\r\nYou would then configure your state management using the same syntax.\r\n\r\n```\r\nimport Vuex from 'vuex'\r\n\r\nconst store = new Vuex.Store({\r\n  state: {\r\n    counter: 0\r\n  },\r\n  getters: {\r\n    counter: state => state.counter * 2\r\n  },\r\n  mutations: {\r\n    increment: state => state.counter  \r\n  }\r\n});\r\n\r\n// Usage\r\n\r\nconsole.log(store.getters.counter);\r\nstore.commit('increment');\r\n```\r\n\r\n<!-- generated by vue-issues.
