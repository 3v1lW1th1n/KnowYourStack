We've evolved since then and are now based on bedrock (on both the server and .NET client) which gives us the ability to run on transports. Since the original SignalR we've done WebSockets, Server-Sent-Events (SSE) (or EventSource in the browser), and LongPolling. With the new fetch APIs it might be possible to support some new scenarios that weren't possible before:\r\n\r\n- HTTP/2 based bi-directional streaming (Request streaming isn't implemented in browsers as yet). The benefit here is that we can use HTTP/2 streams as connections which makes it very cheap to create hub connections. It no longer takes up an entire TCP connection, it's just muxed on top of any existing connection. This also benefits us for when HTTP/3 comes around as it has similar semantics. \r\n    \r\n- Replace Server-Sent-Events with a long running streaming response. This enables us to work around the overhead and limitations of SSE (like being text only and having a specific framing).\r\n\r\nBoth proposals would let us use bearer tokens via headers since we'd be controlling the request initiation.\r\n\r\n*If websockets over HTTP/2 and HTTP/3 becomes a thing, we wouldn't need this though as it would do similar things (though a a little more overhead).*\r\n","Url":"https://github.com/aspnet/AspNetCore/issues/12662","RelatedDescription":"Open issue \"Investigate new transport options for SignalR\" (#12662)"},{"Id":"473693913","IsPullRequest":false,"CreatedAt":"2019-07-28T01:18:54","Actor":"rynowak","Number":"12661","RawContent":null,"Title":"RZC should exit gracefully on warning","State":"open","Body":"```txt\r\nF:\\workspace\\_work\\1\\s\\src\\Mvc\\test\\WebSites\\BasicWebSite\\RazorComponents\\RouterContainer.razor(4,5): warning RZ10014: Found markup element with unexpected name 'NotFoundContent'.

It would be favorable to get either `tcp` or (even better `ftp`) as scheme.\r\n\r\n### To Reproduce\r\nSteps to reproduce the behavior:\r\n1. Using this version of ASP.NET Core '3.0 preview 7'\r\n2. Call `ConfigureKestrel(opt => opt.ListenLocalhost(21))`\r\n3. Output when starting the server (expected, but confusing, and definitely not preferred): `Now listening on: http://localhost:21`.\r\n\r\n### Expected behavior\r\n\r\nIt would be preferrable to have a way to change the scheme to something that wouldn't confuse the user reading the logs, like `ftp`, but `tcp` would work too (as workaround). I'm not able to change `IsHttp`, because it's internal and I don't have a way to add my own `ListenerOptions` implementation, which would be able to return the \"correct\" address.\r\n\r\nThe current (bad) workaround would be to create an extension method, like `ConfigureFtpServer`, which would replicate some of the API of `ConfigureKestrel`, but that would require changing the `IsHttp` property via reflection.\r\n\r\n### Additional context\r\n\r\nAdd any other context about the problem here.\r\nInclude the output of `dotnet --info`\r\n```text\r\n.NET Core SDK (gemäß \"global.json\"):\r\n

If you're using HttpResponse directly you should not need to make any code changes. Read further if you were wrapping or replacing HttpResponse.Body or accessing HttpContext.Features.\r\n\r\nVersion: 3.0.0-preview8\r\n\r\nBackground:\r\nHttpContext, HttpRequest, HttpResponse are backed by an abstraction called [Features](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/aspnet/core/fundamentals/request-features?view=aspnetcore-2.2). This allows functionality to be provided by different components in the pipeline without wrapping the entire HttpContext.\r\n\r\nIn 2.x there are three APIs associated with the response body: IHttpResponseFeature.Body, IHttpSendFileFeature.SendFileAsync, and IHttpBufferingFeature.DisableResponseBuffering, but the later two were rarely implemented or used.\r\n\r\nOver the course of 3.0 several new response body APIs were added:\r\nIHttpResponseBodyPipeFeature\r\nIHttpResponseStartFeature.StartAsync\r\nIHttpResponseCompleteFeature.CompleteAsync\r\n\r\nProblem: With so many APIs it became too hard for middleware to properly intercept the response body. It was also hard for calling code to rely on those features being present on all servers.\r\n\r\nFix: Consolidate the response body APIs onto a single new feature interface [IHttpResponseBodyFeature](https://github.com/aspnet/AspNetCore/blob/4aebd29abca80242f5ff9e89e07d4f1b28788a44/src/Http/Http.Features/src/IHttpResponseBodyFeature.cs). HttpResponse has been updated accordingly, and each server has been updated to provide at least a minimal implementation for all of these APIs. We'll iterate to provide more fully featured implementations in each server but that won't require any more API changes.\r\n\r\nNote if you replace HttpResponse.Body it will now replace the entire IHttpResponseBodyFeature with a wrapper around your given stream using StreamResponseBodyFeature to provide default implementations for all of the expected APIs. Setting back the original stream will undo this change.\r\nhttps://github.com/aspnet/AspNetCore/blob/4aebd29abca80242f5ff9e89e07d4f1b28788a44/src/Http/Http/src/Internal/DefaultHttpResponse.cs#L67-L89\r\n\r\nBreaking change https://github.com/aspnet/AspNetCore/pull/12328\r\n\r\nObsolete existing 2.x APIs\r\nIHttpResponseFeature.Body\r\nIHttpSendFileFeature\r\nIHttpBufferingFeature\r\n\r\nDeleted feature interfaces that were introduced earlier in 3.0.\r\nIHttpResponseBodyPipeFeature\r\nIHttpResponseStartFeature\r\nIHttpResponseCompleteFeature\r\n\r\nIn a future major release we plan to refactor the request body features as well https://github.com/aspnet/AspNetCore/issues/12620.","Url":"https://github.com/aspnet/AspNetCore/issues/12635","RelatedDescription":"Open issue \"[Announcement] HttpResponse body infrastructure changes\" (#12635)"}],"ResultType":"GitHubIssue"},"Identity-Issues":{"Issues":[{"Id":"385990535","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2018-12-19T00:12:57","Actor":"grahamehorner","Number":"2087","RawContent":null,"Title":"WIP: IUserTwoFactorTokenProvider token length POC","State":"closed","Body":"This is a WIP idea to support configuration of token length for UserTwoFactorTokenProviders","Url":"https://github.com/aspnet/Identity/pull/2087","RelatedDescription":"Closed or merged PR \"WIP: IUserTwoFactorTokenProvider token length POC\" (#2087)"},{"Id":"385943112","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2018-12-19T00:06:47","Actor":"grahamehorner","Number":"2086","RawContent":null,"Title":"Update Rfc6238AuthenticationService.cs","State":"closed","Body":"","Url":"https://github.com/aspnet/Identity/pull/2086","RelatedDescription":"Closed or merged PR \"Update Rfc6238AuthenticationService.cs\" (#2086)"},{"Id":"385172059","IsPullRequest":false,"CreatedAt":"2018-12-06T18:36:01","Actor":"Rightio-Limited","Number":"2084","RawContent":null,"Title":"Random Authentication Sign Outs in ASP.NET Core 2.1","State":"closed","Body":"I'm receiving user complaints saying they are being directed to the login screen randomly when it has only been a minute or so since they clicked a button that would have sent a message to the server side.\r\n\r\nHere is a log of one of the errors.\r\n`[INF] Executed action \"MyAppManager.Controllers.API.AgreementAPIController.GetAgreements (MyAppManager)\" in 1473.4897ms (afa2e885)\r\n[INF] Request finished in 1474.816ms 200 application/json; charset=utf-8 (791a596a)\r\n[INF] Request starting HTTP/1.1 GET http://MyAppmanager.MyApp.co.uk/api/AgreementAPI/GetAgreements?searchTerm=1543309403289   (ca22a1cb)\r\n[INF] Entity Framework Core \"2.1.3-rtm-32065\" initialized '\"IdentityDbContext\"' using provider '\"Microsoft.EntityFrameworkCore.SqlServer\"' with options: \"None\" (9958f5bb)\r\n[INF] Executed DbCommand (\"1\"ms) [Parameters=[\"@__get_Item_0='?'

My problem is that its not doing what we would expect it to do.   \r\n\r\nManagement expects when a user logs in and clicks remember me that they will then not be required to type their login and password again for a month.

VS 2019 is about to be released in around early 2019\r\n2. ASP.NET Core 1.0/1.1 is not going to be supported anymore, based on [this page](https://github.com/dotnet/core/blob/master/microsoft-support.md).\r\n3. Creating new ASP.NET Core 1.0/1.1 will always install the .NET Core 1.0/1.1 web tooling, and this is not necessary when previous reason has reached the unsupported period and it's quite near or might be the same time of VS 2019 release.\r\n4. Based on the problem mentioned above, VS 2017 has no \"built in\" tooling when creating new ASP.NET Core 1.0/1.1 project, but the external tooling may help. Therefore for those that still need to maintain ASP.NET Core 1.0/1.1 projects, we could use VS 2017 as long as the VS 2017 is still in support lifecycle or in mainstream support lifecycle.\r\n\r\nI welcome feedback 🙂 \r\n\r\n","Url":"https://github.com/aspnet/Tooling/issues/1078","RelatedDescription":"Closed issue \"Feedback: ensure that .NET Core 1.0/1.1 tooling only supported in VS 2017 and

If you're using HttpResponse directly you should not need to make any code changes. Read further if you were wrapping or replacing HttpResponse.Body or accessing HttpContext.Features.\r\n\r\nVersion: 3.0.0-preview8\r\n\r\nBackground:\r\nHttpContext, HttpRequest, HttpResponse are backed by an abstraction called [Features](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/aspnet/core/fundamentals/request-features?view=aspnetcore-2.2). This allows functionality to be provided by different components in the pipeline without wrapping the entire HttpContext.\r\n\r\nIn 2.x there are three APIs associated with the response body: IHttpResponseFeature.Body, IHttpSendFileFeature.SendFileAsync, and IHttpBufferingFeature.DisableResponseBuffering, but the later two were rarely implemented or used.\r\n\r\nOver the course of 3.0 several new response body APIs were added:\r\nIHttpResponseBodyPipeFeature\r\nIHttpResponseStartFeature.StartAsync\r\nIHttpResponseCompleteFeature.CompleteAsync\r\n\r\nProblem: With so many APIs it became too hard for middleware to properly intercept the response body. It was also hard for calling code to rely on those features being present on all servers.\r\n\r\nFix: Consolidate the response body APIs onto a single new feature interface [IHttpResponseBodyFeature](https://github.com/aspnet/AspNetCore/blob/4aebd29abca80242f5ff9e89e07d4f1b28788a44/src/Http/Http.Features/src/IHttpResponseBodyFeature.cs). HttpResponse has been updated accordingly, and each server has been updated to provide at least a minimal implementation for all of these APIs. We'll iterate to provide more fully featured implementations in each server but that won't require any more API changes.\r\n\r\nNote if you replace HttpResponse.Body it will now replace the entire IHttpResponseBodyFeature with a wrapper around your given stream using StreamResponseBodyFeature to provide default implementations for all of the expected APIs.

If you are not using `Microsoft.AspNetCore.SignalR.Protocols.MessagePack` directly you may still be affected if you are using SignalR and the package is a transitive dependency.\r\n\r\n#### Direct dependencies\r\n\r\nDirect dependencies are discoverable by examining your `csproj` file. They can be fixed by [editing the project file](#fixing-direct-dependencies) or using NuGet to update the dependency.\r\n\r\n#### Transitive dependencies\r\n\r\nTransitive dependencies occur when you add a package to your project that in turn relies on another package. For example, if Contoso publishes a package `Contoso.Utility` which, in turn, depends on `Contoso.Internals` and you add the `Contoso.Utility` package to your project now your project has a direct dependency on `Contoso.Utility` and, because `Contoso.Utility` depends 'Contoso.Internals', your application gains a transitive dependency on the `Contoso.Internals` package.\r\n\r\nTransitive dependencies are reviewable in two ways:\r\n\r\n* In the Visual Studio Solution Explorer window, which supports searching.\r\n* By examining the `project.assets.json` file contained in the obj directory of your project for `csproj` based projects\r\n\r\nThe `project.assets.json` files are the authoritative list of all packages used by your project, containing both direct and transitive dependencies.\r\n\r\nThere are two ways to view transitive dependencies. You can either [use Visual Studio’s Solution Explorer](#vs-solution-explorer), or you can review [the `project.assets.json` file](#project-assets-json)).\r\n\r\n##### <a name=\"vs-solution-explorer\"></a>Using Visual Studio Solution Explorer\r\n\r\nTo use Solution Explorer, open the project in Visual Studio, and then press Ctrl+; to activate the search in Solution Explorer. Search for the [vulnerable package](#affected-software) and make a note of the version numbers of any results you find.\r\n\r\nFor example, searching for `Microsoft.AspNetCore.Mvc.Core` in an example project that contains a package that takes a dependency on `Microsoft.AspNetCore.Mvc` shows the following results in Visual Studio 2017:\r\n\r\n![Screenshot of search results in Visual Studio 2017](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/796298/25858816/8ecdc2b4-3491-11e7-9363-746804bb9832.png)\r\n\r\nThe search results appear as a tree. In the previous results, you can see that a reference to `Microsoft.AspNetCore.Mvc.Core` version 1.1.2 is discovered.\r\n\r\nUnder the Dependencies node is a NuGet node. Under the NuGet node is the list of packages you have directly taken a dependency on and their versions.\r\nIn screenshot, the application takes a direct dependency on `Microsoft.AspNetCore.Mvc`. `Microsoft.AspNetCore.Mvc` in turn has leaf nodes that list its dependencies and their versions.\r\nThe `Microsoft.AspNetCore.Mvc` package takes a dependency on a version of `Microsoft.AspNetCore.Mvc.ApiExplorer`, that in turn takes a dependency on a version of `Microsoft.AspNetCore.Mvc.Core`.\r\n\r\n##### <a name=\"project-assets-json\"></a> Manually reviewing project.assets.json\r\n\r\nOpen the *project.assets.json* file from your project’s obj directory in your editor. We suggest you use an editor that understands JSON and allows you to collapse and expand nodes to review this file.\r\nVisual Studio and Visual Studio Code provide JSON friendly editing.\r\n\r\nSearch the *project.assets.json* file for the [vulnerable package](#affected-software), using the format `packagename/` for each of the package names from the preceding table. If you find the assembly name in your search:\r\n\r\n* Examine the line on which they are found, the version number is after the `/`.\r\n* Compare to the [vulnerable versions table](#affected-software).\r\n\r\nFor example, a search result that shows `System.IO.Pipelines/4.5.0` is a reference to version 4.5.0 of `System.IO.Pipelines`.\r\n\r\nIf your *project.assets.json* file includes references to the [vulnerable package](#affected-software), then you need to fix the transitive dependencies.\r\n\r\nIf you have not found any reference to any vulnerable packages, this means either\r\n\r\n* None of your direct dependencies depend on any vulnerable packages, or\r\n* You have already fixed the problem by updating the direct dependencies.\r\n\r\n### <a name=\"how-fix\"></a>How do I fix the issue?\r\n\r\n#### <a name=\"fixing-direct-dependencies\"></a>Fixing direct dependencies\r\n\r\nOpen *projectname.csproj* in your editor. If you're using Visual Studio, right-click the project and choose **Edit projectname.csproj** from the context menu, where projectname is the name of your project. Look for `PackageReference` elements. The following shows an example project file:\r\n\r\n```xml\r\n<Project Sdk=\"Microsoft.NET.Sdk.Web\">\r\n  <PropertyGroup>\r\n    <TargetFramework>netcoreapp2.1</TargetFramework>\r\n  </PropertyGroup>\r\n  <ItemGroup>\r\n    <PackageReference Include=\"Microsoft.AspNetCore.SignalR.Protocols.MessagePack\" Version=\"1.0.0\" />\r\n  </ItemGroup>\r\n</Project>\r\n```\r\n\r\nThe preceding example has a reference to the [vulnerable package](#affected-software), as seen by the single `PackageReference` element. The name of the package is in the `Include` attribute.\r\nThe package version number is in the `Version` attribute. The previous example shows a single direct dependency on `System.IO.Pipelines` version 4.5.0\r\n\r\nTo update the version to the secure package, change the version number to the updated package version as listed on the table [previously](#affected-software).\r\nIn this example, update `System.IO.Pipelines` to the appropriate [fixed package number](#affected-software) for your major version. Save the *csproj* file. The example *csproj* now looks as follows:\r\n\r\n```xml\r\n<Project Sdk=\"Microsoft.NET.Sdk.Web\">\r\n  <PropertyGroup>\r\n    <TargetFramework>netcoreapp2.1</TargetFramework>\r\n  </PropertyGroup>\r\n  <ItemGroup>\r\n    <PackageReference Include=\"Microsoft.AspNetCore.SignalR.Protocols.MessagePack\" Version=\"1.0.11\" />\r\n  </ItemGroup>\r\n</Project>\r\n```\r\n\r\nIf you're using Visual Studio and you save your updated *csproj* file, Visual Studio will restore the new package version.\r\nYou can see the restore results by opening the **Output** window (Ctrl+Alt+O) and changing the **Show output from** drop-down list to **Package Manager**.\r\n\r\nIf you're not using Visual Studio, open a command line and change to your project directory. Execute the `dotnet restore` command to restore the updated dependencies.\r\n\r\nNow recompile your application. If after recompilation you see a *Dependency conflict warning*, you must update your other direct dependencies to versions that take a dependency on the updated package.\r\n\r\n#### <a name=\"transitive-dependencies\"></a>Fixing transitive dependencies\r\n\r\nIf your transitive dependency review found references to the [vulnerable package](#affected-software), you must add a direct dependency to the updated package to your *csproj* file to override the transitive dependency.\r\n\r\nOpen *projectname.csproj* in your editor. If you're using Visual Studio, right-click the project and choose **Edit projectname.csproj** from the context menu, where projectname is the name of your project.\r\nLook for `PackageReference` nodes, for example:\r\n\r\n```xml\r\n<Project Sdk=\"Microsoft.NET.Sdk.\">\r\n  <PropertyGroup>\r\n    <TargetFramework>net461</TargetFramework>\r\n  </PropertyGroup>\r\n  <ItemGroup>\r\n    <PackageReference Include=\"ThirdParty.NotUpdatedYet\" Version=\"2.0.0\" />\r\n  </ItemGroup>\r\n</Project>\r\n```\r\n\r\nYou must add a direct dependency to the updated version of the [vulnerable package](#affected-software) by adding it to the *csproj* file.\r\nYou do this by adding a new line to the dependencies section, referencing the fixed version.\r\nFor example, if your search showed a transitive reference to a vulnerable `System.ServiceModel.Http` version, you'd add a reference to the [fixed package number](#affected-software).\r\n\r\n```xml\r\n<Project Sdk=\"Microsoft.NET.Sdk.Web\">\r\n  <PropertyGroup>\r\n    <TargetFramework>net461</TargetFramework>\r\n  </PropertyGroup>\r\n  <ItemGroup>\r\n    <PackageReference Include=\"Microsoft.AspNetCore.SignalR.Protocols.MessagePack\" Version=\"1.0.11\" />\r\n    <PackageReference Include=\"ThirdParty.NotUpdatedYet\" Version=\"2.0.0\" />\r\n  </ItemGroup>\r\n</Project>\r\n```\r\n\r\nAfter you've added the direct dependency reference, save your *csproj* file.\r\n\r\nIf you're using Visual Studio, save your updated *csproj* file and Visual Studio will restore the new package versions.\r\nYou can see the restore results by opening the **Output** window (Ctrl+Alt+O) and changing the **Show output from** drop-down list to **Package Manager**.\r\n\r\nIf you're not using Visual Studio, open a command line and change to your project directory. Execute the `dotnet restore` command to restore the new dependencies.\r\n\r\n##### Rebuilding your application\r\n\r\nFinally, you must rebuild your application, test, and redeploy.\r\n\r\n## Other Information\r\n\r\n### Reporting Security Issues\r\n\r\nIf you have found a potential security issue in .NET Core, please email details to secure@microsoft.com.

Link generation would require specifying the `Async` suffix e.g.\r\n\r\n`<a asp-controller=\"Product\" asp-action=\"ListAsync\">List</a>`\r\n\r\nIn 3.0, the action will be routeable via `Product/List` and link generation would require not specifying the `Async` suffix e.g.\r\n\r\n`<a asp-controller=\"Product\" asp-action=\"List\">List</a>`\r\n\r\nThis change does not affect names specified using the `ActionNameAttribute`.
