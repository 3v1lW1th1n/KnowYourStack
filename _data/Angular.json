As as result, when the 'if' gate inside mFG_submit() is hit, it returns immediately, because the form status is 'PENDING'. As a result, even if the asynchronous validator returns true, i,e, the control is valid, the submission logic is never executed.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Describe the solution you'd like\r\n<!-- ✍️--> \r\nOne solution is to check on every submit if the form status is \"PENDING\", and then listen to status changes, and emit ngSubmit again, the moment status changes.

It could publish web apps directly to Firebase; publish Android apps to the PlayStore; export iOS, IPadOS and MacOS code for Xcode; export Windows apps, and/or save IMG files for local use. It would also provide complete version control for the designs, all the apps, and their data -- all within the app builder. UI/UX design could be done directly in the app builder, and/or designs could be imported from and synced with programs like Adobe XD or Sketch., or they could imported from other codebases like React, ReactNative, Vue, etc. The builder could also enable developers to build plugins to extend its functionality. For example, InVision or Figma could build a plugin to export their designs to the app builder. Or, if the NativeScript team thinks they can make a better iPadOS app than the default Flutter app, let them build a plugin that disables the Flutter code for that device and generates the necessary NativeScript code. Additionally, developers behind, say, Chartjs or ThreeJS could build their own plugins that give the app builder new interfaces to support the functionalities of those libraries. Designers and devs could also build templates and themes for some sort of marketplace...idk...spitballin... I know this all sounds like wishful thinking, but it's already happening with tools like React Studio, Supernova Studio, Ionic Studio, etc. IMO, this is the future of app creation. The best apps will always be built by the developers, but good apps should be able to be built for all platforms by designers and by complete noobs wanting to learn. Let's face it, that's exactly who's forgoing Angular for the gentler learning curves of React and Vue. Using the React Studio makes learning React so much easier. It won't matter how good Ivy is at reducing bundle sizes, Angular is just going to keep losing ground until it fades into obscurity if so few of us can figure out how to use it properly. Please help us with better learning tools -- preferably in the form of an all-encompassing visual design-to-code building tool so that we can learn while also being productive. \r\n\r\nNote: as a side bonus, a tool like this would be a good way to help Angular users learn how to use other Google products with Angular. For example, Google Charts, reCaptcha, Google Analytics, Google Ads, Google Apps (Docs, Sheets, etc.), Google Photos -- heck, we could get crazy and build an importer for YouTube and Stadia. Some gamer could build his own web app, mobile app and desktop app with his Google Ads fed into his own layout...all without learning a lick of code -- or maybe just a tiny bit of code...or at least guided thru the process of building an app so learning the code was easier. \r\n\r\n\r\n### Describe alternatives you've considered\r\n<!-- ✍️--> I'm not aware of any alternatives for Angular.

However when we start the server all the urls are still pointing to assets instead of web-vis-angular/assets. If I pull up the images separately using web-vis-angular/assets/..

Any property reads in bindings,\r\ninterpolations etc. read from a given object (usually the component\r\ninstance). In that case there is an _implicit_ receiver which can also\r\nbe specified explicitly by just using `this`.\r\n\r\ne.g.\r\n\r\n```html\r\n<ng-template>{{this.myProperty}}</ng-template>\r\n```\r\n\r\nThis works as expected in Ivy and View Engine, but breaks in case the\r\nimplicit receiver is not used for property reads. For example:\r\n\r\n```html\r\n<my-dir [myFn]=\"greetFn.bind(this)\"></my-dir>\r\n```\r\n\r\nIn that case the `this` will not be properly translated into the generated\r\ntemplate function code because the Ivy compiler currently always treats\r\nthe `ctx` variable as the implicit receiver. This is **not correct** and breaks\r\ncompatibility with View Engine. Rather we need to ensure that we retrieve\r\nthe root context for the standalone implicit receiver similar to how it works\r\nfor property reads (as seen in the example above with `this.myProperty`)\r\n\r\nNote that this requires some small changes to the `expression_converter`\r\nbecause we only want to generate the `eenextContent()` instruction if the\r\nimplicit receiver is _actually_ used/needed. View Engine determines if that is the case by recursively walking through the converted output AST and\r\nchecking for usages of the `o.variable('_co')` variable ([see here][ve_check]). This would work too for Ivy, but involves most likely more code duplication\r\nsince templates are isolated in different functions and it another pass\r\nthrough the output AST for every template expression.\r\n\r\n[ve_check]: https://github.com/angular/angular/blob/0d6c9d36a174f7dc6eb1029e459beecc2dfb0026/packages/compiler/src/view_compiler/view_compiler.ts#L206-L208\r\n\r\nResolves FW-1366.\r\n\r\n**NOTE**: Patch version of 58be2ff88400d7dc876d357f8cc3eb01b0912aae (PR: #30897)","Url":"https://github.com/angular/angular/pull/30994","RelatedDescription":"Closed or merged PR \"fix(ivy): unable to bind to implicit receiver in embedded views [patch]\" (#30994)"},{"Id":"455364692","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2019-06-12T18:37:40","Actor":"jbogarthyde","Number":"31010","RawContent":null,"Title":"WIP: add doc for complex config values","State":"open","Body":"## PR Checklist\r\nPlease check if your PR fulfills the following requirements:\r\n\r\n- [ ] The commit message follows our guidelines: https://github.com/angular/angular/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md#commit\r\n- [ ] Tests for the changes have been added (for bug fixes / features)\r\n- [x] Docs have been added / updated (for bug fixes / features)\r\n\r\n\r\n## PR Type\r\nWhat kind of change does this PR introduce?\r\n\r\n<!-- Please check the one that applies to this PR using \"x\". -->\r\n\r\n- [ ] Bugfix\r\n- [ ] Feature\r\n- [ ] Code style update (formatting, local variables)\r\n- [ ] Refactoring (no functional changes, no api changes)\r\n- [ ] Build related changes\r\n- [ ] CI related changes\r\n- [x] Documentation content changes\r\n- [ ] angular.io application / infrastructure changes\r\n- [ ] Other...

How ever with Angular-Cli it is not possible to generate a component without a selector.\r\n\r\nThe current selectors might actually cause collissions for us due to this separation, for a view selector can be identical to a component selector. (Though so far this never happened!)\r\n\r\n### Describe the solution you'd like\r\n<!-- ✍️--> If you have a solution in mind, please describe it.\r\nEather: Add the --skip-selector param which would generate the component identical to every other component and just doesn't add the selector in the decorator\r\nOr: Add the --routed-component param, which in the future might add other features that are required for routed components (though I do not know of any other differences then adding it to the routing module)\r\n\r\n\r\n### Describe alternatives you've considered\r\n<!-- ✍️--> Have you considered any alternative solutions or workarounds?\r\nI've currently written a custom schematic that calls the the angular component generator but first adds a separate prefix app-view so that we can instantly recognize them as that they should not be re-used inside other views.\r\n\r\n","Url":"https://github.com/angular/angular-cli/issues/14749","RelatedDescription":"Open issue \"Disable selector during component generation\" (#14749)"},{"Id":"455207402","IsPullRequest":false,"CreatedAt":"2019-06-12T13:15:16","Actor":"fetis","Number":"14748","RawContent":null,"Title":"High CPU usage with cli 8.0","State":"open","Body":"I've just upgraded to new Angular8 and noticed that CPU usage dramatically increased for `node` process.
