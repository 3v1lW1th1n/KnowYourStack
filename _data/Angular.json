method.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Describe the solution you'd like\r\nCreate an API on FormControl that would easily allow the input to be focused without having to resort to bringing in Renderer or ElementRef.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Describe alternatives you've considered\r\nhttps://github.com/angular/angular/issues/12463\r\nhttps://github.com/angular/angular/issues/13158\r\n\r\nThe best response for the Angular team is as follows:\r\n>We’re trying to keep our forms modules light and fast, and so it’s important to balance additions to the API with keeping the bundle size manageable.\r\n\r\nI fail to see how a focus method would increase bundle size in any significant way. Bits maybe. The trade off by not doing this is that everyone project implement their own focus thus increasing bundle size for nearly every project anyway since focus on an input is practically universal need for modern UI design.\r\n\r\nThe comment history on both issues show a need.

It seems that when lazy loading routes from a library, each route would need to be its own library or secondary entry point in order for the bundling to work correctly which doesn't make sense when using the libraries for feature development as a feature could consist of multiple lazy-routes.\r\n\r\nMinimal repro: https://github.com/RobM-ADP/lazy-load-bug\r\n\r\n## 🌍 Your Environment\r\n<pre><code>\r\n$ ng version\r\n\r\nAngular CLI: 8.0.3\r\nNode: 10.15.3\r\nOS: darwin x64\r\nAngular: 8.0.1\r\n... animations, common, compiler, compiler-cli, core, forms\r\n... language-service, platform-browser, platform-browser-dynamic\r\n... router\r\n\r\nPackage                            Version\r\n------------------------------------------------------------\r\n@angular-devkit/architect          0.800.3\r\n@angular-devkit/build-angular      0.800.3\r\n@angular-devkit/build-ng-packagr   0.800.3\r\n@angular-devkit/build-optimizer    0.800.3\r\n@angular-devkit/build-webpack      0.800.3\r\n@angular-devkit/core               8.0.3\r\n@angular-devkit/schematics         8.0.3\r\n@angular/cli                       8.0.3\r\n@ngtools/json-schema               1.1.0\r\n@ngtools/webpack                   8.0.3\r\n@schematics/angular                8.0.3\r\n@schematics/update                 0.800.3\r\nng-packagr                         5.3.0\r\nrxjs                               6.5.2\r\ntypescript                         3.4.5\r\nwebpack                            4.30.0\r\n\r\n</code></pre>\r\n\r\n## common.js bundle \r\nNotice that components from both Module AAA and Module BBB are in here.\r\n\r\n<img width=\"1094\" alt=\"common js\" src=\"https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/44685045/59776722-45250000-9281-11e9-9700-2a794ae4df86.png\">\r\n\r\n## aaa-wrapper-module.js bundle\r\nNotice that the only thing in here is the wrapper itself.

It passes in an empty object for the `b` property of `target2`'s options: `{ \"a\": \"bar\", \"b\": {} }`. Thus, `result.b` will be `{}` instead of `{ \"asd\": \"wer\" }`.\r\nThis is done by the Angular's postTransform `addUndefinedDefaults` which is always added to the `CoreSchemaRegistry`. In theory postTransforms can be disabled as seen [here](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli/blob/48e6060e02792cd614a1f80ae8b87109df88c893/packages/angular_devkit/core/src/json/schema/registry.ts#L337L339) using `applyPostTransforms: false`. However, it is not possible to override this value when the builder's schema is compiled and the validator is used, see [here](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli/blob/master/packages/angular_devkit/architect/src/architect.ts#L63) (no second argument is passed to `validation`).\r\n\r\nOf course, I could add some code to my builder that checks for that `{}` and ignores it. But actually, it should be possible to explicitly set `b: {}` to override the inherited value, e.g.:\r\n\r\n    \"target3\": {\r\n        \"builder\": \"mybuilder:f\":\r\n        \"options\": {\r\n            \"targetRef\": \"myproject:target1\",\r\n            \"b\": {}\r\n        }\r\n    },\r\n\r\nSo I really need to distinguish between the `{}` set by the user and the `{}` set by the postTransform.\r\n\r\nNOTE: All of this affects options that are set to type `object` or `array` (in which case `[]` is used as default) in the schema.\r\n\r\n### Describe the solution you'd like\r\nIt would be nice to be able to disable postTransforms for a specific builder, for example in the builder code itself.\r\n\r\nActually I do not know why the `addUndefinedDefaults` transform is used at all, but there is probably a reason for that. Is it? 😛 \r\n\r\n### Describe alternatives you've considered\r\nI cannot imagine any workarounds. Angular modifies the options passed to a builder where it should not, IMHO. In the above case, the user does not specified a `b` property, but Angular passes in an empty object for `b`. And currently there is no way to change that behavior, as far as I can see.\r\n\r\nEDIT:\r\nI did find a workaround, but it is an ugly hack as it relies on the internals of `addUndefinedDefault` and thus could easily break when Angular is updated.\r\n\r\nInstead of this schema:\r\n\r\n    \"b\": {\r\n        \"type\": \"object\",\r\n        \"additionalProperties\": {\r\n            \"type\": \"string\"\r\n        }\r\n    }\r\n\r\nOne can use this schema:\r\n\r\n    \"b\": {\r\n        \"oneOf\": [\r\n            {\r\n                \"type\": \"null\"\r\n            },\r\n            {\r\n                \"type\": \"object\",\r\n                \"additionalProperties\": {\r\n                    \"type\": \"string\"\r\n                }\r\n            }\r\n        ]\r\n    }\r\n\r\nThis works, because Angular detects that two types are possible for `b`: `object`and `null`. This causes Angular to not override the value.\r\nOf course, `null` is now a valid value for `b`, too, but that may not be a problem in some cases.","Url":"https://github.com/angular/angular-cli/issues/14827","RelatedDescription":"Open issue \"applyPostTransforms should not be applied for all builder schemas\" (#14827)"},{"Id":"457860869","IsPullRequest":false,"CreatedAt":"2019-06-19T08:47:43","Actor":"yodi-n","Number":"14826","RawContent":null,"Title":"Update to Angular 8 - web-animations-js","State":"closed","Body":"<!--🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅\r\n\r\nOh hi there! 😄\r\n\r\nTo expedite issue processing please search open and closed issues before submitting a new one.\r\nExisting issues often contain information about workarounds, resolution, or progress updates.\r\n\r\n🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅-->\r\n\r\n\r\n# 🐞 Bug report\r\n\r\nAfter updating our projects form Angular 7 to Angular 8, our Jenkins was not able run npm install due to this line in the package.json file\r\n\"web-animations-js\": \"angular/web-animations-js#release_pr208\"\r\n\r\nThe thing is that our Jenkins is behind a corporate proxy that does not allow calls to github.com\r\n\r\n### Command (mark with an `x`)\r\n<!-- Can you pin-point the command or commands that are effected by this bug?

Or press the 'convert' button.\r\n\r\nSince the template only contains dummy test content within a <p> tag, i'd suggest to remove the whitespace and indentation, which will resolve this issue for most users, for the file then does not have an active indentation.

The ```PersonComponent``` takes a ```Person``` object as an input, and onInit retrieves an ```Activity``` object based on some activity ID from an array of Activities that is cached on a service (```ActivityService```). The retrieved object is then assigned on a variable within the ```PersonComponent``` class.\r\n\r\nThe problem relies when the end user scrolls down and up in the virtual scroll container. When the elements are destroyed and recreated, it seems that the pointers of the activity variable on the ```PersonComponent``` is set to point to another incorrect value.\r\n\r\nTo replicate the problem, \r\n\r\n- Open the stack blits above\r\n- Take note of the Names and their associated activity. \r\n- Scroll down on the virtual scroll container (left scroll), and then all the way up\r\n- Note that the activities associated with the names have changed. \r\n\r\nNote that the content of the activity array is not changing, so it's not an issue of some other process changing the content of the object pointed to. Also if you scroll on a normal non virtual scroll container (right scroll), you can note that the data remains the same and does not change.\r\n\r\nSee also the animated gif below.\r\n\r\n![virtual scroll bug](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/7465421/59760081-bff61700-9291-11e9-9cb1-ca9490da171a.gif)\r\n\r\nI don't know what might be causing the problem, but it seems that it's caused by the virtual scroll functionality.\r\n\r\nI've encounted this problem in v7 but it is also present in v8.\r\n\r\nAlso note that the values that are passed as an @Input() are not changed but remain the same.\r\n \r\n#### Expected Behavior\r\n\r\nIt should be expected that the data that was retrieved onInit is maintained and rendered correctly.\r\n\r\n#### Environment\r\n\r\n- Angular: v8.0.1\r\n- CDK/Material: v8.0.1 (also present in v7.3.6)\r\n- Browser: Chrome\r\n- Operating System: Ubuntu \r\n","Url":"https://github.com/angular/components/issues/16330","RelatedDescription":"Open issue \"Virtual Scroll template caching breaking behavior for Components with ngOnInit\" (#16330)"},{"Id":"457902578","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2019-06-19T09:25:23","Actor":"alvaromartmart","Number":"16329","RawContent":null,"Title":"Fix wrong autocomplete-plain-input example (fixes #16327)","State":"open","Body":"Fix for #16327","Url":"https://github.com/angular/components/pull/16329","RelatedDescription":"Open PR \"Fix wrong autocomplete-plain-input example (fixes #16327)\" (#16329)"},{"Id":"457894952","IsPullRequest":false,"CreatedAt":"2019-06-19T09:09:35","Actor":"alvaromartmart","Number":"16327","RawContent":null,"Title":"Missing example in autocomplete documentation","State":"open","Body":"#### Documentation Feedback\r\n\r\nThe autocomplete documentation is missing the \"Autocomplete on a custom input element\" example.\r\n![missing_autocomplete_example](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/18287793/59752527-b2856080-9282-11e9-863f-1897a6a28370.png)\r\n\r\n\r\n**Affected documentation page:** https://material.angular.io/components/autocomplete/overview#autocomplete-on-a-custom-input-element\r\n","Url":"https://github.com/angular/components/issues/16327","RelatedDescription":"Open issue \"Missing example in autocomplete documentation\" (#16327)"},{"Id":"457861927","IsPullRequest":false,"CreatedAt":"2019-06-19T07:56:34","Actor":"swirlsky","Number":"16326","RawContent":null,"Title":"Drag and Drop resets components being moved","State":"open","Body":"#### What are you seeing that does not match your expectations?\r\n\r\nComponents being drag-and-dropped lose their state.\r\n\r\n#### Reproduction\r\n\r\n[StackBlitz](https://stackblitz.com/edit/angular-ljpjhv)\r\n\r\nSteps to reproduce:\r\n\r\nThere are six rectangles you can drag-and-drop between the two drop zones.

In the current markup of material date picker, ABBR attribute is missing from it's column headers.\r\nThe table used here has **number** dates as it's row data and acronyms of weekdays as its's column data.

In the current markup of material date picker, Please update each of the year div's to include the role of button so that the keyboard and screen reader user can navigate to and be provided proper context and useability.\r\n\r\n      #### Use Case\r\n             By setting the role attribute to button on the year's markup screen\r\n             reader can identify and announce it as a button. So that the users can it to\r\n             their advantage.\r\n\r\n3.  After launching the date picker and clicking on the Month/Year button, focus is currently set within the section that contains the year selection controls.  The issue is that the entire section is read after the selection and not set to the current year as done visually. So after the selection of a year, please set focus to the selected year as done visually.\r\n\r\n      #### Use Case\r\n             By this change users can be notified visually and contextually since it helps\r\n             the screen readers to announce and makes more 508 compatible.\r\n\r\n4.  In the current markup of material date picker, aria-haspopup attribute is currently added incorrectly on the input field instead of the button that triggers the opening of the control.  This is confusing since the user will only open the control via the button and not by the input. So suggestion is to remove the aria markup from the input and add it to only the button that actually triggers the opening of the control.\r\n\r\n         <input  \r\n            class=\"mat-input-element mat-form-field-autofill-control cdk-text-field-autofill- \r\n            monitored ng-pristine ng-valid ng-touched\" id=\"date\" matinput=\"\" \r\n            placeholder=\"MM/DD/YYYY\"\r\n            aria-haspopup=\"true\" aria-invalid=\"false\" aria-required=\"false\">\r\n\r\n      #### Use Case\r\n             This change helps the users with screen readers to announce functionality\r\n             keeps them  away from confusing and thus makes more 508 compatible.\r\n\r\n5.  In the current markup of material date picker, There is a row and TD cells within the data table of the control.  There is no need to include the empty row and the TD cell containing the Month name since it does not provide value to the user using the screen reader. So, removing this from the table data will assist the screen reader in announcing the data effectively to the end user.\r\n\r\n      #### Use Case\r\n            This change helps the screen reader in announcing the data effectively to \r\n            the end user and helps more towards 508 compatibility.","Url":"https://github.com/angular/components/issues/16317","RelatedDescription":"Open issue \"Few accessibility features for date picker for better 508 compatibility\" (#16317)"},{"Id":"457379160","IsPullRequest":false,"CreatedAt":"2019-06-18T14:22:43","Actor":"ashutosh1812","Number":"16314","RawContent":null,"Title":"Template parse errors: Can't bind to 'product' since it isn't a known property of 'app-product-alerts'.","State":"closed","Body":"#### Bug, feature request, or proposal:\r\ni have just started my first basic app in angular using stackblitz but it is giving me some error while adding new component and doing the same given instruction in tutorial. also pasting the whole stack trace please help.\r\n\r\n#### What is the expected behavior?\r\n\r\n\r\n#### What is the current behavior?\r\n\r\nError in /turbo_modules/@angular/compiler@8.0.1/bundles/compiler.umd.js (2479:21)\r\nTemplate parse errors:\r\nCan't bind to 'product' since it isn't a known property of 'app-product-alerts'.\r\n1.
