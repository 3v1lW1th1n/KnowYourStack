Maybe there is a simpler solution.\r\n\r\n~~It works, but I'm not sure if this is a good general solution to the problem.~~ And the problem is that I want to call potentially slow `Blazor.platform.findMethod` only once and store the result in some variable. My first attempt was to call `Blazor.platform.findMethod` in `load` event handler, but it is to early - Blazor is not initialized yet. ~~The above code works because when the first resize event is generated Blazor is already initialized.~~ To solve the problem elegantly we need something like `blazorInitialized` event. Is it available?\r\n\r\n***Update:*** The above code works only if I have the application loaded and then press F5 to refresh the page. It does not work if I open the fresh instance of the browser and then try to load the application for the first time. I get this in console:\r\n```\r\nMonoPlatform.ts:134\r\nUncaught TypeError: assembly_load is not a function\r\n    at findAssembly (MonoPlatform.ts:134)\r\n    at findType (MonoPlatform.ts:147)\r\n    at Object.findMethod (MonoPlatform.ts:160)\r\n    at onResize ((index):40)\r\n```\r\n***Update 2:*** I have just learned that after page refresh `onResizeMethod` variable preserves its value. My current version of JavaScript code is presented below. I still don't like it.\r\n```JS\r\n<script>\r\n        (function () {\r\n            // initialize to be sure that we call Blazor.platform.findMethod after page refresh\r\n            let onResizeMethod = undefined;\r\n            const assemblyName = 'Js';\r\n            const namespace = 'Js';\r\n            const typeName = 'Browser';\r\n            const methodName = 'OnWindowResize';\r\n\r\n            function onResize(event) {\r\n                if (onResizeMethod === undefined) {\r\n                    try {\r\n                        onResizeMethod = Blazor.platform.findMethod(\r\n                            assemblyName,\r\n                            namespace,\r\n                            typeName,\r\n                            methodName\r\n                        );\r\n                    } catch (e) {\r\n                        // catch known exception and ignore, rethrow otherwise\r\n                        if (e.name !== 'TypeError' || e.message !== 'assembly_load is not a function')\r\n                            throw(e);\r\n                    }\r\n                }\r\n                if (onResizeMethod !== undefined) {\r\n                    Blazor.platform.callMethod(onResizeMethod, null, []);\r\n                }\r\n            }\r\n            window.addEventListener('resize', onResize);\r\n        })();\r\n    </script>\r\n```","Url":"https://github.com/aspnet/Blazor/issues/907","RelatedDescription":"Closed issue \"When can we safely call Blazor.platform.findMethod?\" (#907)"},{"Id":"328621784","IsPullRequest":false,"CreatedAt":"2018-06-04T10:06:05","Actor":"InnovationGB","Number":"914","RawContent":null,"Title":"Javascript interop/not linking as I would expect","State":"closed","Body":"I understand that I may be doing this wrong, but with the knowledge I have this is confusing and I am hoping someone can clear this up for me, as I am trying to understand how I can link javascript files that are already functioning with my app components. \r\nhttps://github.com/InnovationGB/BlazorRainEffect\r\nThis isn't anything I made but rather a project from 2015 utilizing webgl in order to give a rainy effect.

So in the MainContent there is a button that triggers the RightMenu to open and set it's Content (a BlazorComponent)\r\n\r\n```\r\nAppState.cs\r\n    public class AppState : IAppState\r\n    {\r\n        public bool IsRightMenuOpen { get; set; }\r\n        public BlazorComponent ContentOfTheRightMenu{ get; set; }\r\n    }\r\n```\r\n```\r\nMainContent.cshtml\r\n@inject IAppState appState\r\n<div>\r\n    <button onclick=\"@ToggleRightMenu\"> Open Right Menu With Content</button>\r\n</div>\r\n\r\n@functions{\r\n    void ToggleRightMenu()\r\n    {\r\n        appState.RightContent = //MyComponentName <= How can we instantiate this?\r\n        appState.ToggleRightMenu();\r\n    }\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nRightMenu.cshtml\r\n```\r\n@inject IAppState appState\r\n<div>\r\n@appState.ContentOfTheRightMenu\r\n</div>\r\n```\r\n\r\nWhere I fail to succeed seems to be the following line:\r\n`        appState.RightContent = MyComponentName\r\n`\r\nHow can we instantiate a component like this?\r\n\r\nAn alternative would be to create an enum of each components you want to render and create a switch statement in the RightMenu.cshtml but I doubt that this is the way it should work. Please note that this issue is not about tracking changes or triggering a StateHasChanged on the right component, it's simply setting the component to make it possible to render later.\r\n\r\n","Url":"https://github.com/aspnet/Blazor/issues/919","RelatedDescription":"Closed issue \"Setting a component as parameter\" (#919)"},{"Id":"328712139","IsPullRequest":false,"CreatedAt":"2018-06-03T23:30:35","Actor":"alexanderjwoods","Number":"915","RawContent":null,"Title":"Default project throws \"CS0234 - The type or namespace name 'Mvc' does not exist in the namespace 'Microsoft.AspNetCore'\"","State":"closed","Body":"Apologize if this is the wrong spot, but when created a blank Blazer app using VS 15.7.3 I get 110 errors of CS0234.

But, as we are all aware, SPA frameworks and approaches waver in and out of favour (fervor) quite rapidly. And, rightly or wrongly, the current front-end ecosystem thrives in a state of rapid change. Case in point, there are already several alternate '.net wasm' projects sprouting up.\r\n\r\nWith this in mind, would it make sense to push this initiative into more of a layered approach - separating out the core enabling technologies from the front-end SPA parts - to ensure that the core technologies can be developed, shared, and maintained even _if_ differing SPA approaches develop / are desired?\r\n\r\nFor example, I could imagine separating the following into composible pieces:\r\n\r\n- wasm framework / bootstrapper,\r\n- JS / Dom interop APIs,\r\n- virtual dom APIs,\r\n- routing,\r\n- Razor components, etc.\r\n\r\nIn the back-end world (while more could be done) many of the ASP pieces can be composed and used in significantly different scenarios.\r\n\r\nApologies if I have missed something and a similar discussion is already in the pipeline.\r\n\r\nThank you kindly,\r\n","Url":"https://github.com/aspnet/Blazor/issues/912","RelatedDescription":"Closed issue \"Layered approach for core technologies\" (#912)"},{"Id":"328451954","IsPullRequest":false,"CreatedAt":"2018-06-01T13:02:13","Actor":"Worble","Number":"911","RawContent":null,"Title":"Having trouble understanding BL9980: \"Expressions like 'Title' inside of a tag must be part of an attribute.\"","State":"closed","Body":"I'm having a little trouble understanding the error here.\r\n\r\nThe error being raised is specifically to do with:\r\n`<div class=\"divider text-center\" data-content=\"@Title\"></div>`\r\n\r\nThe full error is:\r\n`BL9980 Expressions like 'Title' inside of a tag must be part of an attribute.
