This change reduces the code to handle attributes from 60k LOC to 30k, reduces 3 virtual methods to a single one per schema, and reduces the static arrays per schema from 2 to 1.  A future request will attempt to bring a similar system to the element definitions/creation.\r\n"},{"Id":"8083643573","Type":"IssuesEvent","CreatedAt":"2018-08-08T12:33:16","Actor":"SSAbraham","Repository":"OfficeDev/Open-XML-SDK","Organization":"OfficeDev","RawContent":null,"RelatedAction":"closed","RelatedUrl":"https://github.com/OfficeDev/Open-XML-SDK/issues/521","RelatedDescription":"Closed issue \".NET Core and OpenXmlSDK\" (#521) at OfficeDev/Open-XML-SDK","RelatedBody":"**Description**\r\n\r\nError: Package 'DocumentFormat.OpenXmlSDK 2.0.0' was restored using '.NETFramework,Version=v4.6.1' instead of the project target framework '.NETCoreApp,Version=v2.1'.
