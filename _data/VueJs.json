This is suboptimal since it doesn't allow users to provide their own store type.\r\n\r\nBy utilizing TS2.8's conditional type, we can write a `PermissiveAny<T>` type which allows users to customize interface with `any` as fall-back. It can provide **opt-in** type safety for store.\r\n\r\nThe store type is parameterized by `State`. By introducing a global `RootState` interface, we can annotate `$store` as `Store<PermissiveAny<RootState>>`. If users don't augment `RootState`, the $store type is equivalent to `Store<any>`. On the other hand, if users do augment `RootState`, the store type will be changed to `Store<RootState>`.\r\n\r\nEffectively, this feature allows users to manual annotate store type, but without breaking existing code.\r\n\r\ncc @blake-newman @ktsn ","Url":"https://github.com/vuejs/vuex/pull/1192","RelatedDescription":"Open PR \"[feat] [WIP] Store augmentation\" (#1192)"},{"Id":"305255470","IsPullRequest":false,"CreatedAt":"2018-03-14T17:24:15","Actor":"corsarioll","Number":"1190","RawContent":null,"Title":"push element in to state ","State":"closed","Body":"I try to add an element to an array but it returns this error\r\n\r\nTypeError: Cannot add property 5, object is not extensible\r\n    at Array.push (<anonymous>)\r\n    at Store.addProjectsMutation (store.js?adc6:67)\r\n    at wrappedMutationHandler (vuex.esm.js?358c:697)\r\n    at commitIterator (vuex.esm.js?358c:389)\r\n    at Array.forEach (<anonymous>)\r\n    at eval (vuex.esm.js?358c:388)\r\n    at Store._withCommit (vuex.esm.js?358c:495)\r\n    at Store.commit (vuex.esm.js?358c:387)\r\n    at Object.boundCommit [as commit] (vuex.esm.js?358c:335)\r\n    at eval (store.js?adc6:120)\r\n\r\neste es mi codigo \r\n\r\n`addProjectsMutation (state,newValue){\r\n            var test = {\r\n                name : \"jeisson\",\r\n                email : \"test@email.com\",\r\n                logoImage : \"https://files.genial.guru/files/news/part_2/20205/1215060-4-1-650-a542d8629a-1501787353.jpg\",\r\n                description : \"test description con espacios y saltos de linea   asd  asd  das  dasd\"\r\n            }\r\n            console.log(state.projects)\r\n            state.projects.push(test)\r\n        },\r\n`","Url":"https://github.com/vuejs/vuex/issues/1190","RelatedDescription":"Closed issue \"push element in to state \" (#1190)"},{"Id":"305156527","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2018-03-14T13:24:40","Actor":"Jinjiang","Number":"1189","RawContent":null,"Title":"[docs] fixed text cut issue (close #1179)","State":"open","Body":"Ref: #1179 ","Url":"https://github.com/vuejs/vuex/pull/1189","RelatedDescription":"Open PR \"[docs] fixed text cut issue (close #1179)\" (#1189)"},{"Id":"304734995","IsPullRequest":false,"CreatedAt":"2018-03-13T14:25:14","Actor":"GMounir","Number":"1187","RawContent":null,"Title":"common state namespace","State":"closed","Body":"### Version\r\n3.0.0\r\n\r\nI have state with common objects for example:\r\n\r\n```\r\nexport default {\r\n\tresource: {\r\n\t\tall: [],\r\n\t\tselected: null\r\n\t},\r\n        ....\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\ni import the state to use in components  \r\n\r\n```\r\nimport state from '@common/store/state'\r\n\r\nexport default {\r\n\tnamespaced: true,\r\n\tstate,\r\n\tgetters,\r\n\tactions,\r\n\tmutations\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nafter that i use namespace in every component everything working, but one thing i don't know if is right or not:\r\n\r\ni'm working in namespace **test1**\r\nif i did an action to resource for example fill **resource.all[...]**\r\nthe namespace **test2** also is filled.\r\ni tried _.clone(), _.assign() not working or i did not used right.\r\nPlease someone help me...\r\n\r\n\r\n### What is expected?\r\nexpected: fill only the state that i'm woking in\r\n\r\n### What is actually happening?\r\nhappening: fill all states\r\n\r\n<!-- generated by vue-issues.

As someone who has worked with Redux before, I appreciated just how much more simple VueX was in comparison to the over-engineered and complicated Redux library.\r\n\r\nAs it currently stands, VueX is tightly coupled to Vue. This means VueX cannot be used with any other framework or library. Would it ever be a consideration to make VueX a standalone library and remove the Vue dependency?\r\n\r\nAt the end of the day, VueX allows the user to work with a bunch of data inside of a single object tree. I have not done the investigative work just yet to see how much VueX relies on Vue, but I would love to know if the team are open to making it a standalone state management solution? It's one of the best state management libraries I have ever used.\r\n\r\n### What does the proposed API look like?\r\nThe proposed API would resemble that of the current plugin. In-fact, the only thing I could see being different is that you do not register the plugin using `Vue.use(Vuex)` and just instantiate it directly and assign the result to a variable/constant called `store` or whatever.\r\n\r\nYou would then configure your state management using the same syntax.\r\n\r\n```\r\nimport Vuex from 'vuex'\r\n\r\nconst store = new Vuex.Store({\r\n  state: {\r\n    counter: 0\r\n  },\r\n  getters: {\r\n    counter: state => state.counter * 2\r\n  },\r\n  mutations: {\r\n    increment: state => state.counter  \r\n  }\r\n});\r\n\r\n// Usage\r\n\r\nconsole.log(store.getters.counter);\r\nstore.commit('increment');\r\n```\r\n\r\n<!-- generated by vue-issues.
