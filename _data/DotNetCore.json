This advisory also provides guidance on what developers can do to update their applications to remove this vulnerability.\r\n\r\nMicrosoft is aware of a remote code execution vulnerability exists in .NET software when the software fails to check the source markup of a file. An attacker who successfully exploited the vulnerability could run arbitrary code in the context of the current user.\r\n\r\nExploitation of the vulnerability requires that a user open a specially crafted file with an affected version of .NET Core. In an email attack scenario, an attacker could exploit the vulnerability by sending the specially crafted file to the user and convincing the user to open the file.\r\n\r\nThe security update addresses the vulnerability by correcting how .NET Core checks the source markup of a file.\r\n\r\n## Discussion\r\n\r\nDiscussion for this issue can be found at https://github.com/dotnet/wpf/ **TBD**\r\n\r\n## <a name=\"mitigation-factors\"></a>Mitigation factors\r\n\r\nMicrosoft has not identified any mitigating factors for this vulnerability.\r\n\r\n## <a name=\"affected-software\"></a>Affected software\r\n\r\nAny .NET Core 3.0 application running on .NET Core 3.0.0, 3.0.1 or 3.1.0.\r\n\r\n### <a name=\"how-affected\"></a>How do I know if I am affected?\r\n\r\nIf you have a runtime or SDK with a version listed in [affected software](#affected-software) you are exposed to the vulnerability.\r\n\r\n### <a name=\"how-fix\"></a>How do I fix the issue?\r\n\r\nTo fix the issue please install the latest version of .NET Core. If you have multiple versions of .NET Core installed you will need to install multiple runtimes, or SDKs depending on what you have installed.\r\n\r\nYou can list the versions you have installed by running the `dotnet --info` command. You will see output like the following;\r\n\r\n```\r\n.NET Core SDK (reflecting any global.json):\r\n Version:   3.1.100\r\n Commit:    cd82f021f4\r\n\r\nRuntime Environment:\r\n OS Name:     Windows\r\n OS Version:  10.0.18363\r\n OS Platform: Windows\r\n RID:         win10-x64\r\n Base Path:   C:\\Program Files\\dotnet\\sdk\\3.1.100\\\r\n\r\nHost (useful for support):\r\n  Version: 3.1.0\r\n  Commit:  65f04fb6db\r\n\r\n.NET Core SDKs installed:\r\n  3.0.101 [C:\\Program Files\\dotnet\\sdk]\r\n  3.1.100 [C:\\Program Files\\dotnet\\sdk]\r\n\r\n.NET Core runtimes installed:\r\n  Microsoft.AspNetCore.App 3.0.1 [C:\\Program Files\\dotnet\\shared\\Microsoft.AspNetCore.App]\r\n  Microsoft.AspNetCore.App 3.1.0 [C:\\Program Files\\dotnet\\shared\\Microsoft.AspNetCore.App]\r\n  Microsoft.NETCore.App 3.0.1 [C:\\Program Files\\dotnet\\shared\\Microsoft.NETCore.App]\r\n  Microsoft.NETCore.App 3.1.0 [C:\\Program Files\\dotnet\\shared\\Microsoft.NETCore.App]\r\n  Microsoft.WindowsDesktop.App 3.0.1 [C:\\Program Files\\dotnet\\shared\\Microsoft.WindowsDesktop.App]\r\n  Microsoft.WindowsDesktop.App 3.1.0 [C:\\Program Files\\dotnet\\shared\\Microsoft.WindowsDesktop.App]\r\n\r\nTo install additional .NET Core runtimes or SDKs:\r\n  https://aka.ms/dotnet-download\r\n```\r\n\r\n* For machines running .NET Core 3.0, you should download and install Runtime 3.0.2 or SDK 3.0.102 from https://dotnet.microsoft.com/download/dotnet-core/3.0.\r\n* For machines running .NET Core 3.1, you should download and install Runtime 3.1.1 or SDK 3.1.101 from https://dotnet.microsoft.com/download/dotnet-core/3.1.\r\n\r\nIf you have both 3.0 and 3.1 installed, you need to install the updates for both versions.\r\n\r\nOnce you have installed the updated runtime or SDK, restart your apps for the update to take effect.\r\n\r\nAdditionally, if you've deployed [self-contained applications](https://docs.microsoft.com/dotnet/core/deploying/#self-contained-deployments-scd) targeting any of the impacted versions, these applications are also vulnerable and must be recompiled and redeployed.\r\n\r\n## Other Information\r\n\r\n### Reporting Security Issues\r\n\r\nIf you have found a potential security issue in .NET Core, please email details to secure@microsoft.com.

There was a missing implementation when removing values from the module cache which in turn triggered a sporadic bad error in the DAC\r\n\r\nThis has already been fixed in .NET 5 (see dotnet/runtime#32311).

From dotnet/runtime#2317 \r\n> Developing/using the use cases that where described in the .net core announcement under [Assembly Unloadability](https://devblogs.microsoft.com/dotnet/announcing-net-core-3-0) is slowed down as it is not possible to debug any scenario that requires assembly unloading. Without this fix the application must be restarted or tested without a debugger attached. This makes plugin development very annoying and less attractive.\r\n\r\nAlso see https://developercommunity.visualstudio.com/content/problem/698374/vs2019-and-fatal-error-has-occurred-and-debugging.html\r\n\r\n## Regression?\r\nNot a regression. Unloadable ALC's were introduced in the 3.0/3.1 time-frame as a new feature. However, adoption is cumbersome on inner loop due to this. \r\n\r\n## Testing\r\nThere's currently work in flight to add ALCs and unloadability verification for debugger scenarios. \r\n\r\n## Risk\r\nLow. The only code path that reaches this is exactly the one that's getting fixed and that still has somewhat low adoption. \r\n\r\n## Code Reviewer\r\n@sdmaclea "}],"ResultType":"GitHubEvent"},"CLI":{"Events":[{"Id":"11622018504","Type":"PullRequestEvent","CreatedAt":"2020-02-27T05:05:45","Actor":"dotnet-maestro[bot]","Repository":"dotnet/cli","Organization":"dotnet","RawContent":null,"RelatedAction":"merged","RelatedUrl":"https://github.com/dotnet/cli/pull/13265","RelatedDescription":"Merged pull request \"[release/3.1.2xx] Update dependencies from nuget/nuget.client\" (#13265) at dotnet/cli","RelatedBody":"This pull request updates the following dependencies\r\n\r\n[marker]: <> (Begin:3c9d65bb-d2bc-4c69-c5d7-08d76fa9c820)\r\n## From https://github.com/NuGet/NuGet.Client\r\n- **Subscription**: 3c9d65bb-d2bc-4c69-c5d7-08d76fa9c820\r\n- **Build**: 5.5.0.6473\r\n- **Date Produced**: 2/26/2020 12:52 AM\r\n- **Commit**: 4ba7bfa82f894ec32a554ca8d2df143675c85735\r\n- **Branch**: refs/heads/release-5.5.x\r\n- **Updates**:\r\n  -

We are working to convert this documentation to an official one.\r\n\r\n## Motivation\r\n\r\nEnable high cohesion between tools and corresponding code repositories. The repository maintainer could check-in a list of dotnet tools with certain version. And other contributor can use these tools within the repository with certain gestures. Local tools use the same package as global tools.\r\n\r\n## Walk through\r\n\r\n### Install the latest dotnet SDK \"checkin build\"\r\n\r\n1. You can find the installer at [here](https://github.com/dotnet/core-sdk#installers-and-binaries) under the _Master (3.0.x Runtime)_ column.\r\n2. Most of the existing dotnet tools package(global tools) are targeting runtime netcoreapp2.1. You need to install it in order to run the existing command. You can find it at [here](https://www.microsoft.com/net/download/dotnet-core/2.1) under _Run apps - Runtime_ column.\r\n\r\n### Create tool manifest file\r\n\r\nRun `dotnet new tool-manifest` command. It will create a tool manifest file _dotnet-tools.json_ under the directory _.config_.\r\n\r\n### Restore command\r\n\r\nIn order to use the command specified in tool manifest file. You need to run command `dotnet tool restore` and you should see the following success message:\r\n\r\n```shell\r\nTool 'dotnetsay' (version '2.1.4') was restored. Available commands: dotnetsay\r\n\r\n\r\nRestore was successful.\r\n```\r\n\r\n### Run the command\r\n\r\nRun local tool would require prefix `dotnet`. So it will not be ambiguous most of the time. And when there is a global tools with the pattern \"dotnet-*\" CLI will find the tool with the following rule\r\n\r\n| global tools command invoke  | local tools command invoke  |\r\n| ------ | ------ |\r\n| dotnetsay  | dotnet dotnetsay  |\r\n| dotnet say (aka dotnet-say)  | dotnet say  |\r\n| dotnetsay and dotnet say both exist  | dotnet dotnetsay and dotnet dotnet-say |\r\n\r\nYou could also call it by `dotnet tool run dotnetsay hi`. \"dotnet tool run\" is not ambiguous.\r\n\r\nIf you see the following error, please install netcoreapp2.1 runtime. At https://www.microsoft.com/net/download/dotnet-core/2.1. Since _dotnetsay_ and most of the global tools are targeting 2.1 runtime while preview dotnet SDK only contains preview netcoreapp3.0 runtime.\r\n\r\n```shell\r\nIt was not possible to find any compatible framework version\r\nThe specified framework 'Microsoft.NETCore.App', version '2.1.0' was not found.\r\n  - Check application dependencies and target a framework version installed at:\r\n      C:\\Users\\name\\Downloads\\dotnet-sdk-latest-win-x64-localtools\\\r\n  - Installing .NET Core prerequisites might help resolve this problem:\r\n      https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkID=798306&clcid=0x409\r\n  - The .NET Core framework and SDK can be installed from:\r\n      https://aka.ms/dotnet-download\r\n  - The following versions are installed:\r\n      3.0.0-preview1-27017-04 at [C:\\Users\\name\\dotnet-sdk-latest-win-x64\\shared\\Microsoft.NETCore.App]\r\n```\r\n\r\n## Manage local tools\r\n\r\n### Install new local tool\r\n\r\nRun `dotnet tool install <PACKAGE_ID>` (`dotnet tool install dotnetsay`) to install new command. It will add the tool entry to your manifest file. And at the same time it will restore the tool so you can invoke it right away.\r\n\r\nThe message will show which manifest file it added to\r\n\r\n```\r\nYou can invoke the tool from this directory using the following command: dotnet tool run dotnetsay\r\nTool 'dotnetsay' (version '2.1.4') was successfully installed. Entry is added to the manifest file /Users/name/tools/sub/dotnet-tools.json\r\n```\r\n\r\n### Uninstall local tool\r\n\r\nRun `dotnet tool uninstall <PACKAGE_ID>`\r\n\r\n### Update local tool\r\nRun `dotnet tool update <PACKAGE_ID>`. If the new package version is higher. SDK will find the first manifest file that contains the package id and update it. If there is no such package id in any manifest file (that is in the _scope_), SDK will add a new entry to the closest manifest file.\r\n\r\n### List local tool\r\n\r\nRun `dotnet tool list` to list all available tools in the current directory. It will also list the origin manifest of the tool. It can be used to diagnose unexpected tools in the current directory\r\n\r\n```\r\n$ dotnet tool list\r\nPackage Id            Version      Commands             Manifest\r\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\r\ndotnet-dbinfo         1.3.1        dotnet-dbinfo        /Users/name/tools/sub/dotnet-tools.json\r\ndotnet-depends        0.2.0        dotnet-depends       /Users/name/tools/sub/dotnet-tools.json\r\namazon.ecs.tools      3.0.0        dotnet-ecs           /Users/name/tools/sub/dotnet-tools.json\r\ndotnet-encrypto       1.0.5        dotnet-encrypto      /Users/name/tools/sub/dotnet-tools.json\r\nt-rex                 1.0.53       t-rex                /Users/name/tools/.config/dotnet-tools.json\r\n```\r\n\r\n## Feature Detail\r\n\r\n### The _scope_ of the tool manifest file\r\n\r\nIf there is a tool manifest file or a tool manifest file under folder _.config_ in the parent/current directory of the current directory. The current directory has the access to the tools specified in the tool manifest file. For example. If there is a tool manifest with a tool _dotnetsay_ in the root of the repository, the user could run `dotnet tool run dotnetsay hi` in any sub directory of the repository.\r\n\r\n### isRoot flag\r\n\r\nThe flag in the manifest file means \"stop looking up parent directories for manifest file when the first one is found\". This entry in manifest file is required.\r\n\r\n### Invoke local tools\r\n\r\nGlobal tools use $PATH and shell to resolve command via shim. However we could not use the same mechanism due to the limitation of the operation system shell. \r\n\r\n### Example of multiple tools\r\n\r\n```json\r\n{\r\n    \"version\": \"1\",\r\n    \"isRoot\": true,\r\n    \"tools\": {\r\n        \"t-rex\": {\r\n            \"version\": \"1.0.53\",\r\n            \"commands\": [\"t-rex\"],\r\n        },\r\n        \"dotnetsay\": {\r\n            \"version\": \"2.1.4\",\r\n            \"commands\": [\"dotnetsay\"]\r\n        }\r\n    }\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\n### Requirement of commands\r\n\r\nWe require listing out the command in the tool package. Note many dotnet tool packages do not have matching package id and the command.\r\n\r\n### Term\r\n\r\nLocal tool scope: the working directory that has the access to the tool specified in the `dotnet-tools.json` stored in current or parent directory.\r\n\r\nTool manifest file: `dotnet-tools.json`\r\n\r\nRepository maintainer: A dotnet tool consumer. Programmers have the write access to the repository and decide which dotnet tools should be used in this repository.\r\n\r\nRepository contributor: A dotnet tool consumer. Programmers have the read access to the repository and use dotnet tools decided by repository maintainer.\r\n\r\nLocal tools restore: Restore all tools that is possible to be accessed by current directory and generate cache.\r\n\r\nResolver cache: Technical, not customer facing. Cache to speed up the local tool resolution."},{"Id":"11629695100","Type":"PullRequestEvent","CreatedAt":"2020-02-27T20:49:11","Actor":"sfoslund","Repository":"dotnet/sdk","Organization":"dotnet","RawContent":null,"RelatedAction":"merged","RelatedUrl":"https://github.com/dotnet/sdk/pull/10716","RelatedDescription":"Merged pull request \"Update core branding\" (#10716) at dotnet/sdk","RelatedBody":"Removing `core` from branding/ first run experience"},{"Id":"11625605138","Type":"PullRequestEvent","CreatedAt":"2020-02-27T13:00:59","Actor":"dotnet-maestro[bot]","Repository":"dotnet/sdk","Organization":"dotnet","RawContent":null,"RelatedAction":"opened","RelatedUrl":"https://github.com/dotnet/sdk/pull/10725","RelatedDescription":"Opened pull request \"[master] Update dependencies from dotnet/arcade\" (#10725) at dotnet/sdk","RelatedBody":"This pull request updates the following dependencies\r\n\r\n[marker]: <> (Begin:daa187e0-7e60-4c7a-c1ac-08d6354da8a8)\r\n## From https://github.com/dotnet/arcade\r\n- **Subscription**: daa187e0-7e60-4c7a-c1ac-08d6354da8a8\r\n- **Build**: 20200226.7\r\n- **Date Produced**: 2/27/2020 12:44 AM\r\n- **Commit**: cd4164e1f3f7daf2a6f8dbd012210c93521bd82f\r\n- **Branch**: refs/heads/master\r\n- **Updates**:\r\n  - **Microsoft.DotNet.Arcade.Sdk** -> 5.0.0-beta.20126.7\r\n  - **Microsoft.DotNet.Helix.Sdk** -> 5.0.0-beta.20126.7\r\n  - **Microsoft.DotNet.SignTool** -> 5.0.0-beta.20126.7\r\n\r\n[marker]: <> (End:daa187e0-7e60-4c7a-c1ac-08d6354da8a8)\r\n\r\n"},{"Id":"11623784248","Type":"IssuesEvent","CreatedAt":"2020-02-27T09:35:53","Actor":"ststeiger","Repository":"dotnet/sdk","Organization":"dotnet","RawContent":null,"RelatedAction":"opened","RelatedUrl":"https://github.com/dotnet/sdk/issues/10724","RelatedDescription":"Opened issue \"Template for worker/service doesn't by default add the Microsoft.Extensions.Hosting.WindowsServices assembly, and call UseWindowsService if the OS is Windows\" (#10724) at dotnet/sdk","RelatedBody":"I find it strange that the template for worker/service doesn't by default add the Microsoft.Extensions.Hosting.WindowsServices assembly, and call\r\nUseWindowsService if the os is windows.\r\n\r\nNot that I mind adding it, but if I need to google it from 3rd party blogs, to get microsoft software to work on the microsoft OS, and in addition have to figure out that since the blog was written, the method's name has changed to \"UseWindowsService\", then it's badly documented. \r\n\r\nWhy not just include this in the template ?\r\nAnybody who doesn't want it can remove it, then - but that shouldn't be too many.\r\nThat way, it would work out of the box by default.\r\nIn my opinion, I shouldn't have to google anything for this.\r\n\r\nI'd just put this into the default-template: (and add the necessary nuget-assemblies by default)\r\n(in the Worker-Template in function private static IHostBuilder CreateHostBuilder(string[] args))\r\n```\r\nif (System.Runtime.InteropServices.RuntimeInformation.IsOSPlatform(System.Runtime.InteropServices.OSPlatform.Windows))\r\n{\r\n    // https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/aspnet/core/host-and-deploy/windows-service?view=aspnetcore-3.1&tabs=visual-studio#app-configuration\r\n    // Requires Microsoft.Extensions.Hosting.WindowsServices\r\n    builder.UseWindowsService();\r\n} \r\nelse if (System.Runtime.InteropServices.RuntimeInformation.IsOSPlatform(System.Runtime.InteropServices.OSPlatform.Linux))\r\n{\r\n    // https://devblogs.microsoft.com/dotnet/net-core-and-systemd/\r\n    // Requires Microsoft.Extensions.Hosting.Systemd\r\n    builder.UseSystemd();\r\n}\r\n// and whatever launchd needs on OSX\r\n```\r\n\r\nSee https://github.com/dotnet/runtime/issues/32735#issuecomment-591836236 for details\r\n"},{"Id":"11621067318","Type":"IssuesEvent","CreatedAt":"2020-02-27T01:39:25","Actor":"nkolev92","Repository":"dotnet/sdk","Organization":"dotnet","RawContent":null,"RelatedAction":"opened","RelatedUrl":"https://github.com/dotnet/sdk/issues/10723","RelatedDescription":"Opened issue \"Generated NuGet package does not add frameworkAssembly entries for default assemblies\" (#10723) at dotnet/sdk","RelatedBody":"@drieseng commented on [Sat Feb 22 2020](https://github.com/dotnet/project-system/issues/5915)\n\n**Visual Studio Version**: 2017 / 2019\r\n**Summary**:\r\nWhen a NuGet package is built for an SDK project targeting a .NET Framework version, the built NuGet package does not contain **\\<frameworkAssembly\\>** elements for the default framework assembly references.\r\n\r\n**Steps to Reproduce**:\r\n1.

Here is a checklist of steps we’ll follow during the process: [https://github.com/dotnet/foundation/blob/master/guidance/new-projects.md](https://github.com/dotnet/foundation/blob/master/guidance/new-projects.md)\r\n2.  Please fill out the application in the template below. If you prefer to submit via e-mail to keep information private, you can use this [application form](https://github.com/dotnet-foundation/projects/blob/master/OnBoardingQuestionaire.docx) and submit to contact@dotnetfoundation.org, referencing this issue number. You can also fill out the Word document and submit it as an [attachement to the issue](https://help.github.com/en/articles/file-attachments-on-issues-and-pull-requests), via Google Doc, etc. If you have questions, fill out what you know and discuss on the issue.\r\n3.  After review and comment by the advisory council, we will submit your questionnaire to the board of directors recommending we add your project.\r\n4.  We will send you a contribution agreement via DocuSign.\r\n5.  We can announce the project is joining, and work through the other steps on the checklist.\r\n\r\n\r\nSome common questions that come up on the questionnaire:\r\n\r\n*   Project Transfer Signatories section: List the top contributors, with contact e-mail. For most projects, this is the top 1-5 contributors who have contributed more than a few hundred lines of code.\r\n*   Contribution vs Assignment: The difference is in the contribution model is who actually owns the copyright. It is important, but in terms of practical operation of the project it’s pretty transparent.\r\n\r\n\r\n*   **Contribution:** The project grants the .NET Foundation a license and rights to the intellectual property and source code. The project agrees that it is their work, and the .NET Foundation can protect your copyright.\r\n*   **Assignment:** The project / company gives the .NET Foundation the project, the .NET Foundation grants it back  \r\n\r\n Normally for community projects we recommend contribution. It’s more applicable for projects that have had multiple contributors over a period of time. Assignment is more applicable for a project that was developed in-house by a company, as they have had complete and traceable ownership of the project throughout its lifespan. Either works fine and has little to no day to day impact on the project once it joins from an actual open source development / shipping software point of view. I’d honestly have to go back and check the transfer agreements for a project to tell you what contribution model they chose. So, whatever makes your lawyers happiest is best.\r\n-->\r\n\r\n## 1.   General Information\r\n\r\n**Project Name:** \r\nMarten\r\n\r\n**License:**\r\nMIT\r\n\r\n**Contributor (Company, Organization or individual name(s)):**\r\nJeremy D.

Description\r\n**Please provide a brief statement about your project in terms that are understandable to the target consumer of the library or project, i.e. an elevator pitch for the project:**\r\n\r\nMarten gives developers a multi-paradigm framework for modelling, storing and querying data on PostgreSQL. Making use of the battle hardened database engine, Marten transparently exposes the JSON(B) capabilities of PostgreSQL for managing objects and events alike, requiring no ceremony to enable friction-less development. Marten is your object (document) and event store, with bells and whistles attached, be it CRUD, Event Sourcing or anything between.\r\n\r\n**Please provide a 1 sentence (<140 character) summary of your to help users when searching the .NET Foundation projects**\r\nPolyglot Persistence providing object (document) and event store Powered by .NET and PostgreSQL\r\n\r\n## 3.   Project Governance\r\nPlease complete this section about who will be maintaining the open source project and how it will run.\r\n**Project Lead:**\r\n(Who is the primary contact point for the community and the .NET Foundation when discussing governance of the project.)\r\n\r\nName: Jeremy D. Miller\r\n Email: jeremydmiller@yahoo.com  \r\n GitHub Profile URL: https://github.com/jeremydmiller\r\n\r\n**Committers:**\r\n\r\n_Which individuals have commit / write access to the repository, what is their GitHub ID and who is their employer (if contributions are on behalf of an employer)_\r\n\r\nJeremy D. Miller https://github.com/jeremydmiller\r\n\r\nBabu Annamalai https://github.com/mysticmind\r\n\r\nOskar Dudycz https://github.com/oskardudycz\r\n\r\nJoona-Pekka Kokko https://github.com/jokokko\r\n\r\n**Governance Model:**\r\n\r\n_Please describe how new code changes are proposed to the project, how those changes are reviewed and how a decision is made to accept proposed changes. Also describe the process for identifying and appointing new committers._\r\n\r\nChanges are proposed via GH issues. All issues are reviewed and labelled with the proper type and scope. Issues that have the estimated timeline are assigned to a proper milestone. Milestones reflect the package version based on the semantic versioning. \r\nPlans for the new releases are discussed publicly in the issues (see eg. https://github.com/JasperFx/marten/issues/1307 or https://github.com/JasperFx/marten/issues/1391).\r\nQuick surveys, questions, clarifications and in general contact with community is done in dedicated Gitter channel https://gitter.im/JasperFx/marten.\r\nNormally 2 approves from maintainers are needed to merge the Pull Request. \r\nNew committers were appointed once by Jeremy based on the number and quality of commits, activity and helping the community. See more: https://jeremydmiller.com/2018/09/27/marten-3-0-is-released-and-introducing-the-new-core-team/\r\n\r\n**CLA**\r\n\r\n_If already an OSS project, was a Contribution License Agreement in place for contributions accepted? How does the project check who has signed one?_\r\n\r\nNo.\r\n\r\n**CLA Notification Alias**\r\n_Provide an email address that will receive CLA related notifications from the .NET Foundation CLA automation_\r\n\r\n**Project Transfer Type**\r\n\r\n_Projects may join the .NET Foundation in one of two ways and you should chat with your .NET Foundation contact to discuss the best mechanism for your project. You can either a) assign the copyright of the project's source code to the .NET Foundation or b) contribute the project source code to the .NET Foundation under an open source license. Assignment is the preferred approach, but licensing a project to the Foundation may be more appropriate for longer running open source projects that have not previously had a contribution license agreement and have accepted contributions from many different sources.\r\na) Assignment\r\nb) Contribution_\r\n\r\nContribution.\r\n\r\n## 4.   Repository Layout\r\n_The .NET Foundation host guidance for new projects and details on recommended structure here:\r\n[https://github.com/dotnet/home/tree/master/guidance](https://github.com/dotnet/home/tree/master/guidance)\r\n\r\nNote that the open source repository should be the master where changes are made by the core development team using the same PR process that is used for non-committer contributions.\r\n\r\nPlease define below any changes you would want to make to your repositories as part of the process of joining the .NET Foundation_\r\n\r\nI don’t think any repository changes are required as part of this process.\r\n\r\n## 5.   PR Plan\r\n_Please summarize the public relations plan for the announcement when joining the foundation (and releasing as open source if appropriate). What is the main story we wish to promote, through what channels, what issues should we be aware of?  For significant news events then please also work with your .NET Foundation contact to ensure a [full PR plan](https://dotnetfoundation.sharepoint.com/Shared%20Documents/PR/Communications%20Plan%20TEMPLATE.docx?web=1) is developed._\r\n\r\nCurrently we'll promote that through blog post, twitter announcement using twitter handle `@marten_lib` & updated website https://martendb.io. We also want to provide the newsletter and maybe more video tutorials. Contributors also speak about the Event Sourcing with .NET Core and Marten on the local meetups. We also plan to get some sponsorship plan (not clear as yet - https://github.com/JasperFx/marten/issues/1393).\r\n\r\n## 6.   Infrastructure Requirements\r\n_Please describe any infrastructure requirements for the project. For example, how will build servers be operated? Any web hosting or service hosting requirements? Do we need to set up SSL certificates or provide Authenticode Code Signing arrangement for releases?_\r\n\r\nCurrently, we're using the Azure Pipelines and AppVeyor OSS plans and we're happy with that process. We are building our documentation using Storyteller (https://storyteller.github.io/documentation/docs/)  hosted on GitHub pages and Netlify so we also don't need to change it as for now. We might need in the future SSL certificates or Authentication Code Signing.\r\n\r\n## 7.   Additional Notes\r\n_Please provide any additional information required or use this area for notes during the on boarding process. If this open source project has similarities with any other projects in this space then please detail them and why this project is different. If there are any potential issues that you feel the project might need help with early on then also state them here and discuss with your .NET Foundation Contact._\r\n\r\nMarten is sometimes compared to Entity Framework. But Marten is not an ORM, it should be treated as the .NET Document and Event Store that's just backed with PostgreSQL. Our approach to using the PostgreSQL and its sophisticated JSON(B) features is unique in .NET space. It should be more compared to RavenDB rather than Entity Framework.\r\nWe're working on the sustainability of our model (so getting sponsorship) to be able to work on the dedicated time and get more reliability in bigger Enterprise companies. Such help would be more than welcome from .NET Foundation.","Url":"https://github.com/dotnet/foundation/issues/161","RelatedDescription":"Closed issue \"Marten\"

From dotnet/runtime#2317 \r\n> Developing/using the use cases that where described in the .net core announcement under [Assembly Unloadability](https://devblogs.microsoft.com/dotnet/announcing-net-core-3-0) is slowed down as it is not possible to debug any scenario that requires assembly unloading. Without this fix the application must be restarted or tested without a debugger attached. This makes plugin development very annoying and less attractive.\r\n\r\nAlso see https://developercommunity.visualstudio.com/content/problem/698374/vs2019-and-fatal-error-has-occurred-and-debugging.html\r\n\r\n## Regression?\r\nNot a regression. Unloadable ALC's were introduced in the 3.0/3.1 time-frame as a new feature. However, adoption is cumbersome on inner loop due to this. \r\n\r\n## Testing\r\nThere's currently work in flight to add ALCs and unloadability verification for debugger scenarios. \r\n\r\n## Risk\r\nLow.

A FuncEval may time out on entering the lock if for example it calls a virtual or interface method for the first time. Failing the FuncEval when the lock is held enables the debugger to fall back to other options for expression evaluation.\r\n- Also added polls for debugger suspension before acquiring the slot backpatching lock on background threads that often operate in preemptive GC mode. A common case in master is when the debugger breaks while the tiering delay timer is active, the timer ticks shortly afterwards (after debugger suspension completes) and if a thread pool thread is already available, the background thread would block while holding the lock. This is less common in 3.1 because the callback pulses the GC mode at the beginning, but still may occur occasionally. The poll checks for debugger suspension and pulses the GC mode to block before acquiring the lock.\r\n\r\n### Customer impact\r\n\r\n- This is a top feedback item for VS on 3.x: [feedback ticket](https://developercommunity.visualstudio.com/content/problem/855101/to-prevent-an-unsafe-abort-popup-appears-often-in.html)\r\n\r\n### Regression?\r\n\r\nYes, regression from 2.x, starting in 3.0\r\n\r\n### Testing\r\n\r\n- It's a timing issue and was reproduced by inducing specific timings in various phases of tiering\r\n- Verified that the timeout does not occur after the fix in the vast majority of cases. Instead, the FuncEval is failed when the lock is held and VS falls back to alternate means for evaluating the expression. See more in risks below.\r\n- Checked debugger-broken stacks at various phases of tiering to verify that the poll for debugger suspension is working as expected\r\n- Standard tests\r\n\r\n### Risks\r\n\r\n- The fix is only a heuristic and lessens the problem when it is detected that the lock is held by some thread. Since the lock is acquired in preemptive GC mode, it is still possible that after the check at the start of a FuncEval, another thread acquires the lock and the FuncEval may time out. The polling makes it less likely for the lock to be taken by background tiering work, for example if a FuncEval starts while rejitting a method.\r\n- The expression evaluation experience may be worse when it is detected that the lock is held, and may still happen from unfortunate timing\r\n- Low risk for the change itself\r\n\r\nPort of https://github.com/dotnet/runtime/pull/2380\r\nFix for https://github.com/dotnet/runtime/issues/1537","Url":"https://github.com/dotnet/coreclr/pull/28006","RelatedDescription":"Closed or merged PR \"[3.1] Fail FuncEval if slot backpatching lock is held by any thread\" (#28006)"},{"Id":"564203743","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2020-02-18T21:32:58","Actor":"GrabYourPitchforks","Number":"28014","RawContent":null,"Title":"[release/3.1] Port dotnet/runtime#31946 fix for string.Replace infinite loop","State":"closed","Body":"Issue https://github.com/dotnet/runtime/issues/1060 reports that in a linguistic (non-ordinal) call to `string.Replace`, if the target string contains code points with zero collation weight, the `string.Replace` logic can enter an infinite loop.\r\n\r\nThis has already been fixed in .NET 5 (see https://github.com/dotnet/runtime/pull/31946).

We had changed the logic to match precisely what MSDN's documentation stated and to fix a possible data corruption bug; however, this broke a number of customers' applications by sending them into infinite loops.\r\n\r\nThis PR reverts that change.\r\n\r\n## Customer Impact\r\n\r\nIf customers were relying on the previous behavior of the _completed_ out parameter, their applications could end up in an infinite loop. What makes matters worse is that the sample code on the MSDN page for `Encoder.Convert` and `Decoder.Convert` is also susceptible to this pattern, so we suspect a large number of customers may have based their own application code on the sample.\r\n\r\n## Regression?\r\n\r\nYes, from .NET Framework 4.x and .NET Core 2.x. One half of this change was introduced in .NET Core 3.0 (see https://github.com/dotnet/coreclr/commit/43a5159d39bd52195c5095da4006183f791c696b); the other half was introduced in .NET Core 3.1 (see https://github.com/dotnet/coreclr/commit/c07ec4cd2f88c23edc87500893576d83c20f2e6d).\r\n\r\n## Testing\r\n\r\nThe reversion is already committed in the 5.0 branches (see https://github.com/dotnet/runtime/commit/d49b541ab156d992aeb4bbe410f7a816bb0ac039), so we have been getting test coverage on those nightlies. No notable regressions have been reported.\r\n\r\n## Risk\r\n\r\nSomewhere between minimal and moderate. It's possible that some applications may have taken a dependency on the new behavior. See for instance https://github.com/dotnet/aspnetcore/pull/17747, where ASP.NET appears to have unintentionally taken a dependency on the new behavior and had to proactively make a change so that they behave correctly both before and after this PR goes through.\r\n\r\n/cc @tarekgh @anurse @danmosemsft ","Url":"https://github.com/dotnet/coreclr/pull/27996","RelatedDescription":"Closed or merged PR \"[release/3.1] Port fix to revert EncoderNLS and DecoderNLS Convert changes\" (#27996)"},{"Id":"550396592","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2020-01-15T20:04:13","Actor":"dotnet-maestro-bot","Number":"27999","RawContent":null,"Title":"[automated] Merge branch 'release/3.0' => 'release/3.1'","State":"closed","Body":"I detected changes in the release/3.0 branch which have not been merged yet to release/3.1.

We did this  in order to stop using assembly re-writing and instead to use source generation. Back when we did that, we didn't catch one diff which was that our desktop runtime shims would now reference the netcoreapp vertical contracts and their assembly versions, instead of just using 0.0.0.0 as we used to do with assembly re-writing. This caused an issue that if today we service one of our OOB packages and increase the assembly version, and this assembly happens to be referenced by one of our .NET Framework shims, then now the shims will have a hard dependency on that version of the OOB package and won't work with previous versions of the package. The first instance we've seen is now in 3.1.2 when we serviced System.Data.SqlClient (new assembly version is 4.6.1.1) and it is referenced by our System.Data shim. This means that if you need to load the System.Data shim, are running in 3.1.2 runtime, and reference a System.Data.SqlClient package which is older than 4.8.1 you will hit an exception like:\r\n\r\n```\r\nSystem.IO.FileLoadException: Could not load file or assembly 'System.Data.SqlClient, Version=4.6.1.1, Culture=neutral, PublicKeyToken=b03f5f7f11d50a3a'. The located assembly's manifest definition does not match the assembly reference. (0x80131040)\r\n```\r\n\r\nThis will happen because the System.Data is trying to load System.Data.SqlClient new version, but the consuming app was referencing an older version of the package (for example: 4.8.0 which only contains 4.6.1.0 assembly)\r\n\r\nThis fix will address this regression only, by making System.Data shim to reference 4.6.1.0 version again so that package 4.8.0 will work again, however, older versions of the package will still not work (as was the case already since we initially shipped 3.0 and 3.1). There is a much larger list of assemblies that might hit this issue if they get serviced in the future, so after this regression is fixed, we will work in master branch in order to provide a future-proof fix that will work for all cases.","Url":"https://github.com/dotnet/corefx/pull/42868","RelatedDescription":"Closed or merged PR \"Fixing regression caused by servicing of System.Data.SqlClient package\" (#42868)"},{"Id":"568709225","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2020-02-21T03:13:31","Actor":"ahsonkhan","Number":"42869","RawContent":null,"Title":"[release/3.1] Do not null ref or throw index out of range exception when deserializing to char.","State":"open","Body":"Get the changes from 5.0/master found in https://github.com/dotnet/runtime/pull/528 \r\n\r\n## Description\r\n\r\nAdd a null/empty string check when deserializing JSON strings into a `char` property so that we don't null ref or throw an index of out of range exception. Intentionally left out the `string.length > 1` check as that could potentially break someone.\r\n\r\n## Customer Impact\r\n\r\nMost people are very unlikely to have a catch handler for NullReferenceException, IndexOutOfRangeException, or InvalidOperationException (and in the first two, it certainly doesn't make sense for them to). So in server scenarios customers still get an HTTP 500.\r\nNow, the the `JsonConverter<char>` throws an `InvalidOperationException` which the wraps the into an outer `JsonException` so that customers can have handlers to catch that. For them, we’d turn a crash into success.\r\n\r\nDeserializing into a char is now more reliable when the input JSON payload is unknown/provided by the user which may contain unexpected values.\r\n```C#\r\npublic class MyPoco\r\n{\r\n    public char Character { get; set; }\r\n}\r\n\r\npublic static void TestDeserializeToChar()\r\n{\r\n    // Before (3.1): NullReferenceException\r\n    // After (5.0): JsonException\r\n    JsonSerializer.Deserialize<MyPoco>(\"{\\\"Character\\\": null}\");\r\n\r\n    // Before (3.1): IndexOutOfRangeException\r\n    // After (5.0): JsonException\r\n    JsonSerializer.Deserialize<MyPoco>(\"{\\\"Character\\\": \\\"\\\"}\");\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nThere is a workaround for the user today, where they could create and register their own `JsonConverter<char>` which does the right checks. However, doing so, in all the entry points of the JsonSerializer (including within ASP.NET web app) would become cumbersome.\r\n\r\n## Regression\r\n\r\nNo. The bug existed in the deserialization behavior since the initial release of S.T.Json as part of 3.0.\r\n\r\n### Testing\r\n\r\nAdded appropriate unit tests and the behavior in master meets user expectations such as https://github.com/dotnet/runtime/issues/32429\r\nThis only affects deserialization/reading.\r\n\r\n## Risk\r\n\r\n**Low** given it is a very targeted fix with no regression.

The fix is a couple of lines, with the rest of the PR adding tests and test enhancement.\r\n\r\n## Customer Impact\r\n\r\nThis bug was initially reported in user-defined `JsonConverter<T>` where the user couldn't deserialize a deeply nested object graph (beyond the default max depth of 64). The issue, however, is not just specific to converters (nor just to `MaxDepth`) and will be hit whenever the caller passes in a `Utf8JsonReader` to the `JsonSerializer.Deserialize` method with non-default `JsonReaderOptions` set (which currently includes `MaxDepth`, `JsonCommentHandling`, and `AllowTrailingCommas`).\r\n\r\nFor example, this code snippet incorrectly fails with an exception:\r\n```C#\r\nvar localReader = new Utf8JsonReader(Encoding.UTF8.GetBytes(\"[null,]\"), \r\n                                       new JsonReaderOptions { AllowTrailingCommas = true });\r\n\r\nstring[] returnedValue = JsonSerializer.Deserialize<string[]>(ref localReader);\r\n\r\n// System.Text.Json.JsonException : The JSON array contains a trailing comma at the end \r\n// which is not supported in this mode. Change the reader options. Path: $[1] | \r\n// LineNumber: 0 | BytePositionInLine: 6.\r\n```\r\n\r\nIt is clear that we should be honoring the user-defined options. Otherwise, there is no way for callers to deserialize payloads containing trailing commas or comments when using the `Utf8JsonReader` with the `JsonSerializer`. We should make sure to meet user expectations here (otherwise, even debugging the issue would become difficult for them).\r\n\r\nThere is no reasonable workaround for the user. In fact, the `JsonConverter<T>` extension point is the primary workaround to change default serialization behavior, which increases the need for this fix since that isn't working as expected.\r\n\r\n## Regression\r\n\r\nNo. The bug existed in the deserialization behavior since the initial release of S.T.Json as part of 3.0.\r\n\r\n### Testing\r\n\r\nAdded several permutations within the test including customer reported scenario. The fix for the bug is only a couple of lines and only affects the read/deserialize, but I wanted to make sure we add tests to exercise the various options for both read and write. We already have decent negative test cases (where the default options throw for invalid JSON), but were missing positive test cases (where custom options worked to make the reader more flexible).\r\n\r\nThe writer tests are only there for completeness and fill a gap from when the `JsonSerializer` APIs that accept a writer were originally added (see https://github.com/dotnet/corefx/pull/38700#issuecomment-503763061). Those tests pass in master and 3.1 already with no source changes.\r\n\r\n## Risk\r\n\r\n**Low** given it is a very targeted fix with no regression. This fix only affects the deserialization behavior. One scenario where a customer could be impacted is if they accidentally relied on the default reader options to catch/throw for JSON that might contain comments/trailing commas, even when they were setting the options to be flexible. The fix for that would be to make sure the options match what you expect.\r\n\r\ncc @ericstj ","Url":"https://github.com/dotnet/corefx/pull/42867","RelatedDescription":"Open PR \"[release/3.1] Make sure original Utf8JsonReader options are honored when re-creating the reader.\" (#42867)"},{"Id":"567108141","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2020-02-19T18:37:11","Actor":"GrabYourPitchforks","Number":"42862","RawContent":null,"Title":"[release/3.1] Corresponding unit tests for dotnet/coreclr#28014","State":"closed","Body":"These are the unit tests for https://github.com/dotnet/coreclr/pull/28014, which is a customer-reported infinite loop in `string.Replace`.\r\n\r\nThe unit tests will fail (by entering an infinite loop) until that PR is checked in to coreclr and the corresponding build flows to corefx.","Url":"https://github.com/dotnet/corefx/pull/42862","RelatedDescription":"Closed or merged PR \"[release/3.1] Corresponding unit tests for dotnet/coreclr#28014\" (#42862)"},{"Id":"567714171","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2020-02-19T18:10:34","Actor":"dotnet-maestro-bot","Number":"42866","RawContent":null,"Title":"Update CoreClr, CoreFx, CoreSetup to servicing-28516-03, servicing-28516-10, stable, respectively (release/2.1)","State":"closed","Body":"/cc @dotnet/maestro-reviewers-core","Url":"https://github.com/dotnet/corefx/pull/42866","RelatedDescription":"Closed or merged PR \"Update CoreClr, CoreFx, CoreSetup to servicing-28516-03, servicing-28516-10, stable, respectively (release/2.1)\" (#42866)"},{"Id":"562931431","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2020-02-19T01:37:11","Actor":"tgani-msft","Number":"42851","RawContent":null,"Title":"Backport attribute to support inline namespaces in C++/CLI ","State":"closed","Body":"Port commit cef57de93bab815726f860f79195227c65e4fce5 from dotnet/runtime (5.0) to dotnet/corefx (3.1).\r\n\r\ncommit cef57de93bab815726f860f79195227c65e4fce5\r\nAuthor: Tanveer Gani <45886079+tgani-msft@users.noreply.github.com>\r\nDate:   Thu Jan 30 10:28:26 2020 -0800\r\n\r\n    Add attribute to support inline namespaces in C++/CLI.

The PR follows the approved behaviors (https://github.com/dotnet/roslyn/issues/26610#issuecomment-446211056) mentioned in the issue discussion. \r\n\r\nRoot cause: When constructing completion item description, we get symbol name and kind from the completion item property bags, and then get candidate symbols from the position. \r\n\r\nSay we have following types:\r\n\r\n`System.ValueTuple`\r\n`System.ValueTuple<T>`\r\n\r\nBoth types will have same symbol name and kind, hence when get candidate symbols for the two types, the symbols are the same.\r\n\r\nThe simple fix is to add `IsGeneric` to the `CompleteItem.Properties` bag, so that when loading candidate symbols for completion description, we can differ non-generic/generic symbols and give accurate QuickInfo texts.\r\n\r\nNew behavior:\r\n\r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/12908526/75494435-182cff00-5971-11ea-97af-f3b5895fa323.png)\r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/12908526/75494453-2418c100-5971-11ea-8ce9-2487d55db32c.png)\r\n","Url":"https://github.com/dotnet/roslyn/pull/41999","RelatedDescription":"Open PR \"Fix issue #26610\" (#41999)"},{"Id":"572410000","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2020-02-27T22:48:54","Actor":"CyrusNajmabadi","Number":"41998","RawContent":null,"Title":"Move semantic classification out of proc","State":"open","Body":"","Url":"https://github.com/dotnet/roslyn/pull/41998","RelatedDescription":"Open PR \"Move semantic classification out of proc\" (#41998)"},{"Id":"572398673","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2020-02-27T22:23:41","Actor":"333fred","Number":"41996","RawContent":null,"Title":"Binder annotations","State":"open","Body":"Annotate more of the binder.","Url":"https://github.com/dotnet/roslyn/pull/41996","RelatedDescription":"Open PR \"Binder annotations\" (#41996)"},{"Id":"572397841","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2020-02-27T22:22:02","Actor":"mavasani","Number":"41995","RawContent":null,"Title":"[WIP] Port RemoveUnusedMembers analyzer/fixer/tests to shared layer (IDE0051/IDE0052)","State":"open","Body":"This PR builds on top of #41993.

It supports two modes of bulk configuration:\r\n\r\n1. Category based: Configure default severity/disable by default all analyzer diagnostics of a specific diagnostic `category`. Note each diagnostic has a diagnostic category, which is also shown in the `Category` column in error list.\r\n2. All analyzer diagnostics: Configure default severity/disable by default all analyzer diagnostics.\r\n\r\nRule ID based editorconfig/ruleset configuration takes precedence over category based configuration, which in turn takes precedence over all analyzer diagnostics configuration.\r\n\r\nThis PR enhances the `Suppress or Configure issues` light bulb actions menu to include new bulk configuration actions towards the bottom of this sub-menu:\r\n\r\n1.

None of that is needed in CoreRT, but we had it there so that we don't diverge too much. It was 3x faster than CoreCLR anyway. We no longer have to worry about diverging and it seems like CoreCLR might be getting a perf boost here for .NET 5, so let's not stay behind.\r\n\r\nIn this commit:\r\n* Removing the `s_createInstanceMissingDefaultConstructor` flag - we can do this check quickly by comparing the retrieved default constructor with `DefaultConstructorOf<ClassWithMissingConstructor>`.\r\n* Removing upfront checks for arrays/strings/interfaces. We no longer have to worry about accidentally allocating them. We detect them as not having a default ctor.\r\n* For an additional perf boost, exposing `AllocatorOf<T>`. This is a new intrinsic that expands to the existing `AllocatorOf` dictionary entry that represents the optimized allocator method for T. This entry is normally only used in universal shared code, but it's valid to use it outside of that.\r\n* Extra compiler support for dictionary entries that are double indirections. `AllocatorOf` is doubly-indirect for USG reasons. We should probably keep that for universal shared code anyway.\r\n\r\nThere's still room left for improvement - RyuJIT currently doesn't have support for the `RawCalli` intrinsic and generates a normal calli for them. Normal calli needs to check for fat function pointers. These pointers are never fat pointers.","Url":"https://github.com/dotnet/corert/pull/8000","RelatedDescription":"Closed or merged PR \"Make `Activator.CreateInstance<T>` 50% faster\" (#8000)"},{"Id":"569248181","IsPullRequest":false,"CreatedAt":"2020-02-22T02:44:21","Actor":"christianscheuer","Number":"7999","RawContent":null,"Title":"Relatively new futimens dependency in pal_io breaks macOS 10.12 compatibility","State":"closed","Body":"I understand the official .NET builds only support 10.13+ now - but we have tons of customers who are still on 10.12 so we need to keep supporting it in our product releases.\r\n\r\nWhen recently upgrading to a newer build of corert, we noticed that a specific change here is causing issues for us since it relies on a 10.13+ feature (futimens):\r\nhttps://github.com/dotnet/corefx/pull/37583/files#diff-711617c0d34d2b9153911b15c7671db9R1328\r\nWe have to build on Mojave due to Apple notarization requirements - not sure if this has any significance.\r\n\r\nI suspect for this we need to build our own coreclr and somehow manually undefine HAVE_FUTIMENS and then feed it into CoreRT.

LTS releases are stable release which receive critical updates and are supported for at least three years. Current releases can include new features that may undergo future change based on feedback. Current releases are supported for three months after the subsequent .NET Core major or minor release. Both LTS and Current releases receive critical fixes throughout their lifecycle, for security, reliability, or to add support for new operating system versions. You must stay up-to-date with the latest patches to qualify for support. \r\n\r\n[.NET Core 2.2](https://devblogs.microsoft.com/dotnet/announcing-net-core-2-2/) was released in December 2018 as a Current release. Per the lifecycle policy, Current releases reach end of life 3 months after a subsequent release (Current or LTS). **.NET Core 3.0** released in **September 2019** and began the end of life countdown for .NET Core 2.2 that concluded on December 23, 2019. \r\n\r\n## .NET Core 2.2 Downloads\r\n\r\n.NET Core 2.2 installers, zips and tar.gzs will remain available, but unsupported. This includes existing releases available on Linux package feeds. Previous versions, including 2.2, will be accessible through the [Download Archives](https://www.microsoft.com/net/download/archives). \r\n\r\n## Policy Information\r\n\r\nAdditional lifecycle and support details  and background can be seen in the following:\r\n\r\n* [.NET Core Support Lifecycle](https://www.microsoft.com/net/platform/support-policy)\r\n* [Microsoft Support for .NET Core](https://github.com/dotnet/core/blob/master/microsoft-support.md)\r\n* [.NET Core OS Lifecycle Policy](https://github.com/dotnet/core/blob/master/os-lifecycle-policy.md)\r\n* [Support and Versioning](https://blogs.msdn.microsoft.com/dotnet/2016/07/26/net-support-and-versioning/)\r\n","Url":"https://github.com/dotnet/announcements/issues/147","RelatedDescription":"Open issue \".NET Core 2.2 has reached end of life\" (#147)"},{"Id":"541189878","IsPullRequest":false,"CreatedAt":"2019-12-20T20:42:33","Actor":"vivmishra","Number":"146","RawContent":null,"Title":"Announcing Availability of Localized IntelliSense for .NET Core 3.0 and 3.1","State":"open","Body":"This week we released localized [IntelliSense](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/visualstudio/ide/using-intellisense?view=vs-2019) files for .NET Core 3.0 and 3.1, in following 10 Visual Studio supported languages: \r\n- Brazilian Portuguese\r\n- Chinese (simplified)\r\n- Chinese (traditional)\r\n- French\r\n- German\r\n- Italian\r\n- Japanese\r\n- Korean\t\r\n- Russian\r\n- Spanish\r\n\r\nThe files (in zip archives) are available for download from [**Download localized .NET Core IntelliSense files**](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/download/dotnet-core/intellisense).\r\n\r\n * [Checksums for 3.0 zip files](https://dotnetcli.blob.core.windows.net/dotnet/checksums/3.0.0-intellisense-sha.txt)\r\n * [Checksums for 3.1 zip files](https://dotnetcli.blob.core.windows.net/dotnet/checksums/3.1.0-intellisense-sha.txt)\r\n\r\nYou can see [the .NET Core Guide](https://aka.ms/dotnet-core-intellisense) for instructions on how to use these files with Visual Studio.\r\n\r\nBy default, when you're developing .NET Core projects, the SDK only includes the English version of the IntelliSense files. But now you can enhance your localized Visual Studio development experience by adding the localized IntelliSense files from the download site into your local development environment.\r\n\r\nLastly, with this release we have made the localized IntelliSense available as zip archives that does require you to manually extract and copy the files to respective SDK install folders.

This means some folks will lose their Collaborator badge and the ability to interact with the CI system.*\r\n\r\nOver the years, we’ve added a bunch of folks as collaborators with read permissions to our public repos. The rationale was that we wanted to be able to assign issues to community members because GitHub only allowed assigning issues to users with an explicit permission grant for the repository. However, they changed this in [June 2019](https://github.blog/2019-06-25-assign-issues-to-issue-commenters/). Now, we can assign issues to all users with explicit permissions as well as to users that have commented on the specific issue.\r\n\r\nAlso, we recently started to audit and tighten the permissions for our organizations. As a result, it became clear that large number of repo-specific permission grants are hard to review and audit. Internally, our goal is to grant all permissions via teams instead.\r\n\r\nHence, we plan to remove all collaborators from public repos that only have read permissions (folks with triage permissions will remain). The full list of affected repos is listed below.\r\n\r\nThis shouldn’t impact your ability to work with us, but losing explicit read-only has the following implications:\r\n\r\n-   **You’ll lose the collaborator badge**. We understand that this is visually appealing and for some people it might have been a badge of honor. But given that GitHub also shows a Contributor bade for folks whose PRs got merged, we don’t think it this will be a major take back.    \r\n    ![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/5169960/70491508-43acf580-1ab6-11ea-94df-74ea2dde98b4.png)\r\n\r\n-   ~~**You lose the ability to interact with the CI system**. As a collaborator, you can use comments to [send commands to the CI system](https://github.com/dotnet/runtime/blob/master/docs/project/pullrequest-builds.md). While this can be useful at times, we generally don’t expect (or desire) contributors to do that. Of course, anyone can still access the CI logs.~~\r\n\r\n- **You might lose the ability to interact with the CI system**. Based on your feedback we have decided to give externals access to interact with the CI system *on a case by case basis*. If you believe you need to have that ability, please [leave a comment like Kevin's](https://github.com/dotnet/runtime/issues/718#issuecomment-563717478).\r\n\r\n| Public Repo                | \\#collaborators with read |\r\n|----------------------------|---------------------------|\r\n| arcade                     | 1                         |\r\n| BenchmarkDotNet            | 11                        |\r\n| cli                        | 2                         |\r\n| command-line-api           | 14                        |\r\n| coreclr                    | 18                        |\r\n| corefx                     | 180                       |\r\n| corefxlab                  | 4                         |\r\n| corert                     | 7                         |\r\n| core-sdk                   | 1                         |\r\n| docs                       | 3                         |\r\n| interactive-window         | 1                         |\r\n| machinelearning            | 1                         |\r\n| machinelearning-samples    | 1                         |\r\n| msbuild-language-service   | 1                         |\r\n| runtime                    | 128                       |\r\n| spark                      | 5                         |\r\n| standard                   | 1                         |\r\n| windowsdesktop             | 1                         |\r\n| winforms-datavisualization | 1                         |\r\n| Grand Total                | 381                       |\r\n\r\n### Discussion\r\n\r\nTo discuss this, please comment on the corresponding issue at https://github.com/dotnet/runtime/issues/718.","Url":"https://github.com/dotnet/announcements/issues/144","RelatedDescription":"Open issue \"Removal of read-collaborator access\" (#144)"},{"Id":"532249858","IsPullRequest":false,"CreatedAt":"2019-12-03T20:36:29","Actor":"MichaelSimons","Number":"143","RawContent":null,"Title":".NET Core `latest` Docker tags updated to 3.1","State":"open","Body":"# .NET Core `latest` Docker tags updated to 3.1\r\n\r\nThe `latest` tags for the [dotnet/core](https://hub.docker.com/_/microsoft-dotnet-core) repos have been updated to reference [.NET Core 3.1](https://devblogs.microsoft.com/dotnet/announcing-net-core-3-1/).\r\n\r\n## Discussion\r\n \r\nYou can share your thoughts on this change or see what others are saying at:\r\n \r\n* [dotnet/dotnet-docker#1337](https://github.com/dotnet/dotnet-docker/issues/1511)\r\n\r\n## Details\r\n\r\n* [dotnet-docker#1509](https://github.com/dotnet/dotnet-docker/pull/1509)\r\n\r\nThe `latest` tags for the [dotnet/core](https://hub.docker.com/_/microsoft-dotnet-core) repos are always intended to reference the latest supported version of .NET Core.

That means that .NET Core manifest tags are no longer usable on those Windows versions.\r\n\r\nIf you pull a manifest tag on one of the Windows versions described, you may get one of the following error messages:\r\n\r\n* `a Windows version 10.0.18362-based image is incompatible with a 10.0.17134 host`\r\n* `no matching manifest for windows/amd64 in the manifest list entries`\r\n* `no matching manifest for unknown in the manifest list entries`\r\n\r\nIf you need to still use Nano Server, version 1803 images (even though it is no longer supported), you will need to use tags that include the Nano Server version (these are non-manifest tags), for example `mcr.microsoft.com/dotnet/core/runtime:3.0-nanoserver-1803`.","Url":"https://github.com/dotnet/announcements/issues/140","RelatedDescription":"Open issue \"Windows Server, version 1803 no longer supported by .NET Core\" (#140)"},{"Id":"522994983","IsPullRequest":false,"CreatedAt":"2019-11-14T17:15:08","Actor":"leecow","Number":"139","RawContent":null,"Title":".NET Core 3.1.0 Preview 3","State":"open","Body":".NET Core 3.1.0 Preview 3 is available and https://github.com/dotnet/core/issues/3809 has been opened for discussion.\r\n\r\n[Release Notes](https://github.com/dotnet/core/blob/master/release-notes/3.1/preview/3.1.0-preview3.md)\r\n[Download](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/download/dotnet-core/3.1)\r\n\r\n**Blog posts**\r\n\r\n[.NET Core](https://devblogs.microsoft.com/dotnet/announcing-net-core-3-1-preview-3/)\r\n[ASP.NET Core](https://devblogs.microsoft.com/aspnet/asp-net-core-updates-in-net-core-3-1-preview-3/)\r\n\r\nPlease report any issues you find with .NET Core 3.1 Preview 3, either responding to this issue, creating a new issue or creating a new issue in one of the following repos:\r\n\r\n* [aspnet/Home](https://github.com/aspnet/Home) - for ASP.NET Core questions\r\n* [aspnet/EntityFrameworkCore](https://github.com/aspnet/EntityFrameworkCore) - for Entity Framework Core questions\r\n* [dotnet/cli](https://github.com/dotnet/cli/issues) - for CLI tools and questions\r\n* [dotnet/corefx](https://github.com/dotnet/corefx/issues) - for API issues and questions\r\n* [dotnet/coreclr](https://github.com/dotnet/coreclr/issues) - for runtime issues\r\n* [dotnet/core-setup](https://github.com/dotnet/core-setup/issues) - for installer issues\r\n* [dotnet/winforms](https://github.com/dotnet/winforms/issues) - for Winforms issues\r\n* [dotnet/wpf](https://github.com/dotnet/wpf/issues) - for WPF issues\r\n* [nuget/home](https://github.com/nuget/home/issues) - for NuGet questions and issues\r\n","Url":"https://github.com/dotnet/announcements/issues/139","RelatedDescription":"Open issue \".NET Core 3.1.0 Preview 3\" (#139)"},{"Id":"522864668","IsPullRequest":false,"CreatedAt":"2019-11-14T13:37:28","Actor":"TaraOverfield","Number":"138","RawContent":null,"Title":"November 2019 .NET Updates","State":"open","Body":"The following .NET updates were released on November 2019.

Our planning has reached a point where we have a schedule for the coreclr, corefx and core-setupmoves into dotnet/runtime that we want to share out with the community.\r\n\r\n### November 13th\r\nWe’ll move all changes from the original repositories into dotnet/runtime up to 5PM PST on November 13th. We’ll try to help as many pull requests as possible get merged by then. At that point, if there’s any pull requests still open we’ll have to close them. If you’d still like to continue those pull requests, we’d encourage you to bring them to dotnet/runtime in a new pull request.\r\n\r\nThe repositories themselves will be effectively archived at this point. The state of the “master” branch will be recorded with a tag, named “master-archive”, but the branch itself will be deleted. The default branch for the repositories will be named “archive” and it will be a single commit with a README.md and CONTRIBUTING.md file pointing to our dotnet/runtime repository.\r\n\r\nThe repositories will remain active for servicing changes to .NET Core 3.1 and earlier hence we will not be using the GitHub archive capability. \r\n\r\n### November 22nd\r\nThe dotnet/runtime repository will be made public and available for community contribution. Even though the repository will be created on November 13th it will take several days to get it back into a working order: fixing up our build scripts, recreating our Azure Dev Ops build definitions, etc … Until those tasks are completed it will not be possible to accept pull request and hence the repository will remain private. Once we are in a state that pull requests can be merged again the repository will be made public.\r\n\r\nOur expectation is that will occur on November 22nd. If it is ready sooner it will be made public sooner. If the work takes longer than we planned then we will add an update to this announcement with a new expected date.\r\n\r\n### December 1st-2nd\r\nAll issues, open and closed, will be migrated from corefx, coreclr and core-setup into dotnet/runtime. This will be using GitHub’s existing issue transfer feature in a bulk migration. This means all of the existing issue links will continue to function via redirects.\r\n\r\nThis does mean though that labels will not transfer with the issues. Labels will be re-applied as a post processing step by our engineering team once the issue migration completes.\r\n\r\nEven though our issues won’t be fully migrated until this time we’d like the community to begin filing issues on dotnet/runtime as soon as it’s public rather than continuing to file issues on the original repositories.\r\n\r\n### Migrating Commits\r\nThe dotnet/runtime repository will be a new commit history from the original repositories. We are using this consolidation as an opportunity to clean up our history with the goal of having a cleaner, smaller history as a starting point. This means commits will be rewritten in the following ways as they are migrated to dotnet/runtime:\r\n\r\n1. Author information, contributor information, changed file list and time stamps from the original commit will be preserved.\r\n1. Links to issues, pull requests or commits in the repository using GitHub short links will be rewritten so they continue to point the original repository. \r\n1. Every commit will be appended with a link to the original commit it was mapped from.\r\n\r\nThe actual contents of the commit though will be updated to match the new directory layout of the dotnet/runtime repository.","Url":"https://github.com/dotnet/announcements/issues/133","RelatedDescription":"Open issue \"Repository Consolidation Timeline\" (#133)"},{"Id":"513963125","IsPullRequest":false,"CreatedAt":"2019-10-29T14:32:55","Actor":"mthalman","Number":"132","RawContent":null,"Title":"Release of Alpine 3.10 Docker images","State":"open","Body":"# .NET Core Alpine Docker images updated to Alpine 3.10\r\n\r\nDocker images for .NET Core have been released that support Alpine 3.10.

With [.NET Standard 2.0](https://devblogs.microsoft.com/dotnet/announcing-net-standard-2-0/), we tried to make it much more viable to share code between .NET Framework, .NET Core, and Xamarin which resulted in approximately 38K .NET Frameworks APIs being available in .NET Core 2.0. We also built the [Windows Compatibility Pack](https://devblogs.microsoft.com/dotnet/announcing-the-windows-compatibility-pack-for-net-core/) which made another 21K .NET Framework APIs available to .NET Core, resulting in almost 60K additional APIs. And in .NET Core 3.0 we added WPF and WinForms, which increased the number of .NET Framework APIs ported to .NET Core to over 120k, which is more than half of all .NET Framework APIs.\r\n\r\nIt’s also worth pointing out that we added about 62K APIs to .NET Core that don’t exist in .NET Framework. If we compare their total number of APIs, .NET Core has about 80% of the API surface of .NET Framework.\r\n\r\n<p align=\"center\">\r\n<img src=\"https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/5169960/66777114-f8db7c80-ee7c-11e9-9161-acfe1c491586.png\" width=\"600\" align=\"center\">\r\n</p>\r\n\r\nWe announced that the [future of .NET](https://devblogs.microsoft.com/dotnet/net-core-is-the-future-of-net/) will be based on .NET Core. And at Build 2019, [Scott Hunter stated](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZlO1utbB2GQ&t=54m20s) that AppDomains, remoting, Web Forms, WCF server, and Windows Workflow won’t be ported to .NET Core.\r\n\r\nWith .NET Core 3.0, we’re at the point where we’ve ported all technologies that are required for modern workloads, be that desktop apps, mobile apps, console apps, web sites, or cloud services. That’s not to say that we don’t have any gaps or opportunities for new technologies, but we generally believe we won’t be finding them in the .NET Framework code base anymore. Moving forward, we’re focusing our resources on incorporating new technologies.\r\n\r\nSimultaneously, we’re looking into releasing more of the [.NET Framework code base under the MIT license](https://github.com/microsoft/referencesource) on GitHub to allow the community to create OSS projects for technologies we’re not intending to bring to .NET Core. For example, there already are community projects for [CoreWF](https://github.com/UiPath/corewf) and [CoreWCF](https://github.com/CoreWCF/CoreWCF).\r\n\r\nWe’d like to thank everyone who filed issues with requests for APIs being ported.

While this is still work in progress, we'd like to give you an update on where we are.\r\n\r\nSo far, we've identified the following repos:\r\n\r\n* dotnet/**runtime**\r\n\t- Will contain [coreclr](https://github.com/dotnet/coreclr), [corefx](https://github.com/dotnet/corefx), [core-setup](https://github.com/dotnet/core-setup), [aspnet/Extensions](https://github.com/aspnet/Extensions), and some of [mono/mono](https://github.com/mono/mono)\r\n* [dotnet/**sdk**](https://github.com/dotnet/sdk)\r\n\t- Will contain [toolset](https://github.com/dotnet/toolset), [sdk](https://github.com/dotnet/sdk), [cli](https://github.com/dotnet/cli)\r\n* dotnet/**installer**\r\n\t- Renamed from [core-sdk](https://github.com/dotnet/core-sdk)\r\n* dotnet/**aspnetcore**\r\n\t- Moved from [aspnet/AspNetCore](https://github.com/aspnet/AspNetCore) and will also contain [aspnet/AspNetCore-Tooling](https://github.com/aspnet/AspNetCore-Tooling)\r\n* dotnet/**efcore**\r\n\t- Moved from [aspnet/EntityFrameworkCore](https://github.com/aspnet/EntityFrameworkCore)\r\n* [dotnet/**winforms**](https://github.com/dotnet/winforms)\r\n\t- Unchanged, but listed for clarity \r\n* [dotnet/**wpf**](https://github.com/dotnet/wpf)\r\n\t- Unchanged, but listed for clarity\r\n\r\n### Name changes\r\n\r\nYou might notice that we changed our mind on naming from our [earlier announcement][ann]. Based on your feedback, we decided to go with **dotnet/runtime** instead of **dotnet/platform** and **dotnet/sdk** instead of **dotnet/cli**.\r\n\r\nSeveral people pointed out that the previous names weren't relatable to how we talk about the product, for example on download pages. So, we decided to match the product distributions as the primary design point for the new names. We generally refer to the bits you need to run your app as *the runtime* and the bits you need to build apps as *the SDK*. This also matches the naming chosen by other platforms.\r\n\r\n### New repos can't be used for .NET Core 3.x or earlier\r\n\r\nThe consolidated repositories are going to be about .NET 5 and going forward. It will not be possible to build .NET Core 3.1 or earlier from these repositories. As such, only the master branch from each of the repositories will be brought forward. There will be no porting of the individual release branches in the source repositories.\r\n\r\n### Personal names and email addresses\r\n\r\nSince we're planning on rebasing the history in the merged repositories, we can map your name and email address to new values as well. We primarily do this to support our friends in the LGBTQ+ community who have changed their names to reflect their identities. However, anybody is welcome to use this to change their email and name.\r\n\r\nWhatever your reason might be: we value your contributions and we hope this small gesture makes your life a little bit better. So if you changed your name/email – or simply prefer us to use different values – please [submit a request](mailto:dotnet@microsoft.com&subject=.NET%20repo%20consolidation%3A%20request%20for%20name%20change&body=Hey%2C%20%0A%0AI%E2%80%99d%20like%20to%20change%20my%20email%2Fdisplay%20name%20in%20the%20consolidated%20repo%20from%20%0A%0A%20%20%20%20%20%20%20%20My%20Old%20Name%20%3Cold.me%40example.org%3E%20%0A%0Ato%20%0A%0A%20%20%20%20%20%20%20%20My%20New%20Name%20%3Cnew.me%40example.org%3E%20%0A%0AThanks%21%20%0A).\r\n\r\n### More is coming\r\n\r\nWe'll share more updates in the upcoming months.
