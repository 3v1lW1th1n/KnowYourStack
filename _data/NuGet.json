It would be nice if more of the package's metadata was exposed inside the Package Manager Console. Currently only the package ID, version and license URL are available when using Get-Package for a locally installed package for example. But we do not have other metadata, such as tags. Neither do we have the install location for the package.\r\n\r\nThe reason I'm asking is because we currently have a set of PowerShell scripts that can be run in the package manager console that handle deployment of a so called database package, which is just a NuGet package with a specific set of files. Currently I'm discovering the packages folder manually and using the old LocalPackageRepository API to get additional metadata. This has worked fine for us with Visual Studio 2015, but it doesn't work so well for 2017 and with all the changes going on under the hood (no more packages folder and packages.config) we're having trouble moving forward.\r\n\r\nIf more information would be available in the PM console when I do Get-Package that would make this a lot easier to do.
