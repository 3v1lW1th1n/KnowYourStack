I think the latter is easier but I'd be open to the former.\r\n\r\nThis was reported as https://github.com/OmniSharp/omnisharp-roslyn/issues/1311."},{"Id":"9031177189","Type":"IssuesEvent","CreatedAt":"2019-02-08T08:04:01","Actor":"aodl","Repository":"NuGet/Home","Organization":"NuGet","RawContent":null,"RelatedAction":"opened","RelatedUrl":"https://github.com/NuGet/Home/issues/7776","RelatedDescription":"Opened issue \"Document/configure order of dependency lists in Project.assets.json file\" (#7776) at NuGet/Home","RelatedBody":"I've been trying to determine how the order of dependencies in the `projectFileDependencyGroups` section of the project.assets.json file is determined.

Knowing the compile time dependency relationships and altering plugin behaviour based on that provides a mechanism of establishing plugin priority/override behaviour (based on the 'distance' of transitive dependencies from the entry assembly.\r\n\r\nI would like to be able to disambiguate between the priority behaviour of assemblies that sit as the same transitive dependency distance from the entry assembly, and I'm looking for a reliable way to do that. \r\n\r\n\r\n"},{"Id":"9030962673","Type":"IssuesEvent","CreatedAt":"2019-02-08T07:02:43","Actor":"ipavlu","Repository":"NuGet/Home","Organization":"NuGet","RawContent":null,"RelatedAction":"opened","RelatedUrl":"https://github.com/NuGet/Home/issues/7775","RelatedDescription":"Opened issue \"Dependency issue: version 1.2.3 turns into 1.2.2.2\" (#7775) at NuGet/Home","RelatedBody":"The issues seem to happen to a .net core project and to .net 4.7.2 project. they are both targeting a nuget net standard package on nuget.org originally created by a project in the same solution, but there are no references on csproj from the two projects with dependency issues.\r\n\r\nEverything says, that I am targetting GreenSuperGreen.Benchmarking.NetStandard.dll version 1.2.3 but looking on actually built binaries it always goes with version 1.2.2.2\r\n\r\nIt seems as if 1.2.3 is resolved as 1.2.3.0 and when not found on nuget.org then it is going for a closest lower version which is 1.2.2.2 even when 1.2.3 version exists.\r\n\r\nI created the corresponding tag on the github:\r\nhttps://github.com/ipavlu/GreenSuperGreen/releases/tag/dependencyissue\r\n\r\nand zipped tag with sources can be found here:\r\nhttps://github.com/ipavlu/GreenSuperGreen/archive/dependencyissue.zip\r\n\r\nI tried to move to 4 numbered versions.
