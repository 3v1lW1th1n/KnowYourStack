One of the last 'problems' that is really blocking seems to be ['ngx-toastr'](https://github.com/scttcper/ngx-toastr).\r\n\r\nThey dynamically add the [toastr component](https://github.com/scttcper/ngx-toastr/blob/master/src/lib/toastr/toast.component.ts) on runtime in the DOM.\r\n\r\n[Link to code that is responsible for this](https://github.com/scttcper/ngx-toastr/blob/db3e8fefe79dd66f2610b057a762bb0e668ab417/src/lib/portal/dom-portal-host.ts#L32)\r\n\r\nWhen switching to Ivy this code doesn't work anymore:\r\n\r\n```\r\nERROR DOMException: Failed to execute 'createElement' on 'Document': The tag name provided ('') is not a valid name. at DefaultDomRenderer2.createElement\r\n```\r\n\r\nAfter some debugging I found out that it's because the code that's responsible for retrieving the selector of a component in Ivy doesn't work: [Link](https://github.com/angular/angular/blob/c845a7b887d1a85a89acfe5c62b8829079130af3/packages/core/src/render3/component_ref.ts#L124)\r\n\r\nIn case of the toast component (see link above) it's ['', 'toast-component', '']. As a result the tag name becomes ''. And that explains the error above.\r\n\r\nI cloned ngx-toastr, changed the component name from `[toast-component]` to `toast-component` (removed the brackets). And everything seems to be working. This of course changes the result from a div with as attribute 'toast-component' to a custom component with as selector 'toast-component'.\r\n\r\nTL;DR: Dynamically generating components on runtime with Ivy doesn't work when using attribute notation.\r\n\r\n## üî¨ Minimal Reproduction\r\n\r\nUse ngx-toastr with Ivy enabled.\r\nIf more time, I'll create a stackblitz.\r\n\r\n## üî• Exception or Error\r\n\r\n```\r\nERROR DOMException: Failed to execute 'createElement' on 'Document': The tag name provided ('') is not a valid name. \r\nat DefaultDomRenderer2.createElement (http://localhost:4200/vendor.js:82322:25) \r\nat elementCreate (http://localhost:4200/vendor.js:53703:32) \r\nat ComponentFactory$1.create (http://localhost:4200/vendor.js:67815:13) \r\nat DomPortalHost.attachComponentPortal (http://localhost:4200/vendor.js:94547:41) \r\nat DomPortalHost.attach (http://localhost:4200/vendor.js:94505:21) at OverlayRef.attach (http://localhost:4200/vendor.js:94629:33) \r\nat ToastrService._buildNotification (http://localhost:4200/vendor.js:94955:35) \r\nat ToastrService._preBuildNotification (http://localhost:4200/vendor.js:94921:21) \r\nat ToastrService.success\r\n```\r\n\r\n## üåç  Your Environment\r\n\r\n**Angular Version:**\r\n<pre><code>\r\nAngular CLI: 8.2.0-next.1\r\nNode: 12.6.0\r\nOS: win32 x64\r\nAngular:\r\n...\r\n\r\nPackage                      Version\r\n------------------------------------------------------\r\n@angular-devkit/architect    0.802.0-next.1\r\n@angular-devkit/core         8.2.0-next.1\r\n@angular-devkit/schematics   8.2.0-next.1\r\n@schematics/angular          8.2.0-next.1\r\n@schematics/update           0.802.0-next.1\r\nrxjs                         6.4.0\r\n\r\n</code></pre>\r\n\r\n**Anything else relevant?**\r\nCauses https://github.com/scttcper/ngx-toastr/issues/686\r\n","Url":"https://github.com/angular/angular/issues/31785","RelatedDescription":"Closed issue \"Regression Ivy with ComponentFactory\" (#31785)"},{"Id":"471734198","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2019-07-24T04:17:34","Actor":"pkozlowski-opensource","Number":"31798","RawContent":null,"Title":"refactor(ivy): minor code cleanup","State":"closed","Body":"","Url":"https://github.com/angular/angular/pull/31798","RelatedDescription":"Closed or merged PR \"refactor(ivy): minor code cleanup\" (#31798)"},{"Id":"471536091","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2019-07-24T04:16:51","Actor":"splincode","Number":"31792","RawContent":null,"Title":"docs: add ngxs to library section","State":"closed","Body":"## PR Checklist\r\nPlease check if your PR fulfills the following requirements:\r\n\r\n- [x] The commit message follows our guidelines: https://github.com/angular/angular/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md#commit\r\n- [ ] Tests for the changes have been added (for bug fixes / features)\r\n- [x] Docs have been added / updated (for bug fixes / features)\r\n\r\n\r\n## PR Type\r\nWhat kind of change does this PR introduce?\r\n\r\n<!-- Please check the one that applies to this PR using \"x\". -->\r\n\r\n- [ ] Bugfix\r\n- [ ] Feature\r\n- [ ] Code style update (formatting, local variables)\r\n- [ ] Refactoring (no functional changes, no api changes)\r\n- [ ] Build related changes\r\n- [ ] CI related changes\r\n- [ ] Documentation content changes\r\n- [x] angular.io application / infrastructure changes\r\n- [ ] Other...

However you don't get a chance to do this for lazy loaded components.\r\n\r\n### Describe the solution you'd like\r\nAdd some possibility to hook into the `RouterConfigLoader` when routes from the child modules are processed (e.g. a provider that would be called with the routes resolved from the just loaded module's injector - https://github.com/angular/angular/blob/master/packages/router/src/router_config_loader.ts#L43).\r\n\r\n### Describe alternatives you've considered\r\nThe way to get around this is implemented in [localized-router](https://github.com/Greentube/localize-router): https://github.com/Greentube/localize-router/blob/master/src/localize-router-config-loader.ts.

I have an external subject to which I next numbers upon. This subject is given to a child-component through the Async pipe, which then displays whatever given in its template.\r\n\r\nFor this easy test case, I also want to reset that internal `@Input()` of the child component whenever I want to, to 0. However, when I did reset that internal value to 0, and try to next another number ( the same number as I previously did ), the `@Input()` setter does not pick up any change coming from the Async subscribed subject. I'm guessing the Async-pipe has some logic built in that covers duplicates? Although, I would think that it would act the same as a subscription on that Subject, because a normal subscription does log every entry, even identical ones.\r\n\r\nUnsure if this is a bug, or just something that is intended.\r\nI've read the documentation and it only says that `When a new value is emitted, the async pipe marks the component to be checked for changes.`, but I was thinking it is mentioning that for the change detection itself?\r\nOr is the AsyncPipe simply built to only act whenever the value has changed from the previous one,\r\nas sending through objects always triggers it?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAny help is highly appreciated.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n## üî¨ Minimal Reproduction\r\nI've created a StackBlitz, just click on the first button to next 200 for the first time, then click the second button to reset it internally in the child component and then try to do another next of 200.\r\n\r\nhttps://stackblitz.com/edit/angular-xvahxd\r\n\r\n<!--\r\nIf StackBlitz is not suitable for reproduction of your issue, please create a minimal GitHub repository with the reproduction of the issue.\r\nA good way to make a minimal reproduction is to create a new app via `ng new repro-app` and add the minimum possible code to show the problem. \r\nShare the link to the repo below along with step-by-step instructions to reproduce the problem, as well as expected and actual behaviour.\r\n\r\nIssues that don't have enough info and can't be reproduced will be closed.\r\n\r\nYou can read more about issue submission guidelines here: https://github.com/angular/angular/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md#-submitting-an-issue\r\n-->\r\n","Url":"https://github.com/angular/angular/issues/31799","RelatedDescription":"Open issue \"AsyncPipe doesn't register identical numbers as a change\" (#31799)"},{"Id":"471728600","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2019-07-23T14:24:26","Actor":"pkozlowski-opensource","Number":"31797","RawContent":null,"Title":"perf(ivy): introduce new benchmark for view create, destroy, traverse","State":"open","Body":"","Url":"https://github.com/angular/angular/pull/31797","RelatedDescription":"Open PR \"perf(ivy): introduce new benchmark for view create, destroy, traverse\" (#31797)"},{"Id":"471643045","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2019-07-23T11:31:40","Actor":"gkalpak","Number":"31796","RawContent":null,"Title":"ci: move the `test_saucelabs_bazel` CircleCI job to `default_workflow`","State":"open","Body":"This is a backport of #31636 to 8.0.x.\r\n(We need this in order for the changes to take effect on the 8.0.x branch, because CircleCI reads the config from each branch.)","Url":"https://github.com/angular/angular/pull/31796","RelatedDescription":"Open PR \"ci: move the `test_saucelabs_bazel` CircleCI job to `default_workflow`\" (#31796)"},{"Id":"471634805","IsPullRequest":false,"CreatedAt":"2019-07-23T11:13:53","Actor":"manikandanm143","Number":"31795","RawContent":null,"Title":"how to use ::ng-deep inside @media query syntax?","State":"open","Body":"i want to use ng-deep inside css media query.\r\n@media (min-width: 1025px) and (max-width: 1280px) {\r\n     ::ng-deep.bs-datepicker {\r\n         left: var(--my-var) !important;\r\n     }  \r\n}\r\n","Url":"https://github.com/angular/angular/issues/31795","RelatedDescription":"Open issue \"how to use ::ng-deep inside @media query syntax?\" (#31795)"},{"Id":"471630324","IsPullRequest":false,"CreatedAt":"2019-07-23T11:03:57","Actor":"askbs","Number":"31794","RawContent":null,"Title":"Angular 6 application and search-engine optimization, empty Google cached page version","State":"open","Body":"When we open the website its working fine but when we check it SCO purpose it can't be open.

(Original on Stackoverflow)](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/57121368/why-did-the-breakpoints-in-vs19-stop-working-after-angular-8-update)\r\n\r\n**Summarization:**\r\nI just updated my angular webproject yesterday from version 7.2.15 to 8.1.2 with the angular cli and the ng update command. But now if I try to debug my typescript code, all of a sudden the breakpoints won't work anymore in visual studio community 2019?\r\n\r\nSo when I activate a breakpoint, then the breakpoint turns white and shows a label text that says something like: Breakpoint set but not yet bound.\r\n\r\n\r\n**What I've already tried:**\r\nWhen using google I found out that other users had a similiar issue and they resolved the problem by setting inside of tsconfig.json. \r\n\r\n```\r\n\"sourceMap\": true\r\n``` \r\n\r\nUnlucky for me this didn't change anything since my tsconfig.json already had the property sourceMap set to true but the breakpoints still wouldn't get hit.\r\n\r\nMy guess is that the angular update somewhat overwrote some setting in some file, which I'm totally not aware of.\r\n\r\n\r\n**Show some code:**\r\nLooking in to the comparison of my commits, I noticed that in tsconfig.json and package.json files a lot of other stuff has also changed like:\r\n\r\n*tsconfig.json*\r\n```\r\n+ \"downlevelIteration\": true,\r\n- \"module\": \"es2015\",\r\n+ \"module\": \"esnext\",\r\n- \"target\": \"es5\",\r\n+ \"target\": \"es2015\",\r\n```\r\n\r\n*package.json:*\r\n```\r\n- \"@angular-devkit/build-angular\": \"^0.12.4\",\r\n+ \"@angular-devkit/build-angular\": \"~0.801.1\",\r\n- \"codelyzer\": \"~4.5.0\",\r\n+ \"codelyzer\": \"^5.0.1\",\r\n- \"zone.js\": \"~0.8.29\"\r\n+ \"zone.js\": \"~0.9.1\"\r\n- \"typescript\": \"3.1.6\"\r\n+ \"typescript\": \"3.4.5\"\r\n```\r\n\r\n\r\n*tslint.json:*\r\n```\r\n- \"use-input-property-decorator\": true,\r\n- \"use-output-property-decorator\": true,\r\n- \"use-host-property-decorator\": true,\r\n+ \"no-inputs-metadata-property\": true,\r\n+ \"no-outputs-metadata-property\": true,\r\n+ \"no-host-metadata-property\": true,\r\n```\r\n\r\n**Expected Result/Behaviour:** Expected would be that the breakpoints would hit so I could see what was going on in my code. But as said the breakpoints just go white and won't get bound.\r\n\r\n**The final question:** So my question in the end would be: How to get the breakpoints working again in VS2019 after the angular 8 update?\r\n\r\n**(21.07.2019) Edit 1:** Meanwhile I also tried to delete the 'node_modules' folder inside the ClientApp folder and reinstall it again with npm install. Unfortunately the breakpoints still won't get hit. \r\n\r\n**(22.07.2019) Edit 2:** \"This can't be the solution?\" : Seems like reverting angular to version 7.2.15 has fixed the breakpoint issue and I can look in to my breakpoints again.

When I deploy using ng build or when I run ng serve, I do not get the error and everything works as expected.\r\n\r\nAdditionally, the error only happens when I try to route to one specific component within my app. \r\nFurther, I have discovered that when I change the \"target\" property under \"compilerOptions\" in my tsconfig.json file from es2018 to es2015 to es5 or back and forth, it changes the error slightly instead of Gy, it may say Xy, or qy.\r\n\r\nBased on suggestions found in some slightly similar issues, I have tried the following:\r\n-Updating all my npm packages\r\n-Upgrading my

causing the error, but I only get it when I navigate to this specific component, and only when I've run ng build --prod.  \r\nHere are my imports for that component, but nothing really changed within this component from the time it worked to the time it didn't.  \r\n\r\n```\r\nimport { Component, OnInit } from '@angular/core';\r\nimport { GENERAL_REF } from '../../dbReferences';\r\nimport {

Let's call this application `tenant` and the library `shared-lib`.\r\nA component in the `tenant` wants to import a stylesheet of a component from `shared-lib`. This particular stylesheet imports a CSS like so:\r\n```\r\n@import 'colors'; // the lib's ng-package.json styleIncludePaths is already configured.\r\n```\r\nThis will compile just fine in the library.\r\n\r\nNow there is a component in `tenant` that wants to import this particular stylesheet.\r\nThis used to work before by doing this:\r\n\r\n1. Import the stylesheet explicitly,  in `projects/tenant/components/tenant-util.component.ts`\r\n```\r\n  styleUrls: [\r\n    '../../../../shared-lib/src/lib/components/util.component.scss',\r\n    './tenant-util.component.scss'\r\n  ]\r\n...\r\n```\r\n2.
