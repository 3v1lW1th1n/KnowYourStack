So far, I have been successful by adding the \"skipLocationChange: true\" navigationExtra to all my navigate calls, but when I use the router.navigate or router.navigateByUrl calls in interceptors and (more problematically) guards, the url address bar changes to the path I was originally going to before I was redirected.\r\n\r\nOne temporary solution I came up with for the interceptors was placing the navigate call inside a setTimeout().  I don't know if that is the correct way of handling interceptor redirection, but it stopped posting the previous path in the browser address bar.  However, when I use canActivate guards that redirect for invalid access, it always produces the path prior to redirection in the browser address bar, with or without the setTimeout.  This has been an issue for 7.2 in general since I started the project.\r\n\r\n## üî¨ Minimal Reproduction\r\nEasier to discuss rather than produce on stackblitz.\r\nApplication moves to a new screen:\r\n<pre><code>this.router.navigate(['/newscreen', 'screen2'], {skipLocationChange: true});</code></pre>\r\nApplication navigates to the screen component, which then makes an API call:\r\n<pre><code>this.httpClient.get('/someAPI/someMethod')</code></pre>\r\nUnbeknownst to the application, the authentication token for the user has expired.  So when the call gets made through my token interceptor, an HttpErrorResponse object gets sent back to the application, and gets caught in the catchError section of my interceptor.\r\n<pre><code>\r\nif (error instanceof HttpErrorResponse) {\r\n    if (error.status === 401) {\r\n        setTimeout(() => {\r\n            this.router.navigate(['/not-authenticated'], {skipLocationChange: true});\r\n        });\r\n        return EMPTY;\r\n    }\r\n}\r\nreturn throwError(error);\r\n</code></pre>\r\nIf I do not have this setTimeout call here, the browser address bar changes to localhost:4200/newscreen/screen_2, when it should actually stay at localhost:4200 only.\r\n\r\nIn addition, I tried using a canActivate AuthGuard for accessing a component.  In the code, right after my authentication expired, I clicked a button that would send me to root of the application.\r\n<pre><code>this.router.navigate([''], {skipLocationChange: true});</code></pre>\r\nIn my routing, I have the '' path redirecting to my HomeComponent, which has the canActivate AuthGuard, containing the following code:\r\n<pre><code>\r\nconst userToken = this.authService.getAccessToken();\r\nif (userToken) {\r\n  return true;\r\n}\r\nsetTimeout(() => {\r\n  this.router.navigate(['not-authenticated'], {skipLocationChange: true});\r\n});\r\nreturn false;\r\n</code></pre>\r\nThe guard catches the lost authentication, and redirects the user to the not-authenticated page.

I think this might be useful for another many cases, bcs it's quite hard for user to moving element exactly pixel in pixel in some cases, but we can help to do this programmatically.\r\n#### Is there anything else we should know?\r\nIt a bit similar to `dragStartThreshold` from `DragRefConfig`.\r\n","Url":"https://github.com/angular/material2/issues/15795","RelatedDescription":"Open issue \"Drag and drop, ability to hold element while drag\" (#15795)"},{"Id":"432126793","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2019-04-11T16:52:52","Actor":"crisbeto","Number":"15794","RawContent":null,"Title":"fix(chips): allow for role to be overwritten on chip list and chip","State":"open","Body":"Allows for the ARIA `role` of the `mat-chip-list` and `mat-chip` to be overwritten.\r\n\r\nFixes #15787.","Url":"https://github.com/angular/material2/pull/15794","RelatedDescription":"Open PR \"fix(chips): allow for role to be overwritten on chip list and chip\" (#15794)"},{"Id":"432119665","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2019-04-11T16:35:58","Actor":"kseamon","Number":"15793","RawContent":null,"Title":" feat(popover-edit): allow tabbing from popup to next/previous cell","State":"open","Body":"Includes a demo of how this allows a more spreadsheet-like set of user interactions when combined with some of Popover Edit's other features.","Url":"https://github.com/angular/material2/pull/15793","RelatedDescription":"Open PR \" feat(popover-edit): allow tabbing from popup to next/previous cell\" (#15793)"},{"Id":"431994163","IsPullRequest":false,"CreatedAt":"2019-04-11T12:23:59","Actor":"b-mi","Number":"15791","RawContent":null,"Title":"schematic(table): using generated DataSource with async data source","State":"open","Body":"#### What is the expected behavior?\r\n\r\nDocumentation for how to **get async data** `DataSource connect()` from (`http.get.....().subscribe()....`)\r\n\r\nI don't ask for example with static data nor old syntax, but how to use with actual schematic for Table and his DataSource\r\n\r\n#### What is the current behavior?\r\nDataSource extension is generated like this:\r\n```ts\r\nconnect(): Observable<any[]> {\r\n    // Combine everything that affects the rendered data into one update\r\n    // stream for the data-table to consume.\r\n\r\n    const dataMutations = [\r\n      observableOf(this.data),\r\n      this.paginator.page,\r\n      this.sort.sortChange\r\n    ];\r\n\r\n    // Set the paginator's length\r\n    this.paginator.length = this.data.length;\r\n\r\n    return merge(...dataMutations).pipe(map(() => {\r\n      return this.getPagedData(this.getSortedData([...this.data]));\r\n    }));\r\n\r\n  }\r\n```\r\n\r\nNo documentation, where and how to call `http.get`....... for getting async data for `connect()` method. \r\n\r\n#### What are the steps to reproduce?\r\nProviding a StackBlitz reproduction is the *best* way to share your issue. <br/>\r\nStackBlitz starter: https://goo.gl/wwnhMV<br/>\r\n\r\nTry to use material table schematic and fill `connect()` not with static data but async call like `http.get`...\r\n\r\n#### Which versions of Angular, Material, OS, TypeScript, browsers are affected?\r\nActual angular, actual material 7.3.7, needed typescript\r\n\r\n#### Is there anything else we should know?\r\n","Url":"https://github.com/angular/material2/issues/15791","RelatedDescription":"Open issue \"schematic(table): using generated DataSource with async data source\" (#15791)"},{"Id":"431974279","IsPullRequest":false,"CreatedAt":"2019-04-11T11:35:14","Actor":"bhumin3i","Number":"15790","RawContent":null,"Title":"autocomplete placed inside the chip-list  not preventing dummy type text","State":"open","Body":"#### What is the expected behavior?\r\nselect only available option \r\n\r\n#### What is the current behavior?\r\nwhen i type anything and click anywhere in the page it will show me new chip added but it is wrong because chip option only allow available array items also allow me to select option multiple time\r\n\r\n#### What are the steps to reproduce?\r\n> http://recordit.co/8vNqjawYKp\r\n\r\nGIF\r\n![8vNqjawYKp](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/25737987/55954402-3e27b300-5c7c-11e9-834d-5a035f13cd9e.gif)\r\n\r\n\r\n","Url":"https://github.com/angular/material2/issues/15790","RelatedDescription":"Open issue \"autocomplete placed inside the chip-list  not preventing dummy type text\" (#15790)"}],"ResultType":"GitHubIssue"}},"RunOn":"2019-04-15T05:30:04.9460058Z","RunDurationInMilliseconds":2885}
