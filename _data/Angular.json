The problem with this approach is that\r\ncontent projection can change TNodes relationship in a way that it is\r\nimpossible to reach all the nodes created in a given LView.\r\n\r\nThere are several ways we could go about fixing this problem.

In other words each\r\nnode traversal algorithm will have to take content projection into account.\r\nThere are different things we could do to remedy this problem:\r\n\r\n- change data structures so the projection doesn't modify original\r\n  relationship between nodes;\r\n\r\n- write a utility function / iterator that can traverse TView nodes\r\n  taking projection into account;\r\n\r\n- stick with the approach from this PR.\r\n\r\nOpening a WIP PR so we can discuss.","Url":"https://github.com/angular/angular/pull/28759","RelatedDescription":"Open PR \"fix(ivy): query projected child elements by directive\" (#28759)"},{"Id":"410779532","IsPullRequest":false,"CreatedAt":"2019-02-15T13:53:53","Actor":"alinmateut","Number":"28758","RawContent":null,"Title":"Add something like ngModelChange to ngForm","State":"open","Body":"I want to autosave my `student` object each time a field is edited.\r\n\r\nI have a form like\r\n```\r\n <form #form=\"ngForm\"> \r\n        <input name=\"name\"\r\n               #name=\"ngModel\"\r\n               [(ngModel)]=\"student.name\">\r\n        <-- many other inputs -->\r\n```\r\nand I tried to make something like \r\n\r\n```\r\n    ngForm.valueChanges.subscribe(x => {\r\n      if (ngForm.form.dirty && ngForm.form.valid) {\r\n        this.service.updateStudent(this.student).subscribe();\r\n      }\r\n    });\r\n```\r\nto detect the changes on each input and save it to the server each time an input is edited.

Is there any other way to disable a form control completely?\r\n\r\nThanks!\r\n\r\n## 🔬 Minimal Reproduction\r\nPlease see Stackblitz link below, please note that I have used the renderer to remove the disabled flag, to simulate a user removing it:\r\n\r\nhttps://stackblitz.com/edit/angular-7-reactive-form-example-nrkjnv\r\n\r\n## 🌍  Your Environment\r\n\r\n**Angular Version:**\r\n<pre><code>\r\n<!-- run `ng version` and paste output below -->\r\n<!-- ✍️-->\r\n     _                      _                 ____ _     ___\r\n    / \\   _ __   __ _ _   _| | __ _ _ __     / ___| |   |_ _|\r\n   / △ \\ | '_ \\ / _` | | | | |/ _` | '__|   | |   | |    | |\r\n  / ___ \\| | | | (_| | |_| | | (_| | |      | |___| |___ | |\r\n /_/   \\_\\_| |_|\\__, |\\__,_|_|\\__,_|_|       \\____|_____|___|\r\n                |___/\r\n    \r\n\r\nAngular CLI: 7.2.4\r\nNode: 8.10.0\r\nOS: linux x64\r\nAngular: 7.2.4\r\n... animations, cli, common, compiler, compiler-cli, core, forms\r\n... language-service, platform-browser, platform-browser-dynamic\r\n... router\r\n\r\nPackage                           Version\r\n-----------------------------------------------------------\r\n@angular-devkit/architect         0.12.4\r\n@angular-devkit/build-angular     0.12.4\r\n@angular-devkit/build-optimizer   0.12.4\r\n@angular-devkit/build-webpack     0.12.4\r\n@angular-devkit/core              7.2.4\r\n@angular-devkit/schematics        7.2.4\r\n@ngtools/webpack                  7.2.4\r\n@schematics/angular               7.2.4\r\n@schematics/update                0.12.4\r\nrxjs                              6.3.3\r\ntypescript                        3.2.4\r\nwebpack                           4.28.4\r\n\r\n</code></pre>\r\n\r\n**Anything else relevant?**\r\n<!-- ✍️Is this a browser specific issue?

The previous behavior of the Angular CLI prevented this from occuring and resulted in an inability to reference stylesheet assets in this manner.  The initial reason for this behavior is no longer present in the internal implementation of the Angular CLI.  Therefore, this now unnecessary and non-standard behavior is being phased out.  If an application currently relies on this behavior, a compatibility option `rebaseRootRelativeCssUrls` has been provided for the 8.x release cycle to facilitate transition away from this non-standard and limiting behavior.  The recommended method to transition is to use relative paths within the source stylesheet.  This allows the build system to process and generate a full URL for the asset.","Url":"https://github.com/angular/angular-cli/pull/13684","RelatedDescription":"Open PR \"fix(@angular-devkit/build-angular): disable by default stylesheet root relative URL rebasing\" (#13684)"},{"Id":"410728068","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2019-02-15T16:01:42","Actor":"clydin","Number":"13682","RawContent":null,"Title":" feat(@angular-devkit/core): support console logger color customization","State":"closed","Body":"","Url":"https://github.com/angular/angular-cli/pull/13682","RelatedDescription":"Closed or merged PR \" feat(@angular-devkit/core): support console logger color customization\" (#13682)"},{"Id":"410445727","IsPullRequest":false,"CreatedAt":"2019-02-15T12:36:10","Actor":"pedromcunha","Number":"13677","RawContent":null,"Title":"CORS issue while using Angular proxy to proxy an API with response-type application/vnd.apple.mpegurl","State":"closed","Body":"<!--🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅\r\n\r\nOh hi there! 😄\r\n\r\nTo expedite issue processing please search open and closed issues before submitting a new one.\r\nExisting issues often contain information about workarounds, resolution, or progress updates.\r\n\r\n🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅-->\r\n\r\n\r\n# 🐞 Bug report\r\n\r\n### Command (mark with an `x`)\r\n<!-- Can you pin-point the command or commands that are effected by this bug? -->\r\n<!-- ✍️edit: -->\r\n```\r\n- [ ] new\r\n- [ ] build\r\n- [ x ] serve\r\n- [ ] test\r\n- [ ] e2e\r\n- [ ] generate\r\n- [ ] add\r\n- [ ] update\r\n- [ ] lint\r\n- [ ] xi18n\r\n- [ ] run\r\n- [ ] config\r\n- [ ] help\r\n- [ ] version\r\n- [ ] doc\r\n```\r\n\r\n### Description\r\n\r\n<!-- ✍️--> A clear and concise description of the problem...\r\nI'm trying to proxy a request to my backend which has a response-type of **application/vnd.apple.mpegurl**.

To the same targets, it adds the manifest file as an asset.\r\n\r\nHence, ``@angular/pwa`` does not work, if one uses custom builders instead of the two mentioned ones.\r\n\r\nTo solve this, we could

ones (just edit the ``builder`` nodes; I don't think that the mentioned builders need to exist for this reproduction)\r\n- ng add @angular/pwa\r\n- Find out that the ``index.html`` has NOT been

At the moment the module is created as a library and the main application is being used as a demo. The library is built and exported when requesting the module from this repo. (https://bitbucket.org/joseph118/ng-module-x/src/master/)\r\nBitBucket Repo B - Application which makes use of \"BitBucket Repo A\" (installs the library) and more (Web app). (https://bitbucket.org/joseph118/app-x/src/master/)\r\n\r\nOn Repo A, the application is able to build, production build, build the library and also serve.\r\n\r\nOn Repo B, the application is able to build and serve, however it fails on production build. This will end up throwing 'module not found' but checking the node_modules folder, I can verify that everything seems to be in order.\r\n\r\n\r\n## 🔬 Minimal Reproduction\r\nReplication Steps: \r\n1. Clone Repo B (https://bitbucket.org/joseph118/app-x/src/master/).\r\n2. run 'ng build --prod'.\r\n\r\n## Generating project\r\n1. 'ng new ng-module-x'\r\n2. 'ng generate library lib-module'\r\n3.

I'm not able to more an item directly from list 1 to 3, but if I first drag it over list 2 (without dropping), I'm then able to drop it in list 3 (which is invalid since it wasn't specified in list 1's cdkDropListConnectedTo array.\r\n\r\n#### What is the expected behavior?\r\nItems being dragged from a source list, should only be dropable in the list(s) they have specified in their cdkDropListConnectedTo array, regardless of whether they hovered over another list in the process.\r\n\r\n#### What is the current behavior?\r\nI'm able to drop an item in an incorrect list.\r\n\r\n#### What are the steps to reproduce?\r\n\r\n```\r\n<li class=\"swim-lane\">\r\n    <h4>LIST 1</h4>\r\n    <div cdkDropList #list1=\"cdkDropList\" [cdkDropListData]=\"list1Items$ | async\"\r\n      [cdkDropListConnectedTo]=\"[list2]\" \r\n      (cdkDropListDropped)=\"actionDropped($event)\">\r\n      <div class=\"drag-box\" *ngFor=\"let item of (list1Items$ | async)\"\r\n        cdkDrag>\r\n                <span>content</span>\r\n      </div>\r\n    </div>\r\n  </li>\r\n\r\n  <li class=\"swim-lane\">\r\n    <h4>LIST 2</h4>\r\n    <div cdkDropList #list2=\"cdkDropList\" [cdkDropListData]=\"list2Items$ | async\"\r\n      [cdkDropListConnectedTo]=\"[list1]\"\r\n      (cdkDropListDropped)=\"actionDropped($event)\">\r\n      <div class=\"drag-box\" *ngFor=\"let item of (list2Items$ | async)\"\r\n        cdkDrag>\r\n                <span>content</span>\r\n      </div>\r\n    </div>\r\n  </li>\r\n\r\n  <li class=\"swim-lane\">\r\n    <h4>LIST 3</h4>\r\n    <div cdkDropList #list3=\"cdkDropList\" [cdkDropListData]=\"list3Items$ | async\"\r\n      [cdkDropListConnectedTo]=\"[list2]\" \r\n      (cdkDropListDropped)=\"itemDropped($event)\">\r\n      <div class=\"drag-box\" *ngFor=\"let item of (list3Items$ | async)\"\r\n        cdkDrag>\r\n        <span>content</span>\r\n      </div>\r\n    </div>\r\n  </li>\r\n\r\n```\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n#### What is the use-case or motivation for changing an existing behavior?\r\nInvalid drops are causing unnecessary validation errors and an incorrect UX.\r\n\r\n#### Which versions of Angular, Material, OS, TypeScript, browsers are affected?\r\nAngular 7.2.4\r\nMaterial/CDK 7.3.2\r\nWindows 10\r\nTypeScript 3.1.1\r\nChrome\r\n\r\n\r\n#### Is there anything else we should know?\r\n","Url":"https://github.com/angular/material2/issues/15191","RelatedDescription":"Open issue \"cdkDropListConnectedTo allowing invalid drop\" (#15191)"},{"Id":"410296580","IsPullRequest":false,"CreatedAt":"2019-02-14T13:21:08","Actor":"Suresh918","Number":"15190","RawContent":null,"Title":"Custom components using angular elements for angular material components","State":"open","Body":"#### Please describe the feature you would like to request.\r\nImplement custom components using angular elements for angular material components\r\n\r\n#### What is the use-case or motivation for this proposal?\r\nIf custom components implemented, we can use them in any application irrespective of the frame work (i.e. outside angular as well)\r\n\r\n#### Is there anything else we should know?\r\n","Url":"https://github.com/angular/material2/issues/15190","RelatedDescription":"Open issue \"Custom components using angular elements for angular material components\" (#15190)"},{"Id":"410287883","IsPullRequest":false,"CreatedAt":"2019-02-14T12:59:08","Actor":"Nodarii","Number":"15189","RawContent":null,"Title":"[form-field] rounded corners","State":"open","Body":"#### Please describe the feature you would like to request.\r\nAllow to round corners in form-field component.\r\n\r\n\r\n#### What is the use-case or motivation for this proposal?\r\nMaterial design specification -
