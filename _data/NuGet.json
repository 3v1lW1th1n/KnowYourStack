And then when setting up the IIS server, I have to use the same shared folder \\\\\\\\some-server-NUGET02\\nugetlibrary in Physical path:. If I use the local folder (to which the shared folder is pointing to i.e. D:\\Websites\\nugetlibrary), the site does not start. Looks like the publish path has to match the Physical path: in IIS Basic Settings. Is this true and how can I configure Physical path: to be D:\\Websites\\nugetlibrary? Note: this is not causing any issues - I prefer to use D:\\Websites\\nugetlibrary as opposed to \\\\\\\\some-server-NUGET02\\nugetlibrary. \r\n\r\nOne more thing. After I upload packages, the packages count in the main front page is not reflected and also the packages don't appear in the Packages tab or search. I ran Lucene index but that does not help. However, after restarting the server, the count is fine. I see the same issue when running NuGet Gallery locally on my machine.
