The array was modified via `arr.push({val:'hello'})`. That part gets noticed. But changes to the data I push does not get detected, `arr[1].val = 'bye'` does not get detected... unless:\r\n\r\nI played around with different ways to tell Vue what to look for in 'computed' and I did find a condition that solves my scenario, but a) I don't understand why it works, b) it's not straight forward.\r\n\r\nBasically, I iterate through the array in computed function and touch every getter. That seems to satisfy the Dep tracking logic. Notice, however, in my example that array starts off with 0 elements, and I am looping on a zero element array, and yet it works. Why?\r\nIf you remove line 7: `(this.arr[i].val;)`, my change detection no longer works. Who knows what V8 does to the rest of the for-loop. Maybe it yanks it out at runtime?\r\n\r\nWhat I would like is an API to add something to the computed Dep tracker. In my example, when I add a new element to array, I could call something like `this.$updateComputed('myComputedName').`\r\n\r\n```javascript\r\nvar track = 0; // track iGotEvaluated calls\r\n\r\nVue.component('comp', {\r\n\tcomputed: {\r\n  \tiGotEvaluated: function() {\r\n\t\t\tfor (var i = 0; i < this.arr.length; i  ) {\r\n\t\t\t\tthis.arr[i].val;\r\n      }\r\n      return   track;\r\n    }\r\n  },\r\n\ttemplate: `\r\n  \t<div>\r\n    \t\t<div>computed: #{{ iGotEvaluated }}</div>\r\n        \r\n       \t<div v-for=\"n in arr\">\r\n          \t<input v-model=\"n.val\"/>\r\n       \t</div>\r\n       \t<button v-on:click=\"add()\">Add</button>\r\n    </div>`,\r\n  data: function() {\r\n\t  return {\r\n      arr: []\r\n  \t}\r\n  },\r\n  methods: {\r\n  \tadd: function() {\r\n    \t this.arr.push({val: 'edit me'});\r\n    }\r\n  }\r\n})\r\n\r\nnew Vue({el: '#app'})\r\n```\r\n\r\n### What is expected?\r\nA more straight forward way to determine when change in deep array will trigger computed\r\n\r\n### What is actually happening?\r\nWhen dealing with deep array object it is not clear when the change detection will take place\r\n\r\n<!-- generated by vue-issues.
