When using Microsoft.AspNetCore.App 2.1, this results in the compiler referencing 168 .dll files from NuGet packages. These .dll files also happen to be the implementation binaries used in some scenarios. This has some negative consequences, such as (but not limited to):\r\n\r\n* Build perf: A simple netcoreapp2.1 + Microsoft.AspNetCore.App project requires 277 NuGet packages. This has a noticeable impact on all project operations involving NuGet. Even with optimizations like offline restore and NuGet's no-op restore, there is a noticeable amount of time spent on restore. This is visible both on command line \"dotnet restore\" and in VS UI.\r\n* Disk space: These 277 packages also bring down hundreds of other files that are never used for a netcoreapp2.1+ project. The SDK and NuGet must filter through all these to provide the actual set of assets required to compile and run an app. This adds time to project commands like build, publish, test, etc.\r\n* Offline cache: Offline packages caches in Azure Web Apps, Visual Studio, and the .NET Core SDK have become quite large (~1.0 GB) to satisfy offline restore scenarios.\r\n* Versioning quirks: There is no good answer for how to version each of those hundreds of NuGet packages. There is tension between avoiding re-shipping binaries which haven't changes, and having a sensible, consistent versioning.\r\n\r\n### Proposed solution\r\n\r\nLet's update Microsoft.AspNetCore.App to follow the pattern established by Microsoft.NETCore.App in 2.0.0.

It looks like a breaking change, but maybe I've done something wrong.  \r\n\r\nThe exact same code base (built and deployed at the same time) is behaving differently in two different Azure Web apps.  Prior to today, it was behaving the same.  One app was restarted, but we haven't actually deployed anything to either of the. \r\n\r\nWe have an ASP.NET action method that takes in an array of objects, like so:\r\n\r\n```\r\n    [ApiController,\r\n     Authorize,\r\n     Route(\"widgets\")]\r\n    public class WidgetsController : Controller\r\n        [HttpPost(\"summaries\")]\r\n        public async Task<ActionResult<ResultModel[]>> SearchAll(Criteria[] criteria, bool countOnly = false)\r\n        {\r\n              // snip\r\n        }\r\n```\r\n\r\nIn one of the deployed instances, posting a form like this works as expected:\r\n\r\n```json\r\n[\r\n\t{\"parameter\":\"User\",\"comparisonType\":\"=\",\"value\":\"*\"},\r\n\t{\"parameter\":\"Status\",\"comparisonType\":\"=\",\"value\":\"New,AttemptedContact\"}\r\n]\r\n```\r\n\r\nIn the other, posting the *exact* same payload, the payload is ignored.  The criteria array is empty.\r\n\r\nI ran some tests.  If I add `[FromBody]` to the parameter, then it works as expected again.\r\n\r\nI'm having a whale of a time reproducing the issue locally.  Everything worked fine locally until I installed .NET 2.1.5.  Once I did that, I started seeing the same, incorrect behavior that I'm seeing with one of our instances in Azure.  I tried to run my app locally on a previous version of .net by using `global.json`.  The CLI reported it was running 2.1.300, but the same issue still persisted.  **Again, everything worked fine until I installed 2.1.5.**\r\n\r\nPOSTing a single object still works fine, no need for the [FromBody] attribute.  It seems to just be related to posting arrays.\r\n\r\nAny suggestions on how I can troubleshoot this further?

With en-US the test is green, with de-CH it fails\r\n```csharp\r\nCultureInfo.DefaultThreadCurrentCulture = CultureInfo.GetCultureInfo(\"de-CH\");\r\n```\r\n\r\n\r\n#### Description of the problem:\r\n\r\nThe RouteValueProvider uses `.ToString()` to convert the route value to string. and then provides a culture along the result.  But actually the RouteValueProvider must use `System.Convert.ToString(value, culture)` to properly convert the object with the correct culture to a string: \r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/aspnet/Mvc/blob/9daf5ff7a4e092b3a84c060c44148d7d5d40b5c3/src/Microsoft.AspNetCore.Mvc.Core/ModelBinding/RouteValueProvider.cs#L94-L95\r\n\r\nThe SimpleTypeModelBinder uses a TypeConverter to convert it then back to an object using the culture from the ValueProvider:\r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/aspnet/Mvc/blob/a67d9363e22be8ef63a1a62539991e1da3a6e30e/src/Microsoft.AspNetCore.Mvc.Core/ModelBinding/Binders/SimpleTypeModelBinder.cs#L102-L105\r\n\r\nThis fails if the current culture is not matching the culture defined by the RouteValueProvider. My CurrentCulture is \"de-CH\" but the ValueProvider has detected somehow InvariantCulture. This leads to a wrong serialization.\r\n\r\n```csharp\r\nDateTimeOffset(DateTime.Parse(\"2012-12-22T01:02:03+01:00\")).ToString()\r\n== \"22.12.2012 01:02:03 +01:00\" //(de-CH)\r\n```\r\n\r\nThe DateTimeOffsetConverter will try to parse it with InvariantCulture expecting the format `12/22/2012 01:02:03 +01:00` and will fail with an exception. \r\n\r\nThe result in my case is that the `CalcBirthday` function gets \"0001-01-01T00:00:00.0000000+00:00\" as parameter (default value). \r\n\r\n#### Version of `Microsoft.AspNetCore.Mvc` or `Microsoft.AspNetCore.App` or `Microsoft.AspNetCore.All`:\r\n\r\nMicrosoft.AspNetCore.Mvc 2.0.0 \r\n\r\n<!--\r\n                                    --- NOTE ---\r\n1.

I started by reading this article https://blogs.msdn.microsoft.com/webdev/2018/02/27/asp-net-core-2-1-0-preview1-getting-started-with-signalr/\r\n\r\nwhere it clearly states that the SignalR route mapping should go at the END of the Configure method. Doing that gave me a 404 error because it was after my UseSpa method which swallows all the routes. However, I thought it might be a Cors issue, or a version mismatch. Moving those lines earlier just gave a \"Could not initialize transports\" error which sounded like it was happening too soon, so I moved it back. I noticed that putting an invalid hub name in the client made no difference, so I clearly wasn't getting through to the server.\r\n\r\n8 hours of hard slog later after reading hundreds of posts, I found one that mentioned the UseSpa swallowing the routes - if only the error had said \"Hub not found\".\r\n\r\nSo then I set about fixing the \"Could not initialize transports\" error. I tried configuring long polling, switching the version of my client library. My server was running ASP.NET Core 2.1 so that should be fine. Nothing I did would resolve the error. 4 more hours of hard slog later, I noticed that although VS was saying I was running .NET Core 2.1, it was loading some funky preview. I'd only ever installed released code on my machine so I don't know where the preview came from. If only the error had said \"Client/server version mismatch\" - surely not rocket science. So I then updated all the NuGet packages to the latest 2.1 release, but I ran into the \"Method was called with 2 arguments but was expecting 0\" error, documented in another issue, but I was making progress, it was trying to call my code. Of course my methods had the correct number of arguments but the wrong names - if only it had said \"Method not found\".\r\n\r\nSo after 12 hours of hard slog, I finally got it to work! If only the docs had been correct, if only the error messages had not just said Error negotiating: error.\r\n\r\nPlease improve the error messages and docs, SignalR is awesome!\r\n\r\nCheers,\r\nPaul","Url":"https://github.com/aspnet/SignalR/issues/3100","RelatedDescription":"Open issue \"Poor documentation and error messages\" (#3100)"},{"Id":"368104544","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2018-10-09T16:03:56","Actor":"Shehanka","Number":"3099","RawContent":null,"Title":"README Updated","State":"closed","Body":"LICENSE section added to the README.md","Url":"https://github.com/aspnet/SignalR/pull/3099","RelatedDescription":"Closed or merged PR \"README Updated\" (#3099)"},{"Id":"367999747","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2018-10-09T00:53:55","Actor":"dotnet-maestro-bot","Number":"3098","RawContent":null,"Title":"[automated] Merge branch 'release/2.2' => 'master'","State":"closed","Body":"I detected changes in the release/2.2 branch which have not been merged yet to master.\r\nI'm a robot and am configured to help you automatically keep master up to date, so\r\nI've opened this PR.\r\n\r\nThis PR merges commits made on release/2.2 by the following committers:\n\n* @mikaelm12\r\n\r\n## Instructions for merging\r\n\r\nThis PR will not be auto-merged.

For authentication I'm purely using **Steam authentication** (No User/Pass login) provided by, https://github.com/aspnet-contrib/AspNet.Security.OpenId.Providers\r\n\r\n**The problem** is that when I add a Role to a user (I've already got roles seeded and I've added my own steam account to the Admin Role), the role type claims are not being added on login, therefore when an admin user attempts to access an API route protected by [Authorize(Roles = \"Admin\") I'm being returned an Unauthorized Redirect.\r\n\r\nBelow I have added all code snippets I think is required (feel free to request more).\r\n\r\nIf I use (I am currently using this as a temporary solution, but it is not ideal for future development);\r\n\r\n    services.AddIdentity<User, Role>()\r\n       .AddEntityFrameworkStores<RSContext>()\r\n       .AddSignInManager<SignInManager<User>>()\r\n       .AddRoleManager<RoleManager<Role>>()\r\n       .AddDefaultTokenProviders();\r\n\r\nThe application correctly adds the role claims on user sign in (and the Authorize attributes work), using all existing code from AuthController.cs, yet using IdentityCore it fails.\r\n\r\n**NOTE:** The API will **correctly authenticate** and set the users cookies on sign in, but does not add the users roles to the users identity claims. Therefore, Authentication is Working, Authorization is not. If I utilise the [Authorize] attribute without specifying a Role it works flawlessly and only allows Authenticated users to access the route whilst denying unAuthenticated users. This can be seen in the Testing Screenshot at the end, identities[0].isAuthenticated = True, but the admin role is not being added to the Identity's Claims. As noted above, if I do not use AddIdentityCore and use AddIdentity, the roles are added to the user's claims correctly and the [Authorize(Role = \"Admin\")] attribute will work as expected, only allowing users that are apart of the Admin role to access it.\r\n\r\nStartup.cs (Omitted irrelevant parts, eg.

This advisory also provides guidance on what developers can do to remove current security restrictions added by ASP.NET to their applications to become compatible with iOS12.\r\n\r\n## Announcement\r\n\r\nThe original announcement for this issue can be found at https://github.com/aspnet/Announcements/issues/318\r\n\r\n## Discussion\r\n\r\nDiscussion for this issue can be found at https://github.com/aspnet/Security/issues/1864 for ASP.NET Core Cookie Authentication\r\n\r\n## <a name=\"advisory-faq\"></a>Advisory FAQ\r\n\r\n### <a name=\"how-affected\"></a>What has changed\r\n\r\nThe recent iOS12 update has changed Safari's handling of [SameSite](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc6265) cookies. The SameSite attribute allows a developer to control when cookies are sent to a web site, enabling the flow to only occur when requests are from the same site. This standard was introduced to reduce exposure to Cross Site Request Forgery (CSRF) attacks. By default ASP.NET Core 2.0 and later protects its authentication cookies using the SameSite property. The change on Apple's part is not limited to ASP.NET Core applications, it is affecting multiple frameworks and authentication software which relay on HTTP forms in a browser, for example authenticating to a third party via Facebook, Twitter or browser based Open ID Connect (OIDC) mechanism.\r\n\r\nApple have stated they believe [their change is correct behavior](https://bugs.webkit.org/show_bug.cgi?id=188165), and that the fault lies in every other browser's implementation.\r\n\r\nWhile we take no stance on the correctness of browser behavior we feel that removing the SameSite protections would expose our customers, and their customers to a wider risk, as it would remove the protection provided everywhere, for all users, in any browser.\r\n\r\n### <a name=\"how-affected\"></a>How do I know if I am affected?\r\n\r\nIf your users can no longer login to your web application on iOS12 using Safari then you are affected.\r\n\r\n### <a name=\"how-fix\"></a>How do I fix this?\r\n\r\nDevelopers can allow iOS12 Safari users to log into their applications by turn off SameSite protection in `ConfigureServices()`.\r\n\r\nIf you are using ASP.NET Core Identity you disable the protection by configuring cookies with the following code\r\n\r\n```c#\r\nservices.ConfigureExternalCookie(options =>\r\n{\r\n    // Other options\r\n    options.Cookie.SameSite = SameSiteMode.None;\r\n});\r\nservices.ConfigureApplicationCookie(options =>\r\n{\r\n    // Other options\r\n    options.Cookie.SameSite = SameSiteMode.None;\r\n});\r\n```\r\n\r\nIf you are using cookie authentication without ASP.NET Core identity you can turn off the protection with the following code\r\n\r\n```c#\r\nservices.AddCookie(CookieAuthenticationDefaults.AuthenticationScheme, options =>\r\n{\r\n    // Other options\r\n    options.Cookie.SameSite = Microsoft.AspNetCore.Http.SameSiteMode.None;\r\n})\r\n```\r\n\r\nIf you are using external OIDC providers you may be able to avoid the issue by changing the response mode your provider uses from a POST to a GET request, using the following code. Not all providers may support this.\r\n\r\n```c#\r\n.AddOpenIdConnect(\"myOIDProvider\", options => {\r\n    // Other options\r\n    options.ResponseType = \"code\";\r\n    options.ResponseMode = \"query\";\r\n};\r\n```\r\n\r\n_Note that in making these changes protection is removed for all users and all browsers. You should ensure that all your actions that make state changes are protected with [CSRF anti-forgery mechanisms](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/aspnet/core/security/anti-request-forgery) built into ASP.NET Core.\r\n\r\n#### Rebuilding your application\r\n\r\nAfter making these configuration changes you rebuild your application, test, and redeploy.\r\n\r\n## Other Information\r\n\r\n### Reporting Security Issues\r\n\r\nIf you have found a potential security issue in .NET Core, please email details to secure@microsoft.com.

The server won't see this kind of traffic, but I want to make sure is stable in worst case scenario.\r\nIs it possible to limit memory usage?","Url":"https://github.com/aspnet/KestrelHttpServer/issues/2989","RelatedDescription":"Closed issue \"High memory usage observed during Kestrel stress test\" (#2989)"},{"Id":"367157849","IsPullRequest":false,"CreatedAt":"2018-10-06T06:35:58","Actor":"peppy","Number":"2986","RawContent":null,"Title":"Kestrel stops processing requests for a period","State":"closed","Body":"I have been migrating a .NET Framework 4.x project to .NET core. In the process I ran into an issue with `HttpListener` not working as expected, so migrated my code to use Kestrel.\r\n\r\nThe server application is a high-performance game server that handles request and response bodies in a completely custom way. It processes around 3000req/s. After around 5-30 minutes of correct execution, the server goes into a state where it is no longer processing incoming requests. Eventually it will recover from this state, but by this point clients believe they have lost connections.\r\n\r\nI have been debugging over the last few days and have ruled out my code being the direct issue, but I have also been unable to reproduce under non-production load. I did manage to get a core dump in the hanging state and you can find the log of sos EEstack [here](https://gist.github.com/peppy/de6a599a87041c269d420036d2be81ed). I am able to share any further lldb/sos output should it be relevant.\r\n\r\nWhile I fully intend to continue investigation on my own, I want to post this here for visibility in case someone working on the project can guide me in the right direction based on the thread call stacks above.\r\n\r\nThe project was built against `.NET core 2.1.4` / `Kestrel 2.2.0-preview2-35157` on a macOS host using `dotnet publish`, running on an Ubuntu host (rid `linux-x64`).\r\n\r\nNote that I was seeing similar behaviour before migrating from `HttpListener`, so it is quite possibly something at a lower level or unrelated to Kestrel directly.\r\n\r\nAs the project this is being used in is private, I cannot link to the source, but here is an extract showing how I am using Kestrel:\r\n\r\n```csharp\r\n\r\nprivate static void StartHttpListener()\r\n{\r\n    var host = new WebHostBuilder().UseKestrel(options =>\r\n        {\r\n            options.ConfigureEndpointDefaults(o => o.NoDelay = true);\r\n        })\r\n        .Configure(app =>\r\n        {\r\n            app.Run(context =>\r\n            {\r\n                DogStatsd.Increment(\"http_requests\");\r\n                return HandleConnection(context);\r\n            });\r\n        })\r\n        .UseUrls(\"http://*:80\")\r\n        .Build();\r\n\r\n    host.Run();\r\n}\r\n\r\nprivate static Task HandleConnection(HttpContext context)\r\n{\r\n    var request = context.Request;\r\n    var response = context.Response;\r\n    \r\n    var client = UserManager.GetClientFromToken(incomingToken);\r\n    if (client == null)\r\n    {\r\n        response.StatusCode = 403;\r\n        return Task.CompletedTask;\r\n    }\r\n\r\n    var tcs = new TaskCompletionSource<bool>();\r\n    \r\n    client.SetStreams(request.Body, response.Body, (int)(request.ContentLength ?? 0), tcs);\r\n    // the request is read by the client synchronously here.\r\n\r\n    // the response is processed and written to by a separate worker pool within one second of this call.\r\n    // after the worker finishes using the response, it will set tcs.SetResult(true) to complete the returned task below.\r\n    return tcs.Task;\r\n}\r\n\r\n```\r\n\r\nThanks in advance for any help with this issue.\r\n","Url":"https://github.com/aspnet/KestrelHttpServer/issues/2986","RelatedDescription":"Closed issue \"Kestrel stops processing requests for a period\" (#2986)"},{"Id":"366121565","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2018-10-05T23:10:37","Actor":"JunTaoLuo","Number":"2976","RawContent":null,"Title":"Expose status code of BadHttpRequestException","State":"closed","Body":"Addresses #2909.

However, we suggest you update to the new package as soon as possible.

We plan to condense about 53 repos into 5. Repos which merge with another will be archived on GitHub, which makes them read-only. We will also rename a few repositories. GitHub will automatically redirect URLs to issues and commits on renamed repositories. We will update the README and repo descriptions to help you navigate from archived repos to the new repo.\r\n\r\nAfter the merging is complete, the final set of repos will be as follows:\r\n\r\nRepo                            | Primary purpose\r\n--------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------\r\naspnet/AspNetCore               | ASP.NET Core runtime\r\naspnet/Extensions               | Microsoft.Extensions.* APIs\r\naspnet/EntityFrameworkCore      | Entity Framework Core\r\naspnet/Tooling                  | Visual Studio extensions, command-line tools, and MSBuild SDKs\r\naspnet/AspLabs                  | Experiments not ready for production releases\r\n\r\nTo preserve as much history as possible, we will rename aspnet/Home to aspnet/AspNetCore, and aspnet/Common to aspnet/Extensions instead of creating new repos. We will preserve commit history by merging unrelated histories into the unified repos. We will also review open issues and move them when necessary to keep them aligned with the relevant code.\r\n\r\n### Motivation\r\n\r\nOur primary motivation is simplifying both our engineering systems and our GitHub interactions with all of you. We know there are some drawbacks to working in larger repos, but we find the benefits compelling enough to move forward with this change. The new set of repos more closely aligns with the layering of the products they ship.\r\n\r\n### Timeframe\r\n\r\nWe'll be starting the first round of changes soon. We expect the entire unification effort will take us several weeks. We'll migrate repositories in phases and adjust the plan along the way, as necessary.\r\n\r\n### Archived repos\r\n\r\nThe following repos will be merged into the main repos above. They will not be used any more for active development on 2.1 LTS and new releases. The source code for the projects will move to the new project with any issues we intend to keep working on. Remaining issues and pull requests will be closed. We do not plan to delete the repos or remove tagged commits, but the projects will become read-only.\r\n\r\n* AADIntegration           \r\n* Antiforgery              \r\n* AuthSamples              \r\n* AzureIntegration         \r\n* BasicMiddleware          \r\n* BrowserLink              \r\n* Caching                  \r\n* Common                   \r\n* Configuration            \r\n* CORS                     \r\n* DataProtection           \r\n* DependencyInjection      \r\n* Diagnostics              \r\n* DotNetTools              \r\n* EventNotification        \r\n* FileSystem               \r\n* Hosting                  \r\n* HtmlAbstractions         \r\n* HttpAbstractions         \r\n* HttpClientFactory        \r\n* HttpSysServer            \r\n* Identity                 \r\n* IISIntegration           \r\n* JavaScriptServices       \r\n* JsonPatch                \r\n* KestrelHttpServer        \r\n* Localization             \r\n* Logging                  \r\n* MetaPackages             \r\n* Microsoft.Data.Sqlite    \r\n* MusicStore               \r\n* Mvc                      \r\n* MvcPrecompilation        \r\n* Options                  \r\n* Proxy                    \r\n* Razor                    \r\n* ResponseCaching          \r\n* Routing                  \r\n* Scaffolding              \r\n* Security                 \r\n* ServerTests              \r\n* Session                  \r\n* SignalR                  \r\n* StaticFiles              \r\n* Templating               \r\n* Testing                  \r\n* Universe                 \r\n* WebHooks                 \r\n* WebSockets\r\n\r\n\r\n_Please use https://github.com/aspnet/Home/issues/3598 for discussion._  ","Url":"https://github.com/aspnet/Announcements/issues/320","RelatedDescription":"Open issue \"For contributors: unifying to fewer GitHub repos\" (#320)"},{"Id":"367922912","IsPullRequest":false,"CreatedAt":"2018-10-08T19:29:02","Actor":"pranavkm","Number":"319","RawContent":null,"Title":"3.0 - Removing Microsoft.AspNetCore.Mvc.WebApiCompatShim","State":"open","Body":"The Microsoft.AspNetCore.Mvc.WebApiCompatShim (WebApiCompatShim) package provides partial compatibility in ASP.NET Core with ASP.NET Web API 2 to simplify migrating existing Web API implementations to ASP.NET Core.

This advisory also provides guidance on what developers can do to remove current security restrictions added by ASP.NET to their applications to become compatible with iOS12.\r\n\r\n## Discussion\r\n\r\nDiscussion for this issue can be found at https://github.com/aspnet/Identity/issues/1984 for ASP.NET Core Identity\r\nDiscussion for this issue can be found at https://github.com/aspnet/Security/issues/1864 for ASP.NET Core Cookie Authentication\r\n\r\n## <a name=\"advisory-faq\"></a>Advisory FAQ\r\n\r\n### <a name=\"how-affected\"></a>What has changed\r\n\r\nThe recent iOS12 update has changed Safari's handling of [SameSite](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc6265) cookies. The SameSite attribute allows a developer to control when cookies are sent to a web site, enabling the flow to only occur when requests are from the same site. This standard was introduced to reduce exposure to Cross Site Request Forgery (CSRF) attacks. By default ASP.NET Core 2.0 and later protects its authentication cookies using the SameSite property. The change on Apple's part is not limited to ASP.NET Core applications, it is affecting multiple frameworks and authentication software which relay on HTTP forms in a browser, for example authenticating to a third party via Facebook, Twitter or browser based Open ID Connect (OIDC) mechanism.\r\n\r\nApple have stated they believe [their change is correct behavior](https://bugs.webkit.org/show_bug.cgi?id=188165), and that the fault lies in every other browser's implementation.\r\n\r\nWhile we take no stance on the correctness of browser behavior we feel that removing the SameSite protections would expose our customers, and their customers to a wider risk, as it would remove the protection provided everywhere, for all users, in any browser.\r\n\r\n### <a name=\"how-affected\"></a>How do I know if I am affected?\r\n\r\nIf your users can no longer login to your web application on iOS12 using Safari then you are affected.\r\n\r\n### <a name=\"how-fix\"></a>How do I fix this?\r\n\r\nDevelopers can allow iOS12 Safari users to log into their applications by turn off SameSite protection in `ConfigureServices()`.\r\n\r\nIf you are using ASP.NET Core Identity you disable the protection by configuring cookies with the following code\r\n\r\n```c#\r\nservices.ConfigureExternalCookie(options =>\r\n{\r\n    // Other options\r\n    options.Cookie.SameSite = SameSiteMode.None;\r\n});\r\nservices.ConfigureApplicationCookie(options =>\r\n{\r\n    // Other options\r\n    options.Cookie.SameSite = SameSiteMode.None;\r\n});\r\n```\r\n\r\nIf you are using cookie authentication without ASP.NET Core identity you can turn off the protection with the following code\r\n\r\n```c#\r\nservices.AddCookie(CookieAuthenticationDefaults.AuthenticationScheme, options =>\r\n{\r\n    // Other options\r\n    options.Cookie.SameSite = Microsoft.AspNetCore.Http.SameSiteMode.None;\r\n})\r\n```\r\n\r\nIf you are using external OIDC providers you may be able to avoid the issue by changing the response mode your provider uses from a POST to a GET request, using the following code. Not all providers may support this.\r\n\r\n```c#\r\n.AddOpenIdConnect(\"myOIDProvider\", options => {\r\n    // Other options\r\n    options.ResponseType = \"code\";\r\n    options.ResponseMode = \"query\";\r\n};\r\n```\r\n\r\n_Note that in making these changes protection is removed for all users and all browsers. You should ensure that all your actions that make state changes are protected with [CSRF anti-forgery mechanisms](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/aspnet/core/security/anti-request-forgery) built into ASP.NET Core.\r\n\r\n#### Rebuilding your application\r\n\r\nAfter making these configuration changes you rebuild your application, test, and redeploy.\r\n\r\n## Other Information\r\n\r\n### Reporting Security Issues\r\n\r\nIf you have found a potential security issue in .NET Core, please email details to secure@microsoft.com.

This advisory also provides guidance on what developers can do to update their applications to remove this vulnerability.\r\n\r\nMicrosoft is aware of a denial of service vulnerability when ASP.NET Core improperly handles web requests. An attacker who successfully exploited this vulnerability could cause a denial of service against an ASP.NET Core web application. The vulnerability can be exploited remotely, without authentication. A remote unauthenticated attacker could exploit this vulnerability by providing a specially crafted web requests to the ASP.NET Core application.\r\n\r\nThe update addresses the vulnerability by correcting how ASP.NET Core handles parsing web requests.\r\n\r\nThe underlying problem exists in the `System.IO.Pipelines` package.

To check the current installed runtimes open a command prompt and run the `dotnet --info` command. If you have a 2.1 or greater runtime installed you will see output like the following;\r\n\r\n```\r\n.NET Core SDK (reflecting any global.json):\r\n Version:   2.1.401\r\n Commit:    91b1c13032\r\n\r\nRuntime Environment:\r\n OS Name:     Windows\r\n OS Version:  10.0.17134\r\n OS Platform: Windows\r\n RID:         win10-x64\r\n Base Path:   C:\\Program Files\\dotnet\\sdk\\2.1.401\\\r\n\r\nHost (useful for support):\r\n  Version: 2.1.3\r\n  Commit:  124038c13e\r\n\r\n.NET Core SDKs installed:\r\n  2.1.4 [C:\\Program Files\\dotnet\\sdk]\r\n  2.1.401 [C:\\Program Files\\dotnet\\sdk]\r\n\r\n.NET Core runtimes installed:\r\n  Microsoft.AspNetCore.All 2.1.3 [C:\\Program Files\\dotnet\\shared\\Microsoft.AspNetCore.All]\r\n  Microsoft.AspNetCore.App 2.1.3 [C:\\Program Files\\dotnet\\shared\\Microsoft.AspNetCore.App]\r\n  Microsoft.NETCore.App 2.1.3 [C:\\Program Files\\dotnet\\shared\\Microsoft.NETCore.App]\r\n\r\nTo install additional .NET Core runtimes or SDKs:\r\n  https://aka.ms/dotnet-download\r\n```\r\n\r\nIf the highest .NET Core SDK version is less that 2.1.402 or the highest `Microsoft.AspNetCore.App` runtime version is less that 2.1.4 you are vulnerable to this issue. You may not see any SDK versions if you have only installed the runtime.\r\n\r\nTo update ASP.NET Core 2.1 you should [download](https://www.microsoft.com/net/download) and install the .NET Core SDK 2.1.402 on your development machines and build servers, and the .NET Core Runtime 2.1.4 on your deployment servers. Your application will roll forward to these versions on an application restart.\r\n\r\n#### Applications not using Microsoft.AspNetCore.App or Microsoft.AspNetCore.All\r\n\r\nSystem.IO.Pipelines is distributed both in ASP.NET Core 2.1 and separately as a NuGet package. If you are not using Microsoft.AspNetCore.App or .All, you may still be affected if you are referencing the System.IO.Pipelines package.\r\n\r\n##### Direct dependencies\r\n\r\nDirect dependencies are discoverable by examining your `csproj` file. They can be fixed by [editing the project file](#fixing-direct-dependencies) or using NuGet to update the dependency.\r\n\r\n##### Transitive dependencies\r\n\r\nTransitive dependencies occur when you add a package to your project that in turn relies on another package. For example, if Contoso publishes a package `Contoso.Utility` which, in turn, depends on `Contoso.Internals` and you add the `Contoso.Utility` package to your project now your project has a direct dependency on `Contoso.Utility` and, because `Contoso.Utility` depends 'Contoso.Internals', your application gains a transitive dependency on the `Contoso.Internals` package.\r\n\r\nTransitive dependencies are reviewable in two ways:\r\n\r\n* In the Visual Studio Solution Explorer window, which supports searching.\r\n* By examining the `project.assets.json` file contained in the obj directory of your project for `csproj` based projects\r\n\r\nThe `project.assets.json` files are the authoritative list of all packages used by your project, containing both direct and transitive dependencies.\r\n\r\nThere are two ways to view transitive dependencies. You can either [use Visual Studio’s Solution Explorer](#vs-solution-explorer), or you can review [the `project.assets.json` file](#project-assets-json)).\r\n\r\n##### <a name=\"vs-solution-explorer\"></a>Using Visual Studio Solution Explorer\r\n\r\nTo use Solution Explorer, open the project in Visual Studio, and then press Ctrl+; to activate the search in Solution Explorer. Search for the [vulnerable package](#affected-software) and make a note of the version numbers of any results you find.\r\n\r\nFor example, searching for `Microsoft.AspNetCore.Mvc.Core` in an example project that contains a package that takes a dependency on `Microsoft.AspNetCore.Mvc` shows the following results in Visual Studio 2017:\r\n\r\n![Screenshot of search results in Visual Studio 2017](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/796298/25858816/8ecdc2b4-3491-11e7-9363-746804bb9832.png)\r\n\r\nThe search results appear as a tree. In the previous results, you can see that a reference to `Microsoft.AspNetCore.Mvc.Core` version 1.1.2 is discovered.\r\n\r\nUnder the Dependencies node is a NuGet node. Under the NuGet node is the list of packages you have directly taken a dependency on and their versions.\r\nIn screenshot, the application takes a direct dependency on `Microsoft.AspNetCore.Mvc`. `Microsoft.AspNetCore.Mvc` in turn has leaf nodes that list its dependencies and their versions.\r\nThe `Microsoft.AspNetCore.Mvc` package takes a dependency on a version of `Microsoft.AspNetCore.Mvc.ApiExplorer`, that in turn takes a dependency on a version of `Microsoft.AspNetCore.Mvc.Core`.\r\n\r\n##### <a name=\"project-assets-json\"></a> Manually reviewing project.assets.json\r\n\r\nOpen the *project.assets.json* file from your project’s obj directory in your editor. We suggest you use an editor that understands JSON and allows you to collapse and expand nodes to review this file.\r\nVisual Studio and Visual Studio Code provide JSON friendly editing.\r\n\r\nSearch the *project.assets.json* file for the [vulnerable package](#affected-software), using the format `packagename/` for each of the package names from the preceding table. If you find the assembly name in your search:\r\n\r\n* Examine the line on which they are found, the version number is after the `/`.\r\n* Compare to the [vulnerable versions table](#affected-software).\r\n\r\nFor example, a search result that shows `System.IO.Pipelines/4.5.0` is a reference to version 4.5.0 of `System.IO.Pipelines`.\r\n\r\nIf your *project.assets.json* file includes references to the [vulnerable package](#affected-software), then you need to fix the transitive dependencies.\r\n\r\nIf you have not found any reference to any vulnerable packages, this means either\r\n\r\n* None of your direct dependencies depend on any vulnerable packages, or\r\n* You have already fixed the problem by updating the direct dependencies.\r\n\r\n### <a name=\"how-fix\"></a>How do I fix the issue?\r\n\r\n#### <a name=\"fixing-direct-dependencies\"></a>Fixing direct dependencies\r\n\r\nOpen *projectname.csproj* in your editor. If you're using Visual Studio, right-click the project and choose **Edit projectname.csproj** from the context menu, where projectname is the name of your project. Look for `PackageReference` elements. The following shows an example project file:\r\n\r\n```xml\r\n<Project Sdk=\"Microsoft.NET.Sdk.Web\">\r\n  <PropertyGroup>\r\n    <TargetFramework>netcoreapp2.1</TargetFramework>\r\n  </PropertyGroup>\r\n  <ItemGroup>\r\n    <PackageReference Include=\"System.IO.Pipelines\" Version=\"4.5.0\" />\r\n  </ItemGroup>\r\n</Project>\r\n```\r\n\r\nThe preceding example has a reference to the [vulnerable package](#affected-software), as seen by the single `PackageReference` element. The name of the package is in the `Include` attribute.\r\nThe package version number is in the `Version` attribute. The previous example shows a single direct dependency on `System.IO.Pipelines` version 4.5.0\r\n\r\nTo update the version to the secure package, change the version number to the updated package version as listed on the table [previously](#affected-software).\r\nIn this example, update `System.IO.Pipelines` to the appropriate [fixed package number](#affected-software) for your major version. Save the *csproj* file. The example *csproj* now looks as follows:\r\n\r\n```xml\r\n<Project Sdk=\"Microsoft.NET.Sdk.Web\">\r\n  <PropertyGroup>\r\n    <TargetFramework>netcoreapp2.1</TargetFramework>\r\n  </PropertyGroup>\r\n  <ItemGroup>\r\n    <PackageReference Include=\"System.IO.Pipelines\" Version=\"4.5.1\" />\r\n  </ItemGroup>\r\n</Project>\r\n```\r\n\r\nIf you're using Visual Studio and you save your updated *csproj* file, Visual Studio will restore the new package version.\r\nYou can see the restore results by opening the **Output** window (Ctrl+Alt+O) and changing the **Show output from** drop-down list to **Package Manager**.\r\n\r\nIf you're not using Visual Studio, open a command line and change to your project directory. Execute the `dotnet restore` command to restore the updated dependencies.\r\n\r\nNow recompile your application. If after recompilation you see a *Dependency conflict warning*, you must update your other direct dependencies to versions that take a dependency on the updated package.\r\n\r\n#### <a name=\"transitive-dependencies\"></a>Fixing transitive dependencies\r\n\r\nIf your transitive dependency review found references to the [vulnerable package](#affected-software), you must add a direct dependency to the updated package to your *csproj* file to override the transitive dependency.\r\n\r\nOpen *projectname.csproj* in your editor. If you're using Visual Studio, right-click the project and choose **Edit projectname.csproj** from the context menu, where projectname is the name of your project.\r\nLook for `PackageReference` nodes, for example:\r\n\r\n```xml\r\n<Project Sdk=\"Microsoft.NET.Sdk.\">\r\n  <PropertyGroup>\r\n    <TargetFramework>net461</TargetFramework>\r\n  </PropertyGroup>\r\n  <ItemGroup>\r\n    <PackageReference Include=\"ThirdParty.NotUpdatedYet\" Version=\"2.0.0\" />\r\n  </ItemGroup>\r\n</Project>\r\n```\r\n\r\nYou must add a direct dependency to the updated version of the [vulnerable package](#affected-software) by adding it to the *csproj* file.\r\nYou do this by adding a new line to the dependencies section, referencing the fixed version.\r\nFor example, if your search showed a transitive reference to a vulnerable `System.ServiceModel.Http` version, you'd add a reference to the [fixed package number](#affected-software).\r\n\r\n```xml\r\n<Project Sdk=\"Microsoft.NET.Sdk.Web\">\r\n  <PropertyGroup>\r\n    <TargetFramework>net461</TargetFramework>\r\n  </PropertyGroup>\r\n  <ItemGroup>\r\n    <PackageReference Include=\"System.IO.Pipelines\" Version=\"4.5.1\" />\r\n    <PackageReference Include=\"ThirdParty.NotUpdatedYet\" Version=\"2.0.0\" />\r\n  </ItemGroup>\r\n</Project>\r\n```\r\n\r\nAfter you've added the direct dependency reference, save your *csproj* file.\r\n\r\nIf you're using Visual Studio, save your updated *csproj* file and Visual Studio will restore the new package versions.\r\nYou can see the restore results by opening the **Output** window (Ctrl+Alt+O) and changing the **Show output from** drop-down list to **Package Manager**.\r\n\r\nIf you're not using Visual Studio, open a command line and change to your project directory. Execute the `dotnet restore` command to restore the new dependencies.\r\n\r\n#### Rebuilding your application\r\n\r\nFinally you must rebuild your application, test, and redeploy.\r\n\r\n## Other Information\r\n\r\n### Reporting Security Issues\r\n\r\nIf you have found a potential security issue in .NET Core, please email details to secure@microsoft.com.

This feature is on by default and allows build time verification of the correctness of Razor files, and also faster startup performance. Additionally, MVC watches for changes to cshtml files and seamlessly updates build-time compiled views with runtime compiled views. This allows editing cshtml files and then refreshing the browser to see the changes.\r\n\r\nMVC uses the app's compilation context, details about the references and settings that were used to compile the source code (.cs) in the app, to compile views at runtime. In addition to the compilation context, MVC exposes options such as [RazorViewEngineOptions.CompilationCallback](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/api/microsoft.aspnetcore.mvc.razor.razorviewengineoptions.compilationcallback?view=aspnetcore-2.1) and [AdditionalCompilationReferences](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/api/microsoft.aspnetcore.mvc.razor.razorviewengineoptions.additionalcompilationreferences?view=aspnetcore-2.1) that allow configuring compilation specifically for runtime. \r\n\r\nRuntime specific customizations are unavailable at build time and consequently the two outputs could be different.\r\n\r\nTo address this inconsistency, we plan on removing APIs in MVC that change or modify runtime compilation. For 2.2.0, we're marking these APIs obsolete with the intent to remove them in 3.0.0. This is the list of affected APIs:\r\n\r\n* Properties on `Microsoft.AspNetCore.Mvc.Razor.RazorViewEngineOptions`\r\n    * `AdditionalCompilationReferences`\r\n    * `CompilationCallback`\r\n\r\n* `Microsoft.AspNetCore.Mvc.Razor.Compilation.MetadataReferenceFeature`\r\n* `Microsoft.AspNetCore.Mvc.Razor.Compilation.MetadataReferenceFeatureProvider`\r\n* `Microsoft.AspNetCore.Mvc.Razor.Compilation.RazorReferenceManager`\r\n\r\nNo changes are required to your application if it does not use these APIs.\r\n\r\nApps using these APIs to add assembly references to the compilation context for runtime compilation should instead use [`ApplicationPartManager.AddApplicationPart`](https://docs.microsoft.com/dotnet/api/microsoft.extensions.dependencyinjection.mvccoremvccorebuilderextensions.addapplicationpart) to add application parts for each assembly reference, or switch to a built-time compilation model (see [Create reusable UI using the Razor Class Library project](https://docs.microsoft.com/aspnet/core/razor-pages/ui-class)).\r\n\r\nOther scenarios blocked by the removal of these APIs and not covered by alternative MVC features should raised in the linked discussion issue.\r\n\r\nFor discussion, use https://github.com/aspnet/Mvc/issues/8177","Url":"https://github.com/aspnet/Announcements/issues/312","RelatedDescription":"Open issue \"Razor compilation APIs exposing Roslyn types being obsoleted in 2.2.0 and removed in 3.0.0\" (#312)"},{"Id":"339929062","IsPullRequest":false,"CreatedAt":"2018-07-10T17:00:26","Actor":"blowdart","Number":"311","RawContent":null,"Title":"Microsoft Security Advisory ASPNETCore-July18: ASP.NET Core Denial Of Service Vulnerability","State":"open","Body":"# Microsoft Security Advisory ASPNETCore-July18: ASP.NET Core Denial Of Service Vulnerability\r\n\r\n## <a name=\"executive-summary\"></a>Executive summary\r\n\r\nMicrosoft is releasing this security advisory to provide information about a vulnerability in ASP.NET Core 2.0 and 2.1.

When you add a dependency on `Microsoft.AspNetCore.Mvc` in your project, you're taking a transitive dependency on `Microsoft.AspNetCore.Mvc.Core`.\r\n\r\nAny application that has a direct or transitive dependency on the [affected package](#affected-software) can be exposed to the vulnerability if it does not meet any of the [mitigation factors](#mitigation-factors).\r\n\r\n### <a name=\"how-fix\"></a>How do I fix the issue?\r\n\r\n### ASP.NET Core 2.1\r\n\r\nTo update ASP.NET Core 2.1 you should [download](https://www.microsoft.com/net/download) and install the .NET Core SDK 2.1.302 on your development machines and build servers, and the .NET Core Runtime 2.1.2 on your deployment servers. Your application will roll forward to these versions on an application restart.\r\n\r\n### ASP.NET Core 2.0\r\n\r\nIf you're targeting ASP.NET Core 2.0 and using the `Microsoft.AspNetCore.All` metapackage update its version number to 2.0.9 to update the `Microsoft.AspNetCore.Server.Kestrel.Core` package, recompile, and redeploy. On your deployment servers, you should [download](https://github.com/dotnet/core/blob/master/release-notes/download-archives/2.0.9-download.md) and install the .NET Core 2.0.9 using the Windows Server Hosting Bundle for Windows and the `dotnet-hosting-2.0.9` package for Linux servers.\r\n\r\n### ASP.NET 2.0 & 2.1 not targeting the meta-packages\r\n\r\n.NET Core projects have two types of dependencies: direct and transitive. You must update your projects using the following instructions to address both types of dependency.\r\n\r\n#### Direct dependencies\r\n\r\nDirect dependencies are discoverable by examining your `csproj` file. They can be fixed by [editing the project file](#direct-dependencies) or using NuGet to update the dependency.\r\n\r\n#### Transitive dependencies\r\n\r\nTransitive dependencies occur when you add a package to your project that in turn relies on another package. For example, if Contoso publishes a package `Contoso.Utility` which, in turn, depends on `Contoso.Internals` and you add the `Contoso.Utility` package to your project now your project has a direct dependency on `Contoso.Utility` and, because `Contoso.Utility` depends 'Contoso.Internals', your application gains a transitive dependency on the `Contoso.Internals` package.\r\n\r\nTransitive dependencies are reviewable in three ways, depending on your [project format](#project-format):\r\n\r\n* In the Visual Studio Solution Explorer window, which supports searching.\r\n* By examining the `project.assets.json` file contained in the obj directory of your project for `csproj` based projects.\r\n\r\nThe `project.assets.json`files are the authoritative list of all packages used by your project, containing both direct and transitive dependencies.\r\n\r\n#### <a name=\"direct-dependencies-vs2017\"></a>Fixing direct dependencies in Visual Studio 2017\r\n\r\nOpen *projectname.csproj* in your editor. If you're using Visual Studio, right-click the project and choose **Edit projectname.csproj** from the context menu, where projectname is the name of your project. Look for `PackageReference` elements. The following shows an example project file:\r\n\r\n```xml\r\n<Project Sdk=\"Microsoft.NET.Sdk.Web\">\r\n  <PropertyGroup>\r\n    <TargetFramework>netcoreapp2.0</TargetFramework>\r\n  </PropertyGroup>\r\n  <ItemGroup>\r\n    <PackageReference Include=\"Microsoft.AspNetCore.All\" Version=\"2.0.8\" />\r\n  </ItemGroup>\r\n</Project>\r\n```\r\n\r\nThe preceding example has a reference to the [vulnerable package](#affected-software), as seen by the single `PackageReference` element. The name of the package is in the `Include` attribute.\r\nThe package version number is in the `Version` attribute. The previous example shows a single direct dependency on `Microsoft.AspNetCore.All` version 2.0.0.\r\n\r\nTo update the version to the secure package, change the version number to the updated package version as listed on the table [previously](#affected-software).\r\nIn this example, update `Microsoft.AspNetCore.All` to the appropriate [fixed package number](#affected-software) for your major version. Save the *csproj* file. The example *csproj* now looks as follows:\r\n\r\n```xml\r\n<Project Sdk=\"Microsoft.NET.Sdk.Web\">\r\n  <PropertyGroup>\r\n    <TargetFramework>netcoreapp2.0</TargetFramework>\r\n  </PropertyGroup>\r\n  <ItemGroup>\r\n    <PackageReference Include=\"Microsoft.AspNetCore.All\" Version=\"2.0.9\" />\r\n  </ItemGroup>\r\n</Project>\r\n```\r\n\r\nIf you're using Visual Studio and you save your updated *csproj* file, Visual Studio will restore the new package version.\r\nYou can see the restore results by opening the **Output** window (Ctrl+Alt+O) and changing the **Show output from** drop-down list to **Package Manager**.\r\n\r\nIf you're not using Visual Studio, open a command line and change to your project directory. Execute the `dotnet restore` command to restore the updated dependencies.\r\n\r\nNow recompile your application. If after recompilation you see a *Dependency conflict warning*, you must update your other direct dependencies to versions that take a dependency on the updated package.\r\n\r\n#### Discovering and fixing transitive dependencies\r\n\r\nThere are two ways to view transitive dependencies. You can either [use Visual Studio’s Solution Explorer](#vs-solution-explorer), or you can review [the `project.assets.json` file](#project-assets-json) .\r\n\r\n##### <a name=\"vs-solution-explorer\"></a>Using Visual Studio Solution Explorer\r\n\r\nTo use Solution Explorer, open the project in Visual Studio, and then press Ctrl+; to activate the search in Solution Explorer. Search for the [vulnerable package](#affected-software) and make a note of the version numbers of any results you find.\r\n\r\nFor example, searching for `Microsoft.AspNetCore.Mvc.Core` in an example project that contains a package that takes a dependency on `Microsoft.AspNetCore.Mvc` shows the following results in Visual Studio 2017:\r\n\r\n![Screenshot of search results in Visual Studio 2017](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/796298/25858816/8ecdc2b4-3491-11e7-9363-746804bb9832.png)\r\n\r\nThe search results appear as a tree. In the previous results, you can see that a reference to `Microsoft.AspNetCore.Mvc.Core` version 1.1.2 is discovered.\r\n\r\nUnder the Dependencies node is a NuGet node. Under the NuGet node is the list of packages you have directly taken a dependency on and their versions.\r\nIn screenshot, the application takes a direct dependency on `Microsoft.AspNetCore.Mvc`. `Microsoft.AspNetCore.Mvc` in turn has leaf nodes that list its dependencies and their versions.\r\nThe `Microsoft.AspNetCore.Mvc` package takes a dependency on a version of `Microsoft.AspNetCore.Mvc.ApiExplorer`, that in turn takes a dependency on a version of `Microsoft.AspNetCore.Mvc.Core`.\r\n\r\n##### <a name=\"project-assets-json\"></a> Manually reviewing project.assets.json\r\n\r\nOpen the *project.assets.json* file from your project’s obj directory in your editor. We suggest you use an editor that understands JSON and allows you to collapse and expand nodes to review this file.\r\nVisual Studio and Visual Studio Code provide JSON friendly editing.\r\n\r\nSearch the *project.assets.json* file for the [vulnerable package](#affected-software), using the format `packagename/` for each of the package names from the preceding table. If you find the assembly name in your search:\r\n\r\n* Examine the line on which they are found, the version number is after the `/`.\r\n* Compare to the [vulnerable versions table](#affected-software).\r\n\r\nFor example, a search result that shows `Microsoft.AspNetCore.Server.Kestrel.Core/2.0.0` is a reference to version 2.0.0 of `Microsoft.AspNetCore.Server.Kestrel.Core`.\r\nIf your *project.assets.json* file includes references to the [vulnerable package](#affected-software), then you need to fix the transitive dependencies.\r\n\r\nIf you have not found any reference to any vulnerable packages, this means either\r\n\r\n* None of your direct dependencies depend on any vulnerable packages, or\r\n* You have already fixed the problem by updating the direct dependencies.\r\n\r\nIf your transitive dependency review found references to the [vulnerable package](#affected-software), you must add a direct dependency to the updated package to your *csproj* file to override the transitive dependency.\r\n\r\nOpen *projectname.csproj* in your editor. If you're using Visual Studio, right-click the project and choose **Edit projectname.csproj** from the context menu, where projectname is the name of your project.\r\nLook for `PackageReference` nodes, for example:\r\n\r\n```xml\r\n<Project Sdk=\"Microsoft.NET.Sdk.\">\r\n  <PropertyGroup>\r\n    <TargetFramework>net461</TargetFramework>\r\n  </PropertyGroup>\r\n  <ItemGroup>\r\n    <PackageReference Include=\"ThirdParty.NotUpdatedYet\" Version=\"2.0.0\" />\r\n  </ItemGroup>\r\n</Project>\r\n```\r\n\r\nYou must add a direct dependency to the updated version of the [vulnerable package](#affected-software) by adding it to the *csproj* file.\r\nYou do this by adding a new line to the dependencies section, referencing the fixed version.\r\nFor example, if your search showed a transitive reference to a vulnerable `Microsoft.AspNetCore.Server.Kestrel.Core` version, you'd add a reference to the [fixed package number](#affected-software).\r\n\r\n```xml\r\n<Project Sdk=\"Microsoft.NET.Sdk.Web\">\r\n  <PropertyGroup>\r\n    <TargetFramework>net461</TargetFramework>\r\n  </PropertyGroup>\r\n  <ItemGroup>\r\n    <PackageReference Include=\"Microsoft.AspNetCore.Server.Kestrel.Core\" Version=\"2.0.34 />\r\n    <PackageReference Include=\"ThirdParty.NotUpdatedYet\" Version=\"2.0.0\" />\r\n  </ItemGroup>\r\n</Project>\r\n```\r\n\r\nAfter you've added the direct dependency reference, save your *csproj* file.\r\n\r\nIf you're using Visual Studio, save your updated *csproj* file and Visual Studio will restore the new package versions.\r\nYou can see the restore results by opening the **Output** window (Ctrl+Alt+O) and changing the **Show output from** drop-down list to **Package Manager**.\r\n\r\nIf you're not using Visual Studio, open a command line and change to your project directory. Execute the `dotnet restore` command to restore the new dependencies.\r\n\r\n#### Rebuilding your application\r\n\r\nFinally you must rebuild your application, test, and redeploy.\r\n\r\n## Other Information\r\n\r\n### Reporting Security Issues\r\n\r\nIf you have found a potential security issue in .NET Core, please email details to secure@microsoft.com.

Direct dependencies are dependencies where you specifically add a package to your project, transitive dependencies occur when you add a package to your project that in turn relies on another package.\r\n\r\nFor example, the `Microsoft.AspNetCore.Mvc` package depends on the `Microsoft.AspNetCore.Mvc.Core` package. When you add a dependency on `Microsoft.AspNetCore.Mvc` in your project, you're taking a transitive dependency on `Microsoft.AspNetCore.Mvc.Core`.\r\n\r\nAny application that has a direct or transitive dependency on the [affected package](#affected-software) can be exposed to the vulnerability if it does not meet any of the [mitigation factors](#mitigation-factors).\r\n\r\n### <a name=\"how-fix\"></a>How do I fix the issue?\r\n\r\n### ASP.NET Core 2.1\r\n\r\nTo update ASP.NET Core 2.1 you should [download](https://www.microsoft.com/net/download) and install the .NET Core SDK 2.1.302 on your development machines and build servers, and the .NET Core Runtime 2.1.2 on your deployment servers. Your application will roll forward to these versions on an application restart.\r\n\r\n### ASP.NET Core 2.0\r\n\r\nIf you're targeting ASP.NET Core 2.0 and using the `Microsoft.AspNetCore.All` metapackage update its version number to 2.0.9 to update the `Microsoft.AspNetCore.Identity` package, recompile, and redeploy. On your deployment servers, you should [download](https://github.com/dotnet/core/blob/master/release-notes/download-archives/2.0.9-download.md) and install the .NET Core 2.0.9 using the Windows Server Hosting Bundle for Windows and the `dotnet-hosting-2.0.9` package for Linux servers.\r\n\r\n### ASP.NET Core 1.0, 1.1 or 2.0 not targeting the metapackage.\r\n\r\n.NET Core projects have two types of dependencies: direct and transitive. You must update your projects using the following instructions to address both types of dependency.\r\n\r\n### <a name=\"project-format\"></a>.NET Core Project formats\r\n\r\n.NET Core has two different project file formats, depending on what software created the project.\r\n\r\n1. `project.json` is the format used in .NET Core 1.0 and Microsoft Visual Studio 2015.\r\n2. `csproj` is the format used in .NET Core 1.1, .NET Core 2.0 and Microsoft Visual Studio 2017.\r\n\r\n#### Direct dependencies\r\n\r\nDirect dependencies are discoverable by examining your `csproj` file or your `project.json` file. They can be fixed by [editing the project file](#direct-dependencies) or using NuGet to update the dependency.\r\n\r\n#### Transitive dependencies\r\n\r\nTransitive dependencies occur when you add a package to your project that in turn relies on another package. For example, if Contoso publishes a package `Contoso.Utility` which, in turn, depends on `Contoso.Internals` and you add the `Contoso.Utility` package to your project now your project has a direct dependency on `Contoso.Utility` and, because `Contoso.Utility` depends 'Contoso.Internals', your application gains a transitive dependency on the `Contoso.Internals` package.\r\n\r\nTransitive dependencies are reviewable in three ways, depending on your [project format](#project-format):\r\n\r\n* In the Visual Studio Solution Explorer window, which supports searching.\r\n* By examining the `project.assets.json` file contained in the obj directory of your project for `csproj` based projects *OR*.\r\n* By examining the `project.lock.json` file contained in the root directory of your project for `project.json` based projects.\r\n\r\nThe `project.assets.json` and `project.lock.json` files are the authoritative list of all packages used by your project, containing both direct and transitive dependencies.\r\n\r\n#### <a name=\"direct-dependencies-vs2017\"></a>Fixing direct dependencies in a csproj based project / Visual Studio 2017\r\n\r\nOpen *projectname.csproj* in your editor. If you're using Visual Studio, right-click the project and choose **Edit projectname.csproj** from the context menu, where projectname is the name of your project. Look for `PackageReference` elements. The following shows an example project file:\r\n\r\n```xml\r\n<Project Sdk=\"Microsoft.NET.Sdk.Web\">\r\n  <PropertyGroup>\r\n    <TargetFramework>netcoreapp2.0</TargetFramework>\r\n  </PropertyGroup>\r\n  <ItemGroup>\r\n    <PackageReference Include=\"Microsoft.AspNetCore.Identity\" Version=\"2.0.0\" />\r\n  </ItemGroup>\r\n</Project>\r\n```\r\n\r\nThe preceding example has a reference to the [vulnerable package](#affected-software), as seen by the single `PackageReference` element. The name of the package is in the `Include` attribute.\r\nThe package version number is in the `Version` attribute. The previous example shows a single direct dependency on `Microsoft.AspNetCore.Identity` version 2.0.0.\r\n\r\nTo update the version to the secure package, change the version number to the updated package version as listed on the table [previously](#affected-software).\r\nIn this example, update `Microsoft.AspNetCore.Identity` to the appropriate [fixed package number](#affected-software) for your major version. Save the *csproj* file. The example *csproj* now looks as follows:\r\n\r\n```xml\r\n<Project Sdk=\"Microsoft.NET.Sdk.Web\">\r\n  <PropertyGroup>\r\n    <TargetFramework>netcoreapp2.0</TargetFramework>\r\n  </PropertyGroup>\r\n  <ItemGroup>\r\n    <PackageReference Include=\"Microsoft.AspNetCore.Identity\" Version=\"2.0.4\" />\r\n  </ItemGroup>\r\n</Project>\r\n```\r\n\r\nIf you're using Visual Studio and you save your updated *csproj* file, Visual Studio will restore the new package version.\r\nYou can see the restore results by opening the **Output** window (Ctrl+Alt+O) and changing the **Show output from** drop-down list to **Package Manager**.\r\n\r\nIf you're not using Visual Studio, open a command line and change to your project directory. Execute the `dotnet restore` command to restore the updated dependencies.\r\n\r\nNow recompile your application. If after recompilation you see a *Dependency conflict warning*, you must update your other direct dependencies to versions that take a dependency on the updated package.\r\n\r\n#### <a name=\"direct-dependencies-vs2015\"></a> Fixing Direct Dependencies in project.json based project / Visual Studio 2015\r\n\r\nOpen your `project.json` file in your editor. Look for the dependencies section. Below is an example dependencies section:\r\n\r\n``` json\r\n    \"dependencies\": {\r\n      \"Microsoft.NETCore.App\": {\r\n        \"version\": \"1.0.1\",\r\n        \"type\": \"platform\"\r\n      },\r\n     \"Microsoft.AspNetCore.Mvc.Core\": \"1.0.6\",\r\n     \"Microsoft.AspNetCore.Identity\" : \"1.0.5\"\r\n    }\r\n```\r\n\r\nThis example has three direct dependencies: `Microsoft.NETCore.App`, `Microsoft.AspNetCore.Mvc.Core` and `Microsoft.AspNetCore.Identity`.\r\n\r\n`Microsoft.NetCore.App` is the platform the application targets, you should ignore this. The other packages expose their version to the right of the package name. In our example, our non-platform packages are version 1.0.1.\r\n\r\nReview your direct dependencies for any instance of the packages and versions listed above. In the example above, there is a direct dependency on a vulnerable package, `Microsoft.AspNetCore.Identity` version 1.0.5.\r\n\r\nTo update to the fixed package, change the version number to be the appropriate package for your release. In the example, this would be updating `Microsoft.AspNetCore.Identity` to 1.0.6.\r\n\r\nAfter updating the vulnerable package versions, save your `project.json` file.\r\n\r\nThe dependencies section in our example `project.json` would now look as follows:\r\n\r\n```json\r\n  \"dependencies\": {\r\n    \"Microsoft.NETCore.App\": {\r\n      \"version\": \"1.0.1\",\r\n      \"type\": \"platform\"\r\n    },\r\n    \"Microsoft.AspNetCore.Mvc.Core\": \"1.0.6\",\r\n    \"Microsoft.AspNetCore.Identity \": \"1.0.6\"\r\n  }\r\n```\r\n\r\nIf you are using Visual Studio and save your updated `project.json` file, Visual Studio will restore the new package version. You can see the restore results by opening the Output Window (Ctrl+Alt+O) and changing the Show output from drop-down list to Package Manager.\r\n\r\nIf you are not using Visual Studio, open a command line and change to your project directory. Execute the `dotnet restore` command to restore your new dependency.\r\n\r\nAfter you have addressed all of your direct dependencies, you must also review your transitive dependencies.\r\n\r\nAfter you've addressed all of your direct dependencies, you must review your transitive dependencies.\r\n\r\n#### Discovering and fixing transitive dependencies\r\n\r\nThere are two ways to view transitive dependencies. You can either [use Visual Studio’s Solution Explorer](#vs-solution-explorer), or you can review [the `project.assets.json` file](#project-assets-json) or the [the `project.lock.json` file](#project-lock-json).\r\n\r\n##### <a name=\"vs-solution-explorer\"></a>Using Visual Studio Solution Explorer\r\n\r\nTo use Solution Explorer, open the project in Visual Studio, and then press Ctrl+; to activate the search in Solution Explorer. Search for the [vulnerable package](#affected-software) and make a note of the version numbers of any results you find.\r\n\r\nFor example, searching for `Microsoft.AspNetCore.Mvc.Core` in an example project that contains a package that takes a dependency on `Microsoft.AspNetCore.Mvc` shows the following results in Visual Studio 2017:\r\n\r\n![Screenshot of search results in Visual Studio 2017](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/796298/25858816/8ecdc2b4-3491-11e7-9363-746804bb9832.png)\r\n\r\nThe search results appear as a tree. In the previous results, you can see that a reference to `Microsoft.AspNetCore.Mvc.Core` version 1.1.2 is discovered.\r\n\r\nUnder the Dependencies node is a NuGet node. Under the NuGet node is the list of packages you have directly taken a dependency on and their versions.\r\nIn screenshot, the application takes a direct dependency on `Microsoft.AspNetCore.Mvc`. `Microsoft.AspNetCore.Mvc` in turn has leaf nodes that list its dependencies and their versions.\r\nThe `Microsoft.AspNetCore.Mvc` package takes a dependency on a version of `Microsoft.AspNetCore.Mvc.ApiExplorer`, that in turn takes a dependency on a version of `Microsoft.AspNetCore.Mvc.Core`.\r\n\r\n##### <a name=\"project-assets-json\"></a> Manually reviewing project.assets.json (csproj/VS2017)\r\n\r\nOpen the *project.assets.json* file from your project’s obj directory in your editor. We suggest you use an editor that understands JSON and allows you to collapse and expand nodes to review this file.\r\nVisual Studio and Visual Studio Code provide JSON friendly editing.\r\n\r\nSearch the *project.assets.json* file for the [vulnerable package](#affected-software), using the format `packagename/` for each of the package names from the preceding table. If you find the assembly name in your search:\r\n\r\n* Examine the line on which they are found, the version number is after the `/`.\r\n* Compare to the [vulnerable versions table](#affected-software).\r\n\r\nFor example, a search result that shows `Microsoft.AspNetCore.Identity/2.0.0` is a reference to version 2.0.0 of `Microsoft.AspNetCore.Identity`.\r\nIf your *project.assets.json* file includes references to the [vulnerable package](#affected-software), then you need to fix the transitive dependencies.\r\n\r\nIf you have not found any reference to any vulnerable packages, this means either\r\n\r\n* None of your direct dependencies depend on any vulnerable packages, or\r\n* You have already fixed the problem by updating the direct dependencies.\r\n\r\nIf your transitive dependency review found references to the [vulnerable package](#affected-software), you must add a direct dependency to the updated package to your *csproj* file to override the transitive dependency.\r\n\r\nOpen *projectname.csproj* in your editor. If you're using Visual Studio, right-click the project and choose **Edit projectname.csproj** from the context menu, where projectname is the name of your project.\r\nLook for `PackageReference` nodes, for example:\r\n\r\n```xml\r\n<Project Sdk=\"Microsoft.NET.Sdk.\">\r\n  <PropertyGroup>\r\n    <TargetFramework>net461</TargetFramework>\r\n  </PropertyGroup>\r\n  <ItemGroup>\r\n    <PackageReference Include=\"ThirdParty.NotUpdatedYet\" Version=\"2.0.0\" />\r\n  </ItemGroup>\r\n</Project>\r\n```\r\n\r\nYou must add a direct dependency to the updated version of the [vulnerable package](#affected-software) by adding it to the *csproj* file.\r\nYou do this by adding a new line to the dependencies section, referencing the fixed version.\r\nFor example, if your search showed a transitive reference to a vulnerable `Microsoft.AspNetCore.Identity` version, you'd add a reference to the [fixed package number](#affected-software).\r\n\r\n```xml\r\n<Project Sdk=\"Microsoft.NET.Sdk.Web\">\r\n  <PropertyGroup>\r\n    <TargetFramework>net461</TargetFramework>\r\n  </PropertyGroup>\r\n  <ItemGroup>\r\n    <PackageReference Include=\"Microsoft.AspNetCore.Identity\" Version=\"2.0.4\" />\r\n    <PackageReference Include=\"ThirdParty.NotUpdatedYet\" Version=\"2.0.0\" />\r\n  </ItemGroup>\r\n</Project>\r\n```\r\n\r\nAfter you've added the direct dependency reference, save your *csproj* file.\r\n\r\nIf you're using Visual Studio, save your updated *csproj* file and Visual Studio will restore the new package versions.\r\nYou can see the restore results by opening the **Output** window (Ctrl+Alt+O) and changing the **Show output from** drop-down list to **Package Manager**.\r\n\r\nIf you're not using Visual Studio, open a command line and change to your project directory. Execute the `dotnet restore` command to restore the new dependencies.\r\n\r\n##### <a name=\"project-lock-json\"></a> Manually reviewing project.lock.json (project.json/VS2015)\r\n\r\nOpen the `project.lock.json` file in your editor. We suggest you use an editor that understands json and allows you to collapse and expand nodes to review this file; both Visual Studio and Visual Studio Code provide this functionality.\r\n\r\nIf you are using Visual Studio the `project.lock.json` file is “under” the `project.json` file. Click the right pointing triangle, ▷, to the left of the `project.json` file to expand the solution tree to expose the `project.lock.json` file. The following image shows a project with the `project.json` file expanded to show the `project.lock.json` file.\r\n\r\n![project lock json](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/796298/25858179/f6e01200-348f-11e7-8a77-7176d8dd3f03.png)\r\n\r\nSearch the `project.lock.json` file for the vulnerable packages, using the format `packagename/`, using each of the package names from the table above. If you find any vulnerable assembly name in your search examine the line on which they are found, the version number is after the `/` and compare to the vulnerable versions table above. For example a search result that shows `Microsoft.AspNetCore.Identity/1.0.1` is a reference to v1.0.1 of `Microsoft.AspNetCore.Identity`.   If your `project.lock.json` file includes references to any of the package versions shown above then you will need to fix the transitive dependencies.\r\n\r\nIf you have not found any reference to a vulnerable version of  `Microsoft.AspNetCore.Identity` this means none of your direct dependencies depend on any vulnerable packages or you have already fixed the problem by updating the direct dependencies.\r\n\r\nIf your transitive dependency review found references to any of the vulnerable packages you must add a direct dependency to the updated package to your `project.json` file to override the transitive dependency. Open your `project.json` and find the dependencies section. For example:\r\n\r\n``` json\r\n  \"dependencies\": {\r\n    \"Microsoft.NETCore.App\": {\r\n      \"version\": \"1.0.1\",\r\n      \"type\": \"platform\"\r\n    },\r\n    \"Microsoft.AspNetCore.Mvc\": \"1.0.0\"\r\n  }\r\n```\r\n\r\nFor each of the vulnerable packages your search returned you must add a direct dependency to the updated version by adding it to the `project.json` file. You do this by adding a new line to the dependencies section, referring the fixed version. For example, if your search showed a transitive reference to the vulnerable `Microsoft.AspNetCore.Identity` version 1.0.0 you would add a reference to the appropriate fixed version, 1.0.6. Edit the `project.json` file as follows:\r\n\r\n``` json\r\n  \"dependencies\": {\r\n    \"Microsoft.NETCore.App\": {\r\n      \"version\": \"1.0.1\",\r\n      \"type\": \"platform\"\r\n    },\r\n    \"Microsoft.AspNetCore.Identity\": \"1.0.6\",\r\n    \"Microsoft.AspNetCore.Mvc\": \"1.0.0\"\r\n  }\r\n```\r\n\r\nAfter you have added direct dependencies to the fixed packages, save your `project.json` file.\r\n\r\nIf you are using Visual Studio save your updated `project.json` file and Visual Studio will restore the new package versions. You can see the restore results by opening the Output Window (Ctrl+Alt+O) and changing the Show output from drop-down list to Package Manager.\r\n\r\nIf you are not using Visual Studio open a command line and change to your project directory. Execute the `dotnet restore` command to restore your new dependencies.\r\n\r\n#### Rebuilding your application\r\n\r\nFinally you must rebuild your application, test, and redeploy.\r\n\r\n## Other Information\r\n\r\n### Reporting Security Issues\r\n\r\nIf you have found a potential security issue in .NET Core, please email details to secure@microsoft.com.

We are concentrating most of our efforts to add new functionality on the 3.0 release. Still, you can expect 2.2 to include lots of bugs fixes, community contributions and small improvements.\r\n\r\nYou can access the list of issues currently assigned to the 2.2 milestone using [this query](https://github.com/aspnet/EntityFrameworkCore/issues?q=is%3Aopen+is%3Aissue+milestone%3A2.2.0+sort%3Areactions-%2B1-desc) on our issue tracking system.  \r\n\r\n## Schedule\r\nThe schedule of EF Core 2.2 will align with the schedule of .NET Core and ASP.NET Core 2.2. See [the ASP.NET Core 2.2 Roadmap announcement](https://github.com/aspnet/Announcements/issues/307).\r\n\r\nOur current plan is to have three previews before we ship RTM near the end of 2018:\r\n\r\n- August – Preview 1\r\n- September - Preview 2\r\n- October - Preview 3\r\n- Before end-of-year – RTM\r\n\r\n As usual, this post reflects our current plan, but things may change as we make progress. \r\n\r\n## New features\r\n\r\n### Reverse engineering of database views into query types\r\n\r\nIn EF Core 2.1 we added query types, which allow mapping .NET objects to views and tables without keys. In 2.2, we plan to leverage this new capability to automatically map existing database views to query types. \r\n\r\nYou can track the progress of this at https://github.com/aspnet/EntityFrameworkCore/issues/1679.\r\n\r\n###  Support for collections of owned entities\r\n\r\nIn EF Core 2.0 we added the concept of owned entity types, which allows modeling ownership relationship that are common between entities that are part of the same document in document-oriented databases or the same aggregate if you use Domain-Driven Design concepts in your model.\r\n\r\nUntil now, we only support reference navigation properties to owned entities. In EF Core 2.2, we plan to enhance this functionality to map collection navigation properties to owned entities. \r\n\r\nYou can track the progress of this at https://github.com/aspnet/EntityFrameworkCore/issues/8172.\r\n\r\n## Other work\r\n\r\nThere are some additional work items that are not strictly EF Core 2.2 features, but we still track as part of the 2.2 milestone because we are doing the work in the same timeframe:\r\n\r\n### Cosmos DB provider\r\n\r\nA lot of our efforts are going into productizing an EF Core provider for the SQL API in Cosmos DB.\r\nWe have already created a prototype, which we have shown in demos such as in this [this EF Core 2.1 talk](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k55kDH_ixrQ) we did at the Microsoft Build conference.\r\n\r\nDue to competing priorities, releasing a preview of this provider has taken more than what we originally planned, but we are working on it now, and the current plan is to release a stable version by the end of this calendar year.\r\n\r\nYou can track our progress on this issue: https://github.com/aspnet/EntityFrameworkCore/issues/12086. \r\n\r\n### Preview of spatial support for SQL Server\r\n\r\nWe are also focusing on adding spatial support as an extension to the SQL Server provider for EF Core.\r\nNote that the PostgreSQL provider (Npgsql) already added support in EF Core 2.1. Beside implementing this functionality for SQL Server, we are working closely with the developers of Npgsql to try to achieve a consistent and hopefully improved experience across providers.\r\n\r\nNote that we aren't committing to having a final version of the spatial support for the end of the current calendar year. But we are actively working on this now, and as we make progress, we should be able to provide a more precise estimate.   \r\n\r\nYou can track our progress on this issue: https://github.com/aspnet/EntityFrameworkCore/issues/1100.\r\n\r\n### Improve test coverage for LINQ and reduce query regressions in future releases\r\n\r\nIn the last few releases, we have seen that when we commit improvements to our LINQ implementation, we often break queries that were previously working. The main challenge is that LINQ defines a huge space of possible queries to test, and it is very complex to measure what level of test coverage we have, even for a specific query operator. In the 2.2 timeframe, we will be investing on improving test coverage for this huge space. We also plan to experiment with new approaches to add appropriate coverage, and to reduce the likelihood of introducing regressions in future releases.\r\n\r\nYou can track our progress on this at https://github.com/aspnet/EntityFrameworkCore/issues/12046. \r\n\r\nFor discussion on this roadmap, please use https://github.com/aspnet/EntityFrameworkCore/issues/12465. ","Url":"https://github.com/aspnet/Announcements/issues/308","RelatedDescription":"Open issue \"EF Core 2.2 Roadmap\" (#308)"},{"Id":"335571873","IsPullRequest":false,"CreatedAt":"2018-06-25T21:19:36","Actor":"glennc","Number":"307","RawContent":null,"Title":"ASP.NET Core 2.2 Roadmap","State":"open","Body":"We have grouped the ASP.NET Core 2.2 release into a few themes:\r\n\r\n- APIs & Services\r\n- Server improvements\r\n- SignalR\r\n\r\n## Rough Schedule\r\nWe are currently planning to have 3 previews before RTM:\r\n - August – Preview 1\r\n - September - Preview 2\r\n - October - Preview 3\r\n - Before End-of-year – RTM\r\n\r\nAs with our previous roadmap posts this is what we intend right now, but it's subject to change as we continue development.\r\n\r\n## APIs and Services\r\n\r\nThe 'north star' for this version is to generate better metadata about your app and use that data to make your dev experience better and more productive. This is the main focus for 2.2.\r\n\r\n### API Controller conventions\r\nIn 2.1 we added controller specific conventions that make Web API development more convenient with the [ApiController attribute](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/aspnet/core/web-api/index?view=aspnetcore-2.1#annotate-class-with-apicontrollerattribute). In 2.2 we want to expand on this concept to provide metadata for API Explorer and provide a better end-to-end API documentation experience.\r\n\r\nWe want to make it possible for all MVC Core applications to have a good Swagger/OpenAPI definition by default. By following common patterns, your actions will produce rich metadata without falling into 'attribute soup' where you list every possible status code that every action in your app could return. We will include a default set of conventions that match what ASP.NET Core scaffolding generations. It will also be possible to write and share your own conventions to reflect your desired contracts. \r\n\r\nWe will include a set of analyzers that will help you find cases where code that doesn't match the API Explorer metadata, and a code-fix that provides options to explicitly specify the response type metadata, create a new convention with a different pattern, or just let you write code to satisfy the convention.\r\n\r\nAs a concrete example, you could write a convention that says \"every action method that starts with 'Create' will return an HTTP 201\". If you wrote the following code, then you would receive a warning.\r\n\r\n```csharp\r\n[HttpPost(\"/orders\")]\r\npublic ActionResult<Order> CreateOrder(OrderData orderData)\r\n{\r\n    ....\r\n    return Ok(new Order() {...});\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nThis code doesn't match your Swagger/OpenAPI metadata (from the convention) - which says that this action returns a 201. Once you see this, you could `ctrl + .` to add the attributes for what we do know about this method, opting out of conventions, or you could change the code.\r\n\r\nThe analyzer will also be able to 'check your work' if you are being explicit about status codes and results using the existing attributes - it does not require you to use the conventions. Details for how this will all work can be discussed here: https://github.com/aspnet/Mvc/issues/7802\r\n\r\nLet's look at a more fleshed-out out example. The following code snippet is what is required to generate a reasonable Open API document for an action method that will get an item by ID or return a 404:\r\n\r\n```csharp\r\n[ApiController]\r\npublic class CatalogController : ControllerBase\r\n{\r\n    [HttpGet]\r\n    [Route(\"items/{id:int}\")]\r\n    [ProducesResponseType((int)HttpStatusCode.NotFound)]\r\n    [ProducesResponseType(typeof(CatalogItem),(int)HttpStatusCode.OK)]\r\n    public async Task<ActionResult<CatalogItem>> GetItemById(int id)\r\n    {\r\n    }\r\n    ...\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nIn 2.2 with the default conventions the following code should generate the same Open API document that the above code sample does, and this shipped analyzers will give you hints when you do something that doesn't match so you know to go and add attributes or change the conventions:\r\n\r\n```csharp\r\n[ApiController]\r\npublic class CatalogController : ControllerBase\r\n{\r\n    [HttpGet]\r\n    [Route(\"items/{id:int}\")]\r\n    public async Task<ActionResult<CatalogItem>> GetItemById(int id)\r\n    {\r\n    }\r\n    ...\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\n### OpenAPI generation\r\nWith the conventions described above it will be possible for code that uses the API Explorer to generate Open API documents to be better by default, since the code you write will either follow the conventions or have attributes allowing generators to create better documents.\r\n\r\n### Dispatcher\r\nIn 2.2 we will introduce a new routing system that will expand the set of scenarios where routing is useful – tentatively called Dispatcher. \r\n\r\nThe current routing system was designed to support MVC’s historical scenarios without much thought to how routing and the composable middleware pipeline will work together. The Dispatcher is designed to run the URL matching step very early in the pipeline so that middleware can see the Endpoint that was selected as well as metadata that is associated with that endpoint. Like existing routing, the dispatcher will branch and call the actual endpoint at the end of the pipeline.\r\n\r\nA concrete example of how this helps us is with CORS. Today there is both a CORS middleware AND a CORS feature of MVC (https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/aspnet/core/security/cors?view=aspnetcore-2.1). Because routing information is deeply integrated with MVC we can't apply CORS policies that only apply to specific controllers until after we know what controller has been selected. However, if you also want CORS policies to apply to other parts of your pipeline then you need the middleware. This has been a source of confusion for many and we can simplify it if all of the middleware pipeline can have as much information about routing as MVC does today.\r\n\r\nWe’re also using this opportunity to make improvements to the performance of routing and dispatching for MVC and other scenarios.\r\n\r\n### HTTP API REPL tooling\r\nToday there are no tools built into Visual Studio or the dotnet CLI to help you execute HTTP verbs against your API. We have a great language, debugger, and framework but they are somewhat limited when it's difficult to send a POST to my app to see what happens. In 2.2 we want to build a CLI experience for exploring HTTP APIs to imcrease your API inner loop productivity. The CLI builds on all the features we've talked about above as some of its advanced features, like listing all routes in your app, are enabled by consuming the metadata we have about your app via Open API documents. That means the CLI should be useful for executing any HTTP verb, but really shines when you feed it more data like Open API docs. We intend to start by shipping this as a standalone global tool while we explore its feature set and potential.\r\n\r\nYou can see a demo and description of this in Scott Hunter and Scott Hanselman's BUILD talk here: https://youtu.be/KAIJ3ezQb3c?t=18m\r\n\r\n### API client generation (C# & TypeScript)\r\nOnce you have an API with rich metadata and done exploring and testing it, then you need to go and write some client code to call and make use of your API. We are going to build an experience for generating this code based on the same data and documentation described above. We envision a few pieces for this story, one part is a dotnet tool that can generate code from an Open API document, the other is MSBuild SDK work to allow a `ServiceReference` to another project in a solution. That reference will cause build time client code generation to happen via the tool that can generate code. We expect this to work in a similar way to the EF Core tooling experience, where your application is built and most of your startup code executed but instead of running it we use the data we have about your code to generate a client.\r\n\r\n### Authorization Server\r\nOne of the largest gaps we’ve had has been around authorization for applications beyond a simple forms based login. We plan to fill that gap with a simple to use OpenID Connect based authorization server, which will allow your ASP.NET application to act as an authentication point for your projects, be they web site to API, SPA to API, native application to an API or, for distributed applications API to API. As we are concentrating on first party applications we can make the code you need to plumb in trivial, getting as close to zero configuration as you can,  we’re not aiming to replace the excellent third-party solutions out there which enable richer scenarios like third-party applications or which provide a flexibility in configuration and authentication flow.\r\n\r\n## Server Improvements\r\n\r\n### Health Checks\r\nThis feature is a way to trivially setup an endpoint in your application that can be used to check the health of your application, potentially taking into account things like memory consumption or database availability as well as just \"can I accept a HTTP request\".\r\n\r\n### HTTP/2 in Kestrel & HttpClient\r\nThe title says it all in this case. HTTP/2 support for all. We started this work some time ago, and have had the protocol mostly implemented for a while but not compiled into the product since it wasn't ready. This version we will finish that work and implement the missing features.\r\n\r\n### In-proc ANCM\r\nRunning ASP.NET Core applications in-process in IIS, giving a significant performance boost.\r\n\r\n## SignalR\r\n\r\n### Add Java & C++ clients\r\nAllow customers using Java or C++ to connect to SignalR servers, and the [Azure SignalR Service](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/blog/azure-signalr-service-a-fully-managed-service-to-add-real-time-functionality/).\r\n\r\n## Other\r\nAs with all releases there is a large tail of bug fixes, performance improvements, small features, and community PRs that we will also work on. You can see the full list of work by browsing the 2.2 milestones on the various [repositories](https://github.com/aspnet/).\r\n\r\nFor discussion on the roadmap in general, use https://github.com/aspnet/Home/issues/3265","Url":"https://github.com/aspnet/Announcements/issues/307","RelatedDescription":"Open issue \"ASP.NET Core 2.2 Roadmap\" (#307)"},{"Id":"333804954","IsPullRequest":false,"CreatedAt":"2018-06-19T19:21:13","Actor":"anurse","Number":"306","RawContent":null,"Title":"SignalR Client 2.1.1 in UWP apps with Minimum Version of 1803","State":"open","Body":"ASP.NET Core 2.1.1 contains fixes to resolve blocking issues when using the SignalR Client from UWP applications where the minimum version is set to \"Windows 10, version 1803\".

Direct dependencies are dependencies where you specifically add a package to your project, transitive dependencies occur when you add a package to your project that in turn relies on another package.\r\n\r\nFor example, the `Microsoft.AspNetCore.Mvc` package depends on the `Microsoft.AspNetCore.Mvc.Core` package. When you add a dependency on `Microsoft.AspNetCore.Mvc` in your project, you're taking a transitive dependency on `Microsoft.AspNetCore.Mvc.Core`.\r\n\r\nAny application that has a direct or transitive dependency on the [affected packages](#affected-software) can be exposed to the vulnerability.\r\n\r\n### How do I fix the issue?\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\nIf you're targeting .NET Core 2.x and the `Microsoft.AspNetCore.All` \"metapackage\":\r\n\r\n* Update its version number to 2.0.8 if you have targetted 2.0.x *OR*\r\n* Update its version number to 2.1.0-rc1-final if you have targetted previews of 2.1\r\n\r\nUpdating the metapackage will update the [affected packages](#affected-software)\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n.NET Core projects have two types of dependencies: direct and transitive. You must update your projects using the following instructions to address both types of dependency.\r\n\r\n#### Direct dependencies\r\n\r\nDirect dependencies are discoverable by examining your *csproj* file. They can be fixed by [editing the csproj file](#direct-dependencies) or using NuGet to update the dependency.\r\n\r\n#### Transitive dependencies\r\n\r\nTransitive dependencies occur when you add a package to your project that in turn relies on another package. For example, if Contoso publishes a package `Contoso.Utility` which, in turn, depends on `Contoso.Internals` and you add the `Contoso.Utility` package to your project now your project has a direct dependency on `Contoso.Utility` and, because `Contoso.Utility` depends 'Contoso.Internals', your application gains a transitive dependency on the `Contoso.Internals` package.\r\n\r\nTransitive dependencies are reviewable in two ways:\r\n\r\n* In the Visual Studio Solution Explorer window, which supports searching.\r\n* By examining the *project.assets.json* file contained in the obj directory of your project.\r\n\r\nThe *project.assets.json* files are the authoritative list of all packages used by your project, containing both direct and transitive dependencies.\r\n\r\n#### <a name=\"direct-dependencies\"></a>Fixing direct dependencies\r\n\r\nOpen *projectname.csproj* in your editor. If you're using Visual Studio, right-click the project and choose **Edit projectname.csproj** from the context menu, where projectname is the name of your project. Look for `PackageReference` elements. The following shows an example project file:\r\n\r\n```xml\r\n<Project Sdk=\"Microsoft.NET.Sdk\">\r\n  <PropertyGroup>\r\n    <TargetFramework>netcoreapp2.0</TargetFramework>\r\n  </PropertyGroup>\r\n  <ItemGroup>\r\n    <PackageReference Include=\"Microsoft.AspNetCore.Server.Kestrel.Core\" Version=\"2.0.1\" />\r\n  </ItemGroup>\r\n</Project>\r\n```\r\n\r\nThe preceding example has a reference to a [vulnerable package](#affected-software), as seen by the single `PackageReference` element. The name of the package is in the `Include` attribute.\r\nThe package version number is in the `Version` attribute. The previous example shows a single direct dependency on `Microsoft.AspNetCore.Server.Kestrel.Core` version 2.0.1.\r\n\r\nTo update the version to the secure package, change the version number to the updated package version as listed on the table [previously](#affected-software).\r\nIn this example, update `Microsoft.AspNetCore.Server.Kestrel.Core` to a [fixed package number](#affected-software). Save the *csproj* file. The example *csproj* now looks as follows:\r\n\r\n```xml\r\n<Project Sdk=\"Microsoft.NET.Sdk\">\r\n  <PropertyGroup>\r\n    <TargetFramework>netcoreapp2.0</TargetFramework>\r\n  </PropertyGroup>\r\n  <ItemGroup>\r\n    <PackageReference Include=\"Microsoft.AspNetCore.Server.Kestrel.Core\" Version=\"2.0.3 />\r\n  </ItemGroup>\r\n</Project>\r\n```\r\n\r\nIf you're using Visual Studio and you save your updated *csproj* file, Visual Studio will restore the new package version.\r\nYou can see the restore results by opening the **Output** window (Ctrl+Alt+O) and changing the **Show output from** drop-down list to **Package Manager**.\r\n\r\nIf you're not using Visual Studio, open a command line and change to your project directory. Execute the `dotnet restore` command to restore the updated dependencies.\r\n\r\nNow recompile your application. If after recompilation you see a *Dependency conflict warning*, you must update your other direct dependencies to versions that take a dependency on the updated package.\r\n\r\nAfter you've addressed all of your direct dependencies, you must review your transitive dependencies.\r\n\r\n#### Discovering and fixing transitive dependencies\r\n\r\nThere are two ways to view transitive dependencies. You can either [use Visual Studio’s Solution Explorer](#vs-solution-explorer), or you can [review the *project.assets.json* file](#project-assets-json).\r\n\r\n##### <a name=\"vs-solution-explorer\"></a>Using Visual Studio Solution Explorer\r\n\r\nTo use Solution Explorer, open the project in Visual Studio 2017, and then press Ctrl+; to activate the search in Solution Explorer. Search for each of the [vulnerable packages](#affected-software) and make a note of the version numbers of any results you find.\r\n\r\nFor example, searching for `Microsoft.AspNetCore.Mvc.Core` in an example project that contains a package that takes a dependency on `Microsoft.AspNetCore.Mvc` shows the following results in Visual Studio 2017:\r\n\r\n![Screenshot of search results in Visual Studio 2017](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/796298/25858816/8ecdc2b4-3491-11e7-9363-746804bb9832.png)\r\n\r\nThe search results appear as a tree. In the previous results, you can see that a reference to `Microsoft.AspNetCore.Mvc.Core` version 1.1.2 is discovered.\r\n\r\nUnder the Dependencies node is a NuGet node. Under the NuGet node is the list of packages you have directly taken a dependency on and their versions.\r\nIn screenshot, the application takes a direct dependency on `Microsoft.AspNetCore.Mvc`. `Microsoft.AspNetCore.Mvc` in turn has leaf nodes that list its dependencies and their versions.\r\nThe `Microsoft.AspNetCore.Mvc` package takes a dependency on a version of `Microsoft.AspNetCore.Mvc.ApiExplorer`, that in turn takes a dependency on a version of `Microsoft.AspNetCore.Mvc.Core`.\r\n\r\n##### <a name=\"project-assets-json\"></a>Manually reviewing project.assets.json\r\n\r\nOpen the *project.assets.json* file from your project’s obj directory in your editor. We suggest you use an editor that understands JSON and allows you to collapse and expand nodes to review this file.\r\nVisual Studio and Visual Studio Code provide JSON friendly editing.\r\n\r\nSearch the *project.assets.json* file for the [vulnerable package](#affected-software), using the format `packagename/` for each of the package names from the preceding table. If you find the assembly name in your search:\r\n\r\n* Examine the line on which they are found, the version number is after the `/`.\r\n* Compare to the [vulnerable versions table](#affected-software).\r\n\r\nFor example, a search result that shows `System.Security.Cryptography.Xml/4.4.0` is a reference to version 4.4.0 of `System.Security.Cryptography.Xml`.\r\nIf your *project.assets.json* file includes references to the [vulnerable package](#affected-software), then you need to fix the transitive dependencies.\r\n\r\n##### Fixing transitive dependencies\r\n\r\nIf you have not found any reference to any vulnerable packages, this means either\r\n\r\n* None of your direct dependencies depend on any vulnerable packages, or\r\n* You have already fixed the problem by updating the direct dependencies.\r\n\r\nIf your transitive dependency review found references to the [vulnerable package](#affected-software), you must add a direct dependency to the updated package to your *csproj* file to override the transitive dependency.\r\n\r\nOpen *projectname.csproj* in your editor. If you're using Visual Studio, right-click the project and choose **Edit projectname.csproj** from the context menu, where projectname is the name of your project.\r\nLook for `PackageReference` nodes, for example:\r\n\r\n```xml\r\n<Project Sdk=\"Microsoft.NET.Sdk.\">\r\n  <PropertyGroup>\r\n    <TargetFramework>net461</TargetFramework>\r\n  </PropertyGroup>\r\n  <ItemGroup>\r\n    <PackageReference Include=\"ThirdParty.NotUpdatedYet\" Version=\"2.0.0\" />\r\n  </ItemGroup>\r\n</Project>\r\n```\r\n\r\nYou must add a direct dependency to the updated version of the [vulnerable package](#affected-software) by adding it to the *csproj* file.\r\nYou do this by adding a new line to the dependencies section, referencing the fixed version.\r\nFor example, if your search showed a transitive reference to a vulnerable `Microsoft.AspNetCore.Server.Kestrel.Core` version, you'd add a reference to the [fixed package number](#affected-software).\r\n\r\n```xml\r\n<Project Sdk=\"Microsoft.NET.Sdk.Web\">\r\n  <PropertyGroup>\r\n    <TargetFramework>net461</TargetFramework>\r\n  </PropertyGroup>\r\n  <ItemGroup>\r\n    <PackageReference Include=\"Microsoft.AspNetCore.Server.Kestrel.Core\" Version=\"2.0.3\" />\r\n    <PackageReference Include=\"ThirdParty.NotUpdatedYet\" Version=\"2.0.0\" />\r\n  </ItemGroup>\r\n</Project>\r\n```\r\n\r\nAfter you've added the direct dependency reference, save your *csproj* file.\r\n\r\nIf you're using Visual Studio, save your updated *csproj* file and Visual Studio will restore the new package versions.\r\nYou can see the restore results by opening the **Output** window (Ctrl+Alt+O) and changing the **Show output from** drop-down list to **Package Manager**.\r\n\r\nIf you're not using Visual Studio, open a command line and change to your project directory. Execute the `dotnet restore` command to restore the new dependencies.\r\n\r\n#### Rebuilding your application\r\n\r\nFinally you must rebuild your application, test, and redeploy.\r\n\r\n## Other Information\r\n\r\n### Reporting Security Issues\r\n\r\nIf you have found a potential security issue in .NET Core, please email details to secure@microsoft.com.

PR is [here](https://github.com/dotnet/dotnet-docker/pull/450)\r\n\r\n### Why the merge?\r\n\r\nFor some time we have been seeing people search for and find the `microsoft/dotnet` images and never realise that there are aspnetcore ones. This could be problematic in the past as the dotnet images were not optimised for ASP.NET Core, making things a little harder or slower. But with changes in the way ASP.NET Core works in 2.1 it was going to be much more impactful, in that ASP.NET Core applications were not likely to run on the base dotnet image. Given that we also thought it made more sense to have a single repository for all images, as ASP.NET is just part of .NET, we are taking this opportunity to remove the potential source of confusion and wasted time for our customers.\r\n\r\n### Why no Node?\r\nThere are two main reasons for this:\r\n\r\n  1. Multi-stage build now makes it easier to pull in the Node image for purely build concerns.\r\n  2. The ASP.NET Core templates no longer have a hard dependency on Node.\r\n\r\n\r\nFor discussion and feedback on this decision you can go here: [https://github.com/aspnet/aspnet-docker/issues/403](https://github.com/aspnet/aspnet-docker/issues/403)\r\n\r\n### Dockerfile examples\r\n\r\nIf you need Node then you will need to add it in your own Dockerfile, like this:\r\n\r\n```Dockerfile\r\nFROM microsoft/dotnet:2.1-sdk as build-env\r\nWORKDIR /app\r\n#setup node\r\nENV NODE_VERSION 8.9.4\r\nENV NODE_DOWNLOAD_SHA 21fb4690e349f82d708ae766def01d7fec1b085ce1f5ab30d9bda8ee126ca8fc\r\n\r\nRUN curl -SL \"https://nodejs.org/dist/v${NODE_VERSION}/node-v${NODE_VERSION}-linux-x64.tar.gz\" --output nodejs.tar.gz \\\r\n    && echo \"$NODE_DOWNLOAD_SHA nodejs.tar.gz\" | sha256sum -c - \\\r\n    && tar -xzf \"nodejs.tar.gz\" -C /usr/local --strip-components=1 \\\r\n    && rm nodejs.tar.gz \\\r\n    && ln -s /usr/local/bin/node /usr/local/bin/nodejs\r\n\r\n# copy csproj and restore as distinct layers\r\nCOPY *.csproj ./\r\nRUN dotnet restore\r\n\r\n# copy everything else and build\r\nCOPY . ./\r\nRUN dotnet publish -c Release -o out\r\n\r\n# build runtime image\r\nFROM microsoft/dotnet:2.1-aspnetcore-runtime\r\nWORKDIR /app\r\n#setup node, this is only needed if you use Node both at runtime and build time.

This advisory also provides guidance on what developers can do to update their applications to remove this vulnerability.\r\n\r\nMicrosoft is aware of a security vulnerability in all public versions of ASP.NET Core where an elevation of privilege vulnerability exists when a ASP.NET Core web application fails to validate web requests correctly.\r\n\r\n## Discussion\r\n\r\nDiscussion for this issue can be found at https://github.com/aspnet/Home/issues/2954\r\n\r\n### Mitigation factors\r\n\r\nSites are not vulnerable to this elevation of privilege when:\r\n\r\n* The site is hosted behind a proxy, such as Internet Information Services (IIS), NGINX, or Apache, where:\r\n\r\n  * The proxy validates the host header, and\r\n  * The proxy is configured to listen on fully qualified domain names or\r\n  * The proxy is configured with a wildcard subdomain where the root domain is fully controlled by the site owner.\r\n\r\nFor example, if IIS is configured to respond to requests for `contoso.com` or `*.contoso.com` hosts, the application is protected.\r\n\r\nIf IIS is configured to respond to any request from any host, the application is vulnerable.\r\n\r\nKestrel does not have the capability to validate host headers and is vulnerable if not placed behind a proxy that performs the host header validation.\r\n\r\nApps hosted in Azure Web Apps are not susceptible to this vulnerability.\r\n\r\n## <a name=\"affected-software\"></a>Affected software\r\n\r\nAny ASP.NET Core hosted application which is directly exposed to the internet, or hosted behind a proxy which does not validate or restict host headers to known good values.\r\n\r\nThe vulnerability also affects any ASP.NET Core 2.0 project if it uses the following package versions, which must also be [updated](#app-update), in addition to addressing your proxy configuration :\r\n\r\nPackage name | Vulnerable versions | Secure versions\r\n------------ | ---------------- | -------------------------\r\nMicrosoft.AspNetCore.HttpOverrides | 2.0.0, 2.0.1 |  2.0.2 and later\r\nMicrosoft.AspNetCore.Server.Kestrel.Core | 2.0.0, 2.0.1 |  2.0.2 and later\r\n\r\n*No patches are available for ASP.NET Core 1.0.x or ASP.NET Core 1.1.x. Microsoft requires that you place your 1.x ASP.NET Core application behind a proxy.\r\nYou must address the configuration of your proxy to protect your application. If you're not running ASP.NET Core 1.x behind a proxy, you must either place a proxy in front of your application or upgrade to ASP.NET Core 2.0.\r\nand add the host validating middleware provided at https://github.com/aspnet/BasicMiddleware/blob/release/2.0/samples/HostFilteringSample/.*\r\n\r\n## Advisory FAQ\r\n### How do I know if I am affected?\r\n\r\nReview the server and proxy configuration [instructions](#configuration) below to see if your system is configured correctly, and adjust the configuration if necessary.\r\n\r\n### How do I fix the issue?\r\n\r\nYou must address the [configuration](#configuration) of your server or proxy to protect your application to limit requests to known hosts.\r\n\r\nIf you're not running Kestrel 1.x behind a proxy, you must either place a proxy in front of your application or upgrade to ASP.NET Core 2.0 and follow the 2.0 instructions below.\r\n\r\nASP.NET Core 2.0.x applications must [update your code](#app-update) to fully protect your application.\r\n\r\n#### <a name=\"configuration\"></a> Server and Proxy configuration\r\n\r\nYou must examine your externally facing server or proxy configuration and ensure it requires host headers with fully qualified domain names, or known sub-domains if you are using sub-domain wild cards.\r\n\r\n##### ASP.NET Core applications behind [IIS](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/aspnet/core/host-and-deploy/iis/)\r\n\r\nTo configure IIS to only respond to know hosts:\r\n\r\n* Open IIS Manager.\r\n* Expand the **Sites** node for the machine you want to configure.\r\n* Select the site by clicking on the site.\r\n* In the **Actions** list on the right-hand side of IIS Manager, click **Bindings**.\r\n* Edit any bindings that do not have a host name to specify one. Do not use a `*` wildcard unless it's against a domain under your control. For example, `*.contoso.com` is safe, `*.com` is not.\r\n\r\n##### ASP.NET Core applications running publicly on [Kestrel](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/aspnet/core/fundamentals/servers/kestrel)\r\n\r\nKestrel does not have the capability to validate host headers. It must either be placed behind a proxy that performs the host header validation or the validation must be performed within the application by adding  host filtering middleware provided at https://github.com/aspnet/BasicMiddleware/blob/release/2.0/samples/HostFilteringSample/. You must also [update your dependencies](#app-update) to fully protect your application.\r\n\r\n##### ASP.NET Core applications running on [HTTP.SYS](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/aspnet/core/fundamentals/servers/httpsys)\r\n\r\nTo configure URL prefixes and ports, you can use the `UseUrls` extension method, the `urls` command-line argument, the ASPNETCORE_URLS environment variable, or the `UrlPrefixes` property on [HttpSysOptions](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/api/microsoft.aspnetcore.server.httpsys.httpsysoptions). The following code example uses `UrlPrefixes`.\r\n\r\n```c#\r\npublic static IWebHost BuildWebHost(string[] args) =>\r\n    WebHost.CreateDefaultBuilder(args)\r\n        .UseStartup<Startup>()\r\n        .UseHttpSys(options =>\r\n        {\r\n            // The following options are set to default values.\r\n            options.Authentication.Schemes = AuthenticationSchemes.None;\r\n            options.Authentication.AllowAnonymous = true;\r\n            options.MaxConnections = null;\r\n            options.MaxRequestBodySize = 30000000;\r\n            options.UrlPrefixes.Add(\"http://localhost:5000\");\r\n        })\r\n        .Build();\r\n```\r\n\r\n##### ASP.NET Core applications behind [NGINX](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/aspnet/core/host-and-deploy/linux-nginx)\r\n\r\nTo configure NGINX as a reverse proxy to forward requests to your ASP.NET Core app, replace the contents */etc/nginx/sites-available/default* with the following:\r\n\r\n```NGINX\r\nserver {\r\n    listen        80;\r\n    server_name   example.com *.example.com;\r\n    location / {\r\n        proxy_pass         http://localhost:5000;\r\n        proxy_http_version 1.1;\r\n        proxy_set_header   Upgrade $http_upgrade;\r\n        proxy_set_header   Connection keep-alive;\r\n        proxy_set_header   Host $host;\r\n        proxy_cache_bypass $http_upgrade;\r\n    }\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nNote that with NGINX, when there is no match for `server_name`, NGINX will pick the default server. If no default server has been defined, the first server in the conf file is the default server. Best practice is to add a specific default server which returns a status code of 444 in the conf file. An example default server configuration would be as follows:\r\n\r\n```NGINX\r\nserver {\r\n    listen   80 default_server;\r\n    # listen [::]:80 default_server deferred;\r\n    return   444;\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nWith the preceding configuration file and default server, NGINX accepts public traffic on port 80 with host header `example.com` or `*.example.com`. Requests not matching these hosts won't get forwarded to Kestrel. NGINX forwards the matching requests to Kestrel at `http://localhost:5000`. See [How nginx processes a request](https://nginx.org/docs/http/request_processing.html) for more information.\r\n\r\nOnce the NGINX configuration is established, run `sudo nginx -t` to verify the syntax of the configuration files. If the configuration file test is successful, force NGINX to pick up the changes by running `sudo nginx -s reload`.\r\n\r\n##### ASP.NET Core applications behind [Apache](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/aspnet/core/host-and-deploy/linux-apache)\r\n\r\nConfiguration files for Apache are located within the `/etc/httpd/conf.d/` directory. Any file with the `*.conf*` extension:\r\n\r\n* Is processed in alphabetical order, and\r\n* The module configuration files in `/etc/httpd/conf.modules.d/` are processed. The module configuration files in `/etc/httpd/conf.modules.d/` contain any configuration files necessary to load modules.\r\n\r\n\r\n```\r\n<VirtualHost *:80>\r\n    ProxyPreserveHost On\r\n    ProxyPass / http://127.0.0.1:5000/\r\n    ProxyPassReverse / http://127.0.0.1:5000/\r\n    ServerName www.example.com\r\n    ServerAlias *.example.com\r\n</VirtualHost>\r\n```\r\n\r\nThe `VirtualHost` block can appear multiple times, in one or more files on a server. In the preceding configuration file, Apache accepts public traffic on port 80. The domain `www.example.com` is being served, and the `*.example.com` alias resolves to the same website. See [Name-based virtual host support](https://httpd.apache.org/docs/current/vhosts/name-based.html) for more information. Requests are proxied at the root to port 5000 of the server at 127.0.0.1. For bi-directional communication, `ProxyPass` and `ProxyPassReverse` are required.\r\n\r\nSave the file and test the configuration. If everything passes, the response is `Syntax [OK]`.\r\n\r\n```bash\r\nsudo service httpd configtest\r\n```\r\n\r\nRestart Apache:\r\n\r\n```bash\r\nsudo systemctl restart httpd\r\nsudo systemctl enable httpd\r\n```\r\n\r\n\r\n#### <a name=\"app-update\"></a> ASP.NET Core 2.0 application code updates\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\nIf you're targeting .NET Core 2.x and the `Microsoft.AspNetCore.All` \"metapackage\":\r\n\r\n* Update its version number to 2.0.6 or later.\r\n* Updating will pull in the fixed packages listed above.\r\n\r\nIf you're targeting .NET Framework, update the packages listed above to their safe version or later.\r\n\r\nIf your application is using Kestrel without a proxy or the HttpOverrides functionality (UseForwardedHeaders with ForwardedHost) you must also add the host filtering middleware provided at https://github.com/aspnet/BasicMiddleware/tree/release/2.0/samples/HostFilteringSample/.\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n.NET Core and ASP.NET Core have two types of dependencies: direct and transitive. You must follow the update instructions below to address both types of dependency.\r\n\r\n### Direct dependencies\r\n\r\nDirect dependencies are dependencies where you specifically add a package to your project. For example, if you add the `Microsoft.AspNetCore.Mvc` package to your project then you have taken a direct dependency on `Microsoft.AspNetCore.Mvc`.\r\n\r\nDirect dependencies are discoverable by examining your *csproj* file.\r\n\r\n### Transitive dependencies\r\n\r\nTransitive dependencies occur when you add a package to your project that in turn relies on another package. For example, if you add the `Microsoft.AspNetCore.Mvc` package to your project it depends on the `Microsoft.AspNetCore.Mvc.Core` package (among others). Your project has a direct dependency on `Microsoft.AspNetCore.Mvc` and a transitive dependency on the `Microsoft.AspNetCore.Mvc.Core` package.\r\nTransitive dependencies are reviewable:\r\n\r\n* In the Visual Studio Solution Explorer window, which supports searching.\r\n* By examining the *project.assets.json* file contained in the obj directory of your project.\r\n\r\nThe *project.assets.json* files are the authoritative list of all packages used by your project, containing both direct and transitive dependencies.\r\n\r\n\r\n##### Fixing direct dependencies – Projects targeting .NET Core\r\n\r\nOpen *projectname.csproj* in your editor. If you're using Visual Studio, right-click the project and choose **Edit projectname.csproj** from the content menu, where projectname is the name of your project. Look for `PackageReference` elements. The following shows an example project file:\r\n\r\n```xml\r\n<Project Sdk=\"Microsoft.NET.Sdk.Web\">\r\n  <PropertyGroup>\r\n    <TargetFramework>netcoreapp2.0</TargetFramework>\r\n  </PropertyGroup>\r\n  <ItemGroup>\r\n    <PackageReference Include=\"Microsoft.AspNetCore.All\" Version=\"2.0.5\" />\r\n  </ItemGroup>\r\n  <ItemGroup>\r\n    <DotNetCliToolReference Include=\"Microsoft.VisualStudio.Web.CodeGeneration.Tools\" Version=\"2.0.0\" />\r\n  </ItemGroup>\r\n</Project>\r\n```\r\n\r\nThe preceding example has a reference to the vulnerable metapackage, as seen by the single `PackageReference` element. The name of the package is in the `Include` attribute. The package version number is in the `Version` attribute. The example shows a single direct dependency on `Microsoft.AspNetCore.All` version 2.0.5.\r\n\r\nTo update the version to the secure package, change the version number to a secure package version. In this example, update `Microsoft.AspNetCore.All` to 2.0.6 or later. Save the *csproj* file. The example *csproj* now looks as follows:\r\n\r\n```xml\r\n<Project Sdk=\"Microsoft.NET.Sdk.Web\">\r\n  <PropertyGroup>\r\n    <TargetFramework>netcoreapp2.0</TargetFramework>\r\n  </PropertyGroup>\r\n  <ItemGroup>\r\n    <PackageReference Include=\"Microsoft.AspNetCore.All\" Version=\"2.0.6\" />\r\n  </ItemGroup>\r\n  <ItemGroup>\r\n    <DotNetCliToolReference Include=\"Microsoft.VisualStudio.Web.CodeGeneration.Tools\" Version=\"2.0.0\" />\r\n  </ItemGroup>\r\n</Project>\r\n```\r\n\r\nIf you're using Visual Studio and save your updated *csproj* file, Visual Studio will restore the new package version. You can see the restore results by opening the **Output** window (Ctrl+Alt+O) and changing the **Show output from** drop-down list to **Package Manager**.\r\n\r\nIf you're not using Visual Studio, open a command line and change to your project directory. Execute the `dotnet restore` command to restore the updated dependencies.\r\n\r\n##### Fixing direct dependencies – Projects targeting .NET Framework\r\n\r\nOpen *projectname.csproj* in your editor. If you're using Visual Studio, right-click the project and choose **Edit projectname.csproj** from the content menu, where projectname is the name of your project. Look for `PackageReference` nodes. The following shows an example project file:\r\n\r\n```xml\r\n<Project Sdk=\"Microsoft.NET.Sdk.Web\">\r\n  <PropertyGroup>\r\n    <TargetFramework>net461</TargetFramework>\r\n  </PropertyGroup>\r\n  <ItemGroup>\r\n    <PackageReference Include=\"Microsoft.AspNetCore.HttpOverrides\" Version=\"2.0.1\" />\r\n  </ItemGroup>\r\n  <ItemGroup>\r\n    <DotNetCliToolReference Include=\"Microsoft.VisualStudio.Web.CodeGeneration.Tools\" Version=\"2.0.0\" />\r\n  </ItemGroup>\r\n</Project>\r\n```\r\n\r\nThe example has a reference to a single package, as seen by the `PackageReference` element. The name of the package is in the `Include` attribute. The package version number is in the `Version` attribute. The example shows a direct dependency on one of the vulnerable packages from the table above, `Microsoft.AspNetCore.HttpOverrides` version 2.0.1.\r\n\r\nTo update to the secure package, change the version number to the updated package version. In the example, this would be updating `Microsoft.AspNetCore.HttpOverrides` to 2.0.2 and later. Save the *csproj* file. The updated and secure *csproj* look as follows:\r\n\r\n``` XML\r\n<Project Sdk=\"Microsoft.NET.Sdk.Web\">\r\n  <PropertyGroup>\r\n    <TargetFramework>net461</TargetFramework>\r\n  </PropertyGroup>\r\n  <ItemGroup>\r\n    <PackageReference Include=\"Microsoft.AspNetCore.HttpOverrides\" Version=\"2.0.2\" />\r\n  </ItemGroup>\r\n  <ItemGroup>\r\n    <DotNetCliToolReference Include=\"Microsoft.VisualStudio.Web.CodeGeneration.Tools\" Version=\"2.0.0\" />\r\n  </ItemGroup>\r\n</Project>\r\n```\r\n\r\nIf you're using Visual Studio and save your updated *csproj* file, Visual Studio will restore the new package version. You can see the restore results by opening the **Output** window (Ctrl+Alt+O) and changing the **Show output from** drop-down list to **Package Manager**.\r\n\r\nIf you're not using Visual Studio, open a command line and change to your project directory. Execute the `dotnet restore` command to restore the new dependency version.\r\n\r\n##### After updating your direct dependencies\r\n\r\nRecompile your application.\r\n\r\nIf after recompilation you see a *Dependency conflict warning*, you must update your other direct dependencies to a compatible version. \r\n\r\nFor example if your project refers directly to `Microsoft.AspNetCore.Mvc.Cors` with a version number of `2.0.0`, when you update your `Microsoft.AspNetCore.Mvc` package to 2.0.1, compilation will throw:\r\n\r\n`NU1012      Dependency conflict. Microsoft.AspNetCore.Mvc 2.0.1 expected Microsoft.AspNetCore.Mvc.Cors >= 2.0.1 but received 2.0.0`\r\n\r\nTo fix this, edit the version for the expected package to be the version expected by updating your *project.json* in the same way that you used to update the vulnerable package versions.\r\n\r\nAfter you've addressed all of your direct dependencies, you must review your transitive dependencies.\r\n\r\n###### Reviewing transitive dependencies\r\n\r\nThere are two ways to view transitive dependencies. You can either use Visual Studio’s Solution Explorer, or you can review the *project.assets.json* file.\r\n\r\n###### Using Visual Studio Solution Explorer\r\n\r\nTo use Solution Explorer, open the project in Visual Studio 2017, and then press Ctrl+; to activate the search in Solution Explorer. Search for each of the vulnerable package names above and make a note of the version numbers of any results you find.\r\n\r\nFor example, searching for `Microsoft.AspNetCore.Mvc.Core` in an example project that contains a package that takes a dependency on `Microsoft.AspNetCore.Mvc` shows the following results in Visual Studio 2017:\r\n\r\n![vs2017](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/796298/25858816/8ecdc2b4-3491-11e7-9363-746804bb9832.png)\r\n\r\nThe search results appear as a tree. In these results, you can see a reference to `Microsoft.AspNetCore.Mvc.Core` version 1.1.2 is discovered.\r\n\r\nUnder the Dependencies node is a NuGet node. Under the NuGet node is the list of packages you have directly taken a dependency on and their versions. In this example, the application takes a direct dependency on `Microsoft.AspNetCore.Mvc`. `Microsoft.AspNetCore.Mvc` in turn has leaf nodes that list its dependencies and their versions. In the example, the `Microsoft.AspNetCore.Mvc` package takes a dependency on a version of `Microsoft.AspNetCore.Mvc.ApiExplorer`, that in turn takes a dependency on a vulnerable version of `Microsoft.AspNetCore.Mvc.Core`.\r\n\r\n###### Manually reviewing project.assets.json (VS2017)\r\n\r\nOpen the *project.assets.json* file from your project’s obj directory in your editor. We suggest you use an editor that understands JSON and allows you to collapse and expand nodes to review this file. Visual Studio and Visual Studio Code provide JSON friendly editing.\r\n\r\nSearch the *project.assets.json* file for each of the vulnerable packages, using the format `packagename/` for each of the package names from the preceding table. If you find the assembly name in your search:\r\n\r\n* Examine the line on which they are found, the version number is after the `/`.\r\n* Compare to the vulnerable versions table above.\r\n\r\nFor example, a search result that shows `Microsoft.AspNetCore.Mvc.Cors/1.1.0` is a reference to v1.1.0 of `Microsoft.AspNetCore.Mvc.Cors`.   If your *project.assets.json* file includes references to any of the vulnerable packages shown above, then you need to fix the transitive dependencies.\r\n\r\n###### Overriding transitive dependencies\r\n\r\nIf you have not found any reference to any vulnerable packages this means:\r\n\r\n* None of your direct dependencies depend on any vulnerable packages, or\r\n* You have already fixed the problem by updating the direct dependencies.\r\n\r\nIf your transitive dependency review found references to any of the vulnerable packages you must add a direct dependency to the updated package to your *csproj* file to override the transitive dependency.\r\n\r\nOpen *projectname.csproj* in your editor. If you're using Visual Studio, right-click the project and choose **Edit projectname.csproj** from the content menu, where projectname is the name of your project. Look for `PackageReference` nodes, for example:\r\n\r\n```xml\r\n<Project Sdk=\"Microsoft.NET.Sdk.Web\">\r\n  <PropertyGroup>\r\n    <TargetFramework>net461</TargetFramework>\r\n  </PropertyGroup>\r\n  <ItemGroup>\r\n    <PackageReference Include=\"ThirdParty.NotUpdatedYet\" Version=\"2.0.0\" />\r\n  </ItemGroup>\r\n  <ItemGroup>\r\n    <DotNetCliToolReference Include=\"Microsoft.VisualStudio.Web.CodeGeneration.Tools\" Version=\"2.0.0\" />\r\n  </ItemGroup>\r\n</Project>\r\n```\r\n\r\nFor each of the vulnerable packages your search returned, you must add a direct dependency to the updated version by adding it to the *csproj* file.\r\nYou do this by adding a new line to the dependencies section, referring the fixed version.\r\nFor example, if your search showed a transitive reference to the vulnerable `Microsoft.AspNetCore.HttpOverrides` version 2.0.0 you would add a reference to the fixed version, that is, 2.0.2 or later.\r\n\r\n```xml\r\n<Project Sdk=\"Microsoft.NET.Sdk.Web\">\r\n  <PropertyGroup>\r\n    <TargetFramework>net461</TargetFramework>\r\n  </PropertyGroup>\r\n  <ItemGroup>\r\n    <PackageReference Include=\"Microsoft.AspNetCore.HttpOverride\" Version=\"2.0.2\" />\r\n    <PackageReference Include=\"ThirdParty.NotUpdatedYet\" Version=\"2.0.0\" />\r\n  </ItemGroup>\r\n  <ItemGroup>\r\n    <DotNetCliToolReference Include=\"Microsoft.VisualStudio.Web.CodeGeneration.Tools\" Version=\"2.0.0\" />\r\n  </ItemGroup>\r\n</Project>\r\n```\r\n\r\nAfter you have added the direct dependency reference, save your *csproj* file.\r\n\r\nIf you're using Visual Studio, save your updated *csproj* file and Visual Studio will restore the new package versions.\r\nYou can see the restore results by opening the **Output** window (Ctrl+Alt+O) and changing the **Show output from** drop-down list to **Package Manager**.\r\n\r\nIf you're not using Visual Studio, open a command line and change to your project directory. Execute the `dotnet restore` command to restore the new dependencies.\r\n\r\n###### Rebuilding your application\r\n\r\nRebuild your application.

We plan to condense about 53 repos into 5. Repos which merge with another will be archived on GitHub, which makes them read-only. We will also rename a few repositories. GitHub will automatically redirect URLs to issues and commits on renamed repositories. We will update the README and repo descriptions to help you navigate from archived repos to the new repo.\r\n\r\nAfter the merging is complete, the final set of repos will be as follows:\r\n\r\nRepo                            | Primary purpose\r\n--------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------\r\naspnet/AspNetCore               | ASP.NET Core runtime\r\naspnet/Extensions               | Microsoft.Extensions.* APIs\r\naspnet/EntityFrameworkCore      | Entity Framework Core\r\naspnet/Tooling                  | Visual Studio extensions, command-line tools, and MSBuild SDKs\r\naspnet/AspLabs                  | Experiments not ready for production releases\r\n\r\nTo preserve as much history as possible, we will rename aspnet/Home to aspnet/AspNetCore, and aspnet/Common to aspnet/Extensions instead of creating new repos. We will preserve commit history by merging unrelated histories into the unified repos. We will also review open issues and move them when necessary to keep them aligned with the relevant code.\r\n\r\n### Motivation\r\n\r\nOur primary motivation is simplifying both our engineering systems and our GitHub interactions with all of you. We know there are some drawbacks to working in larger repos, but we find the benefits compelling enough to move forward with this change. The new set of repos more closely aligns with the layering of the products they ship.\r\n\r\n### Timeframe\r\n\r\nWe'll be starting the first round of changes soon. We expect the entire unification effort will take us several weeks. We'll migrate repositories in phases and adjust the plan along the way, as necessary.\r\n\r\n### Archived repos\r\n\r\nThe following repos will be merged into the main repos above. They will not be used any more for active development on 2.1 LTS and new releases. The source code for the projects will move to the new project with any issues we intend to keep working on. Remaining issues and pull requests will be closed. We do not plan to delete the repos or remove tagged commits, but the projects will become read-only.\r\n\r\n* AADIntegration           \r\n* Antiforgery              \r\n* AuthSamples              \r\n* AzureIntegration         \r\n* BasicMiddleware          \r\n* BrowserLink              \r\n* Caching                  \r\n* Common                   \r\n* Configuration            \r\n* CORS                     \r\n* DataProtection           \r\n* DependencyInjection      \r\n* Diagnostics              \r\n* DotNetTools              \r\n* EventNotification        \r\n* FileSystem               \r\n* Hosting                  \r\n* HtmlAbstractions         \r\n* HttpAbstractions         \r\n* HttpClientFactory        \r\n* HttpSysServer            \r\n* Identity                 \r\n* IISIntegration           \r\n* JavaScriptServices       \r\n* JsonPatch                \r\n* KestrelHttpServer        \r\n* Localization             \r\n* Logging                  \r\n* MetaPackages             \r\n* Microsoft.Data.Sqlite    \r\n* MusicStore               \r\n* Mvc                      \r\n* MvcPrecompilation        \r\n* Options                  \r\n* Proxy                    \r\n* Razor                    \r\n* ResponseCaching          \r\n* Routing                  \r\n* Scaffolding              \r\n* Security                 \r\n* ServerTests              \r\n* Session                  \r\n* SignalR                  \r\n* StaticFiles              \r\n* Templating               \r\n* Testing                  \r\n* Universe                 \r\n* WebHooks                 \r\n* WebSockets\r\n\r\n\r\n_Please use https://github.com/aspnet/Home/issues/3598 for discussion._  ","Url":"https://github.com/aspnet/Announcements/issues/320","RelatedDescription":"Open issue \"For contributors: unifying to fewer GitHub repos\" (#320)"},{"Id":"367922912","IsPullRequest":false,"CreatedAt":"2018-10-08T19:29:02","Actor":"pranavkm","Number":"319","RawContent":null,"Title":"3.0 - Removing Microsoft.AspNetCore.Mvc.WebApiCompatShim","State":"open","Body":"The Microsoft.AspNetCore.Mvc.WebApiCompatShim (WebApiCompatShim) package provides partial compatibility in ASP.NET Core with ASP.NET Web API 2 to simplify migrating existing Web API implementations to ASP.NET Core.

This advisory also provides guidance on what developers can do to remove current security restrictions added by ASP.NET to their applications to become compatible with iOS12.\r\n\r\n## Discussion\r\n\r\nDiscussion for this issue can be found at https://github.com/aspnet/Identity/issues/1984 for ASP.NET Core Identity\r\nDiscussion for this issue can be found at https://github.com/aspnet/Security/issues/1864 for ASP.NET Core Cookie Authentication\r\n\r\n## <a name=\"advisory-faq\"></a>Advisory FAQ\r\n\r\n### <a name=\"how-affected\"></a>What has changed\r\n\r\nThe recent iOS12 update has changed Safari's handling of [SameSite](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc6265) cookies. The SameSite attribute allows a developer to control when cookies are sent to a web site, enabling the flow to only occur when requests are from the same site. This standard was introduced to reduce exposure to Cross Site Request Forgery (CSRF) attacks. By default ASP.NET Core 2.0 and later protects its authentication cookies using the SameSite property. The change on Apple's part is not limited to ASP.NET Core applications, it is affecting multiple frameworks and authentication software which relay on HTTP forms in a browser, for example authenticating to a third party via Facebook, Twitter or browser based Open ID Connect (OIDC) mechanism.\r\n\r\nApple have stated they believe [their change is correct behavior](https://bugs.webkit.org/show_bug.cgi?id=188165), and that the fault lies in every other browser's implementation.\r\n\r\nWhile we take no stance on the correctness of browser behavior we feel that removing the SameSite protections would expose our customers, and their customers to a wider risk, as it would remove the protection provided everywhere, for all users, in any browser.\r\n\r\n### <a name=\"how-affected\"></a>How do I know if I am affected?\r\n\r\nIf your users can no longer login to your web application on iOS12 using Safari then you are affected.\r\n\r\n### <a name=\"how-fix\"></a>How do I fix this?\r\n\r\nDevelopers can allow iOS12 Safari users to log into their applications by turn off SameSite protection in `ConfigureServices()`.\r\n\r\nIf you are using ASP.NET Core Identity you disable the protection by configuring cookies with the following code\r\n\r\n```c#\r\nservices.ConfigureExternalCookie(options =>\r\n{\r\n    // Other options\r\n    options.Cookie.SameSite = SameSiteMode.None;\r\n});\r\nservices.ConfigureApplicationCookie(options =>\r\n{\r\n    // Other options\r\n    options.Cookie.SameSite = SameSiteMode.None;\r\n});\r\n```\r\n\r\nIf you are using cookie authentication without ASP.NET Core identity you can turn off the protection with the following code\r\n\r\n```c#\r\nservices.AddCookie(CookieAuthenticationDefaults.AuthenticationScheme, options =>\r\n{\r\n    // Other options\r\n    options.Cookie.SameSite = Microsoft.AspNetCore.Http.SameSiteMode.None;\r\n})\r\n```\r\n\r\nIf you are using external OIDC providers you may be able to avoid the issue by changing the response mode your provider uses from a POST to a GET request, using the following code. Not all providers may support this.\r\n\r\n```c#\r\n.AddOpenIdConnect(\"myOIDProvider\", options => {\r\n    // Other options\r\n    options.ResponseType = \"code\";\r\n    options.ResponseMode = \"query\";\r\n};\r\n```\r\n\r\n_Note that in making these changes protection is removed for all users and all browsers. You should ensure that all your actions that make state changes are protected with [CSRF anti-forgery mechanisms](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/aspnet/core/security/anti-request-forgery) built into ASP.NET Core.\r\n\r\n#### Rebuilding your application\r\n\r\nAfter making these configuration changes you rebuild your application, test, and redeploy.\r\n\r\n## Other Information\r\n\r\n### Reporting Security Issues\r\n\r\nIf you have found a potential security issue in .NET Core, please email details to secure@microsoft.com.

A remote unauthenticated attacker could exploit this vulnerability by providing a specially crafted web requests to the ASP.NET Core application.\r\n\r\nThe update addresses the vulnerability by correcting how ASP.NET Core handles parsing web requests.\r\n\r\nThe underlying problem exists in the `System.IO.Pipelines` package. If you have other software which uses this package please follow the instructions in the [.NET Core bulletin](https://github.com/dotnet/announcements/issues/83).\r\n\r\n## Discussion\r\n\r\nDiscussion for this issue can be found at https://github.com/aspnet/KestrelHttpServer/issues/2914\r\n\r\n### <a name=\"mitigation-factors\"></a>Mitigation factors\r\n\r\nThere are no mitigating factors for this vulnerability.\r\n\r\n## <a name=\"affected-software\"></a>Affected software\r\n\r\nAny ASP.NET Core based application that uses either of the packages with a vulnerable version listed below.\r\n\r\nPackage name | Vulnerable versions | Secure versions\r\n------------ | ------------------- | -------------------------\r\nMicrosoft.AspNetCore.All | 2.1.0, 2.1.1, 2.1.2, 2.1.3 | 2.1.4\r\nMicrosoft.AspNetCore.App | 2.1.0, 2.1.1, 2.1.2, 2.1.3 | 2.1.4\r\nSystem.IO.Pipelines | 4.5.0 | 4.5.1\r\n\r\n## <a name=\"advisory-faq\"></a>Advisory FAQ\r\n\r\n### <a name=\"how-affected\"></a>How do I know if I am affected?\r\n\r\n#### Applications which use Microsoft.AspNetCore.App or Microsoft.AspNetCore.All\r\n\r\nASP.NET Core 2.1 is distributed as part of the .NET Core runtime. To check the current installed runtimes open a command prompt and run the `dotnet --info` command. If you have a 2.1 or greater runtime installed you will see output like the following;\r\n\r\n```\r\n.NET Core SDK (reflecting any global.json):\r\n Version:   2.1.401\r\n Commit:    91b1c13032\r\n\r\nRuntime Environment:\r\n OS Name:     Windows\r\n OS Version:  10.0.17134\r\n OS Platform: Windows\r\n RID:         win10-x64\r\n Base Path:   C:\\Program Files\\dotnet\\sdk\\2.1.401\\\r\n\r\nHost (useful for support):\r\n  Version: 2.1.3\r\n  Commit:  124038c13e\r\n\r\n.NET Core SDKs installed:\r\n  2.1.4 [C:\\Program Files\\dotnet\\sdk]\r\n  2.1.401 [C:\\Program Files\\dotnet\\sdk]\r\n\r\n.NET Core runtimes installed:\r\n  Microsoft.AspNetCore.All 2.1.3 [C:\\Program Files\\dotnet\\shared\\Microsoft.AspNetCore.All]\r\n  Microsoft.AspNetCore.App 2.1.3 [C:\\Program Files\\dotnet\\shared\\Microsoft.AspNetCore.App]\r\n  Microsoft.NETCore.App 2.1.3 [C:\\Program Files\\dotnet\\shared\\Microsoft.NETCore.App]\r\n\r\nTo install additional .NET Core runtimes or SDKs:\r\n  https://aka.ms/dotnet-download\r\n```\r\n\r\nIf the highest .NET Core SDK version is less that 2.1.402 or the highest `Microsoft.AspNetCore.App` runtime version is less that 2.1.4 you are vulnerable to this issue. You may not see any SDK versions if you have only installed the runtime.\r\n\r\nTo update ASP.NET Core 2.1 you should [download](https://www.microsoft.com/net/download) and install the .NET Core SDK 2.1.402 on your development machines and build servers, and the .NET Core Runtime 2.1.4 on your deployment servers. Your application will roll forward to these versions on an application restart.\r\n\r\n#### Applications not using Microsoft.AspNetCore.App or Microsoft.AspNetCore.All\r\n\r\nSystem.IO.Pipelines is distributed both in ASP.NET Core 2.1 and separately as a NuGet package. If you are not using Microsoft.AspNetCore.App or .All, you may still be affected if you are referencing the System.IO.Pipelines package.\r\n\r\n##### Direct dependencies\r\n\r\nDirect dependencies are discoverable by examining your `csproj` file. They can be fixed by [editing the project file](#fixing-direct-dependencies) or using NuGet to update the dependency.\r\n\r\n##### Transitive dependencies\r\n\r\nTransitive dependencies occur when you add a package to your project that in turn relies on another package. For example, if Contoso publishes a package `Contoso.Utility` which, in turn, depends on `Contoso.Internals` and you add the `Contoso.Utility` package to your project now your project has a direct dependency on `Contoso.Utility` and, because `Contoso.Utility` depends 'Contoso.Internals', your application gains a transitive dependency on the `Contoso.Internals` package.\r\n\r\nTransitive dependencies are reviewable in two ways:\r\n\r\n* In the Visual Studio Solution Explorer window, which supports searching.\r\n* By examining the `project.assets.json` file contained in the obj directory of your project for `csproj` based projects\r\n\r\nThe `project.assets.json` files are the authoritative list of all packages used by your project, containing both direct and transitive dependencies.\r\n\r\nThere are two ways to view transitive dependencies. You can either [use Visual Studio’s Solution Explorer](#vs-solution-explorer), or you can review [the `project.assets.json` file](#project-assets-json)).\r\n\r\n##### <a name=\"vs-solution-explorer\"></a>Using Visual Studio Solution Explorer\r\n\r\nTo use Solution Explorer, open the project in Visual Studio, and then press Ctrl+; to activate the search in Solution Explorer. Search for the [vulnerable package](#affected-software) and make a note of the version numbers of any results you find.\r\n\r\nFor example, searching for `Microsoft.AspNetCore.Mvc.Core` in an example project that contains a package that takes a dependency on `Microsoft.AspNetCore.Mvc` shows the following results in Visual Studio 2017:\r\n\r\n![Screenshot of search results in Visual Studio 2017](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/796298/25858816/8ecdc2b4-3491-11e7-9363-746804bb9832.png)\r\n\r\nThe search results appear as a tree. In the previous results, you can see that a reference to `Microsoft.AspNetCore.Mvc.Core` version 1.1.2 is discovered.\r\n\r\nUnder the Dependencies node is a NuGet node. Under the NuGet node is the list of packages you have directly taken a dependency on and their versions.\r\nIn screenshot, the application takes a direct dependency on `Microsoft.AspNetCore.Mvc`. `Microsoft.AspNetCore.Mvc` in turn has leaf nodes that list its dependencies and their versions.\r\nThe `Microsoft.AspNetCore.Mvc` package takes a dependency on a version of `Microsoft.AspNetCore.Mvc.ApiExplorer`, that in turn takes a dependency on a version of `Microsoft.AspNetCore.Mvc.Core`.\r\n\r\n##### <a name=\"project-assets-json\"></a> Manually reviewing project.assets.json\r\n\r\nOpen the *project.assets.json* file from your project’s obj directory in your editor. We suggest you use an editor that understands JSON and allows you to collapse and expand nodes to review this file.\r\nVisual Studio and Visual Studio Code provide JSON friendly editing.\r\n\r\nSearch the *project.assets.json* file for the [vulnerable package](#affected-software), using the format `packagename/` for each of the package names from the preceding table. If you find the assembly name in your search:\r\n\r\n* Examine the line on which they are found, the version number is after the `/`.\r\n* Compare to the [vulnerable versions table](#affected-software).\r\n\r\nFor example, a search result that shows `System.IO.Pipelines/4.5.0` is a reference to version 4.5.0 of `System.IO.Pipelines`.\r\n\r\nIf your *project.assets.json* file includes references to the [vulnerable package](#affected-software), then you need to fix the transitive dependencies.\r\n\r\nIf you have not found any reference to any vulnerable packages, this means either\r\n\r\n* None of your direct dependencies depend on any vulnerable packages, or\r\n* You have already fixed the problem by updating the direct dependencies.\r\n\r\n### <a name=\"how-fix\"></a>How do I fix the issue?\r\n\r\n#### <a name=\"fixing-direct-dependencies\"></a>Fixing direct dependencies\r\n\r\nOpen *projectname.csproj* in your editor. If you're using Visual Studio, right-click the project and choose **Edit projectname.csproj** from the context menu, where projectname is the name of your project. Look for `PackageReference` elements. The following shows an example project file:\r\n\r\n```xml\r\n<Project Sdk=\"Microsoft.NET.Sdk.Web\">\r\n  <PropertyGroup>\r\n    <TargetFramework>netcoreapp2.1</TargetFramework>\r\n  </PropertyGroup>\r\n  <ItemGroup>\r\n    <PackageReference Include=\"System.IO.Pipelines\" Version=\"4.5.0\" />\r\n  </ItemGroup>\r\n</Project>\r\n```\r\n\r\nThe preceding example has a reference to the [vulnerable package](#affected-software), as seen by the single `PackageReference` element. The name of the package is in the `Include` attribute.\r\nThe package version number is in the `Version` attribute. The previous example shows a single direct dependency on `System.IO.Pipelines` version 4.5.0\r\n\r\nTo update the version to the secure package, change the version number to the updated package version as listed on the table [previously](#affected-software).\r\nIn this example, update `System.IO.Pipelines` to the appropriate [fixed package number](#affected-software) for your major version. Save the *csproj* file. The example *csproj* now looks as follows:\r\n\r\n```xml\r\n<Project Sdk=\"Microsoft.NET.Sdk.Web\">\r\n  <PropertyGroup>\r\n    <TargetFramework>netcoreapp2.1</TargetFramework>\r\n  </PropertyGroup>\r\n  <ItemGroup>\r\n    <PackageReference Include=\"System.IO.Pipelines\" Version=\"4.5.1\" />\r\n  </ItemGroup>\r\n</Project>\r\n```\r\n\r\nIf you're using Visual Studio and you save your updated *csproj* file, Visual Studio will restore the new package version.\r\nYou can see the restore results by opening the **Output** window (Ctrl+Alt+O) and changing the **Show output from** drop-down list to **Package Manager**.\r\n\r\nIf you're not using Visual Studio, open a command line and change to your project directory. Execute the `dotnet restore` command to restore the updated dependencies.\r\n\r\nNow recompile your application. If after recompilation you see a *Dependency conflict warning*, you must update your other direct dependencies to versions that take a dependency on the updated package.\r\n\r\n#### <a name=\"transitive-dependencies\"></a>Fixing transitive dependencies\r\n\r\nIf your transitive dependency review found references to the [vulnerable package](#affected-software), you must add a direct dependency to the updated package to your *csproj* file to override the transitive dependency.\r\n\r\nOpen *projectname.csproj* in your editor. If you're using Visual Studio, right-click the project and choose **Edit projectname.csproj** from the context menu, where projectname is the name of your project.\r\nLook for `PackageReference` nodes, for example:\r\n\r\n```xml\r\n<Project Sdk=\"Microsoft.NET.Sdk.\">\r\n  <PropertyGroup>\r\n    <TargetFramework>net461</TargetFramework>\r\n  </PropertyGroup>\r\n  <ItemGroup>\r\n    <PackageReference Include=\"ThirdParty.NotUpdatedYet\" Version=\"2.0.0\" />\r\n  </ItemGroup>\r\n</Project>\r\n```\r\n\r\nYou must add a direct dependency to the updated version of the [vulnerable package](#affected-software) by adding it to the *csproj* file.\r\nYou do this by adding a new line to the dependencies section, referencing the fixed version.\r\nFor example, if your search showed a transitive reference to a vulnerable `System.ServiceModel.Http` version, you'd add a reference to the [fixed package number](#affected-software).\r\n\r\n```xml\r\n<Project Sdk=\"Microsoft.NET.Sdk.Web\">\r\n  <PropertyGroup>\r\n    <TargetFramework>net461</TargetFramework>\r\n  </PropertyGroup>\r\n  <ItemGroup>\r\n    <PackageReference Include=\"System.IO.Pipelines\" Version=\"4.5.1\" />\r\n    <PackageReference Include=\"ThirdParty.NotUpdatedYet\" Version=\"2.0.0\" />\r\n  </ItemGroup>\r\n</Project>\r\n```\r\n\r\nAfter you've added the direct dependency reference, save your *csproj* file.\r\n\r\nIf you're using Visual Studio, save your updated *csproj* file and Visual Studio will restore the new package versions.\r\nYou can see the restore results by opening the **Output** window (Ctrl+Alt+O) and changing the **Show output from** drop-down list to **Package Manager**.\r\n\r\nIf you're not using Visual Studio, open a command line and change to your project directory. Execute the `dotnet restore` command to restore the new dependencies.\r\n\r\n#### Rebuilding your application\r\n\r\nFinally you must rebuild your application, test, and redeploy.\r\n\r\n## Other Information\r\n\r\n### Reporting Security Issues\r\n\r\nIf you have found a potential security issue in .NET Core, please email details to secure@microsoft.com.

This feature is on by default and allows build time verification of the correctness of Razor files, and also faster startup performance. Additionally, MVC watches for changes to cshtml files and seamlessly updates build-time compiled views with runtime compiled views. This allows editing cshtml files and then refreshing the browser to see the changes.\r\n\r\nMVC uses the app's compilation context, details about the references and settings that were used to compile the source code (.cs) in the app, to compile views at runtime. In addition to the compilation context, MVC exposes options such as [RazorViewEngineOptions.CompilationCallback](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/api/microsoft.aspnetcore.mvc.razor.razorviewengineoptions.compilationcallback?view=aspnetcore-2.1) and [AdditionalCompilationReferences](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/api/microsoft.aspnetcore.mvc.razor.razorviewengineoptions.additionalcompilationreferences?view=aspnetcore-2.1) that allow configuring compilation specifically for runtime. \r\n\r\nRuntime specific customizations are unavailable at build time and consequently the two outputs could be different.\r\n\r\nTo address this inconsistency, we plan on removing APIs in MVC that change or modify runtime compilation.

Direct dependencies are dependencies where you specifically add a package to your project, transitive dependencies occur when you add a package to your project that in turn relies on another package.\r\n\r\nFor example, the `Microsoft.AspNetCore.Mvc` package depends on the `Microsoft.AspNetCore.Mvc.Core` package. When you add a dependency on `Microsoft.AspNetCore.Mvc` in your project, you're taking a transitive dependency on `Microsoft.AspNetCore.Mvc.Core`.\r\n\r\nAny application that has a direct or transitive dependency on the [affected package](#affected-software) can be exposed to the vulnerability if it does not meet any of the [mitigation factors](#mitigation-factors).\r\n\r\n### <a name=\"how-fix\"></a>How do I fix the issue?\r\n\r\n### ASP.NET Core 2.1\r\n\r\nTo update ASP.NET Core 2.1 you should [download](https://www.microsoft.com/net/download) and install the .NET Core SDK 2.1.302 on your development machines and build servers, and the .NET Core Runtime 2.1.2 on your deployment servers. Your application will roll forward to these versions on an application restart.\r\n\r\n### ASP.NET Core 2.0\r\n\r\nIf you're targeting ASP.NET Core 2.0 and using the `Microsoft.AspNetCore.All` metapackage update its version number to 2.0.9 to update the `Microsoft.AspNetCore.Server.Kestrel.Core` package, recompile, and redeploy. On your deployment servers, you should [download](https://github.com/dotnet/core/blob/master/release-notes/download-archives/2.0.9-download.md) and install the .NET Core 2.0.9 using the Windows Server Hosting Bundle for Windows and the `dotnet-hosting-2.0.9` package for Linux servers.\r\n\r\n### ASP.NET 2.0 & 2.1 not targeting the meta-packages\r\n\r\n.NET Core projects have two types of dependencies: direct and transitive. You must update your projects using the following instructions to address both types of dependency.\r\n\r\n#### Direct dependencies\r\n\r\nDirect dependencies are discoverable by examining your `csproj` file. They can be fixed by [editing the project file](#direct-dependencies) or using NuGet to update the dependency.\r\n\r\n#### Transitive dependencies\r\n\r\nTransitive dependencies occur when you add a package to your project that in turn relies on another package. For example, if Contoso publishes a package `Contoso.Utility` which, in turn, depends on `Contoso.Internals` and you add the `Contoso.Utility` package to your project now your project has a direct dependency on `Contoso.Utility` and, because `Contoso.Utility` depends 'Contoso.Internals', your application gains a transitive dependency on the `Contoso.Internals` package.\r\n\r\nTransitive dependencies are reviewable in three ways, depending on your [project format](#project-format):\r\n\r\n* In the Visual Studio Solution Explorer window, which supports searching.\r\n* By examining the `project.assets.json` file contained in the obj directory of your project for `csproj` based projects.\r\n\r\nThe `project.assets.json`files are the authoritative list of all packages used by your project, containing both direct and transitive dependencies.\r\n\r\n#### <a name=\"direct-dependencies-vs2017\"></a>Fixing direct dependencies in Visual Studio 2017\r\n\r\nOpen *projectname.csproj* in your editor. If you're using Visual Studio, right-click the project and choose **Edit projectname.csproj** from the context menu, where projectname is the name of your project. Look for `PackageReference` elements. The following shows an example project file:\r\n\r\n```xml\r\n<Project Sdk=\"Microsoft.NET.Sdk.Web\">\r\n  <PropertyGroup>\r\n    <TargetFramework>netcoreapp2.0</TargetFramework>\r\n  </PropertyGroup>\r\n  <ItemGroup>\r\n    <PackageReference Include=\"Microsoft.AspNetCore.All\" Version=\"2.0.8\" />\r\n  </ItemGroup>\r\n</Project>\r\n```\r\n\r\nThe preceding example has a reference to the [vulnerable package](#affected-software), as seen by the single `PackageReference` element. The name of the package is in the `Include` attribute.\r\nThe package version number is in the `Version` attribute. The previous example shows a single direct dependency on `Microsoft.AspNetCore.All` version 2.0.0.\r\n\r\nTo update the version to the secure package, change the version number to the updated package version as listed on the table [previously](#affected-software).\r\nIn this example, update `Microsoft.AspNetCore.All` to the appropriate [fixed package number](#affected-software) for your major version. Save the *csproj* file. The example *csproj* now looks as follows:\r\n\r\n```xml\r\n<Project Sdk=\"Microsoft.NET.Sdk.Web\">\r\n  <PropertyGroup>\r\n    <TargetFramework>netcoreapp2.0</TargetFramework>\r\n  </PropertyGroup>\r\n  <ItemGroup>\r\n    <PackageReference Include=\"Microsoft.AspNetCore.All\" Version=\"2.0.9\" />\r\n  </ItemGroup>\r\n</Project>\r\n```\r\n\r\nIf you're using Visual Studio and you save your updated *csproj* file, Visual Studio will restore the new package version.\r\nYou can see the restore results by opening the **Output** window (Ctrl+Alt+O) and changing the **Show output from** drop-down list to **Package Manager**.\r\n\r\nIf you're not using Visual Studio, open a command line and change to your project directory. Execute the `dotnet restore` command to restore the updated dependencies.\r\n\r\nNow recompile your application. If after recompilation you see a *Dependency conflict warning*, you must update your other direct dependencies to versions that take a dependency on the updated package.\r\n\r\n#### Discovering and fixing transitive dependencies\r\n\r\nThere are two ways to view transitive dependencies. You can either [use Visual Studio’s Solution Explorer](#vs-solution-explorer), or you can review [the `project.assets.json` file](#project-assets-json) .\r\n\r\n##### <a name=\"vs-solution-explorer\"></a>Using Visual Studio Solution Explorer\r\n\r\nTo use Solution Explorer, open the project in Visual Studio, and then press Ctrl+; to activate the search in Solution Explorer. Search for the [vulnerable package](#affected-software) and make a note of the version numbers of any results you find.\r\n\r\nFor example, searching for `Microsoft.AspNetCore.Mvc.Core` in an example project that contains a package that takes a dependency on `Microsoft.AspNetCore.Mvc` shows the following results in Visual Studio 2017:\r\n\r\n![Screenshot of search results in Visual Studio 2017](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/796298/25858816/8ecdc2b4-3491-11e7-9363-746804bb9832.png)\r\n\r\nThe search results appear as a tree. In the previous results, you can see that a reference to `Microsoft.AspNetCore.Mvc.Core` version 1.1.2 is discovered.\r\n\r\nUnder the Dependencies node is a NuGet node. Under the NuGet node is the list of packages you have directly taken a dependency on and their versions.\r\nIn screenshot, the application takes a direct dependency on `Microsoft.AspNetCore.Mvc`. `Microsoft.AspNetCore.Mvc` in turn has leaf nodes that list its dependencies and their versions.\r\nThe `Microsoft.AspNetCore.Mvc` package takes a dependency on a version of `Microsoft.AspNetCore.Mvc.ApiExplorer`, that in turn takes a dependency on a version of `Microsoft.AspNetCore.Mvc.Core`.\r\n\r\n##### <a name=\"project-assets-json\"></a> Manually reviewing project.assets.json\r\n\r\nOpen the *project.assets.json* file from your project’s obj directory in your editor. We suggest you use an editor that understands JSON and allows you to collapse and expand nodes to review this file.\r\nVisual Studio and Visual Studio Code provide JSON friendly editing.\r\n\r\nSearch the *project.assets.json* file for the [vulnerable package](#affected-software), using the format `packagename/` for each of the package names from the preceding table. If you find the assembly name in your search:\r\n\r\n* Examine the line on which they are found, the version number is after the `/`.\r\n* Compare to the [vulnerable versions table](#affected-software).\r\n\r\nFor example, a search result that shows `Microsoft.AspNetCore.Server.Kestrel.Core/2.0.0` is a reference to version 2.0.0 of `Microsoft.AspNetCore.Server.Kestrel.Core`.\r\nIf your *project.assets.json* file includes references to the [vulnerable package](#affected-software), then you need to fix the transitive dependencies.\r\n\r\nIf you have not found any reference to any vulnerable packages, this means either\r\n\r\n* None of your direct dependencies depend on any vulnerable packages, or\r\n* You have already fixed the problem by updating the direct dependencies.\r\n\r\nIf your transitive dependency review found references to the [vulnerable package](#affected-software), you must add a direct dependency to the updated package to your *csproj* file to override the transitive dependency.\r\n\r\nOpen *projectname.csproj* in your editor. If you're using Visual Studio, right-click the project and choose **Edit projectname.csproj** from the context menu, where projectname is the name of your project.\r\nLook for `PackageReference` nodes, for example:\r\n\r\n```xml\r\n<Project Sdk=\"Microsoft.NET.Sdk.\">\r\n  <PropertyGroup>\r\n    <TargetFramework>net461</TargetFramework>\r\n  </PropertyGroup>\r\n  <ItemGroup>\r\n    <PackageReference Include=\"ThirdParty.NotUpdatedYet\" Version=\"2.0.0\" />\r\n  </ItemGroup>\r\n</Project>\r\n```\r\n\r\nYou must add a direct dependency to the updated version of the [vulnerable package](#affected-software) by adding it to the *csproj* file.\r\nYou do this by adding a new line to the dependencies section, referencing the fixed version.\r\nFor example, if your search showed a transitive reference to a vulnerable `Microsoft.AspNetCore.Server.Kestrel.Core` version, you'd add a reference to the [fixed package number](#affected-software).\r\n\r\n```xml\r\n<Project Sdk=\"Microsoft.NET.Sdk.Web\">\r\n  <PropertyGroup>\r\n    <TargetFramework>net461</TargetFramework>\r\n  </PropertyGroup>\r\n  <ItemGroup>\r\n    <PackageReference Include=\"Microsoft.AspNetCore.Server.Kestrel.Core\" Version=\"2.0.34 />\r\n    <PackageReference Include=\"ThirdParty.NotUpdatedYet\" Version=\"2.0.0\" />\r\n  </ItemGroup>\r\n</Project>\r\n```\r\n\r\nAfter you've added the direct dependency reference, save your *csproj* file.\r\n\r\nIf you're using Visual Studio, save your updated *csproj* file and Visual Studio will restore the new package versions.\r\nYou can see the restore results by opening the **Output** window (Ctrl+Alt+O) and changing the **Show output from** drop-down list to **Package Manager**.\r\n\r\nIf you're not using Visual Studio, open a command line and change to your project directory. Execute the `dotnet restore` command to restore the new dependencies.\r\n\r\n#### Rebuilding your application\r\n\r\nFinally you must rebuild your application, test, and redeploy.\r\n\r\n## Other Information\r\n\r\n### Reporting Security Issues\r\n\r\nIf you have found a potential security issue in .NET Core, please email details to secure@microsoft.com.

This advisory also provides guidance on what developers can do to update their applications to remove this vulnerability.\r\n\r\nMicrosoft is aware of a security feature bypass in ASP.NET Core when the number of incorrect login attempts is not validated. An attacker who successfully exploited this vulnerability could try an infinite number of authentication attempts.\r\n\r\nThe update addresses the vulnerability by correcting how ASP.NET Core validates the number of incorrect login attempts.\r\n\r\n## Discussion\r\n\r\nDiscussion for this issue can be found at https://github.com/aspnet/Identity/issues/1870\r\n\r\n### <a name=\"mitigation-factors\"></a>Mitigation factors\r\n\r\n* If your application does not use ASP.NET Core's implementation of multi-factor authentication you are not affected.\r\n\r\n## <a name=\"affected-software\"></a>Affected software\r\n\r\nAny ASP.NET Core based application that uses Microsoft.AspNetCore.Identity with a vulnerable version listed below.\r\n\r\nPackage name | Vulnerable versions | Secure versions\r\n------------ | ---------------- | -------------------------\r\nMicrosoft.AspNetCore.Identity | 1.0.0, 1.0.1, 1.0.2, 1.0.3, 1.0.4, 1.0.5 <br /> 1.1.0, 1.1.1, 1.1.2, 1.1.3, 1.1.4, 1.1.5 <br /> 2.0.0, 2.0.1, 2.0.2, 2.0.3 <br /> 2.1.0, 2.1.1 | 1.0.6 <br /> 1.1.6 <br /> 2.0.4 <br /> 2.1.2\r\n\r\n## <a name=\"advisory-faq\"></a>Advisory FAQ\r\n\r\n### <a name=\"how-affected\"></a>How do I know if I am affected?\r\n\r\n.NET Core has two types of dependencies: direct and transitive. Direct dependencies are dependencies where you specifically add a package to your project, transitive dependencies occur when you add a package to your project that in turn relies on another package.\r\n\r\nFor example, the `Microsoft.AspNetCore.Mvc` package depends on the `Microsoft.AspNetCore.Mvc.Core` package. When you add a dependency on `Microsoft.AspNetCore.Mvc` in your project, you're taking a transitive dependency on `Microsoft.AspNetCore.Mvc.Core`.\r\n\r\nAny application that has a direct or transitive dependency on the [affected package](#affected-software) can be exposed to the vulnerability if it does not meet any of the [mitigation factors](#mitigation-factors).\r\n\r\n### <a name=\"how-fix\"></a>How do I fix the issue?\r\n\r\n### ASP.NET Core 2.1\r\n\r\nTo update ASP.NET Core 2.1 you should [download](https://www.microsoft.com/net/download) and install the .NET Core SDK 2.1.302 on your development machines and build servers, and the .NET Core Runtime 2.1.2 on your deployment servers. Your application will roll forward to these versions on an application restart.\r\n\r\n### ASP.NET Core 2.0\r\n\r\nIf you're targeting ASP.NET Core 2.0 and using the `Microsoft.AspNetCore.All` metapackage update its version number to 2.0.9 to update the `Microsoft.AspNetCore.Identity` package, recompile, and redeploy. On your deployment servers, you should [download](https://github.com/dotnet/core/blob/master/release-notes/download-archives/2.0.9-download.md) and install the .NET Core 2.0.9 using the Windows Server Hosting Bundle for Windows and the `dotnet-hosting-2.0.9` package for Linux servers.\r\n\r\n### ASP.NET Core 1.0, 1.1 or 2.0 not targeting the metapackage.\r\n\r\n.NET Core projects have two types of dependencies: direct and transitive. You must update your projects using the following instructions to address both types of dependency.\r\n\r\n### <a name=\"project-format\"></a>.NET Core Project formats\r\n\r\n.NET Core has two different project file formats, depending on what software created the project.\r\n\r\n1. `project.json` is the format used in .NET Core 1.0 and Microsoft Visual Studio 2015.\r\n2. `csproj` is the format used in .NET Core 1.1, .NET Core 2.0 and Microsoft Visual Studio 2017.\r\n\r\n#### Direct dependencies\r\n\r\nDirect dependencies are discoverable by examining your `csproj` file or your `project.json` file. They can be fixed by [editing the project file](#direct-dependencies) or using NuGet to update the dependency.\r\n\r\n#### Transitive dependencies\r\n\r\nTransitive dependencies occur when you add a package to your project that in turn relies on another package. For example, if Contoso publishes a package `Contoso.Utility` which, in turn, depends on `Contoso.Internals` and you add the `Contoso.Utility` package to your project now your project has a direct dependency on `Contoso.Utility` and, because `Contoso.Utility` depends 'Contoso.Internals', your application gains a transitive dependency on the `Contoso.Internals` package.\r\n\r\nTransitive dependencies are reviewable in three ways, depending on your [project format](#project-format):\r\n\r\n* In the Visual Studio Solution Explorer window, which supports searching.\r\n* By examining the `project.assets.json` file contained in the obj directory of your project for `csproj` based projects *OR*.\r\n* By examining the `project.lock.json` file contained in the root directory of your project for `project.json` based projects.\r\n\r\nThe `project.assets.json` and `project.lock.json` files are the authoritative list of all packages used by your project, containing both direct and transitive dependencies.\r\n\r\n#### <a name=\"direct-dependencies-vs2017\"></a>Fixing direct dependencies in a csproj based project / Visual Studio 2017\r\n\r\nOpen *projectname.csproj* in your editor. If you're using Visual Studio, right-click the project and choose **Edit projectname.csproj** from the context menu, where projectname is the name of your project. Look for `PackageReference` elements. The following shows an example project file:\r\n\r\n```xml\r\n<Project Sdk=\"Microsoft.NET.Sdk.Web\">\r\n  <PropertyGroup>\r\n    <TargetFramework>netcoreapp2.0</TargetFramework>\r\n  </PropertyGroup>\r\n  <ItemGroup>\r\n    <PackageReference Include=\"Microsoft.AspNetCore.Identity\" Version=\"2.0.0\" />\r\n  </ItemGroup>\r\n</Project>\r\n```\r\n\r\nThe preceding example has a reference to the [vulnerable package](#affected-software), as seen by the single `PackageReference` element. The name of the package is in the `Include` attribute.\r\nThe package version number is in the `Version` attribute. The previous example shows a single direct dependency on `Microsoft.AspNetCore.Identity` version 2.0.0.\r\n\r\nTo update the version to the secure package, change the version number to the updated package version as listed on the table [previously](#affected-software).\r\nIn this example, update `Microsoft.AspNetCore.Identity` to the appropriate [fixed package number](#affected-software) for your major version. Save the *csproj* file. The example *csproj* now looks as follows:\r\n\r\n```xml\r\n<Project Sdk=\"Microsoft.NET.Sdk.Web\">\r\n  <PropertyGroup>\r\n    <TargetFramework>netcoreapp2.0</TargetFramework>\r\n  </PropertyGroup>\r\n  <ItemGroup>\r\n    <PackageReference Include=\"Microsoft.AspNetCore.Identity\" Version=\"2.0.4\" />\r\n  </ItemGroup>\r\n</Project>\r\n```\r\n\r\nIf you're using Visual Studio and you save your updated *csproj* file, Visual Studio will restore the new package version.\r\nYou can see the restore results by opening the **Output** window (Ctrl+Alt+O) and changing the **Show output from** drop-down list to **Package Manager**.\r\n\r\nIf you're not using Visual Studio, open a command line and change to your project directory. Execute the `dotnet restore` command to restore the updated dependencies.\r\n\r\nNow recompile your application. If after recompilation you see a *Dependency conflict warning*, you must update your other direct dependencies to versions that take a dependency on the updated package.\r\n\r\n#### <a name=\"direct-dependencies-vs2015\"></a> Fixing Direct Dependencies in project.json based project / Visual Studio 2015\r\n\r\nOpen your `project.json` file in your editor. Look for the dependencies section. Below is an example dependencies section:\r\n\r\n``` json\r\n    \"dependencies\": {\r\n      \"Microsoft.NETCore.App\": {\r\n        \"version\": \"1.0.1\",\r\n        \"type\": \"platform\"\r\n      },\r\n     \"Microsoft.AspNetCore.Mvc.Core\": \"1.0.6\",\r\n     \"Microsoft.AspNetCore.Identity\" : \"1.0.5\"\r\n    }\r\n```\r\n\r\nThis example has three direct dependencies: `Microsoft.NETCore.App`, `Microsoft.AspNetCore.Mvc.Core` and `Microsoft.AspNetCore.Identity`.\r\n\r\n`Microsoft.NetCore.App` is the platform the application targets, you should ignore this. The other packages expose their version to the right of the package name. In our example, our non-platform packages are version 1.0.1.\r\n\r\nReview your direct dependencies for any instance of the packages and versions listed above. In the example above, there is a direct dependency on a vulnerable package, `Microsoft.AspNetCore.Identity` version 1.0.5.\r\n\r\nTo update to the fixed package, change the version number to be the appropriate package for your release. In the example, this would be updating `Microsoft.AspNetCore.Identity` to 1.0.6.\r\n\r\nAfter updating the vulnerable package versions, save your `project.json` file.\r\n\r\nThe dependencies section in our example `project.json` would now look as follows:\r\n\r\n```json\r\n  \"dependencies\": {\r\n    \"Microsoft.NETCore.App\": {\r\n      \"version\": \"1.0.1\",\r\n      \"type\": \"platform\"\r\n    },\r\n    \"Microsoft.AspNetCore.Mvc.Core\": \"1.0.6\",\r\n    \"Microsoft.AspNetCore.Identity \": \"1.0.6\"\r\n  }\r\n```\r\n\r\nIf you are using Visual Studio and save your updated `project.json` file, Visual Studio will restore the new package version. You can see the restore results by opening the Output Window (Ctrl+Alt+O) and changing the Show output from drop-down list to Package Manager.\r\n\r\nIf you are not using Visual Studio, open a command line and change to your project directory. Execute the `dotnet restore` command to restore your new dependency.\r\n\r\nAfter you have addressed all of your direct dependencies, you must also review your transitive dependencies.\r\n\r\nAfter you've addressed all of your direct dependencies, you must review your transitive dependencies.\r\n\r\n#### Discovering and fixing transitive dependencies\r\n\r\nThere are two ways to view transitive dependencies. You can either [use Visual Studio’s Solution Explorer](#vs-solution-explorer), or you can review [the `project.assets.json` file](#project-assets-json) or the [the `project.lock.json` file](#project-lock-json).\r\n\r\n##### <a name=\"vs-solution-explorer\"></a>Using Visual Studio Solution Explorer\r\n\r\nTo use Solution Explorer, open the project in Visual Studio, and then press Ctrl+; to activate the search in Solution Explorer. Search for the [vulnerable package](#affected-software) and make a note of the version numbers of any results you find.\r\n\r\nFor example, searching for `Microsoft.AspNetCore.Mvc.Core` in an example project that contains a package that takes a dependency on `Microsoft.AspNetCore.Mvc` shows the following results in Visual Studio 2017:\r\n\r\n![Screenshot of search results in Visual Studio 2017](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/796298/25858816/8ecdc2b4-3491-11e7-9363-746804bb9832.png)\r\n\r\nThe search results appear as a tree. In the previous results, you can see that a reference to `Microsoft.AspNetCore.Mvc.Core` version 1.1.2 is discovered.\r\n\r\nUnder the Dependencies node is a NuGet node. Under the NuGet node is the list of packages you have directly taken a dependency on and their versions.\r\nIn screenshot, the application takes a direct dependency on `Microsoft.AspNetCore.Mvc`. `Microsoft.AspNetCore.Mvc` in turn has leaf nodes that list its dependencies and their versions.\r\nThe `Microsoft.AspNetCore.Mvc` package takes a dependency on a version of `Microsoft.AspNetCore.Mvc.ApiExplorer`, that in turn takes a dependency on a version of `Microsoft.AspNetCore.Mvc.Core`.\r\n\r\n##### <a name=\"project-assets-json\"></a> Manually reviewing project.assets.json (csproj/VS2017)\r\n\r\nOpen the *project.assets.json* file from your project’s obj directory in your editor. We suggest you use an editor that understands JSON and allows you to collapse and expand nodes to review this file.\r\nVisual Studio and Visual Studio Code provide JSON friendly editing.\r\n\r\nSearch the *project.assets.json* file for the [vulnerable package](#affected-software), using the format `packagename/` for each of the package names from the preceding table. If you find the assembly name in your search:\r\n\r\n* Examine the line on which they are found, the version number is after the `/`.\r\n* Compare to the [vulnerable versions table](#affected-software).\r\n\r\nFor example, a search result that shows `Microsoft.AspNetCore.Identity/2.0.0` is a reference to version 2.0.0 of `Microsoft.AspNetCore.Identity`.\r\nIf your *project.assets.json* file includes references to the [vulnerable package](#affected-software), then you need to fix the transitive dependencies.\r\n\r\nIf you have not found any reference to any vulnerable packages, this means either\r\n\r\n* None of your direct dependencies depend on any vulnerable packages, or\r\n* You have already fixed the problem by updating the direct dependencies.\r\n\r\nIf your transitive dependency review found references to the [vulnerable package](#affected-software), you must add a direct dependency to the updated package to your *csproj* file to override the transitive dependency.\r\n\r\nOpen *projectname.csproj* in your editor. If you're using Visual Studio, right-click the project and choose **Edit projectname.csproj** from the context menu, where projectname is the name of your project.\r\nLook for `PackageReference` nodes, for example:\r\n\r\n```xml\r\n<Project Sdk=\"Microsoft.NET.Sdk.\">\r\n  <PropertyGroup>\r\n    <TargetFramework>net461</TargetFramework>\r\n  </PropertyGroup>\r\n  <ItemGroup>\r\n    <PackageReference Include=\"ThirdParty.NotUpdatedYet\" Version=\"2.0.0\" />\r\n  </ItemGroup>\r\n</Project>\r\n```\r\n\r\nYou must add a direct dependency to the updated version of the [vulnerable package](#affected-software) by adding it to the *csproj* file.\r\nYou do this by adding a new line to the dependencies section, referencing the fixed version.\r\nFor example, if your search showed a transitive reference to a vulnerable `Microsoft.AspNetCore.Identity` version, you'd add a reference to the [fixed package number](#affected-software).\r\n\r\n```xml\r\n<Project Sdk=\"Microsoft.NET.Sdk.Web\">\r\n  <PropertyGroup>\r\n    <TargetFramework>net461</TargetFramework>\r\n  </PropertyGroup>\r\n  <ItemGroup>\r\n    <PackageReference Include=\"Microsoft.AspNetCore.Identity\" Version=\"2.0.4\" />\r\n    <PackageReference Include=\"ThirdParty.NotUpdatedYet\" Version=\"2.0.0\" />\r\n  </ItemGroup>\r\n</Project>\r\n```\r\n\r\nAfter you've added the direct dependency reference, save your *csproj* file.\r\n\r\nIf you're using Visual Studio, save your updated *csproj* file and Visual Studio will restore the new package versions.\r\nYou can see the restore results by opening the **Output** window (Ctrl+Alt+O) and changing the **Show output from** drop-down list to **Package Manager**.\r\n\r\nIf you're not using Visual Studio, open a command line and change to your project directory. Execute the `dotnet restore` command to restore the new dependencies.\r\n\r\n##### <a name=\"project-lock-json\"></a> Manually reviewing project.lock.json (project.json/VS2015)\r\n\r\nOpen the `project.lock.json` file in your editor. We suggest you use an editor that understands json and allows you to collapse and expand nodes to review this file; both Visual Studio and Visual Studio Code provide this functionality.\r\n\r\nIf you are using Visual Studio the `project.lock.json` file is “under” the `project.json` file. Click the right pointing triangle, ▷, to the left of the `project.json` file to expand the solution tree to expose the `project.lock.json` file. The following image shows a project with the `project.json` file expanded to show the `project.lock.json` file.\r\n\r\n![project lock json](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/796298/25858179/f6e01200-348f-11e7-8a77-7176d8dd3f03.png)\r\n\r\nSearch the `project.lock.json` file for the vulnerable packages, using the format `packagename/`, using each of the package names from the table above. If you find any vulnerable assembly name in your search examine the line on which they are found, the version number is after the `/` and compare to the vulnerable versions table above. For example a search result that shows `Microsoft.AspNetCore.Identity/1.0.1` is a reference to v1.0.1 of `Microsoft.AspNetCore.Identity`.   If your `project.lock.json` file includes references to any of the package versions shown above then you will need to fix the transitive dependencies.\r\n\r\nIf you have not found any reference to a vulnerable version of  `Microsoft.AspNetCore.Identity` this means none of your direct dependencies depend on any vulnerable packages or you have already fixed the problem by updating the direct dependencies.\r\n\r\nIf your transitive dependency review found references to any of the vulnerable packages you must add a direct dependency to the updated package to your `project.json` file to override the transitive dependency. Open your `project.json` and find the dependencies section. For example:\r\n\r\n``` json\r\n  \"dependencies\": {\r\n    \"Microsoft.NETCore.App\": {\r\n      \"version\": \"1.0.1\",\r\n      \"type\": \"platform\"\r\n    },\r\n    \"Microsoft.AspNetCore.Mvc\": \"1.0.0\"\r\n  }\r\n```\r\n\r\nFor each of the vulnerable packages your search returned you must add a direct dependency to the updated version by adding it to the `project.json` file. You do this by adding a new line to the dependencies section, referring the fixed version. For example, if your search showed a transitive reference to the vulnerable `Microsoft.AspNetCore.Identity` version 1.0.0 you would add a reference to the appropriate fixed version, 1.0.6. Edit the `project.json` file as follows:\r\n\r\n``` json\r\n  \"dependencies\": {\r\n    \"Microsoft.NETCore.App\": {\r\n      \"version\": \"1.0.1\",\r\n      \"type\": \"platform\"\r\n    },\r\n    \"Microsoft.AspNetCore.Identity\": \"1.0.6\",\r\n    \"Microsoft.AspNetCore.Mvc\": \"1.0.0\"\r\n  }\r\n```\r\n\r\nAfter you have added direct dependencies to the fixed packages, save your `project.json` file.\r\n\r\nIf you are using Visual Studio save your updated `project.json` file and Visual Studio will restore the new package versions. You can see the restore results by opening the Output Window (Ctrl+Alt+O) and changing the Show output from drop-down list to Package Manager.\r\n\r\nIf you are not using Visual Studio open a command line and change to your project directory. Execute the `dotnet restore` command to restore your new dependencies.\r\n\r\n#### Rebuilding your application\r\n\r\nFinally you must rebuild your application, test, and redeploy.\r\n\r\n## Other Information\r\n\r\n### Reporting Security Issues\r\n\r\nIf you have found a potential security issue in .NET Core, please email details to secure@microsoft.com.

We are concentrating most of our efforts to add new functionality on the 3.0 release. Still, you can expect 2.2 to include lots of bugs fixes, community contributions and small improvements.\r\n\r\nYou can access the list of issues currently assigned to the 2.2 milestone using [this query](https://github.com/aspnet/EntityFrameworkCore/issues?q=is%3Aopen+is%3Aissue+milestone%3A2.2.0+sort%3Areactions-%2B1-desc) on our issue tracking system.  \r\n\r\n## Schedule\r\nThe schedule of EF Core 2.2 will align with the schedule of .NET Core and ASP.NET Core 2.2. See [the ASP.NET Core 2.2 Roadmap announcement](https://github.com/aspnet/Announcements/issues/307).\r\n\r\nOur current plan is to have three previews before we ship RTM near the end of 2018:\r\n\r\n- August – Preview 1\r\n- September - Preview 2\r\n- October - Preview 3\r\n- Before end-of-year – RTM\r\n\r\n As usual, this post reflects our current plan, but things may change as we make progress. \r\n\r\n## New features\r\n\r\n### Reverse engineering of database views into query types\r\n\r\nIn EF Core 2.1 we added query types, which allow mapping .NET objects to views and tables without keys. In 2.2, we plan to leverage this new capability to automatically map existing database views to query types. \r\n\r\nYou can track the progress of this at https://github.com/aspnet/EntityFrameworkCore/issues/1679.\r\n\r\n###  Support for collections of owned entities\r\n\r\nIn EF Core 2.0 we added the concept of owned entity types, which allows modeling ownership relationship that are common between entities that are part of the same document in document-oriented databases or the same aggregate if you use Domain-Driven Design concepts in your model.\r\n\r\nUntil now, we only support reference navigation properties to owned entities. In EF Core 2.2, we plan to enhance this functionality to map collection navigation properties to owned entities. \r\n\r\nYou can track the progress of this at https://github.com/aspnet/EntityFrameworkCore/issues/8172.\r\n\r\n## Other work\r\n\r\nThere are some additional work items that are not strictly EF Core 2.2 features, but we still track as part of the 2.2 milestone because we are doing the work in the same timeframe:\r\n\r\n### Cosmos DB provider\r\n\r\nA lot of our efforts are going into productizing an EF Core provider for the SQL API in Cosmos DB.\r\nWe have already created a prototype, which we have shown in demos such as in this [this EF Core 2.1 talk](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k55kDH_ixrQ) we did at the Microsoft Build conference.\r\n\r\nDue to competing priorities, releasing a preview of this provider has taken more than what we originally planned, but we are working on it now, and the current plan is to release a stable version by the end of this calendar year.\r\n\r\nYou can track our progress on this issue: https://github.com/aspnet/EntityFrameworkCore/issues/12086. \r\n\r\n### Preview of spatial support for SQL Server\r\n\r\nWe are also focusing on adding spatial support as an extension to the SQL Server provider for EF Core.\r\nNote that the PostgreSQL provider (Npgsql) already added support in EF Core 2.1. Beside implementing this functionality for SQL Server, we are working closely with the developers of Npgsql to try to achieve a consistent and hopefully improved experience across providers.\r\n\r\nNote that we aren't committing to having a final version of the spatial support for the end of the current calendar year. But we are actively working on this now, and as we make progress, we should be able to provide a more precise estimate.   \r\n\r\nYou can track our progress on this issue: https://github.com/aspnet/EntityFrameworkCore/issues/1100.\r\n\r\n### Improve test coverage for LINQ and reduce query regressions in future releases\r\n\r\nIn the last few releases, we have seen that when we commit improvements to our LINQ implementation, we often break queries that were previously working. The main challenge is that LINQ defines a huge space of possible queries to test, and it is very complex to measure what level of test coverage we have, even for a specific query operator. In the 2.2 timeframe, we will be investing on improving test coverage for this huge space. We also plan to experiment with new approaches to add appropriate coverage, and to reduce the likelihood of introducing regressions in future releases.\r\n\r\nYou can track our progress on this at https://github.com/aspnet/EntityFrameworkCore/issues/12046. \r\n\r\nFor discussion on this roadmap, please use https://github.com/aspnet/EntityFrameworkCore/issues/12465. ","Url":"https://github.com/aspnet/Announcements/issues/308","RelatedDescription":"Open issue \"EF Core 2.2 Roadmap\" (#308)"},{"Id":"335571873","IsPullRequest":false,"CreatedAt":"2018-06-25T21:19:36","Actor":"glennc","Number":"307","RawContent":null,"Title":"ASP.NET Core 2.2 Roadmap","State":"open","Body":"We have grouped the ASP.NET Core 2.2 release into a few themes:\r\n\r\n- APIs & Services\r\n- Server improvements\r\n- SignalR\r\n\r\n## Rough Schedule\r\nWe are currently planning to have 3 previews before RTM:\r\n - August – Preview 1\r\n - September - Preview 2\r\n - October - Preview 3\r\n - Before End-of-year – RTM\r\n\r\nAs with our previous roadmap posts this is what we intend right now, but it's subject to change as we continue development.\r\n\r\n## APIs and Services\r\n\r\nThe 'north star' for this version is to generate better metadata about your app and use that data to make your dev experience better and more productive. This is the main focus for 2.2.\r\n\r\n### API Controller conventions\r\nIn 2.1 we added controller specific conventions that make Web API development more convenient with the [ApiController attribute](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/aspnet/core/web-api/index?view=aspnetcore-2.1#annotate-class-with-apicontrollerattribute). In 2.2 we want to expand on this concept to provide metadata for API Explorer and provide a better end-to-end API documentation experience.\r\n\r\nWe want to make it possible for all MVC Core applications to have a good Swagger/OpenAPI definition by default. By following common patterns, your actions will produce rich metadata without falling into 'attribute soup' where you list every possible status code that every action in your app could return. We will include a default set of conventions that match what ASP.NET Core scaffolding generations. It will also be possible to write and share your own conventions to reflect your desired contracts. \r\n\r\nWe will include a set of analyzers that will help you find cases where code that doesn't match the API Explorer metadata, and a code-fix that provides options to explicitly specify the response type metadata, create a new convention with a different pattern, or just let you write code to satisfy the convention.\r\n\r\nAs a concrete example, you could write a convention that says \"every action method that starts with 'Create' will return an HTTP 201\". If you wrote the following code, then you would receive a warning.\r\n\r\n```csharp\r\n[HttpPost(\"/orders\")]\r\npublic ActionResult<Order> CreateOrder(OrderData orderData)\r\n{\r\n    ....\r\n    return Ok(new Order() {...});\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nThis code doesn't match your Swagger/OpenAPI metadata (from the convention) - which says that this action returns a 201. Once you see this, you could `ctrl + .` to add the attributes for what we do know about this method, opting out of conventions, or you could change the code.\r\n\r\nThe analyzer will also be able to 'check your work' if you are being explicit about status codes and results using the existing attributes - it does not require you to use the conventions. Details for how this will all work can be discussed here: https://github.com/aspnet/Mvc/issues/7802\r\n\r\nLet's look at a more fleshed-out out example. The following code snippet is what is required to generate a reasonable Open API document for an action method that will get an item by ID or return a 404:\r\n\r\n```csharp\r\n[ApiController]\r\npublic class CatalogController : ControllerBase\r\n{\r\n    [HttpGet]\r\n    [Route(\"items/{id:int}\")]\r\n    [ProducesResponseType((int)HttpStatusCode.NotFound)]\r\n    [ProducesResponseType(typeof(CatalogItem),(int)HttpStatusCode.OK)]\r\n    public async Task<ActionResult<CatalogItem>> GetItemById(int id)\r\n    {\r\n    }\r\n    ...\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nIn 2.2 with the default conventions the following code should generate the same Open API document that the above code sample does, and this shipped analyzers will give you hints when you do something that doesn't match so you know to go and add attributes or change the conventions:\r\n\r\n```csharp\r\n[ApiController]\r\npublic class CatalogController : ControllerBase\r\n{\r\n    [HttpGet]\r\n    [Route(\"items/{id:int}\")]\r\n    public async Task<ActionResult<CatalogItem>> GetItemById(int id)\r\n    {\r\n    }\r\n    ...\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\n### OpenAPI generation\r\nWith the conventions described above it will be possible for code that uses the API Explorer to generate Open API documents to be better by default, since the code you write will either follow the conventions or have attributes allowing generators to create better documents.\r\n\r\n### Dispatcher\r\nIn 2.2 we will introduce a new routing system that will expand the set of scenarios where routing is useful – tentatively called Dispatcher. \r\n\r\nThe current routing system was designed to support MVC’s historical scenarios without much thought to how routing and the composable middleware pipeline will work together. The Dispatcher is designed to run the URL matching step very early in the pipeline so that middleware can see the Endpoint that was selected as well as metadata that is associated with that endpoint. Like existing routing, the dispatcher will branch and call the actual endpoint at the end of the pipeline.\r\n\r\nA concrete example of how this helps us is with CORS. Today there is both a CORS middleware AND a CORS feature of MVC (https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/aspnet/core/security/cors?view=aspnetcore-2.1). Because routing information is deeply integrated with MVC we can't apply CORS policies that only apply to specific controllers until after we know what controller has been selected. However, if you also want CORS policies to apply to other parts of your pipeline then you need the middleware. This has been a source of confusion for many and we can simplify it if all of the middleware pipeline can have as much information about routing as MVC does today.\r\n\r\nWe’re also using this opportunity to make improvements to the performance of routing and dispatching for MVC and other scenarios.\r\n\r\n### HTTP API REPL tooling\r\nToday there are no tools built into Visual Studio or the dotnet CLI to help you execute HTTP verbs against your API. We have a great language, debugger, and framework but they are somewhat limited when it's difficult to send a POST to my app to see what happens. In 2.2 we want to build a CLI experience for exploring HTTP APIs to imcrease your API inner loop productivity. The CLI builds on all the features we've talked about above as some of its advanced features, like listing all routes in your app, are enabled by consuming the metadata we have about your app via Open API documents. That means the CLI should be useful for executing any HTTP verb, but really shines when you feed it more data like Open API docs. We intend to start by shipping this as a standalone global tool while we explore its feature set and potential.\r\n\r\nYou can see a demo and description of this in Scott Hunter and Scott Hanselman's BUILD talk here: https://youtu.be/KAIJ3ezQb3c?t=18m\r\n\r\n### API client generation (C# & TypeScript)\r\nOnce you have an API with rich metadata and done exploring and testing it, then you need to go and write some client code to call and make use of your API. We are going to build an experience for generating this code based on the same data and documentation described above. We envision a few pieces for this story, one part is a dotnet tool that can generate code from an Open API document, the other is MSBuild SDK work to allow a `ServiceReference` to another project in a solution. That reference will cause build time client code generation to happen via the tool that can generate code. We expect this to work in a similar way to the EF Core tooling experience, where your application is built and most of your startup code executed but instead of running it we use the data we have about your code to generate a client.\r\n\r\n### Authorization Server\r\nOne of the largest gaps we’ve had has been around authorization for applications beyond a simple forms based login. We plan to fill that gap with a simple to use OpenID Connect based authorization server, which will allow your ASP.NET application to act as an authentication point for your projects, be they web site to API, SPA to API, native application to an API or, for distributed applications API to API. As we are concentrating on first party applications we can make the code you need to plumb in trivial, getting as close to zero configuration as you can,  we’re not aiming to replace the excellent third-party solutions out there which enable richer scenarios like third-party applications or which provide a flexibility in configuration and authentication flow.\r\n\r\n## Server Improvements\r\n\r\n### Health Checks\r\nThis feature is a way to trivially setup an endpoint in your application that can be used to check the health of your application, potentially taking into account things like memory consumption or database availability as well as just \"can I accept a HTTP request\".\r\n\r\n### HTTP/2 in Kestrel & HttpClient\r\nThe title says it all in this case. HTTP/2 support for all. We started this work some time ago, and have had the protocol mostly implemented for a while but not compiled into the product since it wasn't ready. This version we will finish that work and implement the missing features.\r\n\r\n### In-proc ANCM\r\nRunning ASP.NET Core applications in-process in IIS, giving a significant performance boost.\r\n\r\n## SignalR\r\n\r\n### Add Java & C++ clients\r\nAllow customers using Java or C++ to connect to SignalR servers, and the [Azure SignalR Service](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/blog/azure-signalr-service-a-fully-managed-service-to-add-real-time-functionality/).\r\n\r\n## Other\r\nAs with all releases there is a large tail of bug fixes, performance improvements, small features, and community PRs that we will also work on. You can see the full list of work by browsing the 2.2 milestones on the various [repositories](https://github.com/aspnet/).\r\n\r\nFor discussion on the roadmap in general, use https://github.com/aspnet/Home/issues/3265","Url":"https://github.com/aspnet/Announcements/issues/307","RelatedDescription":"Open issue \"ASP.NET Core 2.2 Roadmap\" (#307)"},{"Id":"333804954","IsPullRequest":false,"CreatedAt":"2018-06-19T19:21:13","Actor":"anurse","Number":"306","RawContent":null,"Title":"SignalR Client 2.1.1 in UWP apps with Minimum Version of 1803","State":"open","Body":"ASP.NET Core 2.1.1 contains fixes to resolve blocking issues when using the SignalR Client from UWP applications where the minimum version is set to \"Windows 10, version 1803\".

Direct dependencies are dependencies where you specifically add a package to your project, transitive dependencies occur when you add a package to your project that in turn relies on another package.\r\n\r\nFor example, the `Microsoft.AspNetCore.Mvc` package depends on the `Microsoft.AspNetCore.Mvc.Core` package. When you add a dependency on `Microsoft.AspNetCore.Mvc` in your project, you're taking a transitive dependency on `Microsoft.AspNetCore.Mvc.Core`.\r\n\r\nAny application that has a direct or transitive dependency on the [affected packages](#affected-software) can be exposed to the vulnerability.\r\n\r\n### How do I fix the issue?\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\nIf you're targeting .NET Core 2.x and the `Microsoft.AspNetCore.All` \"metapackage\":\r\n\r\n* Update its version number to 2.0.8 if you have targetted 2.0.x *OR*\r\n* Update its version number to 2.1.0-rc1-final if you have targetted previews of 2.1\r\n\r\nUpdating the metapackage will update the [affected packages](#affected-software)\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n.NET Core projects have two types of dependencies: direct and transitive. You must update your projects using the following instructions to address both types of dependency.\r\n\r\n#### Direct dependencies\r\n\r\nDirect dependencies are discoverable by examining your *csproj* file. They can be fixed by [editing the csproj file](#direct-dependencies) or using NuGet to update the dependency.\r\n\r\n#### Transitive dependencies\r\n\r\nTransitive dependencies occur when you add a package to your project that in turn relies on another package. For example, if Contoso publishes a package `Contoso.Utility` which, in turn, depends on `Contoso.Internals` and you add the `Contoso.Utility` package to your project now your project has a direct dependency on `Contoso.Utility` and, because `Contoso.Utility` depends 'Contoso.Internals', your application gains a transitive dependency on the `Contoso.Internals` package.\r\n\r\nTransitive dependencies are reviewable in two ways:\r\n\r\n* In the Visual Studio Solution Explorer window, which supports searching.\r\n* By examining the *project.assets.json* file contained in the obj directory of your project.\r\n\r\nThe *project.assets.json* files are the authoritative list of all packages used by your project, containing both direct and transitive dependencies.\r\n\r\n#### <a name=\"direct-dependencies\"></a>Fixing direct dependencies\r\n\r\nOpen *projectname.csproj* in your editor. If you're using Visual Studio, right-click the project and choose **Edit projectname.csproj** from the context menu, where projectname is the name of your project. Look for `PackageReference` elements. The following shows an example project file:\r\n\r\n```xml\r\n<Project Sdk=\"Microsoft.NET.Sdk\">\r\n  <PropertyGroup>\r\n    <TargetFramework>netcoreapp2.0</TargetFramework>\r\n  </PropertyGroup>\r\n  <ItemGroup>\r\n    <PackageReference Include=\"Microsoft.AspNetCore.Server.Kestrel.Core\" Version=\"2.0.1\" />\r\n  </ItemGroup>\r\n</Project>\r\n```\r\n\r\nThe preceding example has a reference to a [vulnerable package](#affected-software), as seen by the single `PackageReference` element. The name of the package is in the `Include` attribute.\r\nThe package version number is in the `Version` attribute. The previous example shows a single direct dependency on `Microsoft.AspNetCore.Server.Kestrel.Core` version 2.0.1.\r\n\r\nTo update the version to the secure package, change the version number to the updated package version as listed on the table [previously](#affected-software).\r\nIn this example, update `Microsoft.AspNetCore.Server.Kestrel.Core` to a [fixed package number](#affected-software). Save the *csproj* file. The example *csproj* now looks as follows:\r\n\r\n```xml\r\n<Project Sdk=\"Microsoft.NET.Sdk\">\r\n  <PropertyGroup>\r\n    <TargetFramework>netcoreapp2.0</TargetFramework>\r\n  </PropertyGroup>\r\n  <ItemGroup>\r\n    <PackageReference Include=\"Microsoft.AspNetCore.Server.Kestrel.Core\" Version=\"2.0.3 />\r\n  </ItemGroup>\r\n</Project>\r\n```\r\n\r\nIf you're using Visual Studio and you save your updated *csproj* file, Visual Studio will restore the new package version.\r\nYou can see the restore results by opening the **Output** window (Ctrl+Alt+O) and changing the **Show output from** drop-down list to **Package Manager**.\r\n\r\nIf you're not using Visual Studio, open a command line and change to your project directory. Execute the `dotnet restore` command to restore the updated dependencies.\r\n\r\nNow recompile your application. If after recompilation you see a *Dependency conflict warning*, you must update your other direct dependencies to versions that take a dependency on the updated package.\r\n\r\nAfter you've addressed all of your direct dependencies, you must review your transitive dependencies.\r\n\r\n#### Discovering and fixing transitive dependencies\r\n\r\nThere are two ways to view transitive dependencies. You can either [use Visual Studio’s Solution Explorer](#vs-solution-explorer), or you can [review the *project.assets.json* file](#project-assets-json).\r\n\r\n##### <a name=\"vs-solution-explorer\"></a>Using Visual Studio Solution Explorer\r\n\r\nTo use Solution Explorer, open the project in Visual Studio 2017, and then press Ctrl+; to activate the search in Solution Explorer. Search for each of the [vulnerable packages](#affected-software) and make a note of the version numbers of any results you find.\r\n\r\nFor example, searching for `Microsoft.AspNetCore.Mvc.Core` in an example project that contains a package that takes a dependency on `Microsoft.AspNetCore.Mvc` shows the following results in Visual Studio 2017:\r\n\r\n![Screenshot of search results in Visual Studio 2017](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/796298/25858816/8ecdc2b4-3491-11e7-9363-746804bb9832.png)\r\n\r\nThe search results appear as a tree. In the previous results, you can see that a reference to `Microsoft.AspNetCore.Mvc.Core` version 1.1.2 is discovered.\r\n\r\nUnder the Dependencies node is a NuGet node. Under the NuGet node is the list of packages you have directly taken a dependency on and their versions.\r\nIn screenshot, the application takes a direct dependency on `Microsoft.AspNetCore.Mvc`. `Microsoft.AspNetCore.Mvc` in turn has leaf nodes that list its dependencies and their versions.\r\nThe `Microsoft.AspNetCore.Mvc` package takes a dependency on a version of `Microsoft.AspNetCore.Mvc.ApiExplorer`, that in turn takes a dependency on a version of `Microsoft.AspNetCore.Mvc.Core`.\r\n\r\n##### <a name=\"project-assets-json\"></a>Manually reviewing project.assets.json\r\n\r\nOpen the *project.assets.json* file from your project’s obj directory in your editor. We suggest you use an editor that understands JSON and allows you to collapse and expand nodes to review this file.\r\nVisual Studio and Visual Studio Code provide JSON friendly editing.\r\n\r\nSearch the *project.assets.json* file for the [vulnerable package](#affected-software), using the format `packagename/` for each of the package names from the preceding table. If you find the assembly name in your search:\r\n\r\n* Examine the line on which they are found, the version number is after the `/`.\r\n* Compare to the [vulnerable versions table](#affected-software).\r\n\r\nFor example, a search result that shows `System.Security.Cryptography.Xml/4.4.0` is a reference to version 4.4.0 of `System.Security.Cryptography.Xml`.\r\nIf your *project.assets.json* file includes references to the [vulnerable package](#affected-software), then you need to fix the transitive dependencies.\r\n\r\n##### Fixing transitive dependencies\r\n\r\nIf you have not found any reference to any vulnerable packages, this means either\r\n\r\n* None of your direct dependencies depend on any vulnerable packages, or\r\n* You have already fixed the problem by updating the direct dependencies.\r\n\r\nIf your transitive dependency review found references to the [vulnerable package](#affected-software), you must add a direct dependency to the updated package to your *csproj* file to override the transitive dependency.\r\n\r\nOpen *projectname.csproj* in your editor. If you're using Visual Studio, right-click the project and choose **Edit projectname.csproj** from the context menu, where projectname is the name of your project.\r\nLook for `PackageReference` nodes, for example:\r\n\r\n```xml\r\n<Project Sdk=\"Microsoft.NET.Sdk.\">\r\n  <PropertyGroup>\r\n    <TargetFramework>net461</TargetFramework>\r\n  </PropertyGroup>\r\n  <ItemGroup>\r\n    <PackageReference Include=\"ThirdParty.NotUpdatedYet\" Version=\"2.0.0\" />\r\n  </ItemGroup>\r\n</Project>\r\n```\r\n\r\nYou must add a direct dependency to the updated version of the [vulnerable package](#affected-software) by adding it to the *csproj* file.\r\nYou do this by adding a new line to the dependencies section, referencing the fixed version.\r\nFor example, if your search showed a transitive reference to a vulnerable `Microsoft.AspNetCore.Server.Kestrel.Core` version, you'd add a reference to the [fixed package number](#affected-software).\r\n\r\n```xml\r\n<Project Sdk=\"Microsoft.NET.Sdk.Web\">\r\n  <PropertyGroup>\r\n    <TargetFramework>net461</TargetFramework>\r\n  </PropertyGroup>\r\n  <ItemGroup>\r\n    <PackageReference Include=\"Microsoft.AspNetCore.Server.Kestrel.Core\" Version=\"2.0.3\" />\r\n    <PackageReference Include=\"ThirdParty.NotUpdatedYet\" Version=\"2.0.0\" />\r\n  </ItemGroup>\r\n</Project>\r\n```\r\n\r\nAfter you've added the direct dependency reference, save your *csproj* file.\r\n\r\nIf you're using Visual Studio, save your updated *csproj* file and Visual Studio will restore the new package versions.\r\nYou can see the restore results by opening the **Output** window (Ctrl+Alt+O) and changing the **Show output from** drop-down list to **Package Manager**.\r\n\r\nIf you're not using Visual Studio, open a command line and change to your project directory. Execute the `dotnet restore` command to restore the new dependencies.\r\n\r\n#### Rebuilding your application\r\n\r\nFinally you must rebuild your application, test, and redeploy.\r\n\r\n## Other Information\r\n\r\n### Reporting Security Issues\r\n\r\nIf you have found a potential security issue in .NET Core, please email details to secure@microsoft.com.

PR is [here](https://github.com/dotnet/dotnet-docker/pull/450)\r\n\r\n### Why the merge?\r\n\r\nFor some time we have been seeing people search for and find the `microsoft/dotnet` images and never realise that there are aspnetcore ones. This could be problematic in the past as the dotnet images were not optimised for ASP.NET Core, making things a little harder or slower. But with changes in the way ASP.NET Core works in 2.1 it was going to be much more impactful, in that ASP.NET Core applications were not likely to run on the base dotnet image. Given that we also thought it made more sense to have a single repository for all images, as ASP.NET is just part of .NET, we are taking this opportunity to remove the potential source of confusion and wasted time for our customers.\r\n\r\n### Why no Node?\r\nThere are two main reasons for this:\r\n\r\n  1. Multi-stage build now makes it easier to pull in the Node image for purely build concerns.\r\n  2. The ASP.NET Core templates no longer have a hard dependency on Node.\r\n\r\n\r\nFor discussion and feedback on this decision you can go here: [https://github.com/aspnet/aspnet-docker/issues/403](https://github.com/aspnet/aspnet-docker/issues/403)\r\n\r\n### Dockerfile examples\r\n\r\nIf you need Node then you will need to add it in your own Dockerfile, like this:\r\n\r\n```Dockerfile\r\nFROM microsoft/dotnet:2.1-sdk as build-env\r\nWORKDIR /app\r\n#setup node\r\nENV NODE_VERSION 8.9.4\r\nENV NODE_DOWNLOAD_SHA 21fb4690e349f82d708ae766def01d7fec1b085ce1f5ab30d9bda8ee126ca8fc\r\n\r\nRUN curl -SL \"https://nodejs.org/dist/v${NODE_VERSION}/node-v${NODE_VERSION}-linux-x64.tar.gz\" --output nodejs.tar.gz \\\r\n    && echo \"$NODE_DOWNLOAD_SHA nodejs.tar.gz\" | sha256sum -c - \\\r\n    && tar -xzf \"nodejs.tar.gz\" -C /usr/local --strip-components=1 \\\r\n    && rm nodejs.tar.gz \\\r\n    && ln -s /usr/local/bin/node /usr/local/bin/nodejs\r\n\r\n# copy csproj and restore as distinct layers\r\nCOPY *.csproj ./\r\nRUN dotnet restore\r\n\r\n# copy everything else and build\r\nCOPY . ./\r\nRUN dotnet publish -c Release -o out\r\n\r\n# build runtime image\r\nFROM microsoft/dotnet:2.1-aspnetcore-runtime\r\nWORKDIR /app\r\n#setup node, this is only needed if you use Node both at runtime and build time.

If you're not running ASP.NET Core 1.x behind a proxy, you must either place a proxy in front of your application or upgrade to ASP.NET Core 2.0.\r\nand add the host validating middleware provided at https://github.com/aspnet/BasicMiddleware/blob/release/2.0/samples/HostFilteringSample/.*\r\n\r\n## Advisory FAQ\r\n### How do I know if I am affected?\r\n\r\nReview the server and proxy configuration [instructions](#configuration) below to see if your system is configured correctly, and adjust the configuration if necessary.\r\n\r\n### How do I fix the issue?\r\n\r\nYou must address the [configuration](#configuration) of your server or proxy to protect your application to limit requests to known hosts.\r\n\r\nIf you're not running Kestrel 1.x behind a proxy, you must either place a proxy in front of your application or upgrade to ASP.NET Core 2.0 and follow the 2.0 instructions below.\r\n\r\nASP.NET Core 2.0.x applications must [update your code](#app-update) to fully protect your application.\r\n\r\n#### <a name=\"configuration\"></a> Server and Proxy configuration\r\n\r\nYou must examine your externally facing server or proxy configuration and ensure it requires host headers with fully qualified domain names, or known sub-domains if you are using sub-domain wild cards.\r\n\r\n##### ASP.NET Core applications behind [IIS](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/aspnet/core/host-and-deploy/iis/)\r\n\r\nTo configure IIS to only respond to know hosts:\r\n\r\n* Open IIS Manager.\r\n* Expand the **Sites** node for the machine you want to configure.\r\n* Select the site by clicking on the site.\r\n* In the **Actions** list on the right-hand side of IIS Manager, click **Bindings**.\r\n* Edit any bindings that do not have a host name to specify one. Do not use a `*` wildcard unless it's against a domain under your control. For example, `*.contoso.com` is safe, `*.com` is not.\r\n\r\n##### ASP.NET Core applications running publicly on [Kestrel](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/aspnet/core/fundamentals/servers/kestrel)\r\n\r\nKestrel does not have the capability to validate host headers. It must either be placed behind a proxy that performs the host header validation or the validation must be performed within the application by adding  host filtering middleware provided at https://github.com/aspnet/BasicMiddleware/blob/release/2.0/samples/HostFilteringSample/. You must also [update your dependencies](#app-update) to fully protect your application.\r\n\r\n##### ASP.NET Core applications running on [HTTP.SYS](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/aspnet/core/fundamentals/servers/httpsys)\r\n\r\nTo configure URL prefixes and ports, you can use the `UseUrls` extension method, the `urls` command-line argument, the ASPNETCORE_URLS environment variable, or the `UrlPrefixes` property on [HttpSysOptions](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/api/microsoft.aspnetcore.server.httpsys.httpsysoptions). The following code example uses `UrlPrefixes`.\r\n\r\n```c#\r\npublic static IWebHost BuildWebHost(string[] args) =>\r\n    WebHost.CreateDefaultBuilder(args)\r\n        .UseStartup<Startup>()\r\n        .UseHttpSys(options =>\r\n        {\r\n            // The following options are set to default values.\r\n            options.Authentication.Schemes = AuthenticationSchemes.None;\r\n            options.Authentication.AllowAnonymous = true;\r\n            options.MaxConnections = null;\r\n            options.MaxRequestBodySize = 30000000;\r\n            options.UrlPrefixes.Add(\"http://localhost:5000\");\r\n        })\r\n        .Build();\r\n```\r\n\r\n##### ASP.NET Core applications behind [NGINX](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/aspnet/core/host-and-deploy/linux-nginx)\r\n\r\nTo configure NGINX as a reverse proxy to forward requests to your ASP.NET Core app, replace the contents */etc/nginx/sites-available/default* with the following:\r\n\r\n```NGINX\r\nserver {\r\n    listen        80;\r\n    server_name   example.com *.example.com;\r\n    location / {\r\n        proxy_pass         http://localhost:5000;\r\n        proxy_http_version 1.1;\r\n        proxy_set_header   Upgrade $http_upgrade;\r\n        proxy_set_header   Connection keep-alive;\r\n        proxy_set_header   Host $host;\r\n        proxy_cache_bypass $http_upgrade;\r\n    }\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nNote that with NGINX, when there is no match for `server_name`, NGINX will pick the default server. If no default server has been defined, the first server in the conf file is the default server. Best practice is to add a specific default server which returns a status code of 444 in the conf file. An example default server configuration would be as follows:\r\n\r\n```NGINX\r\nserver {\r\n    listen   80 default_server;\r\n    # listen [::]:80 default_server deferred;\r\n    return   444;\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nWith the preceding configuration file and default server, NGINX accepts public traffic on port 80 with host header `example.com` or `*.example.com`. Requests not matching these hosts won't get forwarded to Kestrel. NGINX forwards the matching requests to Kestrel at `http://localhost:5000`. See [How nginx processes a request](https://nginx.org/docs/http/request_processing.html) for more information.\r\n\r\nOnce the NGINX configuration is established, run `sudo nginx -t` to verify the syntax of the configuration files. If the configuration file test is successful, force NGINX to pick up the changes by running `sudo nginx -s reload`.\r\n\r\n##### ASP.NET Core applications behind [Apache](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/aspnet/core/host-and-deploy/linux-apache)\r\n\r\nConfiguration files for Apache are located within the `/etc/httpd/conf.d/` directory. Any file with the `*.conf*` extension:\r\n\r\n* Is processed in alphabetical order, and\r\n* The module configuration files in `/etc/httpd/conf.modules.d/` are processed. The module configuration files in `/etc/httpd/conf.modules.d/` contain any configuration files necessary to load modules.\r\n\r\n\r\n```\r\n<VirtualHost *:80>\r\n    ProxyPreserveHost On\r\n    ProxyPass / http://127.0.0.1:5000/\r\n    ProxyPassReverse / http://127.0.0.1:5000/\r\n    ServerName www.example.com\r\n    ServerAlias *.example.com\r\n</VirtualHost>\r\n```\r\n\r\nThe `VirtualHost` block can appear multiple times, in one or more files on a server. In the preceding configuration file, Apache accepts public traffic on port 80. The domain `www.example.com` is being served, and the `*.example.com` alias resolves to the same website. See [Name-based virtual host support](https://httpd.apache.org/docs/current/vhosts/name-based.html) for more information. Requests are proxied at the root to port 5000 of the server at 127.0.0.1. For bi-directional communication, `ProxyPass` and `ProxyPassReverse` are required.\r\n\r\nSave the file and test the configuration. If everything passes, the response is `Syntax [OK]`.\r\n\r\n```bash\r\nsudo service httpd configtest\r\n```\r\n\r\nRestart Apache:\r\n\r\n```bash\r\nsudo systemctl restart httpd\r\nsudo systemctl enable httpd\r\n```\r\n\r\n\r\n#### <a name=\"app-update\"></a> ASP.NET Core 2.0 application code updates\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\nIf you're targeting .NET Core 2.x and the `Microsoft.AspNetCore.All` \"metapackage\":\r\n\r\n* Update its version number to 2.0.6 or later.\r\n* Updating will pull in the fixed packages listed above.\r\n\r\nIf you're targeting .NET Framework, update the packages listed above to their safe version or later.\r\n\r\nIf your application is using Kestrel without a proxy or the HttpOverrides functionality (UseForwardedHeaders with ForwardedHost) you must also add the host filtering middleware provided at https://github.com/aspnet/BasicMiddleware/tree/release/2.0/samples/HostFilteringSample/.\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n.NET Core and ASP.NET Core have two types of dependencies: direct and transitive. You must follow the update instructions below to address both types of dependency.\r\n\r\n### Direct dependencies\r\n\r\nDirect dependencies are dependencies where you specifically add a package to your project. For example, if you add the `Microsoft.AspNetCore.Mvc` package to your project then you have taken a direct dependency on `Microsoft.AspNetCore.Mvc`.\r\n\r\nDirect dependencies are discoverable by examining your *csproj* file.\r\n\r\n### Transitive dependencies\r\n\r\nTransitive dependencies occur when you add a package to your project that in turn relies on another package. For example, if you add the `Microsoft.AspNetCore.Mvc` package to your project it depends on the `Microsoft.AspNetCore.Mvc.Core` package (among others). Your project has a direct dependency on `Microsoft.AspNetCore.Mvc` and a transitive dependency on the `Microsoft.AspNetCore.Mvc.Core` package.\r\nTransitive dependencies are reviewable:\r\n\r\n* In the Visual Studio Solution Explorer window, which supports searching.\r\n* By examining the *project.assets.json* file contained in the obj directory of your project.\r\n\r\nThe *project.assets.json* files are the authoritative list of all packages used by your project, containing both direct and transitive dependencies.\r\n\r\n\r\n##### Fixing direct dependencies – Projects targeting .NET Core\r\n\r\nOpen *projectname.csproj* in your editor. If you're using Visual Studio, right-click the project and choose **Edit projectname.csproj** from the content menu, where projectname is the name of your project. Look for `PackageReference` elements. The following shows an example project file:\r\n\r\n```xml\r\n<Project Sdk=\"Microsoft.NET.Sdk.Web\">\r\n  <PropertyGroup>\r\n    <TargetFramework>netcoreapp2.0</TargetFramework>\r\n  </PropertyGroup>\r\n  <ItemGroup>\r\n    <PackageReference Include=\"Microsoft.AspNetCore.All\" Version=\"2.0.5\" />\r\n  </ItemGroup>\r\n  <ItemGroup>\r\n    <DotNetCliToolReference Include=\"Microsoft.VisualStudio.Web.CodeGeneration.Tools\" Version=\"2.0.0\" />\r\n  </ItemGroup>\r\n</Project>\r\n```\r\n\r\nThe preceding example has a reference to the vulnerable metapackage, as seen by the single `PackageReference` element. The name of the package is in the `Include` attribute. The package version number is in the `Version` attribute. The example shows a single direct dependency on `Microsoft.AspNetCore.All` version 2.0.5.\r\n\r\nTo update the version to the secure package, change the version number to a secure package version. In this example, update `Microsoft.AspNetCore.All` to 2.0.6 or later. Save the *csproj* file. The example *csproj* now looks as follows:\r\n\r\n```xml\r\n<Project Sdk=\"Microsoft.NET.Sdk.Web\">\r\n  <PropertyGroup>\r\n    <TargetFramework>netcoreapp2.0</TargetFramework>\r\n  </PropertyGroup>\r\n  <ItemGroup>\r\n    <PackageReference Include=\"Microsoft.AspNetCore.All\" Version=\"2.0.6\" />\r\n  </ItemGroup>\r\n  <ItemGroup>\r\n    <DotNetCliToolReference Include=\"Microsoft.VisualStudio.Web.CodeGeneration.Tools\" Version=\"2.0.0\" />\r\n  </ItemGroup>\r\n</Project>\r\n```\r\n\r\nIf you're using Visual Studio and save your updated *csproj* file, Visual Studio will restore the new package version. You can see the restore results by opening the **Output** window (Ctrl+Alt+O) and changing the **Show output from** drop-down list to **Package Manager**.\r\n\r\nIf you're not using Visual Studio, open a command line and change to your project directory. Execute the `dotnet restore` command to restore the updated dependencies.\r\n\r\n##### Fixing direct dependencies – Projects targeting .NET Framework\r\n\r\nOpen *projectname.csproj* in your editor. If you're using Visual Studio, right-click the project and choose **Edit projectname.csproj** from the content menu, where projectname is the name of your project. Look for `PackageReference` nodes. The following shows an example project file:\r\n\r\n```xml\r\n<Project Sdk=\"Microsoft.NET.Sdk.Web\">\r\n  <PropertyGroup>\r\n    <TargetFramework>net461</TargetFramework>\r\n  </PropertyGroup>\r\n  <ItemGroup>\r\n    <PackageReference Include=\"Microsoft.AspNetCore.HttpOverrides\" Version=\"2.0.1\" />\r\n  </ItemGroup>\r\n  <ItemGroup>\r\n    <DotNetCliToolReference Include=\"Microsoft.VisualStudio.Web.CodeGeneration.Tools\" Version=\"2.0.0\" />\r\n  </ItemGroup>\r\n</Project>\r\n```\r\n\r\nThe example has a reference to a single package, as seen by the `PackageReference` element. The name of the package is in the `Include` attribute. The package version number is in the `Version` attribute. The example shows a direct dependency on one of the vulnerable packages from the table above, `Microsoft.AspNetCore.HttpOverrides` version 2.0.1.\r\n\r\nTo update to the secure package, change the version number to the updated package version. In the example, this would be updating `Microsoft.AspNetCore.HttpOverrides` to 2.0.2 and later. Save the *csproj* file. The updated and secure *csproj* look as follows:\r\n\r\n``` XML\r\n<Project Sdk=\"Microsoft.NET.Sdk.Web\">\r\n  <PropertyGroup>\r\n    <TargetFramework>net461</TargetFramework>\r\n  </PropertyGroup>\r\n  <ItemGroup>\r\n    <PackageReference Include=\"Microsoft.AspNetCore.HttpOverrides\" Version=\"2.0.2\" />\r\n  </ItemGroup>\r\n  <ItemGroup>\r\n    <DotNetCliToolReference Include=\"Microsoft.VisualStudio.Web.CodeGeneration.Tools\" Version=\"2.0.0\" />\r\n  </ItemGroup>\r\n</Project>\r\n```\r\n\r\nIf you're using Visual Studio and save your updated *csproj* file, Visual Studio will restore the new package version. You can see the restore results by opening the **Output** window (Ctrl+Alt+O) and changing the **Show output from** drop-down list to **Package Manager**.\r\n\r\nIf you're not using Visual Studio, open a command line and change to your project directory. Execute the `dotnet restore` command to restore the new dependency version.\r\n\r\n##### After updating your direct dependencies\r\n\r\nRecompile your application.\r\n\r\nIf after recompilation you see a *Dependency conflict warning*, you must update your other direct dependencies to a compatible version. \r\n\r\nFor example if your project refers directly to `Microsoft.AspNetCore.Mvc.Cors` with a version number of `2.0.0`, when you update your `Microsoft.AspNetCore.Mvc` package to 2.0.1, compilation will throw:\r\n\r\n`NU1012      Dependency conflict. Microsoft.AspNetCore.Mvc 2.0.1 expected Microsoft.AspNetCore.Mvc.Cors >= 2.0.1 but received 2.0.0`\r\n\r\nTo fix this, edit the version for the expected package to be the version expected by updating your *project.json* in the same way that you used to update the vulnerable package versions.\r\n\r\nAfter you've addressed all of your direct dependencies, you must review your transitive dependencies.\r\n\r\n###### Reviewing transitive dependencies\r\n\r\nThere are two ways to view transitive dependencies. You can either use Visual Studio’s Solution Explorer, or you can review the *project.assets.json* file.\r\n\r\n###### Using Visual Studio Solution Explorer\r\n\r\nTo use Solution Explorer, open the project in Visual Studio 2017, and then press Ctrl+; to activate the search in Solution Explorer. Search for each of the vulnerable package names above and make a note of the version numbers of any results you find.\r\n\r\nFor example, searching for `Microsoft.AspNetCore.Mvc.Core` in an example project that contains a package that takes a dependency on `Microsoft.AspNetCore.Mvc` shows the following results in Visual Studio 2017:\r\n\r\n![vs2017](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/796298/25858816/8ecdc2b4-3491-11e7-9363-746804bb9832.png)\r\n\r\nThe search results appear as a tree. In these results, you can see a reference to `Microsoft.AspNetCore.Mvc.Core` version 1.1.2 is discovered.\r\n\r\nUnder the Dependencies node is a NuGet node. Under the NuGet node is the list of packages you have directly taken a dependency on and their versions. In this example, the application takes a direct dependency on `Microsoft.AspNetCore.Mvc`. `Microsoft.AspNetCore.Mvc` in turn has leaf nodes that list its dependencies and their versions. In the example, the `Microsoft.AspNetCore.Mvc` package takes a dependency on a version of `Microsoft.AspNetCore.Mvc.ApiExplorer`, that in turn takes a dependency on a vulnerable version of `Microsoft.AspNetCore.Mvc.Core`.\r\n\r\n###### Manually reviewing project.assets.json (VS2017)\r\n\r\nOpen the *project.assets.json* file from your project’s obj directory in your editor. We suggest you use an editor that understands JSON and allows you to collapse and expand nodes to review this file. Visual Studio and Visual Studio Code provide JSON friendly editing.\r\n\r\nSearch the *project.assets.json* file for each of the vulnerable packages, using the format `packagename/` for each of the package names from the preceding table. If you find the assembly name in your search:\r\n\r\n* Examine the line on which they are found, the version number is after the `/`.\r\n* Compare to the vulnerable versions table above.\r\n\r\nFor example, a search result that shows `Microsoft.AspNetCore.Mvc.Cors/1.1.0` is a reference to v1.1.0 of `Microsoft.AspNetCore.Mvc.Cors`.   If your *project.assets.json* file includes references to any of the vulnerable packages shown above, then you need to fix the transitive dependencies.\r\n\r\n###### Overriding transitive dependencies\r\n\r\nIf you have not found any reference to any vulnerable packages this means:\r\n\r\n* None of your direct dependencies depend on any vulnerable packages, or\r\n* You have already fixed the problem by updating the direct dependencies.\r\n\r\nIf your transitive dependency review found references to any of the vulnerable packages you must add a direct dependency to the updated package to your *csproj* file to override the transitive dependency.\r\n\r\nOpen *projectname.csproj* in your editor. If you're using Visual Studio, right-click the project and choose **Edit projectname.csproj** from the content menu, where projectname is the name of your project. Look for `PackageReference` nodes, for example:\r\n\r\n```xml\r\n<Project Sdk=\"Microsoft.NET.Sdk.Web\">\r\n  <PropertyGroup>\r\n    <TargetFramework>net461</TargetFramework>\r\n  </PropertyGroup>\r\n  <ItemGroup>\r\n    <PackageReference Include=\"ThirdParty.NotUpdatedYet\" Version=\"2.0.0\" />\r\n  </ItemGroup>\r\n  <ItemGroup>\r\n    <DotNetCliToolReference Include=\"Microsoft.VisualStudio.Web.CodeGeneration.Tools\" Version=\"2.0.0\" />\r\n  </ItemGroup>\r\n</Project>\r\n```\r\n\r\nFor each of the vulnerable packages your search returned, you must add a direct dependency to the updated version by adding it to the *csproj* file.\r\nYou do this by adding a new line to the dependencies section, referring the fixed version.\r\nFor example, if your search showed a transitive reference to the vulnerable `Microsoft.AspNetCore.HttpOverrides` version 2.0.0 you would add a reference to the fixed version, that is, 2.0.2 or later.\r\n\r\n```xml\r\n<Project Sdk=\"Microsoft.NET.Sdk.Web\">\r\n  <PropertyGroup>\r\n    <TargetFramework>net461</TargetFramework>\r\n  </PropertyGroup>\r\n  <ItemGroup>\r\n    <PackageReference Include=\"Microsoft.AspNetCore.HttpOverride\" Version=\"2.0.2\" />\r\n    <PackageReference Include=\"ThirdParty.NotUpdatedYet\" Version=\"2.0.0\" />\r\n  </ItemGroup>\r\n  <ItemGroup>\r\n    <DotNetCliToolReference Include=\"Microsoft.VisualStudio.Web.CodeGeneration.Tools\" Version=\"2.0.0\" />\r\n  </ItemGroup>\r\n</Project>\r\n```\r\n\r\nAfter you have added the direct dependency reference, save your *csproj* file.\r\n\r\nIf you're using Visual Studio, save your updated *csproj* file and Visual Studio will restore the new package versions.\r\nYou can see the restore results by opening the **Output** window (Ctrl+Alt+O) and changing the **Show output from** drop-down list to **Package Manager**.\r\n\r\nIf you're not using Visual Studio, open a command line and change to your project directory. Execute the `dotnet restore` command to restore the new dependencies.\r\n\r\n###### Rebuilding your application\r\n\r\nRebuild your application.

This transition will happen over the next few weeks.\r\n\r\n**Old feed:** https://dotnet.myget.org/F/aspnetcore-dev/api/v3/index.json\r\n**New feed:** https://dotnet.myget.org/F/dotnet-core/api/v3/index.json\r\n\r\nWe recommend updating to use the dotnet-core feed to continue getting the latest daily builds of ASP.NET Core.\r\n\r\nWe are making this change to make it easier for you to pull daily builds that align with the .NET Core CLI and .NET Core runtime. Some of our existing MyGet feeds will continue to exist, but will not be used for official daily builds. Instead, those feeds will only be used for builds of experimental branches of aspnetcore.\r\n\r\nOther useful links:\r\nGallery: https://dotnet.myget.org/gallery/dotnet-core\r\nNuGet v2 source: https://dotnet.myget.org/F/dotnet-core/api/v2\r\nNPM feed: https://dotnet.myget.org/F/dotnet-core/npm/\r\n\r\nPlease use https://github.com/aspnet/Home/issues/2937 for discussion.","Url":"https://github.com/aspnet/Announcements/issues/293","RelatedDescription":"Open issue \"Moving official daily builds to the dotnet-core MyGet feed \" (#293)"}],"ResultType":"GitHubIssue"},"Twitter":{"ResultType":"TwitterTimeline","Tweets":[{"Id":"1049792996743372800","CreatedAt":"2018-10-09T22:45:29+00:00","UserScreenname":"aspnet","Text":"#ASPNET Community Standup starting now!\n\nhttps://t.co/4Ioo9jNSN2","Source":"<a href=\"https://about.twitter.com/products/tweetdeck\" rel=\"nofollow\">TweetDeck</a>","RetweetCount":14,"FavoriteCount":6,"RawContent":null},{"Id":"1049789526162300928","CreatedAt":"2018-10-09T22:31:41+00:00","UserScreenname":"aspnet","Text":"Starting soon! #Blazor update with @aVerySpicyBoi @stevensanderson  @danroth27 @DamianEdwards @jongalloway at 3:45… https://t.co/qvemHwct7z","Source":"<a href=\"https://about.twitter.com/products/tweetdeck\" rel=\"nofollow\">TweetDeck</a>","RetweetCount":19,"FavoriteCount":8,"RawContent":null},{"Id":"1049387182836789248","CreatedAt":"2018-10-08T19:52:55+00:00","UserScreenname":"aspnet","Text":"Don't miss this week's #ASPNET Community Standup this Tuesday at 3:45 Pacific / 22:45 UTC\n\nThis week: #Blazor updat… https://t.co/ldqMQw90HU","Source":"<a href=\"https://about.twitter.com/products/tweetdeck\" rel=\"nofollow\">TweetDeck</a>","RetweetCount":55,"FavoriteCount":36,"RawContent":null},{"Id":"1047175421974831104","CreatedAt":"2018-10-02T17:24:10+00:00","UserScreenname":"aspnet","Text":"Blazor 0.6.0 experimental release now available\n\nhttps://t.co/PLXAt1u6Ha","Source":"<a href=\"https://about.twitter.com/products/tweetdeck\" rel=\"nofollow\">TweetDeck</a>","RetweetCount":261,"FavoriteCount":169,"RawContent":null},{"Id":"1044720517997973505","CreatedAt":"2018-09-25T22:49:16+00:00","UserScreenname":"aspnet","Text":"Starting now!
