Digging into the code, [it looks like](https://github.com/vuejs/vuex/blob/dev/src/store.js#L131-L135) not only do action subscribers not wait on the actions to resolve, but they execute before the action. Mutation subscribers, on the other hand, [seem to work](https://github.com/vuejs/vuex/blob/dev/src/store.js#L97-L102) as expected (call mutation first, call subscriber second). Since actions are often asynchronous (and vuex always wraps them with promises), I think it makes more sense to wait on the action and then call subscribers.\r\n\r\nI wasn't sure if this was intentional or not, hence the feature request.\r\n\r\n### What does the proposed API look like?\r\nI think something like the following would be more in line with what developers expect:\r\n\r\n```js\r\nconst result = entry.length > 1\r\n      ? Promise.all(entry.map(handler => handler(payload)))\r\n      : entry[0](payload);\r\nresult.then(() => this._actionSubscribers.forEach(sub => sub(action, this.state)));\r\nreturn result;\r\n```\r\n\r\nI could open a pull request if that looks reasonable (will add tests, etc.)\r\n\r\n<!-- generated by vue-issues.
