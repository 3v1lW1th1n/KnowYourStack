When working with in-memory images (i.e. NOT loaded with `ImageLoaderTransformer`) this is inadequate, since the `ImageResizingTransformer `will dispose the last image in the dataset, and the user won't be able to use that image again. Particullarly, issue #4126 happened when running Cross Validation with a pipeline that included applying `ImageResizingTransformer `to in memory images: when scoring the first model during cross validation, the last image of the input dataset got disposed, and when trying to score the second model, the image wasn't there, and a exception was thrown.\r\n\r\nThe only reason I found as to why `ImageResizingTransformer` had this behavior, is because `ImageLoadingTransformer` actually disposes all the images it loads except for the last one ([link](https://github.com/dotnet/machinelearning/blob/919bc8b886a6bc20c5022e8dad00f84bc1248236/src/Microsoft.ML.ImageAnalytics/ImageLoader.cs#L226-L230)). So assuming this is the only reason for `ImageResizingTransformer's `disposer, I simply moved the disposal mechanism of the last image to `ImageLoadingTransformer`.\r\n\r\nI added two tests that used to throw exceptions without the changes on this PR. And I also manually tested with the debugger's profiler that the last image got correctly disposed when using `ImageLoadingTransformer`.","Url":"https://github.com/dotnet/machinelearning/pull/5056","RelatedDescription":"Closed or merged PR \"Let ImageLoadingTransformer dispose the last image it loads\" (#5056)"},{"Id":"605941817","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2020-04-23T23:42:26","Actor":"frank-dong-ms","Number":"5058","RawContent":null,"Title":"try put nuget packages to shared folder instead of local to save disk…","State":"open","Body":"… space\r\n\r\nWe are excited to review your PR.\r\n\r\nSo we can do the best job, please check:\r\n\r\n- [ ] There's a descriptive title that will make sense to other developers some time from now. \r\n- [ ] There's associated issues.
