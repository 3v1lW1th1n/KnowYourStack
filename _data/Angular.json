This feature is Lazy Loaded.\r\n\r\nIn that feature I have a service which needs some configuration that is environment dependent. So this information is present in the `environment.ts` files of the application.\r\n\r\nNow I'm looking for a way to pass this environment information to my lazy loaded feature library. These services should only be accessible inside this module or its decedents.\r\n\r\n### Describe the solution you'd like\r\nI was thinking about a similar solution as the forRoot or the forChild methods that currently exists.\r\n```\r\n@NgModule({\r\n   imports: [\r\n      RouterModule.forRoot([{\r\n         path: 'feature',\r\n         loadChildren: () => import('path/to/feature').then(module => module.FeatureModule.forChild(environment.whateverConfigSetting))\r\n       }])\r\n   ]\r\n})\r\nexport class AppModule {}\r\n```\r\n\r\n### Describe alternatives you've considered\r\n\r\nAn alternative solution I currently use is that I have created an addition library with a module that implements a forRoot method. And the module.forRoot() of this library is added to the imports. of the AppModule. Disadvantage of this is that the services is now exposes to the whole application.\r\n\r\nAn other alternative solution could be to inject a AppSettings service into the service living in the feature library and fetch the environment settings of this service. Disadvantage of this solution is that for every feature library I additionally add I have a tight coupling to that service.","Url":"https://github.com/angular/angular/issues/34351","RelatedDescription":"Open issue \"Pass configuration data to services in a lazy loaded module\" (#34351)"},{"Id":"536415880","IsPullRequest":false,"CreatedAt":"2019-12-11T14:43:06","Actor":"dartzki","Number":"34349","RawContent":null,"Title":"Attribute selector when running with Ivy","State":"open","Body":"<!--üîÖüîÖüîÖüîÖüîÖüîÖüîÖüîÖüîÖüîÖüîÖüîÖüîÖüîÖüîÖüîÖüîÖüîÖüîÖüîÖüîÖüîÖüîÖüîÖüîÖüîÖüîÖüîÖüîÖüîÖüîÖ\r\n\r\nOh hi there! üòÑ\r\n\r\nTo expedite issue processing please search open and closed issues before submitting a new one.\r\nExisting issues often contain information about workarounds, resolution, or progress updates.\r\n\r\nüîÖüîÖüîÖüîÖüîÖüîÖüîÖüîÖüîÖüîÖüîÖüîÖüîÖüîÖüîÖüîÖüîÖüîÖüîÖüîÖüîÖüîÖüîÖüîÖüîÖüîÖüîÖüîÖüîÖüîÖüîÖüîÖüîÖ-->\r\n\r\n\r\n# üêû bug report\r\n\r\n### Affected Package\r\nivy renderer\r\n\r\n\r\n### Is this a regression?\r\n\r\nYes, the behavior changed between 8.0 (no-ivy) and 9.0 (ivy)\r\n\r\n\r\n### Description\r\n\r\nWhen the bootstrap component uses an attribute selector  (e.g. '[app-component]') instead of an element selector, the first `<div>` on the page is used to render the component.\r\n\r\n\r\n## üî¨ Minimal Reproduction\r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/dartzki/angular9-ivy-atttribute-selector\r\n\r\nclone, npm install, ng serve\r\n=> the content of AppComponent is rendered inside the first `<div>` instead of the second `<div>` where the attribute is set.\r\nIf Ivy is disabled in tsconfig.json, AppComponent is rendered in the second `<div>` as expected.\r\nIt seems as if attribute selectors are completely ignored by Ivy.\r\n\r\n## üî• Exception or Error\r\nthe content of AppComponent is rendered inside the first `<div>` instead of the second `<div>` where the attribute is set.\r\n\r\n## üåç  Your Environment\r\n\r\n**Angular Version:**\r\n<pre><code>\r\nAngular CLI: 9.0.0-rc.5\r\nNode: 12.12.0\r\nOS: linux x64\r\n\r\nAngular: 9.0.0-rc.5\r\n... animations, cli, common, compiler, compiler-cli, core, forms\r\n... language-service, platform-browser, platform-browser-dynamic\r\n... router\r\nIvy Workspace: Yes\r\n\r\nPackage                           Version\r\n-----------------------------------------------------------\r\n@angular-devkit/architect         0.900.0-rc.5\r\n@angular-devkit/build-angular     0.900.0-rc.5\r\n@angular-devkit/build-optimizer   0.900.0-rc.5\r\n@angular-devkit/build-webpack     0.900.0-rc.5\r\n@angular-devkit/core              9.0.0-rc.5\r\n@angular-devkit/schematics        9.0.0-rc.5\r\n@ngtools/webpack                  9.0.0-rc.5\r\n@schematics/angular               9.0.0-rc.5\r\n@schematics/update                0.900.0-rc.5\r\nrxjs                              6.5.3\r\ntypescript                        3.6.4\r\nwebpack                           4.41.2\r\n\r\n</code></pre>\r\n\r\n**Anything else relevant?**\r\n<!-- ‚úçÔ∏èIs this a browser specific issue?

Upgrading to 8.3.20 (and devkit/build-angular to 0.803.20 accordingly) is breaking the runtime execution of the app. No other project change besides this 19-to-20 change.\r\n\r\n## üî¨ Minimal Reproduction\r\n\r\nThe problem is NOT present when I use `ng serve` nor it is with `ng serve --prod` (assuming here the target is es5). I could only get the error when the final prod build is deployed on a web server (with differential loading active). The error stacktrace is consequently lost in the minified JS and doesn't say much about the problem location.\r\n\r\n## üî• Exception or Error\r\n<pre><code>\r\nObject doesn't support property or method 'some'\r\n</code></pre>\r\n\r\nAccording to MDN, Arrays.some is supported by Internet Explorer since version 9.
