Again for SEO reasons, I don't want the whole card to be an anchor element since it will also contain `Content` and `More content` as anchor text.\r\n\r\nNow I understand where this behavior is coming from, it's trying to prevent a child anchor from triggering a full page navigation. Without using `router-link` I can get the best of both worlds by making a clickable div whose event does not propagate and trigger the inner anchor while web crawlers still relate `/route/3` to `I am a good link`:\r\n\r\n```\r\n<div class=\"card\" @click.prevent=\"$router.push({ name: 'MyRoute', params: { id: 3 } })\">\r\n  <h2><a href=\"/route/3\">I am a good link</a></h2>\r\n  <p>Content</p>\r\n  <p>More content</p>\r\n</div>\r\n```\r\n\r\nThese lines are responsible for this behavior:\r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/vuejs/vue-router/blob/9880cbda8dd299315a253abaab69da00eecdf635/src/components/link.js#L86-L99\r\n\r\nNote a shortcoming of this implementation: should the user place more than one anchor element inside the `router-link`, only the first one will get enhanced while the other ones will still trigger a full page reload. To me that scenario makes little sense and I have no idea of any real use case, but perhaps it should raise a warning.\r\n\r\nIs there any 'official' stance on my workaround?\r\n\r\n<!-- generated by vue-issues.

I consider this a leaking abstraction because the components should not control store internals. It would be helpful to have such method as a part of action context object (also, a namespaced version would be very good to have) because more often than not such dynamic activity is strongly tied to API querying (otherwise, why would one not register modules in before?).\r\n\r\nMy end user experience which led to this proposal is trying to build a page, which would show multiple collections of items filtered by various conditions (an app marketplace, to be exact). These collections are acquired from the backend via GraphQL and are tied to a 3rd party API which cannot be accessed directly from the frontend.\r\n\r\nRight now I'm doing this via `beforeMount` hook of the root presentation component:\r\n```\r\n// Presentation component\r\n      this.$store.dispatch('selections/fetchLanding', this.$store.registerModule.bind(this.$store))\r\n}\r\n\r\n// Store module\r\nactions: {\r\n  fetchLanding ({commit, state}, registerModule) {\r\n    queryCollections.bind(self)(state.filter)\r\n      .then((result) => {\r\n        for (let key in result.collections) {\r\n          if (typeof state.collections[key] === 'undefined') {\r\n            registerModule(['collections', key], (new CollectionModule(self.client)).createModule())\r\n          }\r\n        }\r\n        commit('SET_COLLECTIONS', result.collections)\r\n      })\r\n  }\r\n},\r\n```\r\n\r\nBut passing the bound registerModule method in payload looks ugly.\r\n\r\n### What does the proposed API look like?\r\nI've cleaned up the example to keep it precise to the task:\r\n\r\n```\r\n// Store module\r\nnamespaced: true,\r\nactions: {\r\n  fetchSomething ({commit, state, registerModule}) {\r\n    querySomeAPI()\r\n      .then((result) => {\r\n        registerModule(namespacedKey, new ModuleInstance())\r\n      })\r\n  }\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\n<!-- generated by vue-issues.
