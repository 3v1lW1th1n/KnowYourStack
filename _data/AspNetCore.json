But now with the InProcess hosting model the same problem exists again. \r\n\r\nUsing ASP.NET Core 2.2 using `<AspNetCoreHostingModel>InProcess</AspNetCoreHostingModel>`\r\nA simple code like this shows the issue:\r\n\r\n```\r\npublic async Task<IActionResult> TestOnComplete()\r\n{\r\n        Response.OnCompleted(async () =>\r\n        {\r\n            throw new Exception();\r\n        });\r\n}\r\n```\r\nResponse.OnCompleted is said to be invoked after the response is sent to the user, so the user should already have got the answer, whatever happens there.\r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/aspnet/AspNetCore/blob/master/src/Http/Http.Abstractions/src/HttpResponse.cs#L87\r\n\r\n```\r\n        /// <summary>\r\n        /// Adds a delegate to be invoked after the response has finished being sent to the client.\r\n        /// </summary>\r\n        /// <param name=\"callback\">The delegate to invoke.</param>\r\n        /// <param name=\"state\">A state object to capture and pass back to the delegate.</param>\r\n        public abstract void OnCompleted(Func<object, Task> callback, object state);\r\n```\r\nBut this breaks the response.

My problem is that its not doing what we would expect it to do.   \r\n\r\nManagement expects when a user logs in and clicks remember me that they will then not be required to type their login and password again for a month.  Whether or not they will still have to type in the 2fa code is up for debate.\r\n\r\nWhat is actually happening is that i can close the browser reboot and come back for about an hour and 15 minutes and then i will be forced to type my password again.

VS 2019 is about to be released in around early 2019\r\n2. ASP.NET Core 1.0/1.1 is not going to be supported anymore, based on [this page](https://github.com/dotnet/core/blob/master/microsoft-support.md).\r\n3. Creating new ASP.NET Core 1.0/1.1 will always install the .NET Core 1.0/1.1 web tooling, and this is not necessary when previous reason has reached the unsupported period and it's quite near or might be the same time of VS 2019 release.\r\n4. Based on the problem mentioned above, VS 2017 has no \"built in\" tooling when creating new ASP.NET Core 1.0/1.1 project, but the external tooling may help. Therefore for those that still need to maintain ASP.NET Core 1.0/1.1 projects, we could use VS 2017 as long as the VS 2017 is still in support lifecycle or in mainstream support lifecycle.\r\n\r\nI

Initially integration with these frameworks was accomplished with ASP.NET Core specific components that handled scenarios like server-side prerendering and integration with webpack. But as time went on, industry standards changed and the SPA frameworks each released their own standard command-line interfaces (e.g., Angular CLI, create-react-app).\r\n\r\nWhen ASP.NET Core 2.1 was released in May 2018, we responded to the change in standards by providing a newer and simpler way to integrate with the SPA frameworks' own toolchains. This new integration mechanism exists in the package `Microsoft.AspNetCore.SpaServices.Extensions` and remains the basis of our Angular and React project templates since ASP.NET Core 2.1.\r\n\r\nTo clarify that the older ASP.NET Core specific components are not relevant or recommended, we are now officially obsoleting the pre-2.1 integration mechanism and marking the supporting NPM packages as deprecated.\r\n\r\nThe contents of the following NuGet packages have all been unnecessary since ASP.NET Core 2.1, and so are now being marked as obsolete:\r\n\r\n- Microsoft.AspNetCore.SpaServices\r\n- Microsoft.AspNetCore.NodeServices\r\n\r\nFor the same reason, the following NPM modules are being marked as deprecated:\r\n\r\n- aspnet-angular\r\n- aspnet-prerendering\r\n- aspnet-webpack\r\n- aspnet-webpack-react\r\n- domain-task\r\n\r\nThese packages will later be removed in .NET 5. If you are using these packages, please update your apps to use the functionality in Microsoft.AspNetCore.SpaServices.Extensions instead along with the functionality provided by the SPA frameworks you are using. To enable features like server-side prerendering and hot module reload please refer to the documentation for the corresponding SPA frameworks. The functionality in Microsoft.AspNetCore.SpaServices.Extensions is *not* obsolete and will continue to be supported.\r\n\r\nDiscussion for this issue is at aspnet/aspnetcore#12890\r\n","Url":"https://github.com/aspnet/Announcements/issues/379","RelatedDescription":"Open issue \"Obsoleting Microsoft.AspNetCore.SpaServices and Microsoft.AspNetCore.NodeServices\" (#379)"},{"Id":"474679821","IsPullRequest":false,"CreatedAt":"2019-07-30T16:19:27","Actor":"anurse","Number":"378","RawContent":null,"Title":"ASP.NET Core master branches have switched to \"5.0\"","State":"open","Body":"**This announcement is for contributors to ASP.NET Core repositories. Users should not be affected. Preview builds of 3.0 continue to be available at https://dotnet.microsoft.com/download/dotnet-core/3.0 . There are no preview builds of 5.0 at this time**\r\n\r\nVarious ASP.NET Core repos have switched their master branches to \"5.0\", and will use 3.x branches for 3.0 and 3.1 projects. We will evaluate incoming work and make individual decisions on whether to back-port the work to 3.1. The version number being used is `5.0.0-alpha1`. This does not indicate a specific name or timeline for the initial preview release, it’s just a pre-release tag that allows us the flexibility to change the version as necessary. The [.NET Core Roadmap](https://github.com/dotnet/core/blob/master/roadmap.md) is the authoritative source for committed release schedules. \r\n\r\nAt present, this change is only relevant if you contribute to ASP.NET Core repositories. Otherwise, we recommend that you wait for the official 5.0 Preview releases before installing this new version.\r\n\r\n## Discussion\r\nPlease share your thoughts on this change and see what others are saying at: aspnet/AspNetCore#12732\r\n\r\n## Details\r\nThe following repos have moved their master branches to \"5.0\":\r\n\r\n* [aspnet/AspNetCore](https://github.com/aspnet/AspNetCore)\r\n* [aspnet/AspNetCore-Tooling](https://github.com/aspnet/AspNetCore-Tooling)\r\n* [aspnet/Blazor](https://github.com/aspnet/Blazor)\r\n* [aspnet/EntityFrameworkCore](https://github.com/aspnet/EntityFrameworkCore)\r\n* [aspnet/Extensions](https://github.com/aspnet/Extensions)\r\n\r\nIn addition, the [aspnet/EntityFramework6](https://github.com/aspnet/EntityFramework6) repository has changed version numbers to 6.4 to reflect a version after the 6.3 release in progress. Again, there is no specific timeline or committment for this release.\r\n\r\nVersion numbers may still change during the development cycle for 5.0. This change is being done to reflect the current plans. \r\n\r\nIn large part, we switched master to 5.0 to enable to the community to contribute changes. As the .NET Core 3.0 release progresses towards the final build, we're increasing scrutiny on the changes we will accept. Now that we've permanently branched for 3.0, we can accept a much broader set of changes. Please consider that to be an open invitation!\r\n\r\nAt present, there is no SDK or developer experience for 5.0. Switching your project file to target `netcoreapp5.0` won't do anything useful. Look for a follow-up announcement when this experience is available.\r\n\r\n## Which branch has what?\r\n\r\nHere's a brief table listing the branches and the releases they are targeting:\r\n\r\n| Repository | 3.0 | 5.0 |\r\n| - | - | - |\r\n| [aspnet/AspNetCore](https://github.com/aspnet/AspNetCore) | [`release/3.0`](https://github.com/aspnet/AspNetCore/tree/release/3.0) | [`master`](https://github.com/aspnet/AspNetCore/tree/master) |\r\n| [aspnet/AspNetCore-Tooling](https://github.com/aspnet/AspNetCore-Tooling) |[`release/3.0`](https://github.com/aspnet/AspNetCore-Tooling/tree/release/3.0) | [`master`](https://github.com/aspnet/AspNetCore-Tooling/tree/master) |\r\n| [aspnet/Blazor](https://github.com/aspnet/Blazor) | [`release/3.0`](https://github.com/aspnet/Blazor/tree/release/3.0) | [`master`](https://github.com/aspnet/Blazor/tree/master) |\r\n| [aspnet/EntityFrameworkCore](https://github.com/aspnet/EntityFrameworkCore) |[`release/3.0`](https://github.com/aspnet/EntityFrameworkCore/tree/release/3.0) | [`master`](https://github.com/aspnet/EntityFrameworkCore/tree/master) |\r\n| [aspnet/Extensions](https://github.com/aspnet/Extensions) | [`release/3.0`](https://github.com/aspnet/Extensions/tree/release/3.0) | [`master`](https://github.com/aspnet/Extensions/tree/master) |\r\n\r\nChanges for the 3.1 LTS release (planned for [November 2019](https://github.com/dotnet/core/blob/master/roadmap.md)) will be picked from changes made in 5.0 (master).

If you're using HttpResponse directly you should not need to make any code changes. Read further if you were wrapping or replacing HttpResponse.Body or accessing HttpContext.Features.\r\n\r\nVersion: 3.0.0-preview8\r\n\r\nBackground:\r\nHttpContext, HttpRequest, HttpResponse are backed by an abstraction called [Features](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/aspnet/core/fundamentals/request-features?view=aspnetcore-2.2). This allows functionality to be provided by different components in the pipeline without wrapping the entire HttpContext.\r\n\r\nIn 2.x there are three APIs associated with the response body: IHttpResponseFeature.Body, IHttpSendFileFeature.SendFileAsync, and IHttpBufferingFeature.DisableResponseBuffering, but the later two were rarely implemented or used.\r\n\r\nOver the course of 3.0 several new response body APIs were added:\r\nIHttpResponseBodyPipeFeature\r\nIHttpResponseStartFeature.StartAsync\r\nIHttpResponseCompleteFeature.CompleteAsync\r\n\r\nProblem: With so many APIs it became too hard for middleware to properly intercept the response body. It was also hard for calling code to rely on those features being present on all servers.\r\n\r\nFix: Consolidate the response body APIs onto a single new feature interface [IHttpResponseBodyFeature](https://github.com/aspnet/AspNetCore/blob/4aebd29abca80242f5ff9e89e07d4f1b28788a44/src/Http/Http.Features/src/IHttpResponseBodyFeature.cs). HttpResponse has been updated accordingly, and each server has been updated to provide at least a minimal implementation for all of these APIs. We'll iterate to provide more fully featured implementations in each server but that won't require any more API changes.\r\n\r\nNote if you replace HttpResponse.Body it will now replace the entire IHttpResponseBodyFeature with a wrapper around your given stream using StreamResponseBodyFeature to provide default implementations for all of the expected APIs. Setting back the original stream will undo this change.\r\nhttps://github.com/aspnet/AspNetCore/blob/4aebd29abca80242f5ff9e89e07d4f1b28788a44/src/Http/Http/src/Internal/DefaultHttpResponse.cs#L67-L89\r\n\r\nBreaking change https://github.com/aspnet/AspNetCore/pull/12328\r\n\r\nObsolete existing 2.x APIs\r\nIHttpResponseFeature.Body\r\nIHttpSendFileFeature\r\nIHttpBufferingFeature\r\n\r\nDeleted feature interfaces that were introduced earlier in 3.0.\r\nIHttpResponseBodyPipeFeature\r\nIHttpResponseStartFeature\r\nIHttpResponseCompleteFeature\r\n\r\nIn a future major release we plan to refactor the request body features as well https://github.com/aspnet/AspNetCore/issues/12620.\r\n\r\nSee https://github.com/aspnet/AspNetCore/issues/12635 for discussion.","Url":"https://github.com/aspnet/Announcements/issues/376","RelatedDescription":"Open issue \"HttpResponse body infrastructure changes\" (#376)"},{"Id":"473077311","IsPullRequest":false,"CreatedAt":"2019-07-25T21:25:57","Actor":"HaoK","Number":"375","RawContent":null,"Title":"Breaking change in IAuthorizationPolicyProvider","State":"open","Body":"As part of https://github.com/aspnet/AspNetCore/pull/9759 we added a new method to `IAuthorizationPolicyProvider.GetFallbackPolicyAsync` which is the policy that will be used by the authorization middleware when no policy is specified.","Url":"https://github.com/aspnet/Announcements/issues/375","RelatedDescription":"Open issue \"Breaking change in IAuthorizationPolicyProvider\" (#375)"},{"Id":"472946568","IsPullRequest":false,"CreatedAt":"2019-07-25T15:58:23","Actor":"HaoK","Number":"374","RawContent":null,"Title":"Breaking change in SignInManager constructor (new parameter)","State":"open","Body":"As part of adding support for new email/confirmation flows in Identity(https://github.com/aspnet/AspNetCore/issues/8356), we added a new `IUserConfirmation<TUser>` argument to the constructor of `SignInManager`\r\n\r\n\r\n","Url":"https://github.com/aspnet/Announcements/issues/374","RelatedDescription":"Open issue \"Breaking change in SignInManager constructor (new parameter)\" (#374)"},{"Id":"465890178","IsPullRequest":false,"CreatedAt":"2019-07-09T17:01:09","Actor":"blowdart","Number":"373","RawContent":null,"Title":"Microsoft Security Advisory CVE-2019-1075: ASP.NET Core Spoofing Vulnerability","State":"open","Body":"# Microsoft Security Advisory CVE-2019-1075: ASP.NET Core Spoofing Vulnerability\r\n\r\n## <a name=\"executive-summary\"></a>Executive summary\r\n\r\nMicrosoft is releasing this security advisory to provide information about a vulnerability in ASP.NET Core 2.1 and 2.2. This advisory also provides guidance on what developers can do to update their applications to remove this vulnerability.\r\n\r\nMicrosoft is aware of a spoofing vulnerability that exists in ASP.NET Core that could lead to an open redirect.

This advisory also provides guidance on what developers can do to update their applications to remove this vulnerability.\r\n\r\nMicrosoft is aware of a denial of service vulnerability exists when ASP.NET Core improperly handles web requests. An attacker who successfully exploited this vulnerability could cause a denial of service against an ASP.NET Core web application. The vulnerability can be exploited remotely, without authentication.\r\n\r\nA remote unauthenticated attacker could exploit this vulnerability by issuing specially crafted requests to the ASP.NET Core application.\r\n\r\nThe update addresses the vulnerability by correcting how the ASP.NET Core web application handles web requests.\r\n\r\n## Discussion\r\n\r\nDiscussion for this issue can be found at https://github.com/aspnet/AspNetCore/issues/10238\r\n\r\n### <a name=\"mitigation-factors\"></a>Mitigation factors\r\n\r\nMicrosoft has not identified any mitigating factors for this vulnerability.\r\n\r\n## <a name=\"affected-software\"></a>Affected software\r\n\r\nAny ASP.NET Core based application that uses any of following vulnerable packages:\r\n\r\nPackage name | Vulnerable versions | Secure versions\r\n------------ | ------------------- | -------------------------\r\nMicrosoft.AspNetCore.SignalR.Protocols.MessagePack | 1.0.0, 1.0.1, 1.0.2, 1.0.3, 1.0.4<br/>1.1.0 | 1.0.11<br/>1.1.5\r\n\r\n## <a name=\"advisory-faq\"></a>Advisory FAQ\r\n\r\n### <a name=\"how-affected\"></a>How do I know if I am affected?\r\n\r\nThe affected assemblies are also available separately as a NuGet package. If you are not using `Microsoft.AspNetCore.SignalR.Protocols.MessagePack` directly you may still be affected if you are using SignalR and the package is a transitive dependency.\r\n\r\n#### Direct dependencies\r\n\r\nDirect dependencies are discoverable by examining your `csproj` file. They can be fixed by [editing the project file](#fixing-direct-dependencies) or using NuGet to update the dependency.\r\n\r\n#### Transitive dependencies\r\n\r\nTransitive dependencies occur when you add a package to your project that in turn relies on another package. For example, if Contoso publishes a package `Contoso.Utility` which, in turn, depends on `Contoso.Internals` and you add the `Contoso.Utility` package to your project now your project has a direct dependency on `Contoso.Utility` and, because `Contoso.Utility` depends 'Contoso.Internals', your application gains a transitive dependency on the `Contoso.Internals` package.\r\n\r\nTransitive dependencies are reviewable in two ways:\r\n\r\n* In the Visual Studio Solution Explorer window, which supports searching.\r\n* By examining the `project.assets.json` file contained in the obj directory of your project for `csproj` based projects\r\n\r\nThe `project.assets.json` files are the authoritative list of all packages used by your project, containing both direct and transitive dependencies.\r\n\r\nThere are two ways to view transitive dependencies. You can either [use Visual Studio’s Solution Explorer](#vs-solution-explorer), or you can review [the `project.assets.json` file](#project-assets-json)).\r\n\r\n##### <a name=\"vs-solution-explorer\"></a>Using Visual Studio Solution Explorer\r\n\r\nTo use Solution Explorer, open the project in Visual Studio, and then press Ctrl+; to activate the search in Solution Explorer. Search for the [vulnerable package](#affected-software) and make a note of the version numbers of any results you find.\r\n\r\nFor example, searching for `Microsoft.AspNetCore.Mvc.Core` in an example project that contains a package that takes a dependency on `Microsoft.AspNetCore.Mvc` shows the following results in Visual Studio 2017:\r\n\r\n![Screenshot of search results in Visual Studio 2017](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/796298/25858816/8ecdc2b4-3491-11e7-9363-746804bb9832.png)\r\n\r\nThe search results appear as a tree. In the previous results, you can see that a reference to `Microsoft.AspNetCore.Mvc.Core` version 1.1.2 is discovered.\r\n\r\nUnder the Dependencies node is a NuGet node. Under the NuGet node is the list of packages you have directly taken a dependency on and their versions.\r\nIn screenshot, the application takes a direct dependency on `Microsoft.AspNetCore.Mvc`. `Microsoft.AspNetCore.Mvc` in turn has leaf nodes that list its dependencies and their versions.\r\nThe `Microsoft.AspNetCore.Mvc` package takes a dependency on a version of `Microsoft.AspNetCore.Mvc.ApiExplorer`, that in turn takes a dependency on a version of `Microsoft.AspNetCore.Mvc.Core`.\r\n\r\n##### <a name=\"project-assets-json\"></a> Manually reviewing project.assets.json\r\n\r\nOpen the *project.assets.json* file from your project’s obj directory in your editor. We suggest you use an editor that understands JSON and allows you to collapse and expand nodes to review this file.\r\nVisual Studio and Visual Studio Code provide JSON friendly editing.\r\n\r\nSearch the *project.assets.json* file for the [vulnerable package](#affected-software), using the format `packagename/` for each of the package names from the preceding table. If you find the assembly name in your search:\r\n\r\n* Examine the line on which they are found, the version number is after the `/`.\r\n* Compare to the [vulnerable versions table](#affected-software).\r\n\r\nFor example, a search result that shows `System.IO.Pipelines/4.5.0` is a reference to version 4.5.0 of `System.IO.Pipelines`.\r\n\r\nIf your *project.assets.json* file includes references to the [vulnerable package](#affected-software), then you need to fix the transitive dependencies.\r\n\r\nIf you have not found any reference to any vulnerable packages, this means either\r\n\r\n* None of your direct dependencies depend on any vulnerable packages, or\r\n* You have already fixed the problem by updating the direct dependencies.\r\n\r\n### <a name=\"how-fix\"></a>How do I fix the issue?\r\n\r\n#### <a name=\"fixing-direct-dependencies\"></a>Fixing direct dependencies\r\n\r\nOpen *projectname.csproj* in your editor. If you're using Visual Studio, right-click the project and choose **Edit projectname.csproj** from the context menu, where projectname is the name of your project. Look for `PackageReference` elements. The following shows an example project file:\r\n\r\n```xml\r\n<Project Sdk=\"Microsoft.NET.Sdk.Web\">\r\n  <PropertyGroup>\r\n    <TargetFramework>netcoreapp2.1</TargetFramework>\r\n  </PropertyGroup>\r\n  <ItemGroup>\r\n    <PackageReference Include=\"Microsoft.AspNetCore.SignalR.Protocols.MessagePack\" Version=\"1.0.0\" />\r\n  </ItemGroup>\r\n</Project>\r\n```\r\n\r\nThe preceding example has a reference to the [vulnerable package](#affected-software), as seen by the single `PackageReference` element. The name of the package is in the `Include` attribute.\r\nThe package version number is in the `Version` attribute. The previous example shows a single direct dependency on `System.IO.Pipelines` version 4.5.0\r\n\r\nTo update the version to the secure package, change the version number to the updated package version as listed on the table [previously](#affected-software).\r\nIn this example, update `System.IO.Pipelines` to the appropriate [fixed package number](#affected-software) for your major version. Save the *csproj* file. The example *csproj* now looks as follows:\r\n\r\n```xml\r\n<Project Sdk=\"Microsoft.NET.Sdk.Web\">\r\n  <PropertyGroup>\r\n    <TargetFramework>netcoreapp2.1</TargetFramework>\r\n  </PropertyGroup>\r\n  <ItemGroup>\r\n    <PackageReference Include=\"Microsoft.AspNetCore.SignalR.Protocols.MessagePack\" Version=\"1.0.11\" />\r\n  </ItemGroup>\r\n</Project>\r\n```\r\n\r\nIf you're using Visual Studio and you save your updated *csproj* file, Visual Studio will restore the new package version.\r\nYou can see the restore results by opening the **Output** window (Ctrl+Alt+O) and changing the **Show output from** drop-down list to **Package Manager**.\r\n\r\nIf you're not using Visual Studio, open a command line and change to your project directory. Execute the `dotnet restore` command to restore the updated dependencies.\r\n\r\nNow recompile your application. If after recompilation you see a *Dependency conflict warning*, you must update your other direct dependencies to versions that take a dependency on the updated package.\r\n\r\n#### <a name=\"transitive-dependencies\"></a>Fixing transitive dependencies\r\n\r\nIf your transitive dependency review found references to the [vulnerable package](#affected-software), you must add a direct dependency to the updated package to your *csproj* file to override the transitive dependency.\r\n\r\nOpen *projectname.csproj* in your editor. If you're using Visual Studio, right-click the project and choose **Edit projectname.csproj** from the context menu, where projectname is the name of your project.\r\nLook for `PackageReference` nodes, for example:\r\n\r\n```xml\r\n<Project Sdk=\"Microsoft.NET.Sdk.\">\r\n  <PropertyGroup>\r\n    <TargetFramework>net461</TargetFramework>\r\n  </PropertyGroup>\r\n  <ItemGroup>\r\n    <PackageReference Include=\"ThirdParty.NotUpdatedYet\" Version=\"2.0.0\" />\r\n  </ItemGroup>\r\n</Project>\r\n```\r\n\r\nYou must add a direct dependency to the updated version of the [vulnerable package](#affected-software) by adding it to the *csproj* file.\r\nYou do this by adding a new line to the dependencies section, referencing the fixed version.\r\nFor example, if your search showed a transitive reference to a vulnerable `System.ServiceModel.Http` version, you'd add a reference to the [fixed package number](#affected-software).\r\n\r\n```xml\r\n<Project Sdk=\"Microsoft.NET.Sdk.Web\">\r\n  <PropertyGroup>\r\n    <TargetFramework>net461</TargetFramework>\r\n  </PropertyGroup>\r\n  <ItemGroup>\r\n    <PackageReference Include=\"Microsoft.AspNetCore.SignalR.Protocols.MessagePack\" Version=\"1.0.11\" />\r\n    <PackageReference Include=\"ThirdParty.NotUpdatedYet\" Version=\"2.0.0\" />\r\n  </ItemGroup>\r\n</Project>\r\n```\r\n\r\nAfter you've added the direct dependency reference, save your *csproj* file.\r\n\r\nIf you're using Visual Studio, save your updated *csproj* file and Visual Studio will restore the new package versions.\r\nYou can see the restore results by opening the **Output** window (Ctrl+Alt+O) and changing the **Show output from** drop-down list to **Package Manager**.\r\n\r\nIf you're not using Visual Studio, open a command line and change to your project directory. Execute the `dotnet restore` command to restore the new dependencies.\r\n\r\n##### Rebuilding your application\r\n\r\nFinally, you must rebuild your application, test, and redeploy.\r\n\r\n## Other Information\r\n\r\n### Reporting Security Issues\r\n\r\nIf you have found a potential security issue in .NET Core, please email details to secure@microsoft.com.

This change was made to avoid DI issues such as duplicate singleton services getting created.\r\n\r\nMitigations:\r\n\r\n Inject services into Startup.Configure:\r\n`public void Configure(IApplicationBuilder app, IOptions<MyOptions> options)`\r\n\r\n[We'll add more based on requests for specific scenarios.]\r\n\r\nSee https://github.com/aspnet/AspNetCore/issues/9337 for discussion.","Url":"https://github.com/aspnet/Announcements/issues/353","RelatedDescription":"Open issue \"Generic Host restricts Startup constructor injection\" (#353)"},{"Id":"431074054","IsPullRequest":false,"CreatedAt":"2019-04-09T16:52:55","Actor":"shirhatti","Number":"352","RawContent":null,"Title":"Microsoft Security Advisory CVE-2019-0815: ASP.NET Core denial of service vulnerability","State":"open","Body":"# Microsoft Security Advisory CVE-2019-0815: ASP.NET Core denial of service vulnerability\r\n\r\n## Executive Summary\r\n\r\nMicrosoft is releasing this security advisory to provide information about a vulnerability in public ASP.NET Core 2.2. This advisory also provides guidance on what developers can do to update their applications correctly.\r\nMicrosoft is aware of a security vulnerability in all public versions of ASP.NET Core where, if an application is hosted on Internet Information Server (IIS) a remote unauthenticated attacker can use a specially crafted request can cause a Denial of Service. The security update addresses the vulnerability by ensuring the IIS worker process does not crash in response to specially crafted requests.\r\n\r\n## Discussion\r\n\r\nDiscussion for this issue can be found at https://github.com/aspnet/AspNetCore/issues/9205\r\n\r\n\r\n## Affected Software\r\n\r\nThe vulnerability affects any Microsoft ASP.NET Core 2.2 applications if it is hosted on an IIS server running AspNetCoreModuleV2 (ANCM) prior to and including version 12.2.19024.2.\r\n\r\nThe vulnerability affects any Microsoft ASP.NET Core 1.0/1.1/2/1 application if they have explicitly opted into using the newer AspNetCoreModuleV2 (ANCM) prior to and including  version 12.2.19024.2.\r\n\r\n## Advisory FAQ\r\n\r\n### How do I know if I am affected?\r\n\r\nYou are affected if **BOTH** criteria below are met.\r\n\r\n1.\tThe AspNetCoreModuleV2 module is used by your application\r\n\r\nThe modules attribute in the handler mapping section of the web.config of your application must exactly match the string `AspNetCoreModuleV2`.\r\n\r\n```xml\r\n<?xml version=\"1.0\" encoding=\"utf-8\"?>\r\n<configuration>\r\n  <location path=\".\" inheritInChildApplications=\"false\">\r\n    <system.webServer>\r\n      <handlers>\r\n        <add name=\"aspNetCore\" path=\"*\" verb=\"*\" modules=\"AspNetCoreModuleV2\" resourceType=\"Unspecified\" />\r\n      </handlers>\r\n      <aspNetCore processPath=\"dotnet\" arguments=\".\\myapp.dll\" stdoutLogEnabled=\"false\" stdoutLogFile=\".\\logs\\stdout\" hostingModel=\"inprocess\" />\r\n    </system.webServer>\r\n  </location>\r\n</configuration>\r\n```\r\n2.\tThe version of AspNetCoreModuleV2 module installed on your machine is less than or equal to 12.2.19024.2\r\n\r\nOpen a PowerShell prompt and run the following command\r\n\r\n```ps1\r\n(Get-Item \"$env:ProgramFiles\\IIS\\Asp.Net Core Module\\V2\\aspnetcorev2.dll\").VersionInfo\r\n```\r\n\r\nor use the Windows file properties dialog to check the version on C:\\Program Files\\IIS\\Asp.Net Core Module\\V2\\aspnetcorev2.dll, where C: is your OS install drive.\r\n\r\nHow do I fix the issue?\r\n\r\nInstall the latest version of the ASP.NET Core Runtime & Hosting Bundle 2.2.\r\n\r\nThen restart IIS by running\r\n\r\n```cmd\r\nnet stop was /y\r\nnet start w3svc\r\n```\r\nfrom an elevated command line.\r\n\r\n## Other Information\r\n\r\n### Reporting Security Issues\r\n\r\nIf you have found a potential security issue in .NET Core, please email details to secure@microsoft.com.
