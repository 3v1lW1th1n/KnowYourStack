This means some folks will lose their Collaborator badge and the ability to interact with the CI system.*\r\n\r\nOver the years, we’ve added a bunch of folks as collaborators with read permissions to our public repos. The rationale was that we wanted to be able to assign issues to community members because GitHub only allowed assigning issues to users with an explicit permission grant for the repository. However, they changed this in [June 2019](https://github.blog/2019-06-25-assign-issues-to-issue-commenters/). Now, we can assign issues to all users with explicit permissions as well as to users that have commented on the specific issue.\r\n\r\nAlso, we recently started to audit and tighten the permissions for our organizations. As a result, it became clear that large number of repo-specific permission grants are hard to review and audit. Internally, our goal is to grant all permissions via teams instead.\r\n\r\nHence, we plan to remove all collaborators from public repos that only have read permissions (folks with triage permissions will remain). The full list of affected repos is listed below.\r\n\r\nThis shouldn’t impact your ability to work with us, but losing explicit read-only has the following implications:\r\n\r\n-   **You’ll lose the contributor badge**. We understand that this is visually appealing and for some people it might have been a badge of honor. But given that GitHub also shows a Contributor bade for folks whose PRs got merged, we don’t think it this will be a major take back.    \r\n    ![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/5169960/70491508-43acf580-1ab6-11ea-94df-74ea2dde98b4.png)\r\n\r\n\r\n-   **You lose the ability to interact with the CI system**. As a collaborator, you can use comments to [send commands to the CI system](https://github.com/dotnet/runtime/blob/master/docs/project/pullrequest-builds.md). While this can be useful at times, we generally don’t expect (or desire) contributors to do that. Of course, anyone can still access the CI logs.\r\n\r\n| Public Repo                | \\#collaborators with read |\r\n|----------------------------|---------------------------|\r\n| arcade                     | 1                         |\r\n| BenchmarkDotNet            | 11                        |\r\n| cli                        | 2                         |\r\n| command-line-api           | 14                        |\r\n| coreclr                    | 18                        |\r\n| corefx                     | 180                       |\r\n| corefxlab                  | 4                         |\r\n| corert                     | 7                         |\r\n| core-sdk                   | 1                         |\r\n| docs                       | 3                         |\r\n| interactive-window         | 1                         |\r\n| machinelearning            | 1                         |\r\n| machinelearning-samples    | 1                         |\r\n| msbuild-language-service   | 1                         |\r\n| runtime                    | 128                       |\r\n| spark                      | 5                         |\r\n| standard                   | 1                         |\r\n| windowsdesktop             | 1                         |\r\n| winforms-datavisualization | 1                         |\r\n| Grand Total                | 381                       |\r\n\r\n### Discussion\r\n\r\nTo discuss this, please comment on the corresponding issue at https://github.com/dotnet/runtime/issues/718."},{"Id":"11003471296","Type":"IssuesEvent","CreatedAt":"2019-12-03T20:36:30","Actor":"MichaelSimons","Repository":"dotnet/announcements","Organization":"dotnet","RawContent":null,"RelatedAction":"opened","RelatedUrl":"https://github.com/dotnet/announcements/issues/143","RelatedDescription":"Opened issue \".NET Core `latest` Docker tags updated to 3.1\" (#143) at dotnet/announcements","RelatedBody":"# .NET Core `latest` Docker tags updated to 3.1\r\n\r\nThe `latest` tags for the [dotnet/core](https://hub.docker.com/_/microsoft-dotnet-core) repos have been updated to reference [.NET Core 3.1](https://devblogs.microsoft.com/dotnet/announcing-net-core-3-1/).\r\n\r\n## Discussion\r\n \r\nYou can share your thoughts on this change or see what others are saying at:\r\n \r\n* [dotnet/dotnet-docker#1337](https://github.com/dotnet/dotnet-docker/issues/1511)\r\n\r\n## Details\r\n\r\n* [dotnet-docker#1509](https://github.com/dotnet/dotnet-docker/pull/1509)\r\n\r\nThe `latest` tags for the [dotnet/core](https://hub.docker.com/_/microsoft-dotnet-core) repos are always intended to reference the latest supported version of .NET Core.

That means that .NET Core manifest tags are no longer usable on those Windows versions.\r\n\r\nIf you pull a manifest tag on one of the Windows versions described, you may get one of the following error messages:\r\n\r\n* `a Windows version 10.0.18362-based image is incompatible with a 10.0.17134 host`\r\n* `no matching manifest for windows/amd64 in the manifest list entries`\r\n* `no matching manifest for unknown in the manifest list entries`\r\n\r\nIf you need to still use Nano Server, version 1803 images (even though it is no longer supported), you will need to use tags that include the Nano Server version (these are non-manifest tags), for example `mcr.microsoft.com/dotnet/core/runtime:3.0-nanoserver-1803`."},{"Id":"10864634140","Type":"IssuesEvent","CreatedAt":"2019-11-14T17:15:09","Actor":"leecow","Repository":"dotnet/announcements","Organization":"dotnet","RawContent":null,"RelatedAction":"opened","RelatedUrl":"https://github.com/dotnet/announcements/issues/139","RelatedDescription":"Opened issue \".NET Core 3.1.0 Preview 3\" (#139) at dotnet/announcements","RelatedBody":".NET Core 3.1.0 Preview 3 is available and https://github.com/dotnet/core/issues/3809 has been opened for discussion.\r\n\r\n[Release Notes](https://github.com/dotnet/core/blob/master/release-notes/3.1/preview/3.1.0-preview3.md)\r\n[Download](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/download/dotnet-core/3.1)\r\n\r\n**Blog posts**\r\n\r\n[.NET Core](https://devblogs.microsoft.com/dotnet/announcing-net-core-3-1-preview-3/)\r\n[ASP.NET Core](https://devblogs.microsoft.com/aspnet/asp-net-core-updates-in-net-core-3-1-preview-3/)\r\n\r\nPlease report any issues you find with .NET Core 3.1 Preview 3, either responding to this issue, creating a new issue or creating a new issue in one of the following repos:\r\n\r\n* [aspnet/Home](https://github.com/aspnet/Home) - for ASP.NET Core questions\r\n* [aspnet/EntityFrameworkCore](https://github.com/aspnet/EntityFrameworkCore) - for Entity Framework Core questions\r\n* [dotnet/cli](https://github.com/dotnet/cli/issues) - for CLI tools and questions\r\n* [dotnet/corefx](https://github.com/dotnet/corefx/issues) - for API issues and questions\r\n* [dotnet/coreclr](https://github.com/dotnet/coreclr/issues) - for runtime issues\r\n* [dotnet/core-setup](https://github.com/dotnet/core-setup/issues) - for installer issues\r\n* [dotnet/winforms](https://github.com/dotnet/winforms/issues) - for Winforms issues\r\n* [dotnet/wpf](https://github.com/dotnet/wpf/issues) - for WPF issues\r\n* [nuget/home](https://github.com/nuget/home/issues) - for NuGet questions and issues\r\n"},{"Id":"10862597044","Type":"IssuesEvent","CreatedAt":"2019-11-14T13:37:29","Actor":"TaraOverfield","Repository":"dotnet/announcements","Organization":"dotnet","RawContent":null,"RelatedAction":"opened","RelatedUrl":"https://github.com/dotnet/announcements/issues/138","RelatedDescription":"Opened issue \"November 2019 .NET Updates\" (#138) at dotnet/announcements","RelatedBody":"The following .NET updates were released on October 2019.

latest GCC.\r\n\r\nCLR is a closest one runtime than can bring \"self-modifying code\" benefits to the every-day programming.\r\nSelf-modifying code have huge undiscovered potential, mary \"under the hood\" CoreFX parts can be re-implemented with more than 10x speed up.\r\n\r\nProblems: \r\n1) Exceptions\r\n2) Reference object pinning\r\n3) Debugging\r\n4) OS Security

Therefore method calls fail as they target the root of Ambassador instead. e.g. the logs of ambassador shows something similar to this:\r\n\r\n> ACCESS [2019-12-12T15:16:38.440Z] \"POST /Greet.Greeter/SayHello HTTP/1.1\"\r\n\r\nInstead of (note the 'grpc-web-dot-net'):\r\n> ACCESS [2019-12-12T15:18:19.374Z] \"POST /grpc-web-dot-net/Greet.Greeter/SayHello HTTP/1.1\"\r\n\r\nDigging into the code I noticed that in the generated grpc client proxy, the generated __ServiceName property is indeed only \"Greet.Greeter\" and not \"/grpc-web-dot-net/Greet.Greeter\", so method calls are invoked without the full path that I specified.\r\n\r\nIs there some kind of method or pattern to avoid stripping the ambassador prefix and take the address as provided? \r\n\r\n**Issue 2:**\r\nWhat I did as a workaround to the previous issue, was to create a partial class that will hard-code the missing prefix and recreate the method call (ugly, but hopefully a temporary solution):\r\n```\r\nnamespace GrpcService1\r\n{\r\n    using grpc = global::Grpc.Core;\r\n    public partial class Greeter\r\n    {\r\n        static Greeter()\r\n        {\r\n            __ServiceName = $\"grpc-web-dot-net/{__ServiceName}\";\r\n\r\n             __Method_SayHello = new grpc::Method<global::GrpcService1.HelloRequest, global::GrpcService1.HelloReply>(\r\n                    grpc::MethodType.Unary,\r\n                    __ServiceName,\r\n                    \"SayHello\",\r\n                    __Marshaller_Greet_HelloRequest,\r\n                    __Marshaller_Greet_HelloReply);\r\n        }\r\n    }\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nWhile this works ok, and my grpc service is finally getting the request and processes it well and as expected, I get the following GrpcException:\r\n\r\n> Status(StatusCode=Internal, Detail=\"Bad gRPC response. Response protocol downgraded to HTTP/1.1.\")\r\n\r\nThis I found to be confusing because while in the Ambassador logs I see this HTTP/1.1:\r\n\r\n> ACCESS [2019-12-12T17:14:41.376Z] \"POST /grpc-web-dot-net/Greet.Greeter/SayHello HTTP/1.1\" 200\r\n\r\nThe gRPC server actually received the request as HTTP/2:\r\n\r\n> Request starting HTTP/2 POST http://[...]/Greet.Greeter/SayHello application/grpc\r\n\r\nCan you please assist understanding the problem here?\r\n\r\nWhen targeting the gRPC AKS service directly and not via ambassador, everything is working ok. The problem is only with targeting it via Ambassador.\r\n\r\nThanks."},{"Id":"11075789044","Type":"IssuesEvent","CreatedAt":"2019-12-12T16:54:43","Actor":"karelz","Repository":"dotnet/corefx","Organization":"dotnet","RawContent":null,"RelatedAction":"closed","RelatedUrl":"https://github.com/dotnet/corefx/issues/42161","RelatedDescription":"Closed issue \"NetEventSource can throw on the completion port callback thread.\" (#42161) at dotnet/corefx","RelatedBody":"This is the first of a class of bugs of the same form that we call the heart of darkness.

The analyzer team is already [maintaining a table of used ranges](https://github.com/dotnet/roslyn-analyzers/blob/master/src/Utilities/Compiler/DiagnosticCategoryAndIdRanges.txt) that 1st parties should use to avoid conflicts.\r\n\r\nHowever, we don't really have any guidance how third parties should choose their prefix to avoid conflicts. It seems to me that a prefix should be owned by a single party that can then control the IDs.\r\n\r\nA few things:\r\n\r\n1. **Should Roslyn enforce that certain prefixes are only used by 1st parties?** This would certainly include `CS` and `BC`, but should probably also include `CA` and `IDE`.\r\n\r\n2. **Should we give guidance to use longer prefixes?** My understanding is that the prefix can be of any length, not just 2-3 characters. One option to avoid conflicts would be to use a qualified name, such as the NuGet package name.\r\n\r\n3. **Should we give guidance to use longer IDs?** My understanding is that there is no requirement to use numbers. We could just tell people to spell out string like `CA_Do_Not_Use_Async_Suffixes`. In this cases, prefixes are almost irrelevant as two parties are fairly unlikely to use define the same rule (and if they do, it probably doesn't matter because suppressing both simultaneously is probably desired anyways)."},{"Id":"11079146927","Type":"PullRequestEvent","CreatedAt":"2019-12-13T01:50:21","Actor":"333fred","Repository":"dotnet/roslyn","Organization":"dotnet","RawContent":null,"RelatedAction":"opened","RelatedUrl":"https://github.com/dotnet/roslyn/pull/40350","RelatedDescription":"Opened pull request \"Added System.Index and System.Range\" (#40350) at dotnet/roslyn","RelatedBody":"Implementations are copied from corefx, with minor changes around the\r\nformatting methods, throw helpers, and HashCode to remove unavailable\r\napis.\r\n\r\nYou can find corefx's versions here:\r\nhttps://github.com/dotnet/runtime/blob/master/src/libraries/System.Private.CoreLib/src/System/Index.cs\r\nhttps://github.com/dotnet/runtime/blob/master/src/libraries/System.Private.CoreLib/src/System/Range.cs"},{"Id":"11079097149","Type":"PullRequestEvent","CreatedAt":"2019-12-13T01:38:01","Actor":"mavasani","Repository":"dotnet/roslyn","Organization":"dotnet","RawContent":null,"RelatedAction":"merged","RelatedUrl":"https://github.com/dotnet/roslyn/pull/38908","RelatedDescription":"Merged pull request \"Add codefix for CS0708\" (#38908) at dotnet/roslyn","RelatedBody":"**Description**\r\nThis PR provides a code-fix for the compiler error `CS0708`.\r\n\r\n**Issues fixed**\r\nFix #31838 "},{"Id":"11079097103","Type":"IssuesEvent","CreatedAt":"2019-12-13T01:38:00","Actor":"mavasani","Repository":"dotnet/roslyn","Organization":"dotnet","RawContent":null,"RelatedAction":"closed","RelatedUrl":"https://github.com/dotnet/roslyn/issues/31838","RelatedDescription":"Closed issue \"Code fix for CS0708 to make member static\" (#31838) at dotnet/roslyn","RelatedBody":"```c#\r\nstatic class C\r\n{\r\n    void M() // CS0708: 'M': cannot declare instance members in a static class\r\n    {\r\n    }\r\n}\r\n```\r\nIt would be nice to have a code fix to make `M` static."}],"ResultType":"GitHubEvent"},"CoreRT":{"Events":[{"Id":"11078328150","Type":"IssuesEvent","CreatedAt":"2019-12-12T22:50:16","Actor":"jkotas","Repository":"dotnet/corert","Organization":"dotnet","RawContent":null,"RelatedAction":"closed","RelatedUrl":"https://github.com/dotnet/corert/issues/7852","RelatedDescription":"Closed issue \"AF: InstantiatedMethod.SetCachedCanonValue\" (#7852) at dotnet/corert","RelatedBody":"```\r\n  Generating compatible native code.

https://github.com/dotnet/corefx/issues/42192\r\n\r\n### Summary\r\nOn RHEL 8, some time zones (specifically `Africa/Casablanca`) stop supporting daylight savings transitions because of a change in the tzdata files.\r\n\r\n### Customer Impact\r\nApplications getting time zone information on RedHat 8 (and potentially other Unix distros if using the same tzdata version) stop working with daylight savings time for `Africa/Casablanca` time zone.\r\n\r\nThis change allows `TimeZoneInfo` to work correctly for all the daylight savings transitions in the tzdata file, and it skips the \"future\" daylight savings template if we can't support it.\r\n\r\n### Regression?\r\nFor a user it is a regression when updating to RHEL 8 because of the change in the tzdata in the OS. Our code didn't regress here - we never supported this format before now and were always throwing an exception. This is the first time we've hit it in the real-world.\r\n\r\n### Testing\r\nI ran all the TimeZoneInfo tests on RHEL 8. They failed for `Africa/Casablanca` before this change, and now pass afterward.\r\n\r\n### Risk\r\n**Low**: The change is isolated to a non-supported format that would cause DST to completely stop working before. Now we are allowing the other DST information to work, while skipping the unsupported future dates.\r\n\r\ncc: @danmosemsft @tarekgh @ericstj \r\n\r\n____\r\n\r\n\r\nIsDaylightSavingTime_CasablancaMultiYearDaylightSavings fails on rhel.8\r\n\r\nWhen parsing the tzdata POSIX string that contains an 'n' Julian date, we are currently throwing an exception, and then falling back to a TimeZoneInfo without DST enabled. However, this is a mistake because there are other DST transitions that were read from the tzdata file that are valid and usable. We shouldn't be throwing that information away.\r\n\r\nSo instead, we now skip the POSIX string if we detect an unsupported 'n' Julian date, and just use the last transition as the AdjustmentRule for all the DateTimes in the future. This way we can still make DST determinations correctly for some DateTimes.\r\n\r\nFix https://github.com/dotnet/corefx/issues/42192","Url":"https://github.com/dotnet/coreclr/pull/27969","RelatedDescription":"Open PR \"[release/3.1] Stop throwing exception in TimeZoneInfo POSIX parsing\" (#27969)"},{"Id":"535533061","IsPullRequest":false,"CreatedAt":"2019-12-10T14:47:07","Actor":"NMSAzulX","Number":"27968","RawContent":null,"Title":"How do I write code that allows a method to use Calli instructions at run time?

This pattern is possible as part of clean up in Task.Delay(timeout, cancellationToken), with the null ref then happening on a thread pool thread that results in the app crashing.\r\n\r\n## Customer Impact\r\n\r\nValid coding patterns, both in customer code and in our framework implementation, resulting in NullReferenceExceptions that may not be catchable.

The intention of it is to be interchangeable with regular Dictionary implementations -- where, we always use the interface IDictionary<T, T> to interact with either.  Both Dictionary and ConcurrentDictionary implement IDictionary interface members.\r\n\r\nThe class looks like this:\r\n\r\n\r\n    public class CaseInsensitiveDictionary<TValue>\r\n        : ConcurrentDictionary<string, TValue>\r\n    {\r\n        public CaseInsensitiveDictionary()\r\n            : base(StringComparer.InvariantCultureIgnoreCase)\r\n        {\r\n        }\r\n\r\n        private CaseInsensitiveDictionary(IDictionary<string, TValue> attributes)\r\n            : this()\r\n        {\r\n            AddRange(attributes);\r\n        }\r\n\r\n        public void Add(string key, TValue value)\r\n        {\r\n            this.TryAdd(key, value);\r\n        }\r\n\r\n        public void AddRange(IDictionary<string, TValue> entries)\r\n        {\r\n            foreach (var item in entries)\r\n            {\r\n                this.TryAdd(item.Key, item.Value);\r\n            }\r\n        }\r\n\r\n        public static CaseInsensitiveDictionary<TValue> Create(IDictionary<string, TValue> attributes = null)\r\n        {\r\n            if (attributes == null)\r\n            {\r\n                return new CaseInsensitiveDictionary<TValue>();\r\n            }\r\n            return new CaseInsensitiveDictionary<TValue>(attributes);\r\n        }\r\n\r\n        public static implicit operator Dictionary<string, TValue>(CaseInsensitiveDictionary<TValue> data)\r\n        {\r\n            return new Dictionary<string, TValue>(data);\r\n        }\r\n\r\n        public static implicit operator CaseInsensitiveDictionary<TValue>(Dictionary<string, TValue> data)\r\n        {\r\n            return Create(data);\r\n        }\r\n\r\n    }\r\n\r\n\r\n`  \r\n\r\n\r\nLet's say then that we are trying to implicitly convert the ConcurrentDictionary to and from a dictionary.  To test, I wrote these methods:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n        public void FromDictionaryToCaseInsensitiveDictionaryTest()\r\n        {\r\n\r\n            Dictionary<string, string> dc2 = new Dictionary<string, string>();\r\n            dc2.Add(\"test1\", \"test1 value\");\r\n\r\n            var dc3 = (CaseInsensitiveDictionary<string>)dc2;\r\n            Console.WriteLine(\"FromDictionaryToCaseInsensitiveDictionaryTest success\");\r\n        }\r\n\r\n        public void FromIDictionaryToCaseInsensitiveDictionaryTest()\r\n        {\r\n            IDictionary<string, string> dc2 = new Dictionary<string, string>();\r\n            dc2.Add(\"test1\", \"test1 value\");\r\n\r\n            var dc3 = (CaseInsensitiveDictionary<string>)dc2;\r\n\r\n            Console.WriteLine(\"FromIDictionaryToCaseInsensitiveDictionaryTest success\");\r\n        }\r\n\r\n\r\n        public void FromCaseInsensitiveDictionaryToDictionaryTest()\r\n        {\r\n\r\n            var dc2 = new CaseInsensitiveDictionary<string>();\r\n            dc2.Add(\"test1\", \"test1 value\");\r\n\r\n            var dc3 = (Dictionary<string, string>)dc2;\r\n\r\n            Console.WriteLine(\"FromCaseInsensitiveDictionaryToDictionaryTest success\");\r\n\r\n        }\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe first (FromDictionaryToCaseInsensitiveDictionaryTest) and third methods (FromCaseInsensitiveDictionaryToDictionaryTest) work fine and correctly use the operators.\r\n\r\nThe second one fails with this exception: System.InvalidCastException: 'Unable to cast object of type 'System.Collections.Generic.Dictionary`2[System.String,System.String]' to type 'OpenToken.CaseInsensitiveDictionary`1[System.String]'.'\r\n.  In my opinion, FromIDictionaryToCaseInsensitiveDictionaryTest should work because the type is CaseInsensitiveDictionary and implements IDictionary.  If I do NOT have the first conversion operator, the first test method fails with this exact same error message, \r\n\r\nWith this evidence, it seems to me that something is missing when the runtime is looking for the appropriate operator.  FromIDictionaryToCaseInsensitiveDictionaryTest should work either from the Dictionary operator or automatically work because it implements the IDictionary interface.  (I cannot create an operator for IDictionary conversion because that is illegal).  \r\n\r\nPlease let me know if this is expected behavior and if there is some workaround for it.  This issue seems to be present in all versions of C#.\r\n\r\nThanks!\r\n\r\n","Url":"https://github.com/dotnet/standard/issues/1659","RelatedDescription":"Closed issue \"Generic class operators derived from interface seems broken\" (#1659)"},{"Id":"526765953","IsPullRequest":false,"CreatedAt":"2019-11-25T02:23:45","Actor":"arizvisa","Number":"1657","RawContent":null,"Title":"packages.microsoft.com: signature check for netstandard-targeting-pack-2.1.0 failed","State":"closed","Body":"Hey guys, the signature check for this package seems to be failing.

Therefore method calls fail as they target the root of Ambassador instead. e.g. the logs of ambassador shows something similar to this:\r\n\r\n> ACCESS [2019-12-12T15:16:38.440Z] \"POST /Greet.Greeter/SayHello HTTP/1.1\"\r\n\r\nInstead of (note the 'grpc-web-dot-net'):\r\n> ACCESS [2019-12-12T15:18:19.374Z] \"POST /grpc-web-dot-net/Greet.Greeter/SayHello HTTP/1.1\"\r\n\r\nDigging into the code I noticed that in the generated grpc client proxy, the generated __ServiceName property is indeed only \"Greet.Greeter\" and not \"/grpc-web-dot-net/Greet.Greeter\", so method calls are invoked without the full path that I specified.\r\n\r\nIs there some kind of method or pattern to avoid stripping the ambassador prefix and take the address as provided? \r\n\r\n**Issue 2:**\r\nWhat I did as a workaround to the previous issue, was to create a partial class that will hard-code the missing prefix and recreate the method call (ugly, but hopefully a temporary solution):\r\n```\r\nnamespace GrpcService1\r\n{\r\n    using grpc = global::Grpc.Core;\r\n    public partial class Greeter\r\n    {\r\n        static Greeter()\r\n        {\r\n            __ServiceName = $\"grpc-web-dot-net/{__ServiceName}\";\r\n\r\n             __Method_SayHello = new grpc::Method<global::GrpcService1.HelloRequest, global::GrpcService1.HelloReply>(\r\n                    grpc::MethodType.Unary,\r\n                    __ServiceName,\r\n                    \"SayHello\",\r\n                    __Marshaller_Greet_HelloRequest,\r\n                    __Marshaller_Greet_HelloReply);\r\n        }\r\n    }\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nWhile this works ok, and my grpc service is finally getting the request and processes it well and as expected, I get the following GrpcException:\r\n\r\n> Status(StatusCode=Internal, Detail=\"Bad gRPC response. Response protocol downgraded to HTTP/1.1.\")\r\n\r\nThis I found to be confusing because while in the Ambassador logs I see this HTTP/1.1:\r\n\r\n> ACCESS [2019-12-12T17:14:41.376Z] \"POST /grpc-web-dot-net/Greet.Greeter/SayHello HTTP/1.1\" 200\r\n\r\nThe gRPC server actually received the request as HTTP/2:\r\n\r\n> Request starting HTTP/2 POST http://[...]/Greet.Greeter/SayHello application/grpc\r\n\r\nCan you please assist understanding the problem here?\r\n\r\nWhen targeting the gRPC AKS service directly and not via ambassador, everything is working ok. The problem is only with targeting it via Ambassador.\r\n\r\nThanks.","Url":"https://github.com/dotnet/corefx/issues/42774","RelatedDescription":"Open issue \"gRPC and Ambassador issues\" (#42774)"},{"Id":"536726110","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2019-12-12T02:51:49","Actor":"layomia","Number":"42772","RawContent":null,"Title":"Improve (de)serialization support for nested dictionaries","State":"open","Body":"Fixes https://github.com/dotnet/runtime/issues/670.\r\n\r\ncc @ericstj ","Url":"https://github.com/dotnet/corefx/pull/42772","RelatedDescription":"Open PR \"Improve (de)serialization support for nested dictionaries\" (#42772)"},{"Id":"536424352","IsPullRequest":false,"CreatedAt":"2019-12-11T15:19:08","Actor":"Adam-Tg","Number":"42770","RawContent":null,"Title":"Could not load file or assembly 'System.Security.Principal.Windows', manifest definition does not match the assembly reference","State":"closed","Body":"Solution has compiled successfully, but when executing, the following exception gets thrown:\r\n\r\n> System.IO.FileLoadException: Could not load file or assembly 'System.Security.Principal.Windows, Version=4.1.1.0, Culture=neutral, PublicKeyToken=b03f5f7f11d50a3a' or one of its dependencies.

It seems to me that a prefix should be owned by a single party that can then control the IDs.\r\n\r\nA few things:\r\n\r\n1. **Should Roslyn enforce that certain prefixes are only used by 1st parties?** This would certainly include `CS` and `BC`, but should probably also include `CA` and `IDE`.\r\n\r\n2. **Should we give guidance to use longer prefixes?** My understanding is that the prefix can be of any length, not just 2-3 characters.

This has worked ok up till now, but there is a problem I think with `FieldInfo.SetValue`.  This takes an object so boxes the float32.  Currently this fails as the address passed to `SetValue` is an address to a float64 and RhBox does not expect that and the value is corrupted (a 64bit float is interpreted as a 32 bit float I think).  In other words the following test fails\r\n```\r\n    internal static void TestBoxSingle()\r\n    {\r\n        StartTest(\"Test box single\");\r\n        var fi = typeof(ClassWithFloat).GetField(\"F\");\r\n        fi.SetValue(null, 1.1f);\r\n\r\n        PrintLine(ClassWithFloat.F.ToString());\r\n        EndTest(1.1f == ClassWithFloat.F);\r\n    }\r\n}\r\n\r\npublic class ClassWithFloat\r\n{\r\n    public static float F;\r\n}\r\n``` \r\nAnd it prints -1.0842022E-19.   In the Wasm backend the evaluation stack can have a `StackEntry` type of `FloatConstantEntry`, but this I'm not sure is sufficient to solve this problem as the enum for StackValueKind is \r\n```\r\n    internal enum StackValueKind\r\n    {\r\n        /// <summary>An unknow type.</summary>\r\n        Unknown,\r\n        /// <summary>Any signed or unsigned integer values that can be represented as a 32-bit entity.</summary>\r\n        Int32,\r\n        /// <summary>Any signed or unsigned integer values that can be represented as a 64-bit entity.</summary>\r\n        Int64,\r\n        /// <summary>Underlying platform pointer type represented as an integer of the appropriate size.</summary>\r\n        NativeInt,\r\n        /// <summary>Any float value.</summary>\r\n        Float,\r\n        /// <summary>A managed pointer.</summary>\r\n        ByRef,\r\n        /// <summary>An object reference.</summary>\r\n        ObjRef,\r\n        /// <summary>A value type which is not any of the primitive one.</summary>\r\n        ValueType\r\n    }\r\n```\r\nIt does not distinguish between 32 and 64 bit floats, so its impossible, I think, to load the constant correctly from\r\n```\r\n  IL_0023:  ldc.r4     1.1\r\n  IL_0028:  box        [System.Runtime]System.Single\r\n```\r\nThe 1.1 is loaded with the `FloatConstantEntry` and it can't be passed correctly to the box/RhBox as its unknown whether to trunc the float or not.  \r\n\r\nMy question is, is my thinking correct and I need to add a new `StackEntry` type so that its known if the value was 32 or 64 bits?

On linux, I'm free to do anything I want with currently running binary, including moving it. On Windows, at least usually, I'm not able to delete the running binary, but I'm still able to move it, which satisfies my usage.\r\n\r\n### Issue\r\n\r\nI've noticed inconsistency in regards to this when using `PublishSingleFile=true`. Ideally I'd like to keep being able to move the binary away, which I use right now with no further issues.\r\n\r\nIn particular, this is what happens (only on Windows):\r\n\r\n- When you launch a `PublishSingleFile=true` project for the first time, or after you've manually cleaned `%TEMP%\\.net`, the app unpacks itself and you're free to rename/move the binary as you please.\r\n- However, when you launch that project again, with the content already extracted, you're no longer able to do anything with the original binary, including moving/renaming it. The binary now holds exclusive file lock to itself.\r\n\r\nIf anything, I'd expect this behaviour to be consistent, or logically, more restrictive when we unpack for the first time, rather than when re-using existing structure. Instead, it's entirely different, to the point that makes me believe it's something worth reporting or getting more details about.\r\n\r\nOf course, judging by the above, the \"workaround\" for my use case is manually cleaning `%TEMP%\\.net` after each program run, which is a very weird solution, but a working one. I'm not entirely sure why the application would hold exclusive file access when re-using the existing structure but not when unpacking for the first time, which is exactly why I've decided to create this issue.\r\n\r\nIdeally it'd be nice if that lock wasn't needed (so I could keep using my planned use case), but in case you actually have reasoning for it, you'd likely want to keep it up for both cases and not only one that is effectively a subset of operations (run) in another one (unpack and run). In any case, at least in my opinion, it's something worth investigating and deciding whether that exclusive file lock could be released (like when run for the first time), or if it's actually needed in both cases (in which case you might want to add it to first run as well).\r\n\r\nThank you in advance for your time in regards to this isssue.","Url":"https://github.com/dotnet/sdk/issues/4022","RelatedDescription":"Open issue \"Weird binary file lock with PublishSingleFile=true\" (#4022)"}],"ResultType":"GitHubIssue"},"Announcements-Issues":{"Issues":[{"Id":"536031264","IsPullRequest":false,"CreatedAt":"2019-12-10T22:29:30","Actor":"TaraOverfield","Number":"145","RawContent":null,"Title":"December 2019 .NET Updates","State":"open","Body":"The following .NET updates were released on December 2019.

This means some folks will lose their Collaborator badge and the ability to interact with the CI system.*\r\n\r\nOver the years, we’ve added a bunch of folks as collaborators with read permissions to our public repos. The rationale was that we wanted to be able to assign issues to community members because GitHub only allowed assigning issues to users with an explicit permission grant for the repository. However, they changed this in [June 2019](https://github.blog/2019-06-25-assign-issues-to-issue-commenters/). Now, we can assign issues to all users with explicit permissions as well as to users that have commented on the specific issue.\r\n\r\nAlso, we recently started to audit and tighten the permissions for our organizations. As a result, it became clear that large number of repo-specific permission grants are hard to review and audit. Internally, our goal is to grant all permissions via teams instead.\r\n\r\nHence, we plan to remove all collaborators from public repos that only have read permissions (folks with triage permissions will remain). The full list of affected repos is listed below.\r\n\r\nThis shouldn’t impact your ability to work with us, but losing explicit read-only has the following implications:\r\n\r\n-   **You’ll lose the collaborator badge**. We understand that this is visually appealing and for some people it might have been a badge of honor. But given that GitHub also shows a Contributor bade for folks whose PRs got merged, we don’t think it this will be a major take back.    \r\n    ![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/5169960/70491508-43acf580-1ab6-11ea-94df-74ea2dde98b4.png)\r\n\r\n-   ~~**You lose the ability to interact with the CI system**. As a collaborator, you can use comments to [send commands to the CI system](https://github.com/dotnet/runtime/blob/master/docs/project/pullrequest-builds.md). While this can be useful at times, we generally don’t expect (or desire) contributors to do that. Of course, anyone can still access the CI logs.~~\r\n\r\n- **You might lose the ability to interact with the CI system**. Based on your feedback we have decided to give externals access to interact with the CI system *on a case by case basis*.

Our planning has reached a point where we have a schedule for the coreclr, corefx and core-setupmoves into dotnet/runtime that we want to share out with the community.\r\n\r\n### November 13th\r\nWe’ll move all changes from the original repositories into dotnet/runtime up to 5PM PST on November 13th. We’ll try to help as many pull requests as possible get merged by then. At that point, if there’s any pull requests still open we’ll have to close them. If you’d still like to continue those pull requests, we’d encourage you to bring them to dotnet/runtime in a new pull request.\r\n\r\nThe repositories themselves will be effectively archived at this point. The state of the “master” branch will be recorded with a tag, named “master-archive”, but the branch itself will be deleted. The default branch for the repositories will be named “archive” and it will be a single commit with a README.md and CONTRIBUTING.md file pointing to our dotnet/runtime repository.\r\n\r\nThe repositories will remain active for servicing changes to .NET Core 3.1 and earlier hence we will not be using the GitHub archive capability. \r\n\r\n### November 22nd\r\nThe dotnet/runtime repository will be made public and available for community contribution. Even though the repository will be created on November 13th it will take several days to get it back into a working order: fixing up our build scripts, recreating our Azure Dev Ops build definitions, etc … Until those tasks are completed it will not be possible to accept pull request and hence the repository will remain private. Once we are in a state that pull requests can be merged again the repository will be made public.\r\n\r\nOur expectation is that will occur on November 22nd. If it is ready sooner it will be made public sooner. If the work takes longer than we planned then we will add an update to this announcement with a new expected date.\r\n\r\n### December 1st-2nd\r\nAll issues, open and closed, will be migrated from corefx, coreclr and core-setup into dotnet/runtime. This will be using GitHub’s existing issue transfer feature in a bulk migration. This means all of the existing issue links will continue to function via redirects.\r\n\r\nThis does mean though that labels will not transfer with the issues. Labels will be re-applied as a post processing step by our engineering team once the issue migration completes.\r\n\r\nEven though our issues won’t be fully migrated until this time we’d like the community to begin filing issues on dotnet/runtime as soon as it’s public rather than continuing to file issues on the original repositories.\r\n\r\n### Migrating Commits\r\nThe dotnet/runtime repository will be a new commit history from the original repositories. We are using this consolidation as an opportunity to clean up our history with the goal of having a cleaner, smaller history as a starting point. This means commits will be rewritten in the following ways as they are migrated to dotnet/runtime:\r\n\r\n1. Author information, contributor information, changed file list and time stamps from the original commit will be preserved.\r\n1. Links to issues, pull requests or commits in the repository using GitHub short links will be rewritten so they continue to point the original repository. \r\n1.

With [.NET Standard 2.0](https://devblogs.microsoft.com/dotnet/announcing-net-standard-2-0/), we tried to make it much more viable to share code between .NET Framework, .NET Core, and Xamarin which resulted in approximately 38K .NET Frameworks APIs being available in .NET Core 2.0. We also built the [Windows Compatibility Pack](https://devblogs.microsoft.com/dotnet/announcing-the-windows-compatibility-pack-for-net-core/) which made another 21K .NET Framework APIs available to .NET Core, resulting in almost 60K additional APIs. And in .NET Core 3.0 we added WPF and WinForms, which increased the number of .NET Framework APIs ported to .NET Core to over 120k, which is more than half of all .NET Framework APIs.\r\n\r\nIt’s also worth pointing out that we added about 62K APIs to .NET Core that don’t exist in .NET Framework. If we compare their total number of APIs, .NET Core has about 80% of the API surface of .NET Framework.\r\n\r\n<p align=\"center\">\r\n<img src=\"https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/5169960/66777114-f8db7c80-ee7c-11e9-9161-acfe1c491586.png\" width=\"600\" align=\"center\">\r\n</p>\r\n\r\nWe announced that the [future of .NET](https://devblogs.microsoft.com/dotnet/net-core-is-the-future-of-net/) will be based on .NET Core. And at Build 2019, [Scott Hunter stated](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZlO1utbB2GQ&t=54m20s) that AppDomains, remoting, Web Forms, WCF server, and Windows Workflow won’t be ported to .NET Core.\r\n\r\nWith .NET Core 3.0, we’re at the point where we’ve ported all technologies that are required for modern workloads, be that desktop apps, mobile apps, console apps, web sites, or cloud services. That’s not to say that we don’t have any gaps or opportunities for new technologies, but we generally believe we won’t be finding them in the .NET Framework code base anymore. Moving forward, we’re focusing our resources on incorporating new technologies.\r\n\r\nSimultaneously, we’re looking into releasing more of the [.NET Framework code base under the MIT license](https://github.com/microsoft/referencesource) on GitHub to allow the community to create OSS projects for technologies we’re not intending to bring to .NET Core. For example, there already are community projects for [CoreWF](https://github.com/UiPath/corewf) and [CoreWCF](https://github.com/CoreWCF/CoreWCF).\r\n\r\nWe’d like to thank everyone who filed issues with requests for APIs being ported. Those issues allowed us to prioritize and close the gaps that prevented people from porting to .NET Core.\r\n\r\nBut since we generally no longer plan to bring existing technologies from .NET Framework to .NET Core we’ll be closing all issues that are [labeled with port-to-core](https://github.com/dotnet/corefx/issues?utf8=%E2%9C%93&q=is%3Aissue+is%3Aopen+label%3Aport-to-core).\r\n\r\n### Discussion\r\n\r\nTo discuss this issue, please comment on the corresponding issue at https://github.com/dotnet/corefx/issues/41769.","Url":"https://github.com/dotnet/announcements/issues/130","RelatedDescription":"Open issue \".NET Core 3.0 concludes the .NET Framework API porting project\" (#130)"},{"Id":"505445666","IsPullRequest":false,"CreatedAt":"2019-10-10T18:45:56","Actor":"TaraOverfield","Number":"129","RawContent":null,"Title":"October 2019 .NET Updates","State":"open","Body":"The following .NET updates were released on October 2019.

While this is still work in progress, we'd like to give you an update on where we are.\r\n\r\nSo far, we've identified the following repos:\r\n\r\n* dotnet/**runtime**\r\n\t- Will contain [coreclr](https://github.com/dotnet/coreclr), [corefx](https://github.com/dotnet/corefx), [core-setup](https://github.com/dotnet/core-setup), [aspnet/Extensions](https://github.com/aspnet/Extensions), and some of [mono/mono](https://github.com/mono/mono)\r\n* [dotnet/**sdk**](https://github.com/dotnet/sdk)\r\n\t- Will contain [toolset](https://github.com/dotnet/toolset), [sdk](https://github.com/dotnet/sdk), [cli](https://github.com/dotnet/cli)\r\n* dotnet/**installer**\r\n\t- Renamed from [core-sdk](https://github.com/dotnet/core-sdk)\r\n* dotnet/**aspnetcore**\r\n\t- Moved from [aspnet/AspNetCore](https://github.com/aspnet/AspNetCore) and will also contain [aspnet/AspNetCore-Tooling](https://github.com/aspnet/AspNetCore-Tooling)\r\n* dotnet/**efcore**\r\n\t- Moved from [aspnet/EntityFrameworkCore](https://github.com/aspnet/EntityFrameworkCore)\r\n* [dotnet/**winforms**](https://github.com/dotnet/winforms)\r\n\t- Unchanged, but listed for clarity \r\n* [dotnet/**wpf**](https://github.com/dotnet/wpf)\r\n\t- Unchanged, but listed for clarity\r\n\r\n### Name changes\r\n\r\nYou might notice that we changed our mind on naming from our [earlier announcement][ann]. Based on your feedback, we decided to go with **dotnet/runtime** instead of **dotnet/platform** and **dotnet/sdk** instead of **dotnet/cli**.\r\n\r\nSeveral people pointed out that the previous names weren't relatable to how we talk about the product, for example on download pages. So, we decided to match the product distributions as the primary design point for the new names. We generally refer to the bits you need to run your app as *the runtime* and the bits you need to build apps as *the SDK*. This also matches the naming chosen by other platforms.\r\n\r\n### New repos can't be used for .NET Core 3.x or earlier\r\n\r\nThe consolidated repositories are going to be about .NET 5 and going forward. It will not be possible to build .NET Core 3.1 or earlier from these repositories. As such, only the master branch from each of the repositories will be brought forward. There will be no porting of the individual release branches in the source repositories.\r\n\r\n### Personal names and email addresses\r\n\r\nSince we're planning on rebasing the history in the merged repositories, we can map your name and email address to new values as well. We primarily do this to support our friends in the LGBTQ+ community who have changed their names to reflect their identities. However, anybody is welcome to use this to change their email and name.\r\n\r\nWhatever your reason might be: we value your contributions and we hope this small gesture makes your life a little bit better. So if you changed your name/email – or simply prefer us to use different values – please [submit a request](mailto:dotnet@microsoft.com&subject=.NET%20repo%20consolidation%3A%20request%20for%20name%20change&body=Hey%2C%20%0A%0AI%E2%80%99d%20like%20to%20change%20my%20email%2Fdisplay%20name%20in%20the%20consolidated%20repo%20from%20%0A%0A%20%20%20%20%20%20%20%20My%20Old%20Name%20%3Cold.me%40example.org%3E%20%0A%0Ato%20%0A%0A%20%20%20%20%20%20%20%20My%20New%20Name%20%3Cnew.me%40example.org%3E%20%0A%0AThanks%21%20%0A).\r\n\r\n### More is coming\r\n\r\nWe'll share more updates in the upcoming months.

However, this separation has led to a variety of complications for contributors and maintainers alike.  For example:\r\n- **Confusion about where issues should be opened.**  It’s not always clear in which repo an issue should be reported, complicated by the fact that some implementations actually span repositories (e.g. a type might be exposed through a reference assembly and have its tests in corefx but actually be implemented in System.Private.CoreLib in coreclr).\r\n- **Difficulty sharing source.**  System.Private.CoreLib is intricately connected to the rest of the runtime, and thus has lived with the runtime code.  That, however, means that although corefx has been intended as the place to share as much core library code as possible across any underlying runtime, we’ve needed to keep a significant body of code in System.Private.CoreLib, which then has meant it’s needed to be “mirrored” to each runtime repo (coreclr, corert, mono) that needs to consume it as source; similarly, corefx has similarly required access to much of that source, for example to use the same interop DllImports that are employed elsewhere in the runtimes.  The automatic mirror that shares this source needs to be maintained, and even when it has been, it’s often led to lag.  It’s also complicated developer processes, where to validate a change in one repo generally requires manually mirroring the code to other local repos in order to validate the change and ensure merging into one repo won’t break the others.\r\n- **PRs spanning multiple repos.**  Because the runtime, CoreLib, and the core libraries are all intricately linked, changing runtime behaviors, adding new APIs, or changing various build processes (e.g. improving static analysis) often requires multiple PRs carefully staged across time and multiple repos.  For example, to add a new method to a type like Dictionary<>, a developer must first make the source changes in her local coreclr repo and the test and reference assembly changes in her local corefx repo.  When satisfied with the fix, the developer must submit a PR to coreclr as well as a PR to corefx, the latter of which will fail.  Eventually the coreclr PR will be merged, and the changes will mirror to the other runtimes that also require the update.  Eventually those mirror PRs will be merged, and builds will be created containing the fix for each runtime.  At some point later those builds will be consumed into the corefx repo, after which point the original corefx PR can be re-validated and eventually merged.  That’s the best case; things get more complicated in situations where there are bidirectional dependencies.\r\n- **Building an installable runtime.** Self-hosting a custom built .NET requires intricate knowledge of how all the repos work and interact.  A developer can’t just clone a single repo, make a desired change, and easily produce an installer.\r\n- **Consistency.**  One goal we had for more fine-grained repos was to enable isolation and independence for teams working within each repo’s confines, but this has led to non-trivial duplication of effort on things like build systems and CI, and then the resulting lack of consistency as each system ends up diverging from the others.\r\n\r\nThe issues go beyond the runtime.  For example, the ASP.NET maintainers and community did a great job in the past year or so consolidating from ~55 repos down to ~5 repos, but that’s still more repos than is desirable, leading to similar issues as cited above for the runtime.  On top of that, these ASP.NET repositories are in the aspnet GitHub org, which adds an additional set of issues, for example:\r\n- **Complications moving issues between repos.**  If a developer opens an issue in aspnet/aspnetcore and it’s determined that the cause of the issue is actually in dotnet/corefx, there is no GitHub mechanism to enable easily moving that issue across the aspnet to dotnet organizational boundary.\r\n- **Permissions.** Each organization’s permissions end up needing to be managed and maintained separately.\r\n\r\nThe issues extend into tooling as well.  For example, we currently have multiple repositories that all logically make up the dotnet CLI, but actually creating a working installer spans multiple repos.\r\n\r\n### Plan\r\n\r\nTo address these issues, we’re planning to make some changes to our repository structure:\r\n- **dotnet/platform.**  We plan to combine dotnet/coreclr, dotnet/corefx, dotnet/corert, dotnet/core-setup, and the relevant portions of mono/mono into a new dotnet/platform repo.  Everything needed to build and produce the Microsoft.NETCore.App shared framework will be in this repo.  We will no longer suffer from the complications of source mirroring.  Features like changing runtime behavior or adding an API will no longer require a complicated dance across multiple repos.  Etc.\r\n- **dotnet/aspnetcore.**  We plan to move the existing aspnet/aspnetcore repository into the dotnet organization.  Along with that, we aim to combine a variety of the other aspnet repositories into aspnetcore, such as aspnet/blazor.  Whether repos like entityframeworkcore remain separate or combined remains an open question.  A goal is that, just as dotnet/platform will be responsible for the creation of Microsoft.NETCore.App, dotnet/aspnetcore will be responsible for the creation of Microsoft.AspNETCore.App.\r\n- **dotnet/cli.**  We plan to combine dotnet/toolset and dotnet/sdk into the dotnet/cli repo.\r\n\r\n### FAQ\r\n\r\n#### Why are we merging repos?\r\n\r\nWe believe we can significantly improve several aspects of .NET on GitHub by combining repos, benefiting both maintainers and contributors.  These improvements will manifest in a variety of ways, such as in better issue management, much easier models of contribution, and easier and faster ways to build and install the resulting bits.\r\n\r\n####  What will happen to the aspnet org?\r\n\r\nThe aspnet org as a separate entity is legacy and artificial.  In time we hope to absorb it into the dotnet org and sunset the aspnet org.\r\n\r\n#### Will the coreclr and corefx repos go away?\r\n\r\nWith the help of GitHub, we plan to migrate all issues from these repos to the new dotnet/platform repo, and then lock down creation of additional issues, such that the repos will no longer be used for issue management.  We will also inhibit the creation of PRs to the master branch, which will effectively become an archive for read-only review of history.  In this sense, these repos will be archived, and no active development will happen with them.  However, we plan to continue servicing previous .NET Core releases out of these repos, so the various release branches (e.g. release/2.1, release/3.0, etc.) will continue to see (limited) activity.\r\n\r\n#### Will the mono repo go away?\r\n\r\nNo. mono/mono contains the source for the full mono stack and will continue to live on happily.  We will simply be moving the managed source associated with System.Private.CoreLib and copying the relatively small amount of source that makes up the native mono runtime to dotnet/platform.  We may choose to then use some mirroring technology to keep the runtime copy in sync (this will, however, not suffer from the same mirroring issues we currently experience, as we would not be mirroring between two components required to build the same binaries), or we may choose to let them diverge and manually sync only those changes deemed relevant to both implementations.\r\n\r\n#### Will the corert repo go away?\r\n\r\nYes.  We plan to retire/archive the corert repo.  Some of the technology in the corert repo will be migrated to the master branch of dotnet/platform, where it will be productized as part of .NET.  Other portions of the corert repo will be migrated to feature branches of dotnet/platform, where the experimentation can continue.  In this way, we will use feature branches to continue experimenting with the corert technology, while making it easier to share portions with its shipping counterpart and also graduate functionality into master if/when it’s ready.\r\n\r\n#### Does this mean there will be a single repo for all of .NET?\r\n\r\nNo.  We will be reducing the number of repos that contribute to .NET, but currently we do not believe that going all the way down to one is the right answer.\r\n\r\n#### Doesn’t this mean that issue and PR tracking will now be overwhelming?\r\n\r\nIt is already the case that the vast majority of issues in a given repo are not relevant to any individual developer, and with several thousand open issues in each repo and on the order of a hundred open PRs in each, we already need systems (e.g. labels) to successfully manage issues and PRs.  As such, we don’t believe the merging will have a significant impact on this aspect of developer productivity.  If it turns out to have an unexpectedly large negative impact, we will work with the community to find ways to mitigate the problem.  However, there are already a multitude of successful open source projects on GitHub with at least an order of magnitude more issues.\r\n\r\n#### What will happen to existing issues?\r\n\r\nWith the help of GitHub functionality, we plan to migrate all issues from old repos (e.g. dotnet/coreclr, dotnet/corefx) to the new repos (e.g. dotnet/platform).  We may also use this as a forcing function to revisit stale issues and either close those that are no longer relevant or reinvigorate those that are demanding of more immediate attention.\r\n\r\n#### What about git history?\r\n\r\nIn general, we plan to keep history, such that history from each constituent repo will be a part of the new repo.  However, we have made some mistakes in the past (e.g. large binaries, multitudes of automated PRs for flowing bits and source between repos, etc.), and we plan to rewrite history to correct those mistakes wherever possible and impactful.  Some rough calculations suggest this could end up significantly reducing the size of the repos as well as the time it takes to clone, which should not only help developers approaching the project but also CI.  This will end up meaning that SHAs may be different in the new repo than they were in the old repo; as previously mentioned, however, any references to the old SHAs in the old repos will continue to work, as those repos will remain accessible.\r\n\r\n#### Will I still show up in the contributor list due to previous contributions?\r\n\r\nYes.  We plan to merge all such history.\r\n\r\n#### Will this break debugging with SourceLink?\r\n\r\nNo.  The existing repos will continue to be accessible, and commit SHAs there will remain unchanged.\r\n\r\n#### Might plans change?\r\n\r\nSure.  Part of the goal of posting this announcement is to hear from you, hear about additional benefits you're excited about, and hear about additional concerns we may not have considered.  We will include such ideas in our planning and course correct as necessary.\r\n\r\n## Discussion\r\n\r\nTo discuss these plans, please comment on the corresponding issue at https://github.com/dotnet/coreclr/issues/26175.\r\n","Url":"https://github.com/dotnet/announcements/issues/119","RelatedDescription":"Open issue \"Consolidating .NET GitHub repos\" (#119)"},{"Id":"470434872","IsPullRequest":false,"CreatedAt":"2019-07-19T16:54:02","Actor":"richlander","Number":"118","RawContent":null,"Title":".NET Core master branches have switched to \"5.0\"","State":"open","Body":"# .NET Core master branches have switched to \"5.0\"\r\n\r\nVarious .NET Core repos have switched their `master` branches to \"5.0\", and will use 3.x branches for 3.0 and 3.1 projects.

This could prove to be especially problematic for technologies that share type names (e.g. `UserControl` in WinForms and WPF) and both are referenced by the project.\r\n* Optional parameters and `async`/`await` are usability cliffs\r\n    - Many were confused by optional parameters and tried to pass them in, even though they didn't have to.\r\n    - **[Action]** Talk to the Roslyn IDE team to see if we can visualize them better in VS.\r\n    - **[Action]** Try to avoid heavy use of optional parameters for mainline APIs.\r\n    - Async is a very steep cliff. People have no idea what to do in their code to make async work. While IntelliSense shows the usage by prefixing it with await, people didn't notice that.\r\n    - **[Action]** Unclear; this is a broader issue.\r\n* Virtually nobody used F1 to get help for APIs\r\n    - *Surprise*. I expected more people to use <kbd>F1</kbd>.\r\n* Virtually everyone used F12 to explore the API (\"metadata view\")\r\n    - *Surprise*. I expected most people to explore the type via the\r\n      IntelliSense completion\r\n* Nobody used Object Browser to explorer the APIs\r\n    - *Surprise*. I expected at least some people to.\r\n\r\n## Discussion\r\n\r\nFor a discussion, please go to https://github.com/dotnet/corefx/issues/39304.","Url":"https://github.com/dotnet/announcements/issues/117","RelatedDescription":"Open issue \"System.Text.Json usability study results\" (#117)"},{"Id":"465034831","IsPullRequest":false,"CreatedAt":"2019-07-08T03:13:38","Actor":"leecow","Number":"116","RawContent":null,"Title":"Updates to releases.json (.NET Core release metadata)","State":"open","Body":"**The changes described in this issue will be live with the .NET Core July update on 7/9/2019.**\r\n\r\nThe releases.json files (e.g. [2.2 releases.json](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dotnet/core/master/release-notes/2.2/releases.json)) are comprehensive metadata files which capture details of each .NET Core release. These files, along with the top level [releases-index.json](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dotnet/core/master/release-notes/releases-index.json), are becoming increasingly important .NET Core release assets. These files, one for each major.minor channel, are relied upon by many to detect when updates for .NET Core are available, discover security update details and other uses.\r\n\r\nChanges are sometimes necessary, and the growing dependencies require that we treat compatibility of the schema with the utmost care. This announcement describes an addition to the releases.json schema.\r\n\r\n## SDK Versions and Visual Studio\r\n\r\nBecause of current .NET Core SDK product construction dependencies, there is a hard link between the Runtime, SDK, toolset (compilers, MSBuild, NuGet, and other components), and Visual Studio. Simplistically, this means that when anything updates, everything updates. The unfortunate result of this linking is that multiple versions of the SDK are released with each monthly update for each supported versions of Visual Studio. For example, the May Update for .NET Core 2.2 included the 2.2.5 runtime, 2.2.107 SDK for Visual Studio 2017 and 2.2.204 for Visual Studio 2019 and yet another pair of SDK versions for .NET Core 2.1. An example of this is the [2.2.5 Release Notes](https://github.com/dotnet/core/blob/master/release-notes/2.2/2.2.5/2.2.5.md). \r\n\r\nThis is a confusing situation and we are working to mitigate the need to release multiple SDKs with .NET Core 3.0. The need for multiple SDK versions will persist for 2.1 LTS.\r\n\r\n## Adding the SDKS array\r\n\r\nTo appropriately model multiple SDKs per release, we are adding an SDKs array to releases.json, which will contain SDK objects. The top-level SDK object will represent the highest versioned SDK for a given update. Using the previous 2.2.5 update example, SDK 2.2.204 is in the top SDK object as well as duplicated in the SDKS array. All other applicable 2.2* SDK objects are included in the SDKS array. The SDK objects within the array will carry specific Visual Studio compatibility and version inclusion information to provide appropriate context.\r\n\r\nHere is an example of the new array based on the upcoming July update.\r\nAgain, this will be additive and the previous SDK object will include the highest SDK version for the release.\r\n\r\n```json\r\n{\r\n    \"sdk\": {\r\n        \"version\": \"2.2.301\",\r\n        \"version-display\": \"2.2.301\",\r\n        \"runtime-version\": \"2.2.6\",\r\n        \"vs-version\": \"16.1.3\",\r\n        \"vs-support\": \"Visual Studio 2019 (v16.1)\",\r\n        \"csharp-version\": \"7.3\",\r\n        \"fsharp-version\": \"4.5\",\r\n        \"vb-version\": null,\r\n        \"files\": []\r\n    },\r\n    \"sdks\": [\r\n        {\r\n            \"version\": \"2.2.301\",\r\n            \"version-display\": \"2.2.301\",\r\n            \"runtime-version\": \"2.2.6\",\r\n            \"vs-version\": \"16.1.3\",\r\n            \"vs-support\": \"Visual Studio 2019 (v16.1)\",\r\n            \"csharp-version\": \"7.3\",\r\n            \"fsharp-version\": \"4.5\",\r\n            \"vb-version\": null,\r\n            \"files\": []\r\n        },\r\n        {\r\n          \"version\": \"2.2.205\",\r\n          \"version-display\": \"2.2.205\",\r\n          \"runtime-version\": \"2.2.6\",\r\n          \"vs-version\": \"16.0.5\",\r\n          \"vs-support\": \"Visual Studio 2019 (v16.0)\",\r\n          \"csharp-version\": \"7.3\",\r\n          \"fsharp-version\": \"4.5\",\r\n          \"vb-version\": null,\r\n          \"files\": []\r\n        }\r\n    ]\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\n## vs-version and the Runtime\r\n\r\nThe same version of the runtime is included in multiple versions of Visual Studio. To account for this, the vs-version field is being updated to a comma-delimited string. The string will represent all versions of Visual Studio which first include the particular .NET Core update. Again, an example from the upcoming July Update.\r\n\r\n```json\r\n\"runtime\": {\r\n        \"version\": \"2.2.6\",\r\n        \"version-display\": \"2.2.6\",\r\n        \"vs-version\": \"15.9.13, 16.1.3, 16.2.0\",\r\n```\r\n\r\nThe same `vs-versions` changes will be seen in the `aspnetcore-runtime` object.\r\n\r\n## Future Enhancements\r\n\r\nThere are other improvements to the schema which have been suggested by the community which we are evaluating. Generally, theses enhancements are additive and should not represent compatibility compromises for existing parsers and similar announcements will be published ahead of any changes.\r\n\r\n","Url":"https://github.com/dotnet/announcements/issues/116","RelatedDescription":"Open issue \"Updates to releases.json (.NET Core release metadata)\" (#116)"}],"ResultType":"GitHubIssue"},"Twitter":{"ResultType":"TwitterTimeline","Tweets":[{"Id":"1205234626337394689","CreatedAt":"2019-12-12T21:15:01+00:00","UserScreenname":"dotnet","Text":"...oh, cool.
