Our planning has reached a point where we have a schedule for the coreclr, corefx and core-setupmoves into dotnet/runtime that we want to share out with the community.\r\n\r\n### November 13th\r\nWe’ll move all changes from the original repositories into dotnet/runtime up to 5PM PST on November 13th. We’ll try to help as many pull requests as possible get merged by then. At that point, if there’s any pull requests still open we’ll have to close them. If you’d still like to continue those pull requests, we’d encourage you to bring them to dotnet/runtime in a new pull request.\r\n\r\nThe repositories themselves will be effectively archived at this point. The state of the “master” branch will be recorded with a tag, named “master-archive”, but the branch itself will be deleted. The default branch for the repositories will be named “archive” and it will be a single commit with a README.md and CONTRIBUTING.md file pointing to our dotnet/runtime repository.\r\n\r\nThe repositories will remain active for servicing changes to .NET Core 3.1 and earlier hence we will not be using the GitHub archive capability. \r\n\r\n### November 22nd\r\nThe dotnet/runtime repository will be made public and available for community contribution. Even though the repository will be created on November 13th it will take several days to get it back into a working order: fixing up our build scripts, recreating our Azure Dev Ops build definitions, etc … Until those tasks are completed it will not be possible to accept pull request and hence the repository will remain private. Once we are in a state that pull requests can be merged again the repository will be made public.\r\n\r\nOur expectation is that will occur on November 22nd. If it is ready sooner it will be made public sooner. If the work takes longer than we planned then we will add an update to this announcement with a new expected date.\r\n\r\n### December 1st-2nd\r\nAll issues, open and closed, will be migrated from corefx, coreclr and core-setup into dotnet/runtime. This will be using GitHub’s existing issue transfer feature in a bulk migration. This means all of the existing issue links will continue to function via redirects.\r\n\r\nThis does mean though that labels will not transfer with the issues. Labels will be re-applied as a post processing step by our engineering team once the issue migration completes.\r\n\r\nEven though our issues won’t be fully migrated until this time we’d like the community to begin filing issues on dotnet/runtime as soon as it’s public rather than continuing to file issues on the original repositories.\r\n\r\n### Migrating Commits\r\nThe dotnet/runtime repository will be a new commit history from the original repositories. We are using this consolidation as an opportunity to clean up our history with the goal of having a cleaner, smaller history as a starting point. This means commits will be rewritten in the following ways as they are migrated to dotnet/runtime:\r\n\r\n1. Author information, contributor information, changed file list and time stamps from the original commit will be preserved.\r\n1. Links to issues, pull requests or commits in the repository using GitHub short links will be rewritten so they continue to point the original repository. \r\n1. Every commit will be appended with a link to the original commit it was mapped from.\r\n\r\nThe actual contents of the commit though will be updated to match the new directory layout of the dotnet/runtime repository."},{"Id":"10738283611","Type":"IssuesEvent","CreatedAt":"2019-10-29T14:32:57","Actor":"mthalman","Repository":"dotnet/announcements","Organization":"dotnet","RawContent":null,"RelatedAction":"opened","RelatedUrl":"https://github.com/dotnet/announcements/issues/132","RelatedDescription":"Opened issue \"Release of Alpine 3.10 Docker images\" (#132) at dotnet/announcements","RelatedBody":"# .NET Core Alpine Docker images updated to Alpine 3.10\r\n\r\nDocker images for .NET Core have been released that support Alpine 3.10.

Since ```ReadOnlyCollection<T>``` exposes indexer, its naming should be ```ReadOnlyList<T>``` to stuck with current approach.\r\n2. Implementing ```ICollection<T>```, ```IList<T>```, ```IList``` is also debatable. Since .NET Core is brand new, one could have been observing more changes to collection designs:\r\n    • Saying that ```ReadOnlyCollection<T>``` is implementing these is as well designed as design ```IReadOnlyList<T>``` in manner where public indexer ```public T this[int index] { get; }``` will have setter part supposed to throwing NotImplementedException.\r\n    • Proper way is to redesign read-only interfaces in a way that they are providing non-altering methods like ```Contains(T)```, ```IndexOf(T)``` and remove these methods from their alter-also counterparts. So for instance ```ICollection<T>.Contains(T)``` should be sited to ```IReadOnlyCollection<T>```. Alike ```IList<T>.IndexOf<T>``` should be in ```IReadOnlyList<T>```. Then altering interface should implement read-only interface in natural logic way of inheritance design.\r\n\r\nThen there can be ```ReadOnlyList<T>``` not implementing many methods that throws exception. 👍"},{"Id":"10936441591","Type":"IssuesEvent","CreatedAt":"2019-11-25T00:56:51","Actor":"Spaceman1861","Repository":"dotnet/corefx","Organization":"dotnet","RawContent":null,"RelatedAction":"opened","RelatedUrl":"https://github.com/dotnet/corefx/issues/42701","RelatedDescription":"Opened issue \"System.Net.Security.SslStream breaks after upgrade 2.1 -> 3.0 (Linux only)\" (#42701) at dotnet/corefx","RelatedBody":"Hi all!\r\n\r\nFirst up, not sure if this the correct repo let me know if needs moving.\r\n\r\nThis has been discussed here(https://github.com/jstedfast/MailKit/issues/951) as well and determined that it was probably a dotnet issue.\r\n\r\nWe are hitting an issue with MailKit connecting to certain IMAP servers post upgrade to 3.0 only on the base 3.0 linux distro (debian 10).

Take the following method:\r\n\r\n```c#\r\n[MethodImpl(MethodImplOptions.AggressiveInlining)]\r\npublic static bool HasFlag(T value, T flag) where T : struct, Enum\r\n{\t\t\t\r\n    int size = Unsafe.SizeOf<T>();\r\n\r\n    if (size == 1)\r\n        return (Unsafe.As<T, byte>(ref value) | Unsafe.As<T, byte>(ref flag)) == Unsafe.As<T, byte>(ref value);\r\n    else if (size == 2)\r\n        return (Unsafe.As<T, short>(ref value) | Unsafe.As<T, short>(ref flag)) == Unsafe.As<T, short>(ref value);\r\n    else if (size == 4)\r\n        return (Unsafe.As<T, int>(ref value) | Unsafe.As<T, int>(ref flag)) == Unsafe.As<T, int>(ref value);\r\n    else // size == 8\r\n        return (Unsafe.As<T, long>(ref value) | Unsafe.As<T, long>(ref flag)) == Unsafe.As<T, long>(ref value);\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nWith the branch elimination it is doing it should be able to produce the optimal ASM, i.e.:\r\n\r\n```\r\n    L0000: or edx, ecx\r\n    L0002: cmp edx, ecx\r\n    L0004: setz al\r\n    L0007: movzx eax, al\r\n    L000a: ret\r\n```\r\n\r\nIt gets somewhat close but produces this instead (for size 4 types):\r\n\r\n```\r\n    L0000: mov [rsp+0x8], ecx\r\n    L0004: mov [rsp+0x10], edx\r\n    L0008: mov eax, [rsp+0x8]\r\n    L000c: mov edx, [rsp+0x10]\r\n    L0010: or edx, eax\r\n    L0012: cmp edx, eax\r\n    L0014: setz al\r\n    L0017: movzx eax, al\r\n    L001a: ret\r\n```\r\n\r\nWhich runs about half as fast and uses 16 additional bytes (26 instead of just 10). I'm not sure exactly what is going on here but I believe it has to do with the way the stack is used when there are multiple branches that use locals causing some optimizations not to be done because this produces the optimal ASM:\r\n\r\n```c#\r\npublic static bool HasFlag(T value, T flag) where T : struct, Enum\r\n{\t\t\t\r\n    int size = Unsafe.SizeOf<T>();\r\n\r\n    if (size == 4)\r\n        return (Unsafe.As<T, int>(ref value) | Unsafe.As<T, int>(ref flag)) == Unsafe.As<T, int>(ref value);\r\n    \r\n    throw new NotSupportedException();    \r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nI imagine that improving this could reduce JITted code size and bump performance in many cases. One of the concerns about adding generic enum methods is the JIT bloat it will produce and this could potentially help with that given that most of the methods would be simple bitwise operations like the one above.","Url":"https://github.com/dotnet/coreclr/issues/27917","RelatedDescription":"Open issue \"JIT Optimization (Stack Usage?)\" (#27917)"},{"Id":"526812011","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2019-11-21T20:06:22","Actor":"dotnet-maestro-bot","Number":"27916","RawContent":null,"Title":"[automated] Merge branch 'release/2.1' => 'release/2.2'","State":"closed","Body":"I detected changes in the release/2.1 branch which have not been merged yet to release/2.2.

When `write()` is done, data will be written even if .NET process crashes as OS will close all handles and flush all buffers. \r\nTo make this worse, the `fsync` is currently done under lock and that can significanly increase critical section. \r\n\r\nThere seems to be other issues with this code. We only check for negative value returned from `write`. However `write` can write less then asked for and return written bytes. We would miss such case and we could write corrupted entries unnoticed. \r\n\r\nSince we write fixed number records we should be able to to have iovec on stack and use single `writev()` That would limit context switches to kernel and it would make this less impactful to traced code. \r\n\r\ncc @sdmaclea @janvorli @noahfalk @jkotas ","Url":"https://github.com/dotnet/coreclr/issues/27912","RelatedDescription":"Open issue \"unnecessary fsync in perf tracing code\" (#27912)"},{"Id":"526336720","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2019-11-21T17:31:02","Actor":"jashook","Number":"27906","RawContent":null,"Title":"Move off of the old arm32 queue","State":"closed","Body":"Port #27905 to release/3.1\r\n\r\n/cc @hoyosjs @lpereira @trylek @ilyas1974 ","Url":"https://github.com/dotnet/coreclr/pull/27906","RelatedDescription":"Closed or merged PR \"Move off of the old arm32 queue\" (#27906)"},{"Id":"526728194","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2019-11-21T17:08:44","Actor":"dotnet-maestro[bot]","Number":"27911","RawContent":null,"Title":"[release/3.0] Update dependencies from dotnet/corefx","State":"open","Body":"This pull request updates the following dependencies\r\n\r\n[marker]: <> (Begin:d7eb9992-d759-446e-f8f0-08d6910be5f1)\r\n## From https://github.com/dotnet/corefx\r\n- **Build**: 20191016.9\r\n- **Date Produced**: 10/16/2019 10:28 PM\r\n- **Commit**: c1778515a3bee34cc09c757b5563d0af0c8b1e99\r\n- **Branch**: refs/heads/release/3.0\r\n- **Updates**:\r\n  - **Microsoft.Private.CoreFx.NETCoreApp** -> 4.6.0-servicing.19516.9\r\n\r\n[marker]: <> (End:d7eb9992-d759-446e-f8f0-08d6910be5f1)\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n","Url":"https://github.com/dotnet/coreclr/pull/27911","RelatedDescription":"Open PR \"[release/3.0] Update dependencies from dotnet/corefx\" (#27911)"},{"Id":"526622122","IsPullRequest":false,"CreatedAt":"2019-11-21T14:15:53","Actor":"Const-me","Number":"27909","RawContent":null,"Title":"The new SIMD support could use some improvements","State":"open","Body":"Here's the source code of a function which computes brightness of RGBA images.

When looking at the disassembly in VS2019 debugger, I noticed 2 things.\r\n\r\n1. You don’t propagate invariants. There’re many magic numbers involved. Instead of caching values in a register, the generated code creates them on demand inside the loop, with instructions like this:\r\n```\r\nmov         r8d,0FF00h\r\nvmovd       xmm5,r8d\r\nvpbroadcastd xmm5,xmm5\r\n```\r\nThe code only uses first 6 out of 16 available vector registers.

Since .NET Core is brand new, one could have been observing more changes to collection designs:\r\n    • Saying that ```ReadOnlyCollection<T>``` is implementing these is as well designed as design ```IReadOnlyList<T>``` in manner where public indexer ```public T this[int index] { get; }``` will have setter part supposed to throwing NotImplementedException.\r\n    • Proper way is to redesign read-only interfaces in a way that they are providing non-altering methods like ```Contains(T)```, ```IndexOf(T)``` and remove these methods from their alter-also counterparts. So for instance ```ICollection<T>.Contains(T)``` should be sited to ```IReadOnlyCollection<T>```. Alike ```IList<T>.IndexOf<T>``` should be in ```IReadOnlyList<T>```.

Please describe.\r\n\r\nThere are some very useful extension methods for the `System.Net.Http.HttpClient` found in `Microsoft.AspNetCore.Components.HttpClientJsonExtensions`. These are used extensively in Blazor apps but are also useful in Console and Windows Forms apps, in fact, any app that interacts with a remote server.\r\n\r\nHowever, with a small change, they could be more useful. They're a bit of a mysterious black-box at the moment. If you don't can't serialize the response from the server into the JSON type T passed as a parameter, it's hard for a client to know what went wrong. It would be much nicer if I could pass an optional delegate (or `Func`, or `Action`) to these methods to say what I'd like to do with the response if it can't be serialized to type `T`. If that delegate could take, as a parameter, the entire `HttpResponseMessage` object, it would have everything it needed to process the unexpected response gracefully.\r\n\r\n### Describe the solution you'd like\r\n\r\nI think that this, below, or something like it, would work nicely and not break anything.\r\nAmend the class in the file `AspNetCore/src/Components/Components/src/HttpClientJsonExtensions.cs` to read:\r\n\r\n```\r\npublic static class HttpClientJsonExtensions\r\n    {\r\n        /// <summary>\r\n        /// Sends a GET request to the specified URI, and parses the JSON response body\r\n        /// to create an object of the generic type.\r\n        /// </summary>\r\n        /// <typeparam name=\"T\">A type into which the response body can be JSON-deserialized.</typeparam>\r\n        /// <param name=\"httpClient\">The <see cref=\"HttpClient\"/>.</param>\r\n        /// <param name=\"requestUri\">The URI that the request will be sent to.</param>\r\n        /// <param name=\"actionOnFailure\">An action to be executed if the response from the server cannot be\r\n        /// serialized into the expected type <typeparamref name=\"T\"/></param>\r\n        /// <returns>The response parsed as an object of the generic type.</returns>\r\n        public static async Task<T> GetJsonAsync<T>(this HttpClient httpClient, string requestUri, Action<string> actionOnFailure = null)\r\n        {\r\n            var stringContent = await httpClient.GetStringAsync(requestUri);\r\n            T result = default;\r\n\r\n            try\r\n            {\r\n                result = JsonSerializer.Deserialize<T>(stringContent, JsonSerializerOptionsProvider.Options);\r\n            }\r\n            catch\r\n            {\r\n                if (actionOnFailure != null)\r\n                {\r\n                    actionOnFailure.Invoke(stringContent);\r\n                }\r\n            }\r\n\r\n            return result;\r\n        }\r\n\r\n        /// <summary>\r\n        /// Sends a POST request to the specified URI, including the specified <paramref name=\"content\"/>\r\n        /// in JSON-encoded format, and parses the JSON response body to create an object of the generic type.\r\n        /// </summary>\r\n        /// <param name=\"httpClient\">The <see cref=\"HttpClient\"/>.</param>\r\n        /// <param name=\"requestUri\">The URI that the request will be sent to.</param>\r\n        /// <param name=\"content\">Content for the request body.

This is problematic because it forces users of other platforms than Windows to install mono in order to run nuget.exe. It works okay, but the nuget cli, being designed for windows, feels alien and and has a cumbersome and error prone install process.\r\n\r\nAnother consequence of this is that we have to jump through hoops when restoring private packages in CI environments - either starting out with a mono-enabled environment and copying over packages to the final build, or editing the nuget.config file by inserting config in a build step in order to use the dotnet cli.\r\n\r\nAll of this makes developing and running dotnet core in non-windows environments a second-class experience. There is more to it than managing private sources, but this is the use case that seems to be the most common and something that users trying to adopt dotnet-core in a lot of corporate environments will battle with early on.\r\n\r\nAre there any plans for adopting the feature of nuget.exe in dotnet cli?","Url":"https://github.com/dotnet/sdk/issues/3941","RelatedDescription":"Open issue \"Manage sources with dotnet cli\" (#3941)"},{"Id":"525744307","IsPullRequest":false,"CreatedAt":"2019-11-20T11:28:29","Actor":"artecoop","Number":"3938","RawContent":null,"Title":"The specified framework 'Microsoft.AspNetCore.App', version '2.2.0' was not found.","State":"open","Body":"On my fresh install of Fedora 30, I installed donet-sdk 2.2 (I need to stick with this version right now) as per \r\nhttps://dotnet.microsoft.com/download/linux-package-manager/sdk-2.2.207\r\n\r\nthen verified with donet --info\r\n```\r\n.NET Core SDK (reflecting any global.json):\r\n Version:   2.2.402\r\n Commit:    c7f2f96116\r\n\r\nRuntime Environment:\r\n OS Name:     fedora\r\n OS Version:  30\r\n OS Platform: Linux\r\n RID:         fedora.30-x64\r\n Base Path:   /usr/share/dotnet/sdk/2.2.402/\r\n\r\nHost (useful for support):\r\n  Version: 2.2.8\r\n  Commit:  b9aa1abc51\r\n\r\n.NET Core SDKs installed:\r\n  2.2.402 [/usr/share/dotnet/sdk]\r\n\r\n.NET Core runtimes installed:\r\n  Microsoft.NETCore.App 2.2.8 [/usr/share/dotnet/shared/Microsoft.NETCore.App]\r\n\r\nTo install additional .NET Core runtimes or SDKs:\r\n  https://aka.ms/dotnet-download\r\n```\r\n\r\nNow I'm creating a simple app\r\n```\r\nmkidr foo-2.2\r\ncd foo-2.2\r\ndotnet new web\r\nThe template \"ASP.NET Core Empty\" was created successfully.\r\n\r\nProcessing post-creation actions...\r\nRunning 'dotnet restore' on /folder/foo-2.2/foo-2.2.csproj...\r\n  Restore completed in 1.08 sec for  /folder/foo-2.2/foo-2.2.csproj.\r\n\r\nRestore succeeded.\r\n```\r\n\r\nPerfect.

The default branch for the repositories will be named “archive” and it will be a single commit with a README.md and CONTRIBUTING.md file pointing to our dotnet/runtime repository.\r\n\r\nThe repositories will remain active for servicing changes to .NET Core 3.1 and earlier hence we will not be using the GitHub archive capability. \r\n\r\n### November 22nd\r\nThe dotnet/runtime repository will be made public and available for community contribution. Even though the repository will be created on November 13th it will take several days to get it back into a working order: fixing up our build scripts, recreating our Azure Dev Ops build definitions, etc … Until those tasks are completed it will not be possible to accept pull request and hence the repository will remain private. Once we are in a state that pull requests can be merged again the repository will be made public.\r\n\r\nOur expectation is that will occur on November 22nd. If it is ready sooner it will be made public sooner. If the work takes longer than we planned then we will add an update to this announcement with a new expected date.\r\n\r\n### December 1st-2nd\r\nAll issues, open and closed, will be migrated from corefx, coreclr and core-setup into dotnet/runtime. This will be using GitHub’s existing issue transfer feature in a bulk migration. This means all of the existing issue links will continue to function via redirects.\r\n\r\nThis does mean though that labels will not transfer with the issues. Labels will be re-applied as a post processing step by our engineering team once the issue migration completes.\r\n\r\nEven though our issues won’t be fully migrated until this time we’d like the community to begin filing issues on dotnet/runtime as soon as it’s public rather than continuing to file issues on the original repositories.\r\n\r\n### Migrating Commits\r\nThe dotnet/runtime repository will be a new commit history from the original repositories. We are using this consolidation as an opportunity to clean up our history with the goal of having a cleaner, smaller history as a starting point. This means commits will be rewritten in the following ways as they are migrated to dotnet/runtime:\r\n\r\n1. Author information, contributor information, changed file list and time stamps from the original commit will be preserved.\r\n1. Links to issues, pull requests or commits in the repository using GitHub short links will be rewritten so they continue to point the original repository. \r\n1. Every commit will be appended with a link to the original commit it was mapped from.\r\n\r\nThe actual contents of the commit though will be updated to match the new directory layout of the dotnet/runtime repository.","Url":"https://github.com/dotnet/announcements/issues/133","RelatedDescription":"Open issue \"Repository Consolidation Timeline\" (#133)"},{"Id":"513963125","IsPullRequest":false,"CreatedAt":"2019-10-29T14:32:55","Actor":"mthalman","Number":"132","RawContent":null,"Title":"Release of Alpine 3.10 Docker images","State":"open","Body":"# .NET Core Alpine Docker images updated to Alpine 3.10\r\n\r\nDocker images for .NET Core have been released that support Alpine 3.10.

With [.NET Standard 2.0](https://devblogs.microsoft.com/dotnet/announcing-net-standard-2-0/), we tried to make it much more viable to share code between .NET Framework, .NET Core, and Xamarin which resulted in approximately 38K .NET Frameworks APIs being available in .NET Core 2.0. We also built the [Windows Compatibility Pack](https://devblogs.microsoft.com/dotnet/announcing-the-windows-compatibility-pack-for-net-core/) which made another 21K .NET Framework APIs available to .NET Core, resulting in almost 60K additional APIs. And in .NET Core 3.0 we added WPF and WinForms, which increased the number of .NET Framework APIs ported to .NET Core to over 120k, which is more than half of all .NET Framework APIs.\r\n\r\nIt’s also worth pointing out that we added about 62K APIs to .NET Core that don’t exist in .NET Framework. If we compare their total number of APIs, .NET Core has about 80% of the API surface of .NET Framework.\r\n\r\n<p align=\"center\">\r\n<img src=\"https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/5169960/66777114-f8db7c80-ee7c-11e9-9161-acfe1c491586.png\" width=\"600\" align=\"center\">\r\n</p>\r\n\r\nWe announced that the [future of .NET](https://devblogs.microsoft.com/dotnet/net-core-is-the-future-of-net/) will be based on .NET Core. And at Build 2019, [Scott Hunter stated](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZlO1utbB2GQ&t=54m20s) that AppDomains, remoting, Web Forms, WCF server, and Windows Workflow won’t be ported to .NET Core.\r\n\r\nWith .NET Core 3.0, we’re at the point where we’ve ported all technologies that are required for modern workloads, be that desktop apps, mobile apps, console apps, web sites, or cloud services. That’s not to say that we don’t have any gaps or opportunities for new technologies, but we generally believe we won’t be finding them in the .NET Framework code base anymore. Moving forward, we’re focusing our resources on incorporating new technologies.\r\n\r\nSimultaneously, we’re looking into releasing more of the [.NET Framework code base under the MIT license](https://github.com/microsoft/referencesource) on GitHub to allow the community to create OSS projects for technologies we’re not intending to bring to .NET Core. For example, there already are community projects for [CoreWF](https://github.com/UiPath/corewf) and [CoreWCF](https://github.com/CoreWCF/CoreWCF).\r\n\r\nWe’d like to thank everyone who filed issues with requests for APIs being ported. Those issues allowed us to prioritize and close the gaps that prevented people from porting to .NET Core.\r\n\r\nBut since we generally no longer plan to bring existing technologies from .NET Framework to .NET Core we’ll be closing all issues that are [labeled with port-to-core](https://github.com/dotnet/corefx/issues?utf8=%E2%9C%93&q=is%3Aissue+is%3Aopen+label%3Aport-to-core).\r\n\r\n### Discussion\r\n\r\nTo discuss this issue, please comment on the corresponding issue at https://github.com/dotnet/corefx/issues/41769.","Url":"https://github.com/dotnet/announcements/issues/130","RelatedDescription":"Open issue \".NET Core 3.0 concludes the .NET Framework API porting project\" (#130)"},{"Id":"505445666","IsPullRequest":false,"CreatedAt":"2019-10-10T18:45:56","Actor":"TaraOverfield","Number":"129","RawContent":null,"Title":"October 2019 .NET Updates","State":"open","Body":"The following .NET updates were released on October 2019.

While this is still work in progress, we'd like to give you an update on where we are.\r\n\r\nSo far, we've identified the following repos:\r\n\r\n* dotnet/**runtime**\r\n\t- Will contain [coreclr](https://github.com/dotnet/coreclr), [corefx](https://github.com/dotnet/corefx), [core-setup](https://github.com/dotnet/core-setup), [aspnet/Extensions](https://github.com/aspnet/Extensions), and some of [mono/mono](https://github.com/mono/mono)\r\n* [dotnet/**sdk**](https://github.com/dotnet/sdk)\r\n\t- Will contain [toolset](https://github.com/dotnet/toolset), [sdk](https://github.com/dotnet/sdk), [cli](https://github.com/dotnet/cli)\r\n* dotnet/**installer**\r\n\t- Renamed from [core-sdk](https://github.com/dotnet/core-sdk)\r\n* dotnet/**aspnetcore**\r\n\t- Moved from [aspnet/AspNetCore](https://github.com/aspnet/AspNetCore) and will also contain [aspnet/AspNetCore-Tooling](https://github.com/aspnet/AspNetCore-Tooling)\r\n* dotnet/**efcore**\r\n\t- Moved from [aspnet/EntityFrameworkCore](https://github.com/aspnet/EntityFrameworkCore)\r\n* [dotnet/**winforms**](https://github.com/dotnet/winforms)\r\n\t- Unchanged, but listed for clarity \r\n* [dotnet/**wpf**](https://github.com/dotnet/wpf)\r\n\t- Unchanged, but listed for clarity\r\n\r\n### Name changes\r\n\r\nYou might notice that we changed our mind on naming from our [earlier announcement][ann]. Based on your feedback, we decided to go with **dotnet/runtime** instead of **dotnet/platform** and **dotnet/sdk** instead of **dotnet/cli**.\r\n\r\nSeveral people pointed out that the previous names weren't relatable to how we talk about the product, for example on download pages. So, we decided to match the product distributions as the primary design point for the new names. We generally refer to the bits you need to run your app as *the runtime* and the bits you need to build apps as *the SDK*. This also matches the naming chosen by other platforms.\r\n\r\n### New repos can't be used for .NET Core 3.x or earlier\r\n\r\nThe consolidated repositories are going to be about .NET 5 and going forward. It will not be possible to build .NET Core 3.1 or earlier from these repositories. As such, only the master branch from each of the repositories will be brought forward. There will be no porting of the individual release branches in the source repositories.\r\n\r\n### Personal names and email addresses\r\n\r\nSince we're planning on rebasing the history in the merged repositories, we can map your name and email address to new values as well. We primarily do this to support our friends in the LGBTQ+ community who have changed their names to reflect their identities. However, anybody is welcome to use this to change their email and name.\r\n\r\nWhatever your reason might be: we value your contributions and we hope this small gesture makes your life a little bit better. So if you changed your name/email – or simply prefer us to use different values – please [submit a request](mailto:dotnet@microsoft.com&subject=.NET%20repo%20consolidation%3A%20request%20for%20name%20change&body=Hey%2C%20%0A%0AI%E2%80%99d%20like%20to%20change%20my%20email%2Fdisplay%20name%20in%20the%20consolidated%20repo%20from%20%0A%0A%20%20%20%20%20%20%20%20My%20Old%20Name%20%3Cold.me%40example.org%3E%20%0A%0Ato%20%0A%0A%20%20%20%20%20%20%20%20My%20New%20Name%20%3Cnew.me%40example.org%3E%20%0A%0AThanks%21%20%0A).\r\n\r\n### More is coming\r\n\r\nWe'll share more updates in the upcoming months.

However, this separation has led to a variety of complications for contributors and maintainers alike.  For example:\r\n- **Confusion about where issues should be opened.**  It’s not always clear in which repo an issue should be reported, complicated by the fact that some implementations actually span repositories (e.g. a type might be exposed through a reference assembly and have its tests in corefx but actually be implemented in System.Private.CoreLib in coreclr).\r\n- **Difficulty sharing source.**  System.Private.CoreLib is intricately connected to the rest of the runtime, and thus has lived with the runtime code.  That, however, means that although corefx has been intended as the place to share as much core library code as possible across any underlying runtime, we’ve needed to keep a significant body of code in System.Private.CoreLib, which then has meant it’s needed to be “mirrored” to each runtime repo (coreclr, corert, mono) that needs to consume it as source; similarly, corefx has similarly required access to much of that source, for example to use the same interop DllImports that are employed elsewhere in the runtimes.  The automatic mirror that shares this source needs to be maintained, and even when it has been, it’s often led to lag.  It’s also complicated developer processes, where to validate a change in one repo generally requires manually mirroring the code to other local repos in order to validate the change and ensure merging into one repo won’t break the others.\r\n- **PRs spanning multiple repos.**  Because the runtime, CoreLib, and the core libraries are all intricately linked, changing runtime behaviors, adding new APIs, or changing various build processes (e.g. improving static analysis) often requires multiple PRs carefully staged across time and multiple repos.  For example, to add a new method to a type like Dictionary<>, a developer must first make the source changes in her local coreclr repo and the test and reference assembly changes in her local corefx repo.  When satisfied with the fix, the developer must submit a PR to coreclr as well as a PR to corefx, the latter of which will fail.  Eventually the coreclr PR will be merged, and the changes will mirror to the other runtimes that also require the update.  Eventually those mirror PRs will be merged, and builds will be created containing the fix for each runtime.  At some point later those builds will be consumed into the corefx repo, after which point the original corefx PR can be re-validated and eventually merged.  That’s the best case; things get more complicated in situations where there are bidirectional dependencies.\r\n- **Building an installable runtime.** Self-hosting a custom built .NET requires intricate knowledge of how all the repos work and interact.  A developer can’t just clone a single repo, make a desired change, and easily produce an installer.\r\n- **Consistency.**  One goal we had for more fine-grained repos was to enable isolation and independence for teams working within each repo’s confines, but this has led to non-trivial duplication of effort on things like build systems and CI, and then the resulting lack of consistency as each system ends up diverging from the others.\r\n\r\nThe issues go beyond the runtime.  For example, the ASP.NET maintainers and community did a great job in the past year or so consolidating from ~55 repos down to ~5 repos, but that’s still more repos than is desirable, leading to similar issues as cited above for the runtime.  On top of that, these ASP.NET repositories are in the aspnet GitHub org, which adds an additional set of issues, for example:\r\n- **Complications moving issues between repos.**  If a developer opens an issue in aspnet/aspnetcore and it’s determined that the cause of the issue is actually in dotnet/corefx, there is no GitHub mechanism to enable easily moving that issue across the aspnet to dotnet organizational boundary.\r\n- **Permissions.** Each organization’s permissions end up needing to be managed and maintained separately.\r\n\r\nThe issues extend into tooling as well.  For example, we currently have multiple repositories that all logically make up the dotnet CLI, but actually creating a working installer spans multiple repos.\r\n\r\n### Plan\r\n\r\nTo address these issues, we’re planning to make some changes to our repository structure:\r\n- **dotnet/platform.**  We plan to combine dotnet/coreclr, dotnet/corefx, dotnet/corert, dotnet/core-setup, and the relevant portions of mono/mono into a new dotnet/platform repo.  Everything needed to build and produce the Microsoft.NETCore.App shared framework will be in this repo.  We will no longer suffer from the complications of source mirroring.  Features like changing runtime behavior or adding an API will no longer require a complicated dance across multiple repos.  Etc.\r\n- **dotnet/aspnetcore.**  We plan to move the existing aspnet/aspnetcore repository into the dotnet organization.  Along with that, we aim to combine a variety of the other aspnet repositories into aspnetcore, such as aspnet/blazor.  Whether repos like entityframeworkcore remain separate or combined remains an open question.  A goal is that, just as dotnet/platform will be responsible for the creation of Microsoft.NETCore.App, dotnet/aspnetcore will be responsible for the creation of Microsoft.AspNETCore.App.\r\n- **dotnet/cli.**  We plan to combine dotnet/toolset and dotnet/sdk into the dotnet/cli repo.\r\n\r\n### FAQ\r\n\r\n#### Why are we merging repos?\r\n\r\nWe believe we can significantly improve several aspects of .NET on GitHub by combining repos, benefiting both maintainers and contributors.  These improvements will manifest in a variety of ways, such as in better issue management, much easier models of contribution, and easier and faster ways to build and install the resulting bits.\r\n\r\n####  What will happen to the aspnet org?\r\n\r\nThe aspnet org as a separate entity is legacy and artificial.  In time we hope to absorb it into the dotnet org and sunset the aspnet org.\r\n\r\n#### Will the coreclr and corefx repos go away?\r\n\r\nWith the help of GitHub, we plan to migrate all issues from these repos to the new dotnet/platform repo, and then lock down creation of additional issues, such that the repos will no longer be used for issue management.  We will also inhibit the creation of PRs to the master branch, which will effectively become an archive for read-only review of history.  In this sense, these repos will be archived, and no active development will happen with them.  However, we plan to continue servicing previous .NET Core releases out of these repos, so the various release branches (e.g. release/2.1, release/3.0, etc.) will continue to see (limited) activity.\r\n\r\n#### Will the mono repo go away?\r\n\r\nNo. mono/mono contains the source for the full mono stack and will continue to live on happily.  We will simply be moving the managed source associated with System.Private.CoreLib and copying the relatively small amount of source that makes up the native mono runtime to dotnet/platform.  We may choose to then use some mirroring technology to keep the runtime copy in sync (this will, however, not suffer from the same mirroring issues we currently experience, as we would not be mirroring between two components required to build the same binaries), or we may choose to let them diverge and manually sync only those changes deemed relevant to both implementations.\r\n\r\n#### Will the corert repo go away?\r\n\r\nYes.  We plan to retire/archive the corert repo.  Some of the technology in the corert repo will be migrated to the master branch of dotnet/platform, where it will be productized as part of .NET.  Other portions of the corert repo will be migrated to feature branches of dotnet/platform, where the experimentation can continue.  In this way, we will use feature branches to continue experimenting with the corert technology, while making it easier to share portions with its shipping counterpart and also graduate functionality into master if/when it’s ready.\r\n\r\n#### Does this mean there will be a single repo for all of .NET?\r\n\r\nNo.  We will be reducing the number of repos that contribute to .NET, but currently we do not believe that going all the way down to one is the right answer.\r\n\r\n#### Doesn’t this mean that issue and PR tracking will now be overwhelming?\r\n\r\nIt is already the case that the vast majority of issues in a given repo are not relevant to any individual developer, and with several thousand open issues in each repo and on the order of a hundred open PRs in each, we already need systems (e.g. labels) to successfully manage issues and PRs.  As such, we don’t believe the merging will have a significant impact on this aspect of developer productivity.  If it turns out to have an unexpectedly large negative impact, we will work with the community to find ways to mitigate the problem.  However, there are already a multitude of successful open source projects on GitHub with at least an order of magnitude more issues.\r\n\r\n#### What will happen to existing issues?\r\n\r\nWith the help of GitHub functionality, we plan to migrate all issues from old repos (e.g. dotnet/coreclr, dotnet/corefx) to the new repos (e.g. dotnet/platform).  We may also use this as a forcing function to revisit stale issues and either close those that are no longer relevant or reinvigorate those that are demanding of more immediate attention.\r\n\r\n#### What about git history?\r\n\r\nIn general, we plan to keep history, such that history from each constituent repo will be a part of the new repo.  However, we have made some mistakes in the past (e.g. large binaries, multitudes of automated PRs for flowing bits and source between repos, etc.), and we plan to rewrite history to correct those mistakes wherever possible and impactful.  Some rough calculations suggest this could end up significantly reducing the size of the repos as well as the time it takes to clone, which should not only help developers approaching the project but also CI.  This will end up meaning that SHAs may be different in the new repo than they were in the old repo; as previously mentioned, however, any references to the old SHAs in the old repos will continue to work, as those repos will remain accessible.\r\n\r\n#### Will I still show up in the contributor list due to previous contributions?\r\n\r\nYes.  We plan to merge all such history.\r\n\r\n#### Will this break debugging with SourceLink?\r\n\r\nNo.  The existing repos will continue to be accessible, and commit SHAs there will remain unchanged.\r\n\r\n#### Might plans change?\r\n\r\nSure.  Part of the goal of posting this announcement is to hear from you, hear about additional benefits you're excited about, and hear about additional concerns we may not have considered.  We will include such ideas in our planning and course correct as necessary.\r\n\r\n## Discussion\r\n\r\nTo discuss these plans, please comment on the corresponding issue at https://github.com/dotnet/coreclr/issues/26175.\r\n","Url":"https://github.com/dotnet/announcements/issues/119","RelatedDescription":"Open issue \"Consolidating .NET GitHub repos\" (#119)"},{"Id":"470434872","IsPullRequest":false,"CreatedAt":"2019-07-19T16:54:02","Actor":"richlander","Number":"118","RawContent":null,"Title":".NET Core master branches have switched to \"5.0\"","State":"open","Body":"# .NET Core master branches have switched to \"5.0\"\r\n\r\nVarious .NET Core repos have switched their `master` branches to \"5.0\", and will use 3.x branches for 3.0 and 3.1 projects.

In the future, we should do more API focused UX studies 😊\r\n\r\n## Tasks\r\n\r\n| # | Description                            | Code\r\n|:--|:---------------------------------------|:-----\r\n| 1 | Serialize and pretty print             | [Link](https://github.com/ahsonkhan/JsonUxStudy/blob/master/UxScenarios/Scenario1/Program.cs#L19-L31)\r\n| 2 | Deserialize with trailing comma        | [Link](https://github.com/ahsonkhan/JsonUxStudy/blob/master/UxScenarios/Scenario2/Program.cs#L19-L25)\r\n| 3 | Deserialize with custom property names | [Link](https://github.com/ahsonkhan/JsonUxStudy/blob/master/UxScenarios/Scenario3/Program.cs#L30-L45)\r\n| 4 | Read with DOM                          | [Link](https://github.com/ahsonkhan/JsonUxStudy/blob/master/UxScenarios/Scenario4/Program.cs#L20-L35)\r\n| 5 | Pretty print an existing JSON file     | [Link](https://github.com/ahsonkhan/JsonUxStudy/blob/master/UxScenarios/Scenario5/Program.cs#L26-L34)\r\n\r\n## Hypotheses\r\n\r\nWe expect developers to...\r\n\r\n| # | Description                                            | Result\r\n|:--|:-------------------------------------------------------|:---------------\r\n| 1 | ...assume the APIs are similar/identical to JSON.NET   |  Validated\r\n| 2 | ...complete tasks 1-4 successfully                     |  Validated\r\n| 3 | ...struggle/unable to complete the task 5, because it requires working with two different components which is very different from JSON.NET |  Invalidated\r\n| 4 | ...not look at documentation for most of their coding as IntelliSense is good enough |  Invalidated\r\n| 5 | ...be happy with the experience of using the API                                     |  Validated\r\n| 6 | ...plan on using `System.Text.Json` for their next JSON task                         |  Partially Validated\r\n\r\n##  Key Observations\r\n\r\n* Everyone completed scenarios #1-#3, 2 didn't complete #4, 6 didn't complete #5\r\n    - The reason was always \"out of time\". Every person who started a scenario successfully finished it.\r\n    - We feel this validates that we picked the right scope for a 60 minute study of people from various backgrounds\r\n* Overall people liked the new API\r\n    - Key value prop for most people was the fact that \"it's now built in\"\r\n    - Very few mentioned perf and the ones that did thought that it probably wouldn't make a difference in their scenarios.\r\n    - Most people said they would prefer `System.Text.Json` for new APIs, but would stick to JSON.NET in code that already uses it.\r\n    - **[Action]** None, this is in line with what we expected.\r\n* Virtually everyone tried to google for sample code in the documentation\r\n    - Everyone found our blog post and online documentation\r\n    - People new to .NET were confused that JSON.NET and `System.Text.Json` weren't the same thing\r\n    - Everyone complained that the current docs are lacking, especially sample code.\r\n    - **[Action]** Docs are work in progress. We plan on shipping with a fully documented API surface and sample code.\r\n* Virtually everyone found the key type relatively quickly\r\n    - Some people were confused when types were static, rather than something that one can new up\r\n    - **[Action]** None. This is by-design as we try to reduce the number of allocations.\r\n* Virtually everyone had trouble selecting the correct method on\r\n  `JsonSerializer`\r\n    - We chose a very complicated naming convention\r\n    - **[Action]** We simplified it by using names that people in the study told us were looking for.\r\n* Most of our error messages were well received because they told people what\r\n  the problem is & how they can fix them.\r\n    - One error message was unclear because we reported an unexpected character when we could have reported that we didn't expect a comment.\r\n    - **[Action]** We've reworded the error message.\r\n    - We had one error message that was generated by a lower layer and provided an action item that doesn't make sense when people receive it when using the higher layer component.\r\n    - **[Action]** We've reworded the error message to be more generic so it makes sense for both kind of consumers.\r\n* Virtually everyone used the new Roslyn completion feature which will also show\r\n  types from namespaces not imported yet.\r\n    - However, virtually nobody realized that they were doing it.\r\n    - This caused confusion when people found other APIs that happen to include Json in them, specifically the old data contract serialization.\r\n    - **[Action]** Talk to the Roslyn IDE team to see if this something more people will run into. This could prove to be especially problematic for technologies that share type names (e.g. `UserControl` in WinForms and WPF) and both are referenced by the project.\r\n* Optional parameters and `async`/`await` are usability cliffs\r\n    - Many were confused by optional parameters and tried to pass them in, even though they didn't have to.\r\n    - **[Action]** Talk to the Roslyn IDE team to see if we can visualize them better in VS.\r\n    - **[Action]** Try to avoid heavy use of optional parameters for mainline APIs.\r\n    - Async is a very steep cliff. People have no idea what to do in their code to make async work. While IntelliSense shows the usage by prefixing it with await, people didn't notice that.\r\n    - **[Action]** Unclear; this is a broader issue.\r\n* Virtually nobody used F1 to get help for APIs\r\n    - *Surprise*. I expected more people to use <kbd>F1</kbd>.\r\n* Virtually everyone used F12 to explore the API (\"metadata view\")\r\n    - *Surprise*. I expected most people to explore the type via the\r\n      IntelliSense completion\r\n* Nobody used Object Browser to explorer the APIs\r\n    - *Surprise*. I expected at least some people to.\r\n\r\n## Discussion\r\n\r\nFor a discussion, please go to https://github.com/dotnet/corefx/issues/39304.","Url":"https://github.com/dotnet/announcements/issues/117","RelatedDescription":"Open issue \"System.Text.Json usability study results\" (#117)"},{"Id":"465034831","IsPullRequest":false,"CreatedAt":"2019-07-08T03:13:38","Actor":"leecow","Number":"116","RawContent":null,"Title":"Updates to releases.json (.NET Core release metadata)","State":"open","Body":"**The changes described in this issue will be live with the .NET Core July update on 7/9/2019.**\r\n\r\nThe releases.json files (e.g. [2.2 releases.json](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dotnet/core/master/release-notes/2.2/releases.json)) are comprehensive metadata files which capture details of each .NET Core release. These files, along with the top level [releases-index.json](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dotnet/core/master/release-notes/releases-index.json), are becoming increasingly important .NET Core release assets. These files, one for each major.minor channel, are relied upon by many to detect when updates for .NET Core are available, discover security update details and other uses.\r\n\r\nChanges are sometimes necessary, and the growing dependencies require that we treat compatibility of the schema with the utmost care. This announcement describes an addition to the releases.json schema.\r\n\r\n## SDK Versions and Visual Studio\r\n\r\nBecause of current .NET Core SDK product construction dependencies, there is a hard link between the Runtime, SDK, toolset (compilers, MSBuild, NuGet, and other components), and Visual Studio. Simplistically, this means that when anything updates, everything updates. The unfortunate result of this linking is that multiple versions of the SDK are released with each monthly update for each supported versions of Visual Studio. For example, the May Update for .NET Core 2.2 included the 2.2.5 runtime, 2.2.107 SDK for Visual Studio 2017 and 2.2.204 for Visual Studio 2019 and yet another pair of SDK versions for .NET Core 2.1. An example of this is the [2.2.5 Release Notes](https://github.com/dotnet/core/blob/master/release-notes/2.2/2.2.5/2.2.5.md). \r\n\r\nThis is a confusing situation and we are working to mitigate the need to release multiple SDKs with .NET Core 3.0. The need for multiple SDK versions will persist for 2.1 LTS.\r\n\r\n## Adding the SDKS array\r\n\r\nTo appropriately model multiple SDKs per release, we are adding an SDKs array to releases.json, which will contain SDK objects. The top-level SDK object will represent the highest versioned SDK for a given update. Using the previous 2.2.5 update example, SDK 2.2.204 is in the top SDK object as well as duplicated in the SDKS array. All other applicable 2.2* SDK objects are included in the SDKS array. The SDK objects within the array will carry specific Visual Studio compatibility and version inclusion information to provide appropriate context.\r\n\r\nHere is an example of the new array based on the upcoming July update.\r\nAgain, this will be additive and the previous SDK object will include the highest SDK version for the release.\r\n\r\n```json\r\n{\r\n    \"sdk\": {\r\n        \"version\": \"2.2.301\",\r\n        \"version-display\": \"2.2.301\",\r\n        \"runtime-version\": \"2.2.6\",\r\n        \"vs-version\": \"16.1.3\",\r\n        \"vs-support\": \"Visual Studio 2019 (v16.1)\",\r\n        \"csharp-version\": \"7.3\",\r\n        \"fsharp-version\": \"4.5\",\r\n        \"vb-version\": null,\r\n        \"files\": []\r\n    },\r\n    \"sdks\": [\r\n        {\r\n            \"version\": \"2.2.301\",\r\n            \"version-display\": \"2.2.301\",\r\n            \"runtime-version\": \"2.2.6\",\r\n            \"vs-version\": \"16.1.3\",\r\n            \"vs-support\": \"Visual Studio 2019 (v16.1)\",\r\n            \"csharp-version\": \"7.3\",\r\n            \"fsharp-version\": \"4.5\",\r\n            \"vb-version\": null,\r\n            \"files\": []\r\n        },\r\n        {\r\n          \"version\": \"2.2.205\",\r\n          \"version-display\": \"2.2.205\",\r\n          \"runtime-version\": \"2.2.6\",\r\n          \"vs-version\": \"16.0.5\",\r\n          \"vs-support\": \"Visual Studio 2019 (v16.0)\",\r\n          \"csharp-version\": \"7.3\",\r\n          \"fsharp-version\": \"4.5\",\r\n          \"vb-version\": null,\r\n          \"files\": []\r\n        }\r\n    ]\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\n## vs-version and the Runtime\r\n\r\nThe same version of the runtime is included in multiple versions of Visual Studio. To account for this, the vs-version field is being updated to a comma-delimited string. The string will represent all versions of Visual Studio which first include the particular .NET Core update. Again, an example from the upcoming July Update.\r\n\r\n```json\r\n\"runtime\": {\r\n        \"version\": \"2.2.6\",\r\n        \"version-display\": \"2.2.6\",\r\n        \"vs-version\": \"15.9.13, 16.1.3, 16.2.0\",\r\n```\r\n\r\nThe same `vs-versions` changes will be seen in the `aspnetcore-runtime` object.\r\n\r\n## Future Enhancements\r\n\r\nThere are other improvements to the schema which have been suggested by the community which we are evaluating. Generally, theses enhancements are additive and should not represent compatibility compromises for existing parsers and similar announcements will be published ahead of any changes.\r\n\r\n","Url":"https://github.com/dotnet/announcements/issues/116","RelatedDescription":"Open issue \"Updates to releases.json (.NET Core release metadata)\" (#116)"},{"Id":"444065225","IsPullRequest":false,"CreatedAt":"2019-05-14T18:38:23","Actor":"TaraOverfield","Number":"114","RawContent":null,"Title":"May 2019 .NET Updates","State":"open","Body":"# May 2019 .NET Updates\r\n\r\nThe following .NET updates were released in May 2019.
