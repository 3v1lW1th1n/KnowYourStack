We currently ensure the folder is named uniquely by checking if it exists, and if so, incrementing a counter at the end. This process has a race condition where multiple processes will test for the folder's existence, see nothing, and both create and begin to work in the same folder. \r\n\r\n## Background\r\n@markusmobius was running multiple instances of the AutoML CLI, and the various processes were clobbering each others' temporary folders. See https://github.com/dotnet/machinelearning/issues/3749#issuecomment-495259293\r\n\r\nAs said by @daholste in https://github.com/dotnet/machinelearning/issues/3749#issuecomment-495407319:\r\n> Re: writing models to the temp folder -- when initializing experiments one after the other on a machine, each experiment would have its own unique model folder:\r\n> ![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/43974253/58290281-0c6f3500-7d6e-11e9-8790-d8a4077dab21.png)\r\n> However, when initializing many experiments in parallel on the same machine, it is definitely possible to have a race condition that causes conflict here.
