This was bad DX and not having it specified was not reliable as webdriver-manager would not always download the chromedriver version to work with the locally installed chrome.\r\n\r\n`webdriver-manager update --gecko=false --standalone=false $CI_CHROMEDRIVER_VERSION_ARG` is now replaced with `node webdriver-manager-update.js` in the root package.json, which checks which version of chrome puppeteer has come bundled with & downloads informs webdriver-manager to download the corresponding chrome driver version.\r\n\r\nIntegration tests now use `\"webdriver-manager\": \"file:../../node_modules/webdriver-manager\"` and set resolution for it as well so they don't have to waste time calling webdriver-manager update in postinstall\r\n```\r\n\"// resolutions\": \"Ensure a single version of webdriver-manager which comes from root node_modules that has already run webdriver-manager update\",\r\n\"resolutions\": {\r\n\"webdriver-manager\": \"file:../../node_modules/webdriver-manager\"\r\n}\r\n```\r\nThis should speed up each integration postinstall by a few seconds.\r\n\r\nFurther, integration test package.json files link puppeteer via `file:../../node_modules/puppeteer` which is the ideal situation as the puppeteer post-install won't download chrome if it is already downloaded. In CI, since node_modules is cached it should not need to download Chrome either unless the node_modules cache is busted.\r\n\r\nNB: each version of puppeteer comes bundles with a specific version of chrome. Root package.json & yarn.lock currently pull down puppeteer 2.1.0 which comes with chrome 80. See https://github.com/puppeteer/puppeteer#q-which-chromium-version-does-puppeteer-use for more info.\r\n\r\nBONUS COMMIT: updated the aio build to use puppeteer as well so it no longer depends on CI_CHROMEDRIVER_VERSION_ARG.\r\n\r\nOnly two references to CI_CHROMEDRIVER_VERSION_ARG left:\r\n\r\n1) `integration/bazel-schematics/test.sh` which I'm not entirely sure how to get rid of it <== @kyliau\r\n2) `aio/tools/examples/shared/package.json` which I'm not hesitant to touch as its used for examples\r\n\r\n## PR Checklist\r\nPlease check if your PR fulfills the following requirements:\r\n\r\n- [x] The commit message follows our guidelines: https://github.com/angular/angular/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md#commit\r\n- [x] Tests for the changes have been added (for bug fixes / features)\r\n- [ ] Docs have been added / updated (for bug fixes / features)\r\n\r\n\r\n## PR Type\r\nWhat kind of change does this PR introduce?\r\n\r\n<!-- Please check the one that applies to this PR using \"x\". -->\r\n\r\n- [ ] Bugfix\r\n- [ ] Feature\r\n- [ ] Code style update (formatting, local variables)\r\n- [ ] Refactoring (no functional changes, no api changes)\r\n- [ ] Build related changes\r\n- [ ] CI related changes\r\n- [ ] Documentation content changes\r\n- [ ] angular.io application / infrastructure changes\r\n- [x] Other...

My issue is that in `ngOnInit`, I set some things in my component and want to call the `onChange` function. So, I decided to use a `ReplaySubject(1)` to store emitted values. When an `onChange` function gets registered, I subscribe to the stream of values and emit a change on each value received. This causes Angular to throw `ExpressionChangedAfterItWasCheckedError`.\r\n\r\n## üî¨ Minimal Reproduction\r\n- clone [this demo repo](https://github.com/gempain/angular-kxwkry)\r\n- `npm start` and open the console; you should see this:\r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/13135149/73408241-e128e680-42fb-11ea-9649-86329e23b588.png)\r\n\r\nThe first two console logs show that `ngOnInit` is called before `registerOnChange`, so the first value emitted by the `my-control-sync` is not propagated to the parent. The second log shows the error, thrown after the on change function is called in `my-control-async`.\r\n\r\n## üî• Exception or Error\r\n<pre><code>\r\ncore.js:5809 ERROR Error: ExpressionChangedAfterItHasBeenCheckedError: Expression has changed after it was checked.

The slide in is animated using the Angular animations module. When using the application as normal, the slider appears and disappears as expected, animating as expected.\r\n\r\nWhen testing the component using karma/jasmine the component does not behave as expected. One of two things will happen, either the panel is hidden and will not show, or the panel is visible initially and will not hide. When inspecting the styles of the slide in panel, there are some mangled styles that are not present when using the app as normal (style=\"width:50vw;opacity:1;0:width;1:opacity;opacity:1;webkit-opacity:1;width:50vw;\").\r\n\r\nThe Component is supposed to be hidden initially, and when triggered, an animation with change from 0 width to 100% of its contents, and 0 opacity to 1 opacity. The test is checking the components opacity style to confirm that the component is visible. It is checked before and after the components activation. When there is a mouse click, that is not on the component, the component is supposed to hide itself again.\r\n\r\n## üî¨ Minimal Reproduction\r\nhttps://stackblitz.com/edit/angular-xblhso\r\nAs part of the reproduction, in the application window, there is a normal app version at the top of the window, which you can use to see how it should work.

Since [TypeScript 3.0](http://www.typescriptlang.org/docs/handbook/release-notes/typescript-3-0.html#new-unknown-top-type), when a value type is really not known, the right type is `unknown`, which is type safe.\r\n\r\n### Describe the solution you'd like\r\n\r\nIt would be nice if Angular CLI schematics could be compliant with that lint rule by default.

But the result is not stable.\r\n\r\n`caniuse-lite` has its own data in json file in npm package.  Both `build-angular` and `browserslist` have `caniuse-lite`.\r\nSince dependencies of `browserslist` is incremental like `caniuse-lite \"^1.0.30001017\"` and `caniuse-lite` of `build-angular` is fixed, the judgment result of `BuildBrowserFeatures` can change even if the source code of the repository is the same.\r\nModern browsers are updated frequently, so Angular-cli may not be updated in time.\r\n\r\nFor example:\r\n\r\nbuild-angular@0.803.23 includes \"caniuse-lite\": \"1.0.30001019\".\r\nThis version don't have the information of android chrome 79.\r\n`last 2 versions` on the `browserslist` can return 79-78.\r\nBuildBrowserFeatures.isFeatureSupported('es6-module') returns false, because featureStatus for android chrome 79 is undefined.\r\n\r\n### Describe the solution you'd like\r\n\r\nThe package.json of `@angular-devkit/build-angular` changes version dependencies of `caniuse-lite` incrementally like \"^1.0.0\".\r\n\r\n### Describe alternatives you've considered\r\n\r\nMake the `caniuse-lite` included in the browserlist exactly match the` caniuse-lite` of the build-angular.\r\n\r\n1. Point the version of `caniuse-lite` in resolutions.\r\n2. Remove `caniuse-lite` in package.json, use dependiecies of package.json in browserlist.\r\n\r\n\r\nIt may be better to find the lowest supported version and judge the version with an inequality sign. If using `caniuse-api`, it can be easily. But impact on polyfill creation, etc. cannot be fully determined.","Url":"https://github.com/angular/angular-cli/issues/16790","RelatedDescription":"Open issue \"Make the version strategy of caniuse-lite incremental\" (#16790)"},{"Id":"556049280","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2020-01-28T18:52:53","Actor":"renovate[bot]","Number":"16778","RawContent":null,"Title":"build: update tar to version ^6.0.0","State":"closed","Body":"This PR contains the following updates:\n\n| Package | Type | Update | Change |\n|---|---|---|---|\n| [tar](https://togithub.com/npm/node-tar) | devDependencies | major | [`^5.0.0` -> `^6.0.0`](https://renovatebot.com/diffs/npm/tar/5.0.5/6.0.0) |\n\n---\n\n### Release Notes\n\n<details>\n<summary>npm/node-tar</summary>\n\n### [`v6.0.0`](https://togithub.com/npm/node-tar/compare/v5.0.5...v6.0.0)\n\n[Compare Source](https://togithub.com/npm/node-tar/compare/v5.0.5...v6.0.0)\n\n</details>\n\n---\n\n### Renovate configuration\n\n:date: **Schedule**: \"after 10pm every weekday,before 4am every weekday,every weekend\" in timezone America/Tijuana.\n\n:vertical_traffic_light: **Automerge**: Disabled by config.

Puppeteer can now talk to a real, unpatched Firefox binary (as opposed to the old [Juggler](https://togithub.com/puppeteer/juggler)-based approach).

Yes, the pipeline to build/deploy was working in Angular 8.2, the behaviour changed migrating to Angular 9.rc10\r\n\r\n\r\n### Description\r\n\r\nThe way that angular.json configuration for \"fileReplacements\" and \"assets\" works has changed.\r\n\r\n\r\n## üî¨ Minimal Reproduction\r\n\r\nTo deploy with CloudFoundry I need to provide an environment specific manifest.yml file.\r\nSo I have a manifest.{env}.yml for each environment.\r\n\r\nIn 8.2, I was specifying to replace the manifest file with \"fileReplacements\", and then adding the manifest.yml as an \"asset\" to push to CloudFoundry.\r\n\r\nFor example for the environment \"staging\" I would have:\r\n/src/deployment/manifest.staging.yml\r\n/src/deployment/manifest.yml\r\n\r\nThe first step here would be fileReplacements kicking in, moving the content from manifest.staging.yml inside manifest.yml\r\n\r\nThe second/last step is manifest.yml being included in dist through the \"assets\" configuration, but with the staging's configuration inside.\r\n\r\nInstead, after migrating to Angular 9.rc10, fileReplacements doesn't happen in time and manifest.yml has the content of the original (non-staging) one.\r\n\r\nAs a possible fix I tried this approach:\r\nI tried to change my assets configuration to grab directly the manifest file:\r\n{\r\n\t\"glob\":   \"manifest.staging.yml\",\r\n\t\"input\":  \"apps/appointment-manager/src/deployment\",\r\n\t\"output\": \"manifest.yml\"\r\n},\r\n\r\nI expected:\r\ndist/manifest.yml\r\nInstead I got:\r\ndist/manifest.yml/manifest.staging.yml\r\n\r\nthe output was read as a directory where to place the content.\r\n\r\n## üî• Exception or Error\r\n\r\nNope.\r\n\r\n\r\n## üåç Your Environment\r\n<pre><code>\r\nAngular CLI: 9.0.0-rc.10\r\nNode:

When I navigate away from the search result route from the first result page and come back to it, everything works fine. When I navigate away from another page (index > 0) and come back to it, an `ExpressionChangedAfterIthasBeenChecked` error is raised.\r\n\r\nReproduction link : https://stackblitz.com/edit/angular-okcqx3\r\n\r\nSteps to reproduce:\r\n1. Clic on \"item11\" or \"item22\" link, then \"back to table\". No error is raised\r\n2. Navigate to page 2 or 3 and clic any link (\"item33\" for instance), then \"back to table\". Error is raised.\r\n\r\nDetailed messages (two different errors are raised) : \r\n\r\n- `Previous value: 'disabled: true'. Current value: 'disabled: false'`\r\n- `Previous value: 'null: undefined'. Current value: 'null: 33'`\r\n\r\nI know the conditions which can lead to `ExpressionChangedAfterIthasBeenChecked` but could not identify any here. I could narrow the condition for the second error :\r\n\r\n`<a (click)=\"displayItem(item)\" *ngIf=\"item.id\">{{item.name}}</a>`\r\n\r\nHowever, I do not understand why my code would trigger a change during the two detection cycles. I cannot figure out why the `*ngIf` at this line of the template would be interpreted once as undefined, then as 33. The id of the item is always present in this 33 item. The name of the property (`null`) is also quite strange.\r\n \r\n#### Expected Behavior\r\n\r\nNo error raised in browser console.\r\n\r\n#### Actual Behavior\r\n\r\nAn `ExpressionChangedAfterIthasBeenChecked` Error is raised.\r\n\r\nNote : This behavior is present only during development phase as the check is removed as expected by the `--prod` compilation. I did NOT see any production problem related to it. However, due to a general ErrorHandler in the application (which is catching all the frontend errors for proper display), the `ExpressionChangedAfterIthasBeenChecked` is rather annoying as it triggers this general handler.\r\n\r\n#### Environment\r\n\r\n- Angular: 8.2.14\r\n- CDK/Material: 8.2.3\r\n- Browser(s): Tested on Chrome and Firefox\r\n- Operating System : Win 10\r\n","Url":"https://github.com/angular/components/issues/18311","RelatedDescription":"Open issue \"Table with paginator, ExpressionChangedAfterItHasBeenChecked when restoring page index\" (#18311)"},{"Id":"556164808","IsPullRequest":false,"CreatedAt":"2020-01-28T12:04:24","Actor":"aitboudad","Number":"18310","RawContent":null,"Title":"[Form field] mat-label doesn't not instantly reflected in UI when using ngIf","State":"open","Body":"#### Reproduction\r\n\r\nhttps://stackblitz.com/edit/angular-mscc8j\r\n \r\n \r\n#### Expected Behavior\r\n\r\nshould render label when is set\r\n\r\n\r\n#### Actual Behavior\r\n\r\nWhen the label is set the UI doesn't detect changes until the field catches focus\r\n\r\n\r\n#### Environment\r\n\r\n- Angular: `8.2.14`\r\n- CDK/Material: `8.2.3`\r\n- Browser(s): `Chrome`\r\n- Operating System (e.g. Windows, macOS, Ubuntu): `macOS`\r\n","Url":"https://github.com/angular/components/issues/18310","RelatedDescription":"Open issue \"[Form field] mat-label doesn't not instantly reflected in UI when using ngIf\" (#18310)"},{"Id":"556115865","IsPullRequest":false,"CreatedAt":"2020-01-28T11:50:06","Actor":"miohtama","Number":"18309","RawContent":null,"Title":"StackBlitz links are broken","State":"closed","Body":"#### Documentation Feedback\r\n\r\nCurrently StackBlitz links are not working.\r\n\r\nAn example link picked up from the page:\r\n\r\nhttps://run.stackblitz.com/api/angular/v1?file=src%2Fapp%2Fform-field-overview-example.ts\r\n\r\n<img width=\"625\" alt=\"image\" src=\"https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/49922/73255837-2f859a80-41c1-11ea-9c92-a1a852369a53.png\">\r\n\r\nGives HTTP 500 on StackBlitz\r\n\r\n<img width=\"556\" alt=\"image\" src=\"https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/49922/73255909-4b893c00-41c1-11ea-8577-6812e1efa9c9.png\">\r\n\r\n\r\n**Affected documentation page:** \r\n\r\nThis page https://material.angular.io/components/form-field/examples and many others.\r\n\r\nI suspect the lnk format is somehow wrong, though I do not have insight how Angular and StackBlitz links were wired.\r\n","Url":"https://github.com/angular/components/issues/18309","RelatedDescription":"Closed issue \"StackBlitz links are broken\" (#18309)"},{"Id":"556112894","IsPullRequest":false,"CreatedAt":"2020-01-28T10:23:57","Actor":"xXKeyleXx","Number":"18308","RawContent":null,"Title":"Stuttering scrollbar (Virtual scrolling) when using el.offsetHeight","State":"open","Body":"#### Reproduction\r\n\r\nhttps://stackblitz.com/edit/angular-dz9eqz?file=src%2Fapp%2Fcdk-virtual-scroll-overview-example.ts\r\n\r\nSteps to reproduce:\r\n1.
