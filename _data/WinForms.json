It is produced and consumed by `KeysConverter` class that is [locale dependent](https://github.com/dotnet/winforms/blob/df89eb965dd59fd15341972e3a6ce33e51a86317/src/System.Windows.Forms/src/System/Windows/Forms/KeysConverter.cs#L44-L66). While the value `Control` would work in any locale due to the fallback to names in the `Keys` enum the value `Ctrl` is taken from a dictionary that contains localized names. On .NET Core 3.1 in the German localization the name for `Control` key is `Strg`. Thus the value `Ctrl+C` in the resource file is invalid and causes conversion error at runtime.\r\n\r\nNotably we migrated a large project from .NET Framework to .NET Core where we hit this issue. The .NET Framework also has similar issue in code but the localizations may differ which would explain why the problem is not hit.\r\n\r\nManually fixing the value in the .resx file to `Control+C` makes the application work in any locale but any further editing in the designer breaks it again.\r\n\r\n**Expected behavior:**\r\n\r\nNo crash. The resources generated by the designer should be locale independent.\r\n\r\n**Minimal repro:**\r\n\r\nHere's the sample app created using the steps above. It is multi-targeting both .NET Framework and .NET Core so it can run in both variation from inside Visual Studio.\r\n\r\n[WindowsFormsApp2.zip](https://github.com/dotnet/winforms/files/4226867/WindowsFormsApp2.zip)\r\n","Url":"https://github.com/dotnet/winforms/issues/2886","RelatedDescription":"Open issue \"Runtime crash due to localization and the way designer serializes keyboard shortcuts\" (#2886)"},{"Id":"567554245","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2020-02-19T13:16:48","Actor":"dotnet-maestro[bot]","Number":"2885","RawContent":null,"Title":"[master] Update dependencies from dotnet/arcade","State":"closed","Body":"This pull request updates the following dependencies\r\n\r\n[marker]: <> (Begin:4d0c844d-0758-4fc5-c1ad-08d6354da8a8)\r\n## From https://github.com/dotnet/arcade\r\n- **Subscription**: 4d0c844d-0758-4fc5-c1ad-08d6354da8a8\r\n- **Build**: 20200218.1\r\n- **Date Produced**: 2/18/2020 2:20 PM\r\n- **Commit**: b40d0c89c230189b4c6aeb32c0a43218b4bc3359\r\n- **Branch**: refs/heads/master\r\n- **Updates**:\r\n  -
