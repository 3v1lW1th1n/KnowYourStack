We can instead open the image using Bitmap(stream) and create stream in Read only mode. Since bitmap class expects us to keep the stream open until the lifetime of the bitmap class so we will first create a file stream, copy the contents over to in memory and pass the reference to in memory stream to the bitmap class. Whenever bitmap object is disposed GC will clean up the in memory image data. This is of course not a great solution as it will increase GC pressure but this is the best we can do given the limitations of bitmap class. This will prevent ML.NET code creating a lock over the input image files because there is no good reason to do that and instead it creates issues if another process wants to rewrite to that image location.","Url":"https://github.com/dotnet/machinelearning/issues/3630","RelatedDescription":"Closed issue \"ImageLoader loader transform should not hold the lock on image\" (#3630)"},{"Id":"439208542","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2019-05-01T16:11:29","Actor":"eerhardt","Number":"3637","RawContent":null,"Title":"Update ML.NET version in Extensions.ML","State":"closed","Body":"Reference the latest ML.NET.","Url":"https://github.com/dotnet/machinelearning/pull/3637","RelatedDescription":"Closed or merged PR \"Update ML.NET version in Extensions.ML\" (#3637)"},{"Id":"439192572","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2019-05-01T15:59:28","Actor":"eerhardt","Number":"3636","RawContent":null,"Title":"Merge release into integration","State":"closed","Body":"Merging `release/1.0` into `features/IntegrationPackage`.
