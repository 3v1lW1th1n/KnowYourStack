PerfView has the ability to generate GCDumps (a collections of statistics about all objects on the heap) of a running process by turning on a specific set of keywords on the `Microsoft-Windows-DotNETRuntime` provider and analyzing the data.  These are a powerful tool for triaging memory leaks and other flavors of memory issues.\r\n\r\nff37915 - This moves a function call to `EtwCallbackCommon` so that both ETW and EventPipe have the same behavior.  `OnKeywordsChanged` modifies some global statics for type logging to cause the type cache to be emptied when a specific keyword is not enabled.  Without clearing this type cache, type metadata events are not generated when GCs are triggered via EventPipe resulting in GCDumps that have no type information.  Moving this to `EtwCallbackCommon` ensures that the type cache is correctly flushed like it was with ETW.\r\n\r\n2a1a6cf - This fixes 3 events that were not being sent over EventPipe previously.  Without these events, static, ccw, and rcw type metadata would not be present in GCDumps created via EventPipe.\r\n\r\n### Customer Impact\r\n\r\nWith these changes, customers will be able to collect GCDumps on Linux, Mac, and Windows by analyzing events sent over EventPipe as they could with ETW.\r\n\r\n### Regression\r\n\r\nThis is a discrepancy in the event parity between ETW and EventPipe (i.e., what events can be collected by what technology), but not technically a regression as this issue has existed since before 2.2.\r\n\r\n### Risk\r\n\r\nLow - These changes are targeted to preserve ETW behavior without modifying any other logic.\r\n\r\nCC @tommcdon @caslan ","Url":"https://github.com/dotnet/coreclr/pull/27297","RelatedDescription":"Open PR \"[3.1] Backport fixes to ETW/EventPipe events to enable GCDumps\" (#27297)"},{"Id":"509295270","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2019-10-18T20:28:45","Actor":"fadimounir","Number":"27296","RawContent":null,"Title":"Packaging for crossgen2 as a framework dependent application.","State":"open","Body":"This requires us to manually emit a runtimeconfig json for now, since the build produces a self-contained version of crossgen2.\r\n\r\nAlso includes some minor cleanups to the way we build crossgen2:\r\n- Removed from build.proj since we explicitly build it as a self-contained application from build.cmd/build.sh\r\n- Removed the output path property from the csproj files.

liblttng-ust-dev ","State":"closed","Body":"This fixes https://github.com/dotnet/coreclr/issues/27024.\r\n\r\nFor all of our event sinks for LTTng, we wrap the call to fire events with `tracepoint_enabled`, which is a macro defined in a header file liblttng-ust-dev. This macro checks whether a particular probe point is enabled before we fire an event, so that we're not unnecessarily making the call to fire events through LTTng when nobody is listening to it. \r\n\r\nFor environments that don't want to build using LTTng, we have a macro definition for `tracepoint_enabled`, which used to be defined as:\r\n\r\n`#define tracepoint_enabled(provider, name) TRUE`. \r\n\r\nThis meant that for custom CoreCLR builds that were produced without LTTng library enabled, the runtime will always try to fire all events only to find out nobody is listening. So this behavior was changed to \r\n\r\n`#define tracepoint_enabled(provider, name) FALSE`. \r\n\r\nUnfortunately this caused the compiler to optimize out the bodies for all the event sinks when such thing happens. This would be fine for custom builds that didn't want LTTng since they become no-ops. However, some build environments that we still use, we use old enough distributions that have old LTTng libraries, specifically CentOS 6 which uses liblttng-ust-dev version 2.4. This particular version of the library doesn't have the definition of `tracepoint_enabled` in its header, so we hit this bad behavior in builds produced in CentOS 6 container. \r\n\r\nEven more unfortunately, CentOS 6 is the distro we use for our official SDK build containers for Linux, so this caused LTTng support in CoreCLR to regress in the official builds.\r\n\r\nThis fix changes the macro definition of `tracepoint_enabled` to use `XplatEventLogger::IsEventLoggingEnabled` method, which checks if the environment variable we require for using LTTng tracing (`COMPlus_EnableEventLog`) is enabled.\r\n\r\nThe long term fix for this would be to change the official build containers to build and install liblttng-ust-dev versions 2.5 or newer, but this is the short-term fix until that happens.\r\n\r\nThe fix will be ported to 3.0 and 3.1 once merged. \r\n\r\ncc @tommcdon  ","Url":"https://github.com/dotnet/coreclr/pull/27273","RelatedDescription":"Closed or merged PR \"Fix LTTng

Other languages have such features.\r\n\r\nIs there any chance to request an API addition that allows such things?\r\nFor example allowing the constructor of `HttpListener` to take an `TcpListener`-Instance.\r\n","Url":"https://github.com/dotnet/standard/issues/1617","RelatedDescription":"Closed issue \"Why do I need special permission when using HttpListener?\" (#1617)"},{"Id":"509045354","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2019-10-18T12:30:25","Actor":"dotnet-maestro[bot]","Number":"1616","RawContent":null,"Title":"[master] Update dependencies from dotnet/corefx","State":"closed","Body":"This pull request updates the following dependencies\r\n\r\n[marker]: <> (Begin:2a9b120a-74e9-4ac8-c08c-08d6da235811)\r\n## From https://github.com/dotnet/corefx\r\n- **Build**: 20191018.1\r\n- **Date Produced**: 10/18/2019 8:58 AM\r\n- **Commit**: 2b92fc0930b941cd0d9146971745cd717689434c\r\n- **Branch**: refs/heads/master\r\n- **Updates**:\r\n  - **System.Reflection.Emit** -> 5.0.0-alpha1.19518.1\r\n  - **System.Reflection.Emit.ILGeneration** -> 5.0.0-alpha1.19518.1\r\n  - **System.Reflection.Emit.Lightweight** -> 5.0.0-alpha1.19518.1\r\n\r\n[marker]: <> (End:2a9b120a-74e9-4ac8-c08c-08d6da235811)\r\n\r\n","Url":"https://github.com/dotnet/standard/pull/1616","RelatedDescription":"Closed or merged PR \"[master] Update dependencies from dotnet/corefx\" (#1616)"},{"Id":"508423360","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2019-10-17T23:53:53","Actor":"akoeplinger","Number":"1614","RawContent":null,"Title":"Update Xamarin APIs to latest Dev16.4 builds","State":"closed","Body":"- Xamarin.Android 10.1.0.1\r\n- Xamarin.iOS 13.8.1.1\r\n- Xamarin.Mac 6.8.1.1\r\n\r\nThis also uses a new GenAPI version so the diff is a little messy because of the enum value to name changes in attributes.\r\n\r\nI also had to introduce a System.Core.stubs.csproj to break a build cycle because System.dll references System.Security.Cryptography.ECDsa from System.Core.dll now.","Url":"https://github.com/dotnet/standard/pull/1614","RelatedDescription":"Closed or merged PR \"Update Xamarin APIs to latest Dev16.4 builds\" (#1614)"},{"Id":"508433927","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2019-10-17T12:24:28","Actor":"dotnet-maestro[bot]","Number":"1615","RawContent":null,"Title":"[master] Update dependencies from dotnet/corefx","State":"closed","Body":"This pull request updates the following dependencies\r\n\r\n[marker]: <> (Begin:2a9b120a-74e9-4ac8-c08c-08d6da235811)\r\n## From https://github.com/dotnet/corefx\r\n- **Build**: 20191016.16\r\n- **Date Produced**: 10/17/2019 4:25 AM\r\n- **Commit**: b9186cfa3566ee24e5f16e45c542a3078e128dc6\r\n- **Branch**: refs/heads/master\r\n- **Updates**:\r\n  - **System.Reflection.Emit** -> 5.0.0-alpha1.19516.16\r\n  - **System.Reflection.Emit.ILGeneration** -> 5.0.0-alpha1.19516.16\r\n  - **System.Reflection.Emit.Lightweight** -> 5.0.0-alpha1.19516.16\r\n\r\n[marker]: <> (End:2a9b120a-74e9-4ac8-c08c-08d6da235811)\r\n\r\n","Url":"https://github.com/dotnet/standard/pull/1615","RelatedDescription":"Closed or merged PR \"[master] Update dependencies from dotnet/corefx\" (#1615)"},{"Id":"507816713","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2019-10-16T12:33:03","Actor":"dotnet-maestro[bot]","Number":"1613","RawContent":null,"Title":"[master] Update dependencies from dotnet/corefx","State":"closed","Body":"This pull request updates the following dependencies\r\n\r\n[marker]: <> (Begin:2a9b120a-74e9-4ac8-c08c-08d6da235811)\r\n## From https://github.com/dotnet/corefx\r\n- **Build**: 20191015.14\r\n- **Date Produced**: 10/16/2019 5:58 AM\r\n- **Commit**: b50bd0a1d3f0326fc717706cb5c5950ab41cf437\r\n- **Branch**: refs/heads/master\r\n- **Updates**:\r\n  - **System.Reflection.Emit** -> 5.0.0-alpha1.19515.14\r\n  - **System.Reflection.Emit.ILGeneration** -> 5.0.0-alpha1.19515.14\r\n  - **System.Reflection.Emit.Lightweight** -> 5.0.0-alpha1.19515.14\r\n\r\n[marker]: <> (End:2a9b120a-74e9-4ac8-c08c-08d6da235811)\r\n\r\n","Url":"https://github.com/dotnet/standard/pull/1613","RelatedDescription":"Closed or merged PR \"[master] Update dependencies from dotnet/corefx\" (#1613)"},{"Id":"507439996","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2019-10-15T19:33:30","Actor":"crummel","Number":"1612","RawContent":null,"Title":"Source-build improvements.","State":"open","Body":"- Always restore, even in source-build.

I've been digging and trying to understand for weeks where the issue/limitation is to our problem, figured this would be the most suitable place to ask. We are not sure if this is a limitation with the frameworks, or the platform, or due to our limited knowledge, or a combination of all. But things are very confusing right now, and we just need proper guidance on what direction to take.\r\n\r\nEDIT: Would appreciate if @bartonjs or @filipnavara could pitch in 👍 \r\n\r\n### **Background** 💡 \r\nWe are creating a small, cross-platform (win & macos), desktop application that will act as a websocket server running only on localhost (https). This application is a bridge between our web applications and the local machine hardware (e.g. printers). In order to provide a secure connection, `SslStream` requires a `X509Certificate2` class with a `PrivateKey`.\r\n\r\nThe idea is to let the app itself generate a self-signed certificate with private key and use that to start the secure websocket service. After the certificate has been generated for the first time, we store it in the local certificate store and reuse it when the app restarts. \r\n\r\n### **Project structure & frameworks** 📦 \r\nThis is how our solution is defined. `SharedProject` is a shared lib referenced by both `AppWin` & `AppMac`. The Win & Mac projects are startup-projects for their respective platform. \r\n```\r\nOurApp.sln\r\n  |---- SharedProject (netstandard2.1)\r\n        Creates & runs the websocket service, generates certificate (win), communicates with local hardware, ect\r\n\r\n  |---- AppWin (netcore3.0)\r\n        Startup project for Windows platform. Contains platform-specific code, if any.\r\n\r\n  |---- AppMac (Xamarin.Mac)\r\n        Startup project for macOS platform. Contains platform-specific code (generates certificate).\r\n```\r\n\r\n### **How it runs** 🏃 \r\nIn our `SharedProject` we have a class taking care of certificate generation and storing. The idea was that both the Win & Mac platforms could use this to manage the certificates. It uses the `X509Certificate2` & `CertificateRequest` provided by the framework. Plus the `X509Store` to save and retrieve the certificate.\r\n\r\n**Windows** ✔️ \r\nOn Windows there are no issues. With minimum amount of code we are able to generate a self-signed certificate with private-key, store it, and run the service with it. Also re-using the certificate when the app restarts by retrieving the certificate works very well. The `X509Store` returns the certificate with the _private key_, and we can easily use it with our `SslStream`. \r\n\r\n**macOS** ❌ \r\nThings are not so clear here... We could not use the above mentioned shared class to manage certificates (that works just fine on Windows):\r\n* First issue was that we got a `PlatformNotSupportedException` when the application was trying to use the `CertificateRequest`. \r\n* Second \"issue\" was that the `X509Store` did not store or retrieve certificates from the macOS keychain, but instead it uses some local mono certificate-store that the browsers do not see (at least in our tests). And it only stored the certificate (.cer) not the private-key that was included in the `X509Certificate2` object. Plus it seemed difficult to \"Trust\" the stored certificate.\r\n\r\nSo we created a separate class to take care of certificate management for macOS inside the `AppMac (Xamarin.Mac)` project. By using `BouncyCastle` we generated an identical self-signed certificate with private-key and used that to run our secure websocket service:\r\n\r\n* When launching our Secure Websocket service on macOS, the certificate used here is automatically added to the local macOS login keychain. For us this is great, since we could not use `X509Store` to add it there in the first place.\r\n* The only way we could retrieve the certificate from the keychain was to use the `SecKeyChain` class and query for it. Thankfully the `SecCertificate` object has a `ToX509Certificate2()` function. But that still left us without the `PrivateKey` that is needed by `SslStream`. \r\n* We also tried using `SecKeyChain.FindIdentity` to retrieve both, but even tho it is easy to convert `SecCertificate` to `X509Certificate2`, there seems to be no way to convert a `SecKey` to something useful like `RSA` or `RSACryptoServiceProvider` or something that can be embedded to the `X509Certificate2`\r\n\r\n### What to do? 😭 \r\nWe are pretty much stuck when it comes to the macOS platform. There seems to be no way for us to retrieve our own X509Certificate2 with the private-key embedded. Not sure if this is because we are using Xamarin.Mac & netstandard2.1, perhaps things are easier on netcore3? But still, Xamarin & mono have been around for a long time, there should be a way for us to do this today. Must be something we are missing here and would appreciate if someone could guide us.

One thing to note though, is that the numbers for small sizes seem to fluctuate around for small sizes, so I suppose the results may be inaccurate. (Even for this benchmark, I expect the numbers to be similar for Size 4/16/32, since they are all stored in one `int` and therefore should be just a single copy of an int; but they all seem to give different results)\r\n\r\nFurthermore, since the current implementation of `SetAll` operates on the whole of the backing array, this may result in unnecessary copying to unused area when the `BitArray.Length` has been set to make the BitArray smaller but the backing array hasn't been resized due to the new length not meeting the `_ShrinkThreshold` (in `int` counts): https://github.com/dotnet/corefx/blob/2b92fc0930b941cd0d9146971745cd717689434c/src/System.Collections/src/System/Collections/BitArray.cs#L23\r\n\r\nThe new implementation uses `GetInt32ArrayLengthFromBitLength(Length)` method to calculate where the used area are and only copies to that region. Unfortunately, since this happens for smaller sized arrays as well, this check on itself seem to results in approximately 0.7x slowdown when the array has less than 32 elements.\r\n\r\nRegarding the use of AVX2, I figured out that AVX2 generally improved the performance despite the concerns about downclocking. This is an example comparison between various paths for BitArray(Array, int) with bool arrays (See https://github.com/dotnet/corefx/issues/41762#issuecomment-542658154 and https://github.com/dotnet/corefx/issues/41762#issuecomment-542831649 for benchmarks of And/or/xor/not and `BitArray(bool[])`):\r\n```\r\n// * Summary *                                                                                                          \r\nBenchmarkDotNet=v0.11.5.1159-nightly, OS=Windows 10.0.18999                                                             Intel Core i7-8700 CPU 3.20GHz (Coffee Lake), 1 CPU, 12 logical and 6 physical cores\r\n.NET Core SDK=5.0.100-alpha1-014899\r\n  [Host]              : .NET Core 5.0.0-alpha1.19507.3 (CoreCLR 5.0.19.50101, CoreFX 5.0.19.50407), X64 RyuJIT\r\n  Job-VRDFCM          : .NET Core ?

For two sucessfull lookups I get something like \r\n```\r\n<Event MSec=  \"1622.1247\" PID=\"11101\" PName=\"Process(11101)\" TID=\"11101\" EventName=\"Enter\" ProviderName=\"Microsoft-System-Net-NameResolution\" thisOrContextObject=\"(null)\" memberName=\"BeginGetHostEntry\" parameters=\"(www.foo.com)\"/>\r\n<Event MSec=  \"1624.5354\" PID=\"11101\" PName=\"Process(11101)\" TID=\"11101\" EventName=\"Exit\" ProviderName=\"Microsoft-System-Net-NameResolution\" thisOrContextObject=\"(null)\" memberName=\"BeginGetHostEntry\" result=\"DnsResolveAsyncResult#33476626\"/>\r\n<Event MSec=  \"1624.5881\" PID=\"11101\" PName=\"Process(11101)\" TID=\"11101\" EventName=\"Enter\" ProviderName=\"Microsoft-System-Net-NameResolution\" thisOrContextObject=\"(null)\" memberName=\"BeginGetHostEntry\" parameters=\"(www.foo.com)\"/>\r\n<Event MSec=  \"1625.0484\" PID=\"11101\" PName=\"Process(11101)\" TID=\"11101\" EventName=\"Exit\" ProviderName=\"Microsoft-System-Net-NameResolution\" thisOrContextObject=\"(null)\" memberName=\"BeginGetHostEntry\" result=\"DnsResolveAsyncResult#27252167\"/>\r\n<Event MSec=  \"6647.5183\" PID=\"11101\" PName=\"Process(11101)\" TID=\"11112\" EventName=\"Enter\" ProviderName=\"Microsoft-System-Net-NameResolution\" thisOrContextObject=\"(null)\" memberName=\"EndGetHostEntry\" parameters=\"(DnsResolveAsyncResult#27252167)\"/>\r\n<Event MSec=  \"6647.5809\" PID=\"11101\" PName=\"Process(11101)\" TID=\"11109\" EventName=\"Enter\" ProviderName=\"Microsoft-System-Net-NameResolution\" thisOrContextObject=\"(null)\" memberName=\"EndGetHostEntry\" parameters=\"(DnsResolveAsyncResult#33476626)\"/>\r\n<Event MSec=  \"6647.6229\" PID=\"11101\" PName=\"Process(11101)\" TID=\"11112\" EventName=\"Exit\" ProviderName=\"Microsoft-System-Net-NameResolution\" thisOrContextObject=\"(null)\" memberName=\"EndGetHostEntry\" result=\"IPHostEntry#4032828\"/>\r\n<Event MSec=  \"6647.6674\" PID=\"11101\" PName=\"Process(11101)\" TID=\"11109\" EventName=\"Exit\" ProviderName=\"Microsoft-System-Net-NameResolution\" thisOrContextObject=\"(null)\" memberName=\"EndGetHostEntry\" result=\"IPHostEntry#6044116\"/>\r\n```\r\n\r\n* since tasks are executed on ThreadPool I cannot anymore use TID to find matching Exit entries for Entry. So I cannot figure out how long took to do lookup and it is not possible find failing lookups by looking for missing Exit entries. \r\n\r\n**Proposal:** \r\n\r\n* We currently don't set context on entry/exit. We could set it to passed in string. That would allow us distinguish between lookups for different instances\r\n* We could try/catch/throw in public functions but as @stephentoub quickly pointed out there is performance cost associated with that. We could do something like `catch (Exception) when (IsTracingEnabled())`  do pay the cost when tracing is enabled. However if we go with above proposal or if we find better way how to trace identity we can emit traces at the places where we throw. \r\n\r\n```c#\r\n        private static object GetHostEntryOrAddressesCore(string hostName, bool justAddresses)\r\n        {\r\n            int hash = hostName.GetHashCode();\r\n            if (NetEventSource.IsEnabled) NetEventSource.Enter(hostName, hostName);\r\n            Console.WriteLine(\"GetHostEntryOrAddressesCore start: {0} {1}\",  hostName, hostName.GetHashCode());\r\n            ValidateHostName(hostName);\r\n\r\n            SocketError errorCode = NameResolutionPal.TryGetAddrInfo(hostName, justAddresses, out string newHostName, out string[] aliases, out IPAddress[] addresses, out int nativeErrorCode);\r\n            if (errorCode != SocketError.Success)\r\n            {\r\n+                if (NetEventSource.IsEnabled) NetEventSource.Error(hostName, $\"{hostName} DNS lookup failed with {errorCode}\");\r\n                throw SocketExceptionFactory.CreateSocketException(errorCode, nativeErrorCode);\r\n            }\r\n```\r\n```\r\n<Event MSec=   \"322.2866\" PID=\"14211\" PName=\"Process(14211)\" TID=\"14211\" EventName=\"Info\" ProviderName=\"Microsoft-System-Net-NameResolution\" thisOrContextObject=\"String#-263748031\" memberName=\"GetHostEntryOrAddressesCoreAsync\" message=\"www.foo.com\"/>\r\n<Event MSec=   \"324.5510\" PID=\"14211\" PName=\"Process(14211)\" TID=\"14211\" EventName=\"Info\" ProviderName=\"Microsoft-System-Net-NameResolution\" thisOrContextObject=\"String#-349866304\" memberName=\"GetHostEntryOrAddressesCoreAsync\" message=\"www.foo22.com\"/>\r\n<Event MSec=   \"326.1782\" PID=\"14211\" PName=\"Process(14211)\" TID=\"14219\" EventName=\"Enter\" ProviderName=\"Microsoft-System-Net-NameResolution\" thisOrContextObject=\"String#-263748031\" memberName=\"GetHostEntryOrAddressesCore\" parameters=\"(www.foo.com)\"/>\r\n<Event MSec=   \"326.2288\" PID=\"14211\" PName=\"Process(14211)\" TID=\"14221\" EventName=\"Enter\" ProviderName=\"Microsoft-System-Net-NameResolution\" thisOrContextObject=\"String#-349866304\" memberName=\"GetHostEntryOrAddressesCore\" parameters=\"(www.foo22.com)\"/>\r\n<Event MSec=  \"5354.9991\" PID=\"14211\" PName=\"Process(14211)\" TID=\"14219\" EventName=\"Exit\" ProviderName=\"Microsoft-System-Net-NameResolution\" thisOrContextObject=\"String#-263748031\" memberName=\"GetHostEntryOrAddressesCore\" result=\"IPHostEntry#6044116, 2\"/>\r\n<Event MSec=  \"5366.5515\" PID=\"14211\" PName=\"Process(14211)\" TID=\"14221\" EventName=\"ErrorMessage\" ProviderName=\"Microsoft-System-Net-NameResolution\" thisOrContextObject=\"String#-349866304\" memberName=\"GetHostEntryOrAddressesCore\" message=\"www.foo22.com DNS lookup failed with HostNotFound\"/>\r\n\r\n``` \r\n\r\nThis would allow to pair Enter/Exit for successful cases as well as provide useful info on failures. When `*:0xFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFF:3` filter is used, it would show just the failing message without any additional craft. For that reason I think we should repeat failing name instead  of relying on Entry (as the record may not be available) \r\n\r\nFor successful case I also throw  length of address list `result=\"IPHostEntry#6044116, 2\"/>` so the log would show to how many IP addresses name resolved to. \r\n\r\n```c#\r\n if (NetEventSource.IsEnabled) NetEventSource.Exit(hostName, result, addresses.Length);\r\n```\r\n\r\n","Url":"https://github.com/dotnet/corefx/issues/41884","RelatedDescription":"Open issue \"tracing in NameResolution should be improved\" (#41884)"},{"Id":"508811244","IsPullRequest":false,"CreatedAt":"2019-10-18T02:04:10","Actor":"reflectronic","Number":"41883","RawContent":null,"Title":"API Proposal: ImmutableArray<T>.Builder.Remove(T, IEqualityComparer<T>)","State":"open","Body":"## Proposed API\r\n```diff\r\npublic struct ImmutableArray<T>\r\n{\r\n\tpublic class Builder\r\n    {\r\n+       public bool Remove(T element, IEqualityComparer<T> equalityComparer);\r\n    }\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\n`ImmutableArray<T>` itself [already exposes such a method](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/api/system.collections.immutable.immutablearray-1.remove?view=netcore-3.0#System_Collections_Immutable_ImmutableArray_1_Remove__0_System_Collections_Generic_IEqualityComparer__0__) and adding it to the builder doesn't seem like it would take much effort.","Url":"https://github.com/dotnet/corefx/issues/41883","RelatedDescription":"Open issue \"API Proposal: ImmutableArray<T>.Builder.Remove(T, IEqualityComparer<T>)\" (#41883)"},{"Id":"508792755","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2019-10-18T00:49:08","Actor":"danmosemsft","Number":"41882","RawContent":null,"Title":"Annotate System.Reflection.TypeExtensions for nullable references","State":"open","Body":"Contributes to #40623","Url":"https://github.com/dotnet/corefx/pull/41882","RelatedDescription":"Open PR \"Annotate System.Reflection.TypeExtensions for nullable references\" (#41882)"},{"Id":"509244000","IsPullRequest":false,"CreatedAt":"2019-10-16T01:29:49","Actor":"zehavibarak","Number":"41902","RawContent":null,"Title":"Migrate to 3.0 misleading message to reference System.Data.SqlClient","State":"open","Body":"# General\r\n\r\nMigrating to core 3.0 from 2.2 issues a message over SqlParameter `SqlParameter is now in System.Data.SqlClient`.

Or did I missed something?\r\n\r\nIn the case I am right a short check showed me that the ilcompiler doesn't support the flags and callbacks for this yet?\r\n\r\nDo I need to add this to get the GC working with multiple threads or have I looked at the wrong place?\r\n\r\nIf this the right place does it make any sense to aim for the inline version of the gc probe or can this never work with corert and the call variant is the only solution? I already checked the code and noticed that even if the inline variant can work the call needs still be implemented as it is used in more complicated cases.","Url":"https://github.com/dotnet/corert/issues/7807","RelatedDescription":"Open issue \"GC thread suspension\" (#7807)"},{"Id":"501011867","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2019-10-01T18:56:37","Actor":"Dotnet-GitSync-Bot","Number":"7806","RawContent":null,"Title":"Mirror changes from dotnet/coreclr","State":"closed","Body":"This PR contains mirrored changes from dotnet/coreclr\n\n\n**Please REBASE this PR when merging**\n\n cc @tannergooding","Url":"https://github.com/dotnet/corert/pull/7806","RelatedDescription":"Closed or merged PR \"Mirror changes from dotnet/coreclr\" (#7806)"},{"Id":"500653866","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2019-10-01T15:25:51","Actor":"Dotnet-GitSync-Bot","Number":"7805","RawContent":null,"Title":"Mirror changes from dotnet/corefx,coreclr","State":"closed","Body":"This PR contains mirrored changes from dotnet/corefx,coreclr\n\n\n**Please REBASE this PR when merging**\n\n cc @adamsitnik","Url":"https://github.com/dotnet/corert/pull/7805","RelatedDescription":"Closed or merged PR \"Mirror changes from dotnet/corefx,coreclr\" (#7805)"},{"Id":"500408911","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2019-10-01T04:22:31","Actor":"Dotnet-GitSync-Bot","Number":"7804","RawContent":null,"Title":"Mirror changes from dotnet/coreclr,corefx","State":"closed","Body":"This PR contains mirrored changes from dotnet/coreclr,corefx\n\n\n**Please REBASE this PR when merging**\n\n cc @tannergooding @Youssef1313 @safern","Url":"https://github.com/dotnet/corert/pull/7804","RelatedDescription":"Closed or merged PR \"Mirror changes from dotnet/coreclr,corefx\" (#7804)"},{"Id":"499907137","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2019-09-29T14:16:14","Actor":"MichalStrehovsky","Number":"7803","RawContent":null,"Title":"Delete ReadyToRun portions of the compiler and test tree","State":"closed","Body":"The development of the ReadyToRun compiler moved to the CoreCLR repo.

With [.NET Standard 2.0](https://devblogs.microsoft.com/dotnet/announcing-net-standard-2-0/), we tried to make it much more viable to share code between .NET Framework, .NET Core, and Xamarin which resulted in approximately 38K .NET Frameworks APIs being available in .NET Core 2.0. We also built the [Windows Compatibility Pack](https://devblogs.microsoft.com/dotnet/announcing-the-windows-compatibility-pack-for-net-core/) which made another 21K .NET Framework APIs available to .NET Core, resulting in almost 60K additional APIs. And in .NET Core 3.0 we added WPF and WinForms, which increased the number of .NET Framework APIs ported to .NET Core to over 120k, which is more than half of all .NET Framework APIs.\r\n\r\nIt’s also worth pointing out that we added about 62K APIs to .NET Core that don’t exist in .NET Framework. If we compare their total number of APIs, .NET Core has about 80% of the API surface of .NET Framework.\r\n\r\n<p align=\"center\">\r\n<img src=\"https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/5169960/66777114-f8db7c80-ee7c-11e9-9161-acfe1c491586.png\" width=\"600\" align=\"center\">\r\n</p>\r\n\r\nWe announced that the [future of .NET](https://devblogs.microsoft.com/dotnet/net-core-is-the-future-of-net/) will be based on .NET Core. And at Build 2019, [Scott Hunter stated](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZlO1utbB2GQ&t=54m20s) that AppDomains, remoting, Web Forms, WCF server, and Windows Workflow won’t be ported to .NET Core.\r\n\r\nWith .NET Core 3.0, we’re at the point where we’ve ported all technologies that are required for modern workloads, be that desktop apps, mobile apps, console apps, web sites, or cloud services. That’s not to say that we don’t have any gaps or opportunities for new technologies, but we generally believe we won’t be finding them in the .NET Framework code base anymore. Moving forward, we’re focusing our resources on incorporating new technologies.\r\n\r\nSimultaneously, we’re looking into releasing more of the [.NET Framework code base under the MIT license](https://github.com/microsoft/referencesource) on GitHub to allow the community to create OSS projects for technologies we’re not intending to bring to .NET Core. For example, there already are community projects for [CoreWF](https://github.com/UiPath/corewf) and [CoreWCF](https://github.com/CoreWCF/CoreWCF).\r\n\r\nWe’d like to thank everyone who filed issues with requests for APIs being ported. Those issues allowed us to prioritize and close the gaps that prevented people from porting to .NET Core.\r\n\r\nBut since we generally no longer plan to bring existing technologies from .NET Framework to .NET Core we’ll be closing all issues that are [labeled with port-to-core](https://github.com/dotnet/corefx/issues?utf8=%E2%9C%93&q=is%3Aissue+is%3Aopen+label%3Aport-to-core).\r\n\r\n### Discussion\r\n\r\nTo discuss this issue, please comment on the corresponding issue at https://github.com/dotnet/corefx/issues/41769.","Url":"https://github.com/dotnet/announcements/issues/130","RelatedDescription":"Open issue \".NET Core 3.0 concludes the .NET Framework API porting project\" (#130)"},{"Id":"505445666","IsPullRequest":false,"CreatedAt":"2019-10-10T18:45:56","Actor":"TaraOverfield","Number":"129","RawContent":null,"Title":"October 2019 .NET Updates","State":"open","Body":"The following .NET updates were released on October 2019.

While this is still work in progress, we'd like to give you an update on where we are.\r\n\r\nSo far, we've identified the following repos:\r\n\r\n* dotnet/**runtime**\r\n\t- Will contain [coreclr](https://github.com/dotnet/coreclr), [corefx](https://github.com/dotnet/corefx), [core-setup](https://github.com/dotnet/core-setup), [aspnet/Extensions](https://github.com/aspnet/Extensions), and some of [mono/mono](https://github.com/mono/mono)\r\n* [dotnet/**sdk**](https://github.com/dotnet/sdk)\r\n\t- Will contain [toolset](https://github.com/dotnet/toolset), [sdk](https://github.com/dotnet/sdk), [cli](https://github.com/dotnet/cli)\r\n* dotnet/**installer**\r\n\t- Renamed from [core-sdk](https://github.com/dotnet/core-sdk)\r\n* dotnet/**aspnetcore**\r\n\t- Moved from [aspnet/AspNetCore](https://github.com/aspnet/AspNetCore) and will also contain [aspnet/AspNetCore-Tooling](https://github.com/aspnet/AspNetCore-Tooling)\r\n* dotnet/**efcore**\r\n\t- Moved from [aspnet/EntityFrameworkCore](https://github.com/aspnet/EntityFrameworkCore)\r\n* [dotnet/**winforms**](https://github.com/dotnet/winforms)\r\n\t- Unchanged, but listed for clarity \r\n* [dotnet/**wpf**](https://github.com/dotnet/wpf)\r\n\t- Unchanged, but listed for clarity\r\n\r\n### Name changes\r\n\r\nYou might notice that we changed our mind on naming from our [earlier announcement][ann]. Based on your feedback, we decided to go with **dotnet/runtime** instead of **dotnet/platform** and **dotnet/sdk** instead of **dotnet/cli**.\r\n\r\nSeveral people pointed out that the previous names weren't relatable to how we talk about the product, for example on download pages. So, we decided to match the product distributions as the primary design point for the new names. We generally refer to the bits you need to run your app as *the runtime* and the bits you need to build apps as *the SDK*. This also matches the naming chosen by other platforms.\r\n\r\n### New repos can't be used for .NET Core 3.x or earlier\r\n\r\nThe consolidated repositories are going to be about .NET 5 and going forward. It will not be possible to build .NET Core 3.1 or earlier from these repositories. As such, only the master branch from each of the repositories will be brought forward. There will be no porting of the individual release branches in the source repositories.\r\n\r\n### Personal names and email addresses\r\n\r\nSince we're planning on rebasing the history in the merged repositories, we can map your name and email address to new values as well. We primarily do this to support our friends in the LGBTQ+ community who have changed their names to reflect their identities. However, anybody is welcome to use this to change their email and name.\r\n\r\nWhatever your reason might be: we value your contributions and we hope this small gesture makes your life a little bit better. So if you changed your name/email – or simply prefer us to use different values – please [submit a request](mailto:dotnet@microsoft.com&subject=.NET%20repo%20consolidation%3A%20request%20for%20name%20change&body=Hey%2C%20%0A%0AI%E2%80%99d%20like%20to%20change%20my%20email%2Fdisplay%20name%20in%20the%20consolidated%20repo%20from%20%0A%0A%20%20%20%20%20%20%20%20My%20Old%20Name%20%3Cold.me%40example.org%3E%20%0A%0Ato%20%0A%0A%20%20%20%20%20%20%20%20My%20New%20Name%20%3Cnew.me%40example.org%3E%20%0A%0AThanks%21%20%0A).\r\n\r\n### More is coming\r\n\r\nWe'll share more updates in the upcoming months.

However, this separation has led to a variety of complications for contributors and maintainers alike.  For example:\r\n- **Confusion about where issues should be opened.**  It’s not always clear in which repo an issue should be reported, complicated by the fact that some implementations actually span repositories (e.g. a type might be exposed through a reference assembly and have its tests in corefx but actually be implemented in System.Private.CoreLib in coreclr).\r\n- **Difficulty sharing source.**  System.Private.CoreLib is intricately connected to the rest of the runtime, and thus has lived with the runtime code.  That, however, means that although corefx has been intended as the place to share as much core library code as possible across any underlying runtime, we’ve needed to keep a significant body of code in System.Private.CoreLib, which then has meant it’s needed to be “mirrored” to each runtime repo (coreclr, corert, mono) that needs to consume it as source; similarly, corefx has similarly required access to much of that source, for example to use the same interop DllImports that are employed elsewhere in the runtimes.  The automatic mirror that shares this source needs to be maintained, and even when it has been, it’s often led to lag.  It’s also complicated developer processes, where to validate a change in one repo generally requires manually mirroring the code to other local repos in order to validate the change and ensure merging into one repo won’t break the others.\r\n- **PRs spanning multiple repos.**  Because the runtime, CoreLib, and the core libraries are all intricately linked, changing runtime behaviors, adding new APIs, or changing various build processes (e.g. improving static analysis) often requires multiple PRs carefully staged across time and multiple repos.  For example, to add a new method to a type like Dictionary<>, a developer must first make the source changes in her local coreclr repo and the test and reference assembly changes in her local corefx repo.  When satisfied with the fix, the developer must submit a PR to coreclr as well as a PR to corefx, the latter of which will fail.  Eventually the coreclr PR will be merged, and the changes will mirror to the other runtimes that also require the update.  Eventually those mirror PRs will be merged, and builds will be created containing the fix for each runtime.  At some point later those builds will be consumed into the corefx repo, after which point the original corefx PR can be re-validated and eventually merged.  That’s the best case; things get more complicated in situations where there are bidirectional dependencies.\r\n- **Building an installable runtime.** Self-hosting a custom built .NET requires intricate knowledge of how all the repos work and interact.  A developer can’t just clone a single repo, make a desired change, and easily produce an installer.\r\n- **Consistency.**  One goal we had for more fine-grained repos was to enable isolation and independence for teams working within each repo’s confines, but this has led to non-trivial duplication of effort on things like build systems and CI, and then the resulting lack of consistency as each system ends up diverging from the others.\r\n\r\nThe issues go beyond the runtime.  For example, the ASP.NET maintainers and community did a great job in the past year or so consolidating from ~55 repos down to ~5 repos, but that’s still more repos than is desirable, leading to similar issues as cited above for the runtime.  On top of that, these ASP.NET repositories are in the aspnet GitHub org, which adds an additional set of issues, for example:\r\n- **Complications moving issues between repos.**  If a developer opens an issue in aspnet/aspnetcore and it’s determined that the cause of the issue is actually in dotnet/corefx, there is no GitHub mechanism to enable easily moving that issue across the aspnet to dotnet organizational boundary.\r\n- **Permissions.** Each organization’s permissions end up needing to be managed and maintained separately.\r\n\r\nThe issues extend into tooling as well.  For example, we currently have multiple repositories that all logically make up the dotnet CLI, but actually creating a working installer spans multiple repos.\r\n\r\n### Plan\r\n\r\nTo address these issues, we’re planning to make some changes to our repository structure:\r\n- **dotnet/platform.**  We plan to combine dotnet/coreclr, dotnet/corefx, dotnet/corert, dotnet/core-setup, and the relevant portions of mono/mono into a new dotnet/platform repo.  Everything needed to build and produce the Microsoft.NETCore.App shared framework will be in this repo.  We will no longer suffer from the complications of source mirroring.  Features like changing runtime behavior or adding an API will no longer require a complicated dance across multiple repos.  Etc.\r\n- **dotnet/aspnetcore.**  We plan to move the existing aspnet/aspnetcore repository into the dotnet organization.  Along with that, we aim to combine a variety of the other aspnet repositories into aspnetcore, such as aspnet/blazor.  Whether repos like entityframeworkcore remain separate or combined remains an open question.  A goal is that, just as dotnet/platform will be responsible for the creation of Microsoft.NETCore.App, dotnet/aspnetcore will be responsible for the creation of Microsoft.AspNETCore.App.\r\n- **dotnet/cli.**  We plan to combine dotnet/toolset and dotnet/sdk into the dotnet/cli repo.\r\n\r\n### FAQ\r\n\r\n#### Why are we merging repos?\r\n\r\nWe believe we can significantly improve several aspects of .NET on GitHub by combining repos, benefiting both maintainers and contributors.  These improvements will manifest in a variety of ways, such as in better issue management, much easier models of contribution, and easier and faster ways to build and install the resulting bits.\r\n\r\n####  What will happen to the aspnet org?\r\n\r\nThe aspnet org as a separate entity is legacy and artificial.  In time we hope to absorb it into the dotnet org and sunset the aspnet org.\r\n\r\n#### Will the coreclr and corefx repos go away?\r\n\r\nWith the help of GitHub, we plan to migrate all issues from these repos to the new dotnet/platform repo, and then lock down creation of additional issues, such that the repos will no longer be used for issue management.  We will also inhibit the creation of PRs to the master branch, which will effectively become an archive for read-only review of history.  In this sense, these repos will be archived, and no active development will happen with them.  However, we plan to continue servicing previous .NET Core releases out of these repos, so the various release branches (e.g. release/2.1, release/3.0, etc.) will continue to see (limited) activity.\r\n\r\n#### Will the mono repo go away?\r\n\r\nNo. mono/mono contains the source for the full mono stack and will continue to live on happily.  We will simply be moving the managed source associated with System.Private.CoreLib and copying the relatively small amount of source that makes up the native mono runtime to dotnet/platform.  We may choose to then use some mirroring technology to keep the runtime copy in sync (this will, however, not suffer from the same mirroring issues we currently experience, as we would not be mirroring between two components required to build the same binaries), or we may choose to let them diverge and manually sync only those changes deemed relevant to both implementations.\r\n\r\n#### Will the corert repo go away?\r\n\r\nYes.  We plan to retire/archive the corert repo.  Some of the technology in the corert repo will be migrated to the master branch of dotnet/platform, where it will be productized as part of .NET.  Other portions of the corert repo will be migrated to feature branches of dotnet/platform, where the experimentation can continue.  In this way, we will use feature branches to continue experimenting with the corert technology, while making it easier to share portions with its shipping counterpart and also graduate functionality into master if/when it’s ready.\r\n\r\n#### Does this mean there will be a single repo for all of .NET?\r\n\r\nNo.  We will be reducing the number of repos that contribute to .NET, but currently we do not believe that going all the way down to one is the right answer.\r\n\r\n#### Doesn’t this mean that issue and PR tracking will now be overwhelming?\r\n\r\nIt is already the case that the vast majority of issues in a given repo are not relevant to any individual developer, and with several thousand open issues in each repo and on the order of a hundred open PRs in each, we already need systems (e.g. labels) to successfully manage issues and PRs.  As such, we don’t believe the merging will have a significant impact on this aspect of developer productivity.  If it turns out to have an unexpectedly large negative impact, we will work with the community to find ways to mitigate the problem.  However, there are already a multitude of successful open source projects on GitHub with at least an order of magnitude more issues.\r\n\r\n#### What will happen to existing issues?\r\n\r\nWith the help of GitHub functionality, we plan to migrate all issues from old repos (e.g. dotnet/coreclr, dotnet/corefx) to the new repos (e.g. dotnet/platform).  We may also use this as a forcing function to revisit stale issues and either close those that are no longer relevant or reinvigorate those that are demanding of more immediate attention.\r\n\r\n#### What about git history?\r\n\r\nIn general, we plan to keep history, such that history from each constituent repo will be a part of the new repo.  However, we have made some mistakes in the past (e.g. large binaries, multitudes of automated PRs for flowing bits and source between repos, etc.), and we plan to rewrite history to correct those mistakes wherever possible and impactful.  Some rough calculations suggest this could end up significantly reducing the size of the repos as well as the time it takes to clone, which should not only help developers approaching the project but also CI.  This will end up meaning that SHAs may be different in the new repo than they were in the old repo; as previously mentioned, however, any references to the old SHAs in the old repos will continue to work, as those repos will remain accessible.\r\n\r\n#### Will I still show up in the contributor list due to previous contributions?\r\n\r\nYes.  We plan to merge all such history.\r\n\r\n#### Will this break debugging with SourceLink?\r\n\r\nNo.  The existing repos will continue to be accessible, and commit SHAs there will remain unchanged.\r\n\r\n#### Might plans change?\r\n\r\nSure.  Part of the goal of posting this announcement is to hear from you, hear about additional benefits you're excited about, and hear about additional concerns we may not have considered.  We will include such ideas in our planning and course correct as necessary.\r\n\r\n## Discussion\r\n\r\nTo discuss these plans, please comment on the corresponding issue at https://github.com/dotnet/coreclr/issues/26175.\r\n","Url":"https://github.com/dotnet/announcements/issues/119","RelatedDescription":"Open issue \"Consolidating .NET GitHub repos\" (#119)"},{"Id":"470434872","IsPullRequest":false,"CreatedAt":"2019-07-19T16:54:02","Actor":"richlander","Number":"118","RawContent":null,"Title":".NET Core master branches have switched to \"5.0\"","State":"open","Body":"# .NET Core master branches have switched to \"5.0\"\r\n\r\nVarious .NET Core repos have switched their `master` branches to \"5.0\", and will use 3.x branches for 3.0 and 3.1 projects. This is very similar to how we approached 2.x and 3.0 projects. As context, `master` branches produced 3.0 builds for the entire period of the 2.2 project.\r\n\r\nAt present, this change is only relevant if you contribute to .NET Core repositories. Otherwise, we recommend that you wait for the 5.0 Preview releases before installing this new version.\r\n\r\n## Discussion\r\nPlease share your thoughts on this change and see what others are saying at:\r\n\r\n[dotnet/core #3059](https://github.com/dotnet/core/issues/3059)\r\n\r\n## Details\r\n\r\nThe following repos have moved their master branches to \"5.0\":\r\n\r\n- [dotnet/coreclr](https://github.com/dotnet/coreclr)\r\n- [dotnet/corefx](https://github.com/dotnet/corefx)\r\n- [dotnet/core-setup](https://github.com/dotnet/core-setup)\r\n\r\nYou can see that [5.0 .NET Core Runtime builds](https://github.com/dotnet/core-setup#daily-builds) are now being built and published at dotnet/core-setup.\r\n\r\nIn large part, we switched `master` to 5.0 to enable to the community to contribute changes. As the .NET Core 3.0 released has progressed, we've had to increase scrutiny on the changes we will accept. Now that we've permanently branched for 3.0, we can accept a much broader set of changes. Please consider that to be an open invitation!\r\n\r\nNotably, [dotnet/core-sdk](https://github.com/dotnet/core-sdk) is not yet producing 5.0 builds.

Every person who started a scenario successfully finished it.\r\n    - We feel this validates that we picked the right scope for a 60 minute study of people from various backgrounds\r\n* Overall people liked the new API\r\n    - Key value prop for most people was the fact that \"it's now built in\"\r\n    - Very few mentioned perf and the ones that did thought that it probably wouldn't make a difference in their scenarios.\r\n    - Most people said they would prefer `System.Text.Json` for new APIs, but would stick to JSON.NET in code that already uses it.\r\n    - **[Action]** None, this is in line with what we expected.\r\n* Virtually everyone tried to google for sample code in the documentation\r\n    - Everyone found our blog post and online documentation\r\n    - People new to .NET were confused that JSON.NET and `System.Text.Json` weren't the same thing\r\n    - Everyone complained that the current docs are lacking, especially sample code.\r\n    - **[Action]** Docs are work in progress. We plan on shipping with a fully documented API surface and sample code.\r\n* Virtually everyone found the key type relatively quickly\r\n    - Some people were confused when types were static, rather than something that one can new up\r\n    - **[Action]** None. This is by-design as we try to reduce the number of allocations.\r\n* Virtually everyone had trouble selecting the correct method on\r\n  `JsonSerializer`\r\n    - We chose a very complicated naming convention\r\n    - **[Action]** We simplified it by using names that people in the study told us were looking for.\r\n* Most of our error messages were well received because they told people what\r\n  the problem is & how they can fix them.\r\n    - One error message was unclear because we reported an unexpected character when we could have reported that we didn't expect a comment.\r\n    - **[Action]** We've reworded the error message.\r\n    - We had one error message that was generated by a lower layer and provided an action item that doesn't make sense when people receive it when using the higher layer component.\r\n    - **[Action]** We've reworded the error message to be more generic so it makes sense for both kind of consumers.\r\n* Virtually everyone used the new Roslyn completion feature which will also show\r\n  types from namespaces not imported yet.\r\n    - However, virtually nobody realized that they were doing it.\r\n    - This caused confusion when people found other APIs that happen to include Json in them, specifically the old data contract serialization.\r\n    - **[Action]** Talk to the Roslyn IDE team to see if this something more people will run into. This could prove to be especially problematic for technologies that share type names (e.g. `UserControl` in WinForms and WPF) and both are referenced by the project.\r\n* Optional parameters and `async`/`await` are usability cliffs\r\n    - Many were confused by optional parameters and tried to pass them in, even though they didn't have to.\r\n    - **[Action]** Talk to the Roslyn IDE team to see if we can visualize them better in VS.\r\n    - **[Action]** Try to avoid heavy use of optional parameters for mainline APIs.\r\n    - Async is a very steep cliff. People have no idea what to do in their code to make async work. While IntelliSense shows the usage by prefixing it with await, people didn't notice that.\r\n    - **[Action]** Unclear; this is a broader issue.\r\n* Virtually nobody used F1 to get help for APIs\r\n    - *Surprise*. I expected more people to use <kbd>F1</kbd>.\r\n* Virtually everyone used F12 to explore the API (\"metadata view\")\r\n    - *Surprise*. I expected most people to explore the type via the\r\n      IntelliSense completion\r\n* Nobody used Object Browser to explorer the APIs\r\n    - *Surprise*. I expected at least some people to.\r\n\r\n## Discussion\r\n\r\nFor a discussion, please go to https://github.com/dotnet/corefx/issues/39304.","Url":"https://github.com/dotnet/announcements/issues/117","RelatedDescription":"Open issue \"System.Text.Json usability study results\" (#117)"},{"Id":"465034831","IsPullRequest":false,"CreatedAt":"2019-07-08T03:13:38","Actor":"leecow","Number":"116","RawContent":null,"Title":"Updates to releases.json (.NET Core release metadata)","State":"open","Body":"**The changes described in this issue will be live with the .NET Core July update on 7/9/2019.**\r\n\r\nThe releases.json files (e.g. [2.2 releases.json](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dotnet/core/master/release-notes/2.2/releases.json)) are comprehensive metadata files which capture details of each .NET Core release. These files, along with the top level [releases-index.json](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dotnet/core/master/release-notes/releases-index.json), are becoming increasingly important .NET Core release assets. These files, one for each major.minor channel, are relied upon by many to detect when updates for .NET Core are available, discover security update details and other uses.\r\n\r\nChanges are sometimes necessary, and the growing dependencies require that we treat compatibility of the schema with the utmost care. This announcement describes an addition to the releases.json schema.\r\n\r\n## SDK Versions and Visual Studio\r\n\r\nBecause of current .NET Core SDK product construction dependencies, there is a hard link between the Runtime, SDK, toolset (compilers, MSBuild, NuGet, and other components), and Visual Studio. Simplistically, this means that when anything updates, everything updates. The unfortunate result of this linking is that multiple versions of the SDK are released with each monthly update for each supported versions of Visual Studio. For example, the May Update for .NET Core 2.2 included the 2.2.5 runtime, 2.2.107 SDK for Visual Studio 2017 and 2.2.204 for Visual Studio 2019 and yet another pair of SDK versions for .NET Core 2.1. An example of this is the [2.2.5 Release Notes](https://github.com/dotnet/core/blob/master/release-notes/2.2/2.2.5/2.2.5.md). \r\n\r\nThis is a confusing situation and we are working to mitigate the need to release multiple SDKs with .NET Core 3.0. The need for multiple SDK versions will persist for 2.1 LTS.\r\n\r\n## Adding the SDKS array\r\n\r\nTo appropriately model multiple SDKs per release, we are adding an SDKs array to releases.json, which will contain SDK objects. The top-level SDK object will represent the highest versioned SDK for a given update. Using the previous 2.2.5 update example, SDK 2.2.204 is in the top SDK object as well as duplicated in the SDKS array. All other applicable 2.2* SDK objects are included in the SDKS array. The SDK objects within the array will carry specific Visual Studio compatibility and version inclusion information to provide appropriate context.\r\n\r\nHere is an example of the new array based on the upcoming July update.\r\nAgain, this will be additive and the previous SDK object will include the highest SDK version for the release.\r\n\r\n```json\r\n{\r\n    \"sdk\": {\r\n        \"version\": \"2.2.301\",\r\n        \"version-display\": \"2.2.301\",\r\n        \"runtime-version\": \"2.2.6\",\r\n        \"vs-version\": \"16.1.3\",\r\n        \"vs-support\": \"Visual Studio 2019 (v16.1)\",\r\n        \"csharp-version\": \"7.3\",\r\n        \"fsharp-version\": \"4.5\",\r\n        \"vb-version\": null,\r\n        \"files\": []\r\n    },\r\n    \"sdks\": [\r\n        {\r\n            \"version\": \"2.2.301\",\r\n            \"version-display\": \"2.2.301\",\r\n            \"runtime-version\": \"2.2.6\",\r\n            \"vs-version\": \"16.1.3\",\r\n            \"vs-support\": \"Visual Studio 2019 (v16.1)\",\r\n            \"csharp-version\": \"7.3\",\r\n            \"fsharp-version\": \"4.5\",\r\n            \"vb-version\": null,\r\n            \"files\": []\r\n        },\r\n        {\r\n          \"version\": \"2.2.205\",\r\n          \"version-display\": \"2.2.205\",\r\n          \"runtime-version\": \"2.2.6\",\r\n          \"vs-version\": \"16.0.5\",\r\n          \"vs-support\": \"Visual Studio 2019 (v16.0)\",\r\n          \"csharp-version\": \"7.3\",\r\n          \"fsharp-version\": \"4.5\",\r\n          \"vb-version\": null,\r\n          \"files\": []\r\n        }\r\n    ]\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\n## vs-version and the Runtime\r\n\r\nThe same version of the runtime is included in multiple versions of Visual Studio. To account for this, the vs-version field is being updated to a comma-delimited string. The string will represent all versions of Visual Studio which first include the particular .NET Core update. Again, an example from the upcoming July Update.\r\n\r\n```json\r\n\"runtime\": {\r\n        \"version\": \"2.2.6\",\r\n        \"version-display\": \"2.2.6\",\r\n        \"vs-version\": \"15.9.13, 16.1.3, 16.2.0\",\r\n```\r\n\r\nThe same `vs-versions` changes will be seen in the `aspnetcore-runtime` object.\r\n\r\n## Future Enhancements\r\n\r\nThere are other improvements to the schema which have been suggested by the community which we are evaluating. Generally, theses enhancements are additive and should not represent compatibility compromises for existing parsers and similar announcements will be published ahead of any changes.\r\n\r\n","Url":"https://github.com/dotnet/announcements/issues/116","RelatedDescription":"Open issue \"Updates to releases.json (.NET Core release metadata)\" (#116)"},{"Id":"444065225","IsPullRequest":false,"CreatedAt":"2019-05-14T18:38:23","Actor":"TaraOverfield","Number":"114","RawContent":null,"Title":"May 2019 .NET Updates","State":"open","Body":"# May 2019 .NET Updates\r\n\r\nThe following .NET updates were released in May 2019.

Either target .NET Core 2.1 or lower, or use a version of the .NET SDK that supports .NET Core 2.2.`\r\n\r\nIf you downloaded the .NET Core SDK 2.2 between April 2 and April 12, 2019, the main [.NET downloads page](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/download/) included only 2.2.2nn. Starting April 12th, a new button marked \"Compatible with Visual Studio 2017\" is provided to target 2.2.1nn.

This article explains why this happens and how you can fix your installation.\r\n\r\nWhen Visual Studio can't find an appropriate version of the .NET Core SDK, you'll receive an error message. This may appear in the Error pane as NETSDK1045:\r\n\r\n\"The current .NET SDK does not support targeting .NET Core 2...\"\r\n\r\nYou can check what .NET Core SDKs you have on your machine with the following command:\r\n\r\n```bash\r\ndotnet --list-sdks\r\n```\r\n\r\nUnless you have a global.json file, when you use `dotnet` from the command line, the latest .NET Core SDK is used.\r\n\r\n> [TIP!] \r\n> Open a command prompt and try to build with `dotnet build`. If the command line build works, but Visual Studio doesn't suggestions in this article may help.\r\n\r\nThe last two digits of the .NET Core SDK version numbers are in the format are a patch number, which is represented by `nn` in this article because we will continue to service them to include the latest runtimes. To find out more, vist the [Overview of how .NET Core is versioned page](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/core/versions/).\r\n\r\n## Fixes for Common Problems\r\n\r\n### Visual Studio 2017 can't target .NET Core 2.2\r\n\r\nIf you receive the error message in Visual Studio 2017:\r\n\r\n`The current .NET SDK does not support targeting .NET Core 2.2… Either target .NET Core 2.1 or lower, or use a version of the .NET SDK that supports .NET Core 2.2.`\r\n\r\nUse `dotnet --list-sdks` to ensure you have .NET Core SDK 2.2.1nn. As an example, 2.2.106 would be a valid entry.\r\n\r\nIf you downloaded the .NET Core SDK 2.2 after April 2, 2019, version 2.2.2nn (such as 2.2.203) is listed first and is the highest version available. However, Visual Studio 2017 requires 2.2.1nn (such as 2.2.106). .NET Core SDK 2.2.2nn works with Visual Studio 2019. Visual Studio 2017 and Visual Studio 2019 can be installed side by side, but this requires both .NET Core SDK 2.2.1nn and .NET Core SDK 2.2.2nn to develop .NET Core 2.2 applications.\r\n\r\nTo download .NET Core SDK 2.2.2nn, visit the [.NET downloads page](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/download/dotnet-core/2.2).\r\n\r\n### Visual Studio 2017 can't target .NET Core 2.1\r\n\r\nIf you receive this error message in Visual Studio 2017:\r\n\r\n`The current .NET SDK does not support targeting .NET Core 2.1. Either target .NET Core 2.0 or lower, or use a version of the .NET SDK that supports .NET Core 2.1.`\r\n\r\nUse `dotnet --list-sdks` to ensure you have .NET Core SDK 2.1.5nn. As an example, 2.1.505 would be a valid entry. \r\n\r\nThis problem occurs of you manually uninstall the 2.1.5nn version.\r\n\r\nThe Visual Studio 2019 installation will not remove this file and Visual Studio 2017 will continue to work side by side.\r\n\r\nTo reinstall .NET Core SDK 2.1.5nn, visit the [.NET downloads page](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/download/dotnet-core/2.1).\r\n\r\n### Visual Studio 2019 can't target .NET Core 3.0 Preview\r\n\r\nIf you receive this error message in Visual Studio 2019:\r\n\r\n`The current .NET SDK does not support targeting .NET Core 2.1. Either target .NET Core 2.0 or lower, or use a version of the .NET SDK that supports .NET Core 2.1.`\r\n\r\nUse `dotnet --list-sdks` to ensure you have .NET Core SDK 3.0.100-preview... As an example, SDK 3.0.100-preview3-010431 would be a valid entry.\r\n\r\nTo install .NET Core SDK 3.0.1nn preview, visit the [.NET downloads page](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/download/dotnet-core/3.0).\r\n\r\nIn Visual Studio, go to `Tools\\Options\\Projects and Solutions\\.NET Core` and check the box `Use Previews of the .NET Core SDK`.\r\n\r\n> [NOTE!]\r\n> This option will be moving to `Tools\\Options\\Environment` and renamed `Preview Features` in Visual Studio 2019 version 16.1 Preview 2.\r\n\r\nIf you are targeting .NET Core 3.0 preview, the [C# language version will be C# 8.0 Preview by default](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/visualstudio/releases/2019/release-notes#csharp-defaults) allowing you to use new C# features.\r\n\r\n## Understand the relationship between .NET Core SDKs and Visual Studio build tools\r\n\r\nVisual Studio has its own copies of tools like MSBuild, NuGet and the compilers. If you install the .NET Core workload, it also installs the .NET Core SDK which has versions of these tools and provides tasks and targets. These two versions are built from the same repositories, but target .NET Framework and .NET Core respectively. \r\n\r\nWhen you build a .NET Core project in Visual Studio, it uses Visual Studio's copy of MSBuild, but the tasks and targets are supplied from the selected version of the .NET Core SDK. \r\n\r\nWhen you upgrade the .NET Core SDK, you get new tasks and targets. These new tasks and targets may contain features that are not supported by older versions of MSBuild. Like all of the .NET Core SDK, MSBuild is backwards compatible. It is not forwards compatible.\r\n\r\nThis generally works well, but requires a guarantee that the tasks and targets work with the MSBuild version. To ensure this, each .NET Core SDK indicates an MSBuild version range that is used by Visual Studio to determine compatibility. Versions of the .NET Core SDK that have a higher MSBuild identifier than expected are ignored by Visual Studio. In the normal case, this simply means you use the tasks and targets that were installed with your version of Visual Studio.\r\n\r\nBecause of this, you may have many versions of the .NET Core SDK on your machine and Visual Studio still fail to find one it considers appropriate. This is compounded by a poor error message, which we cannot fully correct because it is from the old version of the .NET Core SDK on your machine. Confusion is also compounded by a complex non-linear release matrix that makes it difficult to predict the right .NET Core SDK to select. We are working to improve all this. \r\n\r\n## The Visual Studio / .NET Core SDK support matrix\r\n\r\nThe last two digits of the .NET Core SDK version number are a patch number, which are represented by a `nn` in this table. You can learn more about .NET Core SDK and .NET Core Runtime versioning at the [Overview of how .NET Core is versioned page](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/core/versions/).\r\n\r\nThe following table shows which Visual Studio versions and .NET Core SDKs are compatible and how they are acquired if you are working with Visual Studio. \r\n\r\n| .NET Core SDK | .NET Core Runtime | Compatible Visual Studio | MSBuild | Notes                                     |\r\n|---------------|-------------------|--------------------------|---------|-------------------------------------------|\r\n| 2.1.5nn       | 2.1               | 2017                     | 15      | Installed as part of VS 2017 version 15.9 |\r\n| 2.1.6nn       | 2.1               | 2019                     | 16      | Installed as part of VS 2019              |\r\n| 2.2.1nn       | 2.2               | 2017                     | 15      | Installed manually                        |\r\n| 2.2.2nn       | 2.2               | 2019                     | 16      | Installed as part of VS 2019              |\r\n| 3.0.1nn       | 3.0 (Preview)     | 2019                     | 16      | Installed manually                        |\r\n\r\nVisual Studio 2017 cannot work with .NET Core SDK 2.1.6nn or 2.2.2nn.\r\n\r\nTo find out more about removing older versions of the .NET Core Runtime and .NET Core SDK, visit the [How to remove the .NET Core Runtime and SDK page](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/core/versions/remove-runtime-sdk-versions?tabs=macos).\r\n\r\nTo download the .NET Core SDK, visit the [.NET downloads page](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/download/dotnet-core).","Url":"https://github.com/dotnet/announcements/issues/108","RelatedDescription":"Open issue \".NET Core SDK 2.2.2nn and 2.1.6nn do not work with Visual Studio 2017\" (#108)"},{"Id":"432081093","IsPullRequest":false,"CreatedAt":"2019-04-11T15:16:43","Actor":"KathleenDollard","Number":"107","RawContent":null,"Title":"Limit DotNetCliToolReference Tools to .NET Core 2.2 and Below","State":"open","Body":"# Limit DotNetCliToolReference Tools to .NET Core 2.2 and Below\r\n\r\n.NET Core 3 takes the next step in the .NET Core tool strategy with local tools.

You can now access local tools via `dotnet <toolname>`.\r\n\r\nDotNetCliToolReference tools have a flaw in how their dependencies are restored which can create [difficult to diagnose bugs when running these tools](https://github.com/NuGet/Home/issues/5067). This issue would occur much more frequently if targeting .NET Core 3.0 was allowed. Restricting tools to target only .NET Core 2.2 and below means existing scenarios to continue to work (as well as they previously did), regardless of the framework version targeted by the project or the current .NET Core SDK. \r\n\r\nThe new .NET Core tool strategy avoids this flaw in restore strategy and offers other benefits, like the ability to author one type of tool and install it in different ways depending on project and user needs.\r\n\r\nWe look forward to your feedback on .NET Core Local Tools, and on challenges you face moving away from DotNetCliToolReference tools. \r\n\r\n[dotnet/sdk #3057](https://github.com/dotnet/sdk/pull/3057)","Url":"https://github.com/dotnet/announcements/issues/107","RelatedDescription":"Open issue \"Limit DotNetCliToolReference Tools to .NET Core 2.2 and Below\" (#107)"},{"Id":"431012407","IsPullRequest":false,"CreatedAt":"2019-04-09T14:51:18","Actor":"MichaelSimons","Number":"106","RawContent":null,"Title":".NET Core SDK container images now contain the Visual Studio 2019 toolset","State":"open","Body":"# .NET Core SDK container images now contain the Visual Studio 2019 toolset\r\n\r\n.NET Core SDK container images now include Visual Studio 2019 tools.

There are two primary reasons for this change:\r\n\r\n* Syndicate Microsoft-provided container images to multiple registries, like Docker Hub and Red Hat.\r\n* Use Microsoft Azure as a global CDN for delivering Microsoft-provided container images.\r\n\r\nYou will use and see MCR as a storage back-end for Microsoft images. The primary way you learn about Microsoft container images and tags will be through a registry, which for most users will continue to be Docker Hub. Most of the experience you've had browsing for .NET Core container images will continue unchanged with this new model. The Docker Hub URLs you've used for Microsoft repos will continue to work, and forward to updated locations on Docker Hub. Existing Docker Hub will images will be maintained as-is.\r\n\r\nSee [.NET Core Container Images now Published to Microsoft Container Registry](https://devblogs.microsoft.com/dotnet/net-core-container-images-now-published-to-microsoft-container-registry/) for the most updated information on our use of MCR.\r\n\r\n## Discussion\r\nPlease share your thoughts on this change and see what others are saying at:\r\n\r\n* [dotnet-docker #935](https://github.com/dotnet/dotnet-docker/issues/935)\r\n\r\n## Starting with .NET Core nightly repo\r\n\r\nOn the .NET team, we started our [transition to MCR](https://github.com/dotnet/dotnet-docker/issues/745) with the .NET Core \"nightly\" repo. [dotnet-nightly](dockerhub.com/r/microsoft/dotnet-nightly) is now hosted on MCR and syndicated to Docker Hub. We started with the nightly repo in order to discover and fix any challenges we found with this new model before we move our higher-traffic primary container repository.\r\n\r\nWe will start publishing [dotnet](dockerhub.com/r/microsoft/dotnet) to MCR a bit later, in either February or March. This issue will be updated when that happens.\r\n\r\n## Repo Split\r\n\r\nThe [.NET Core repo](https://hub.docker.com/r/microsoft/dotnet) currently includes 4 major categories of tags: \r\n\r\n* `sdk`\r\n* `aspnetcore-runtime`\r\n* `runtime` \r\n* `runtime-deps`\r\n\r\nProviding all of the tags in one place has helped with discoverability but made for a repo with an enormous README that can be challenging to navigate and consume. It is large enough that we exceeded Docker Hub README limits and had to artificially make it smaller.\r\n\r\nGoing forward, we will provide a repo for each of the tag categories listed above. We'll also provide a \"product repo\" that will hierarchicaly group all of our repos together. This will satisfy discoverability needs so that it will be easy to find the tags you want.\r\n\r\nYou can already see this experience with [microsoft-dotnet-core-nightly](https://hub.docker.com/_/microsoft-dotnet-core-nightly). There are now multiple repos for our nightly builds:\r\n\r\n* [.NET Core Nightly product repo](https://hub.docker.com/_/microsoft-dotnet-core-nightly)\r\n* [.NET Core SDK Nightly repo](https://hub.docker.com/_/microsoft-dotnet-core-nightly-sdk/)\r\n* [.NET Core ASP.NET Core Nightly repo](https://hub.docker.com/_/microsoft-dotnet-core-nightly-aspnet/)\r\n* [.NET Core Runtime Nightly repo](https://hub.docker.com/_/microsoft-dotnet-core-nightly-runtime/)\r\n* [.NET Core Runtime-deps Nightly repo](https://hub.docker.com/_/microsoft-dotnet-core-nightly-runtime-deps/)\r\n\r\nThe same split will exist for the non-nightly stable repo (currently hosted at  [microsoft/dotnet](https://hub.docker.com/r/microsoft/dotnet)) when we start publishing it to MCR and syndicating it back to DockerHub.\r\n\r\n## Changes to registry URL\r\n\r\nThe biggest change is that your Dockerfiles need to be updated to point to the MCR registry in order get access to new .NET Core container tags. The same change is required for scripts or human operations that pull images via `docker pull`.\r\n\r\nThe following example shows the registry path, repo and tag for the .NET Core 2.2 \"Nightly\" SDK on MCR:\r\n\r\n```console\r\nmcr.microsoft.com/dotnet/core-nightly/sdk:2.2\r\n```\r\n\r\nAs comparison, the following repo and tag have been used to date for the .NET Core 2.2 \"Nightly\" SDK on Docker Hub:\r\n\r\n```console\r\nmicrosoft/dotnet-nightly:2.2-sdk\r\n```\r\n\r\nThe new repo URL is provided at each of the news repos. For example, the new .NET Core SDK \"nightly\" repo provides a box on the right where you can copy and paste the correct MCR-based repo syntax that you can use for `docker pull` or in `FROM` statements in your Dockerfiles.\r\n\r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/2608468/52811702-95c5eb80-304a-11e9-8de8-e6ea1f4b4d75.png)\r\n\r\n## Servicing existing Docker Hub tags\r\n\r\nWe will continue to service existing non-version-specific or floating tags on Docker Hub while the associated .NET Core version is supported. For example the `microsoft/dotnet:2.1-sdk` tag is a floating tag that will continue to be serviced for the lifetime of .NET Core 2.1. You can continue using floating tags without issue.\r\n\r\nIf you use non-floating tags, like `microsoft/dotnet:2.1.504-sdk-alpine`, then you will need to update your Dockerfile to use a new non-floating tag. No new non-floating tags will be published to `microsoft/dotnet` and `microsoft/dotnet-nightly` after we fully transition to MCR.\r\n\r\n.NET Core 3.0 Preview 3 and later will only be made available on MCR.\r\n\r\n## Microsoft is a Verified Publisher\r\n\r\nUntil now, Microsoft-provided container images were considered \"community images\". As part of this change, we are re-classifying Microsoft as a \"verified publisher\" on Docker Hub. This designation should make it clearer that .NET and other Microsoft-provided images are coming from a verified source.
