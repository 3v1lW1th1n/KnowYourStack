Some were wrapped around null, some were wrapped around things that had no hold on the handle in question. There is also no need to `HandleRef` things you're deleting in `Dispose()`. The idea behind `HandleRef` is to ensure that you don't get finalized during a P/Invoke invocation. Some of the ones I left in with the method moves can likely be removed with a bit more rationaliztion/thinking. I just killed ones that were fairly obvious.\r\n\r\nWhen I needed `HandleRef` overrides I manually wrote wrappers for `IntPtr` exports.

When we get windows messages (`WM_*`) we create event classes and jump through a lot of hoops that would not be necessary in a closed system.\r\n\r\nFor one example, getting a `WM_ERASEBKGND` often ends up being a `FillRect` on the passed in `HDC`.  We could potentially avoid a lot of hoop jumping some allocations if we knew the `OnPaintBackground` was completely under our control.\r\n\r\nWe would pay up front for this sort of check, but could potentially earn it back quite quickly. The following code takes a couple of milliseconds on class creation:\r\n\r\n``` C#\r\nType type = GetType();\r\n_isTypeInAssembly = type.Assembly == typeof(Control).Assembly;\r\n\r\n_isOnPaintBackgroundLocal = _isTypeInAssembly\r\n    || type.GetMethod(\r\n        \"OnPaintBackground\",\r\n        BindingFlags.NonPublic | BindingFlags.Instance,\r\n        null,\r\n        new Type[] { typeof(PaintEventArgs) }, null\r\n             ).DeclaringType.Assembly == typeof(Control).Assembly;\r\n```\r\n\r\nIf we find measurable situations where we go \"if only we knew this wasn't customized\" this may be a strategy to attempt.","Url":"https://github.com/dotnet/winforms/issues/1441","RelatedDescription":"Open issue \"Consider using reflection to optimize code paths in stock scenarios\" (#1441)"},{"Id":"471157365","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2019-07-22T15:20:55","Actor":"hughbe","Number":"1439","RawContent":null,"Title":"Add CodeDomComponentSerializationService tests and fix some bugs","State":"open","Body":"\n\n###### Microsoft Reviewers: [Open in CodeFlow](http://wpcp.azurewebsites.net/CodeFlowProtocolProxy2.php?pullrequest=https://github.com/dotnet/winforms/pull/1439)","Url":"https://github.com/dotnet/winforms/pull/1439","RelatedDescription":"Open PR \"Add CodeDomComponentSerializationService tests and fix some bugs\" (#1439)"},{"Id":"471059145","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2019-07-22T12:37:40","Actor":"hughbe","Number":"1438","RawContent":null,"Title":"Rename control.ime.cs to match guidelines","State":"closed","Body":"\n\n###### Microsoft Reviewers: [Open in CodeFlow](http://wpcp.azurewebsites.net/CodeFlowProtocolProxy2.php?pullrequest=https://github.com/dotnet/winforms/pull/1438)","Url":"https://github.com/dotnet/winforms/pull/1438","RelatedDescription":"Closed or merged PR \"Rename control.ime.cs to match guidelines\" (#1438)"},{"Id":"471051449","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2019-07-22T11:51:41","Actor":"hughbe","Number":"1437","RawContent":null,"Title":"Consolidate and cleanup pinvokes for loading libraries/dlls","State":"open","Body":"\n\n###### Microsoft Reviewers: [Open in CodeFlow](http://wpcp.azurewebsites.net/CodeFlowProtocolProxy2.php?pullrequest=https://github.com/dotnet/winforms/pull/1437)","Url":"https://github.com/dotnet/winforms/pull/1437","RelatedDescription":"Open PR \"Consolidate and cleanup pinvokes for loading libraries/dlls\" (#1437)"}],"ResultType":"GitHubIssue"}},"RunOn":"2019-07-25T05:31:02.6933762Z","RunDurationInMilliseconds":1290}
