Watch console.log reports on number of button on which dragenter/dragleave event was triggered - for buttons 3-5 the number might be incorrect. The bug sometimes needs a few drags before it triggers. \r\n\r\n### What is expected?\r\nFirst dragenter/dragleave event triggering inside the dragged element should trigger only on the element that is being dragged (unless the pointer moves over another element).\r\n\r\n### What is actually happening?\r\n**Dragenter** and **dragleave** events are triggered on an incorrect (i.e. **preceding sibling**) element from **v-for** loop **together with or instead of** the events of the actually dragged element (DragTarget). The problem seems to be related to v-for specifically, I haven’t encountered it on non-v-for’ed elements. It appears on Chrome only.\r\n\r\nBug behavior is erratic. There are 5 elements rendered with v-for:\r\n\r\n1) The problem does not always occur on the first drag\r\n\r\n2) Buttons 1 and 2 always work fine\r\n\r\n3) Button 3 sometimes works fine and sometimes does not trigger any dragenter/dragleave event at all\r\n\r\n4) Buttons 4 and 5:\r\n\r\n  a.\tsometimes work fine (rarely),\r\n\r\n  b.\tsometimes they trigger events only on the preceding element (eg dragging No 4 triggers dragenter/leave on No 3)\r\n\r\n  c.\tsometimes they trigger events on both the dragged element and the preceding element. In such case the order is: 1) PrecedingSibling.DragEnter 2) DragTarget.DragEnter 3) PrecedingSibling.DragLeave 4) DragTarget.DragLeave\r\n\r\n  d.\tHowever, if you start the drag and don’t move the pointer outside of the DragTarget the bug is **very unlikely** to occur! If it occurs it never triggers PrecedingSibling only, it triggers both elements: 1) PrecedingSibling.DragEnter 2) DragTarget.DragEnter 3) PrecedingSibling.DragLeave (the latter is therefore not connected with DragTarget.DragLeave, but happens automatically regardless) \r\n\r\n  e.\tOn the other hand, if you move the pointer out of the element immediately after drag start, the bug is very likely to occur.\r\n\r\n  f.\tWhen the dragenter is triggered on the DragTarget again, i.e. when you move the pointer out of the element and come back into it – the sibling event is not triggered anymore, just on the very beginning of the drag.\r\n\r\nBug is present on all 3 versions of Vue in js fiddle and on Vue 2.6.10 in my project.\r\n\r\n---\r\nThis is the same problem as was submitted in unresolved issue **#4479**. I can reproduce the behavior from the jsfiddle mentioned in #4479 on my PC. I hope this submission can shed some more light on the problem, because I noticed some more nuances.\r\n\r\nBug behavior on my local project (Vue 2.6.10) is slightly different than the one from my fiddle described above. The setup is slightly different as well (v-for is used on components which have some nested divs in them). Bug behavior:\r\n\r\n1) The problem does not always occur on the first drag\r\n\r\n2) Once the problem occurs for the first time it occurs on every consecutive drag – except for element no 2 which can behave correctly again.\r\n\r\n3) Dragging element triggers dragenter/dragleave triggers on both the dragged element and on the preceding v-for sibling (sibling first) or just on the preceding sibling. When the dragenter is triggered on the DragTarget again, i.e. when you move the pointer on the child div or when you leave the element and come back into it – the sibling event is not triggered anymore, just on the beginning of the drag.\r\n\r\nThe difference between js fiddle and local behavior is mainly (but not only) frequency of particular behaviors. On the local setup:\r\n\r\na. second v-for element is also affected, although can react correctly sometimes (in fiddle second is not affected),\r\n\r\nb. third element very rarely ignores the drag (in fiddle it is much more frequent)\r\n\r\nc. starting from third element rendered by v-for, once the bug occurs, it will occur every time (although will still randomly oscillate between triggering on preceding sibling only or two elements together),\r\n\r\nd. the fact of not moving the cursor out of the DragTarget does not prevent the bug from happening (in contrary to jsfiddle description point 4.d ). This might be caused by children divs?\r\n\r\nProblem occurs on my two computers (Win7 HP and Win7 Professional), only on Chrome (74.0.3729.157). Mozilla and IE work fine. On one of the computers I removed Chrome with all extensions and history and reinstalled it. The problem persisted. Kaspersky’s Chrome extension is unfortunately automatically loaded on Chrome install, though not activated. Turning off Kaspersky on Windows did not prevent the extension from loading, and I don’t know how to prevent it other than uninstalling Kaspersky which I’d rather not do. Removing the Kaspersky’s extension from Chrome does not change the situation though.\r\n\r\nPS. This is my second submission of this issue. Previous was closed by the bot, because I used \"reference in new issue\" option from my comment to #4479. I thought that linking them this way would be more useful than going through the template. Please consider adding explicit clarification on how to submit issues \"reopening\" previously closed issues  and/or a issue reference field to the template. I read the documentation, but didnt find it. Sorry for inconvenience.\r\n\r\n<!-- generated by vue-issues.

Create an element with `type` attribute set to either `checkbox` or `radio`.\r\n2. Call `preventDefault` on the `click` event (or just set `@click.prevent`)\r\n3. Set the `checked` value synchronously to a different value\r\n\r\n### What is expected?\r\nNew value that is set should be reflected in the rendered markup.\r\n\r\n### What is actually happening?\r\nThe result of the value changing is not reflected in the in the rendered state even though the value is actually changed based on what is shown in Vue dev tools.\r\n\r\n---\r\nThis worked prior to `2.6.0` and I can not find any documentation indicating the behavior changed or why it would change.  In the reproduction link you can comment out the `2.6.0` version and uncomment the line above it with `2.5.22`.  On `2.5.22` it works as expected.\r\n\r\nI have been using this previously when wrapping an input with a styled alternative with additional markup/styling.  The purpose of having `preventDefault` is to allow the decision of the value change to be made in a location other than the checkbox itself.  For example, we could easily display a dialog box when the user clicks this and then when it is closed set the state based on the response.  Removing `preventDefault` causes the checkbox to toggle.  If this happens but we want to wait until a later time to set the state, the desired state is not reflected properly until that time.  Some cases, no async work is done and it is desirable to change state immediately.  In those cases, a simple `v-model` can be used with the same exact component.\r\n\r\nA dialog box is just one example, I also have cases where there is an network call before the actual state is changed.  (one style is a toggle slider for example but i have other styled inputs as well)\r\n\r\n<!-- generated by vue-issues.

This is overkill for ssr performance and is being flagged as a CPU consuming process in the node profiler. \r\nI have managed to double the number of requests per second my ssr app can handle just by using memoization on the gettersProxy object creation.

Plugins _alter_ an existing store / module, modules provide some completed state based functionality. \r\n\r\nTherefore it can often be the case where a reusable and freely distributed module is desirable (e.g. to include in multiple projects or multiple component libraries). \r\n\r\nAt the moment Vuex's documentation strikes a surprising balance of brevity and coverage (although in my opinion plugins could use some more expansion). However, the mention of how to make and distribute vuex modules is completely absent. \r\n\r\nSince Vue and the Vue ecosystem has lowered the barrier to entry to web development, not using Vue has complete coverage of the nuances of JavaScript and the many core libraries that help it work on the web (e.g. Babel)\r\n\r\nThus it would be relevant and beneficial to provide a complete example (even if it is minimal) of how to make a truly reusable module.\r\n\r\n\r\n### What does the proposed API look like?\r\nI would consider something simplistic (e.g. the counter app). However, I would suggest 2  modifications:\r\n\r\n1. an async / await version (as this can cause trouble with bundling)\r\n2. a typescript variant\r\n\r\n```js\r\n// reusable module\r\n\r\nconst state = () => ({\r\n  count: 0,\r\n  delay: 500\r\n})\r\n\r\nconst getters = {\r\n\r\n}\r\n\r\nconst actions = {\r\n  async updateCount({state, commit}, byHowMuch) {\r\n    let newCount = await setTimeout( () => state.count   byHowMuch, state.delay)\r\n    commit('setCount', newCount)\r\n  }\r\n}\r\n\r\nconst mutations = {\r\n  setCount(state, amount) {\r\n    state.count = amount\r\n  }\r\n}\r\n\r\n\r\nexport {namespaced:true, state, mutations, actions, getters}\r\n```\r\n\r\n\r\nthen provide the configuration file for how to use rollup and deploy to npm / yarn \r\n\r\n\r\nthen provide how to incorporate with nuxt\r\n\r\n\r\n```\r\n// <nuxt-project>/store/AsyncCountModule/index.js\r\nimport AsyncCountModule from 'AsyncCountModule'\r\n\r\nexport AsyncCountModule //<-- this doesnt work \r\n```\r\n\r\n<!-- generated by vue-issues.
