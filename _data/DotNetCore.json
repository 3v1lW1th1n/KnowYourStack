However, this separation has led to a variety of complications for contributors and maintainers alike.  For example:\r\n- **Confusion about where issues should be opened.**  It’s not always clear in which repo an issue should be reported, complicated by the fact that some implementations actually span repositories (e.g. a type might be exposed through a reference assembly and have its tests in corefx but actually be implemented in System.Private.CoreLib in coreclr).\r\n- **Difficulty sharing source.**  System.Private.CoreLib is intricately connected to the rest of the runtime, and thus has lived with the runtime code.  That, however, means that although corefx has been intended as the place to share as much core library code as possible across any underlying runtime, we’ve needed to keep a significant body of code in System.Private.CoreLib, which then has meant it’s needed to be “mirrored” to each runtime repo (coreclr, corert, mono) that needs to consume it as source; similarly, corefx has similarly required access to much of that source, for example to use the same interop DllImports that are employed elsewhere in the runtimes.  The automatic mirror that shares this source needs to be maintained, and even when it has been, it’s often led to lag.  It’s also complicated developer processes, where to validate a change in one repo generally requires manually mirroring the code to other local repos in order to validate the change and ensure merging into one repo won’t break the others.\r\n- **PRs spanning multiple repos.**  Because the runtime, CoreLib, and the core libraries are all intricately linked, changing runtime behaviors, adding new APIs, or changing various build processes (e.g. improving static analysis) often requires multiple PRs carefully staged across time and multiple repos.  For example, to add a new method to a type like Dictionary<>, a developer must first make the source changes in her local coreclr repo and the test and reference assembly changes in her local corefx repo.  When satisfied with the fix, the developer must submit a PR to coreclr as well as a PR to corefx, the latter of which will fail.  Eventually the coreclr PR will be merged, and the changes will mirror to the other runtimes that also require the update.  Eventually those mirror PRs will be merged, and builds will be created containing the fix for each runtime.  At some point later those builds will be consumed into the corefx repo, after which point the original corefx PR can be re-validated and eventually merged.  That’s the best case; things get more complicated in situations where there are bidirectional dependencies.\r\n- **Building an installable runtime.** Self-hosting a custom built .NET requires intricate knowledge of how all the repos work and interact.  A developer can’t just clone a single repo, make a desired change, and easily produce an installer.\r\n- **Consistency.**  One goal we had for more fine-grained repos was to enable isolation and independence for teams working within each repo’s confines, but this has led to non-trivial duplication of effort on things like build systems and CI, and then the resulting lack of consistency as each system ends up diverging from the others.\r\n\r\nThe issues go beyond the runtime.  For example, the ASP.NET maintainers and community did a great job in the past year or so consolidating from ~55 repos down to ~5 repos, but that’s still more repos than is desirable, leading to similar issues as cited above for the runtime.  On top of that, these ASP.NET repositories are in the aspnet GitHub org, which adds an additional set of issues, for example:\r\n- **Complications moving issues between repos.**  If a developer opens an issue in aspnet/aspnetcore and it’s determined that the cause of the issue is actually in dotnet/corefx, there is no GitHub mechanism to enable easily moving that issue across the aspnet to dotnet organizational boundary.\r\n- **Permissions.** Each organization’s permissions end up needing to be managed and maintained separately.\r\n\r\nThe issues extend into tooling as well.  For example, we currently have multiple repositories that all logically make up the dotnet CLI, but actually creating a working installer spans multiple repos.\r\n\r\n### Plan\r\n\r\nTo address these issues, we’re planning to make some changes to our repository structure:\r\n- **dotnet/platform.**  We plan to combine dotnet/coreclr, dotnet/corefx, dotnet/corert, dotnet/core-setup, and the relevant portions of mono/mono into a new dotnet/platform repo.  Everything needed to build and produce the Microsoft.NETCore.App shared framework will be in this repo.  We will no longer suffer from the complications of source mirroring.  Features like changing runtime behavior or adding an API will no longer require a complicated dance across multiple repos.  Etc.\r\n- **dotnet/aspnetcore.**  We plan to move the existing aspnet/aspnetcore repository into the dotnet organization.  Along with that, we aim to combine a variety of the other aspnet repositories into aspnetcore, such as aspnet/blazor.  Whether repos like entityframeworkcore remain separate or combined remains an open question.  A goal is that, just as dotnet/platform will be responsible for the creation of Microsoft.NETCore.App, dotnet/aspnetcore will be responsible for the creation of Microsoft.AspNETCore.App.\r\n- **dotnet/cli.**  We plan to combine dotnet/toolset and dotnet/sdk into the dotnet/cli repo.\r\n\r\n## To discuss these plans, please comment on the corresponding issue at https://github.com/dotnet/coreclr/issues/26175.\r\n\r\n### FAQ\r\n\r\n#### Why are we merging repos?\r\n\r\nWe believe we can significantly improve several aspects of .NET on GitHub by combining repos, benefiting both maintainers and contributors.  These improvements will manifest in a variety of ways, such as in better issue management, much easier models of contribution, and easier and faster ways to build and install the resulting bits.\r\n\r\n####  What will happen to the aspnet org?\r\n\r\nThe aspnet org as a separate entity is legacy and artificial.  In time we hope to absorb it into the dotnet org and sunset the aspnet org.\r\n\r\n#### Will the coreclr and corefx repos go away?\r\n\r\nWith the help of GitHub, we plan to migrate all issues from these repos to the new dotnet/platform repo, and then lock down creation of additional issues, such that the repos will no longer be used for issue management.  We will also inhibit the creation of PRs to the master branch, which will effectively become an archive for read-only review of history.  In this sense, these repos will be archived, and no active development will happen with them.  However, we plan to continue servicing previous .NET Core releases out of these repos, so the various release branches (e.g. release/2.1, release/3.0, etc.) will continue to see (limited) activity.\r\n\r\n#### Will the mono repo go away?\r\n\r\nNo. mono/mono contains the source for the full mono stack and will continue to live on happily.  We will simply be moving the managed source associated with System.Private.CoreLib and copying the relatively small amount of source that makes up the native mono runtime to dotnet/platform.  We may choose to then use some mirroring technology to keep the runtime copy in sync (this will, however, not suffer from the same mirroring issues we currently experience, as we would not be mirroring between two components required to build the same binaries), or we may choose to let them diverge and manually sync only those changes deemed relevant to both implementations.\r\n\r\n#### Will the corert repo go away?\r\n\r\nYes.  We plan to retire/archive the corert repo.  Some of the technology in the corert repo will be migrated to the master branch of dotnet/platform, where it will be productized as part of .NET.  Other portions of the corert repo will be migrated to feature branches of dotnet/platform, where the experimentation can continue.  In this way, we will use feature branches to continue experimenting with the corert technology, while making it easier to share portions with its shipping counterpart and also graduate functionality into master if/when it’s ready.\r\n\r\n#### Does this mean there will be a single repo for all of .NET?\r\n\r\nNo.  We will be reducing the number of repos that contribute to .NET, but currently we do not believe that going all the way down to one is the right answer.\r\n\r\n#### Doesn’t this mean that issue and PR tracking will now be overwhelming?\r\n\r\nIt is already the case that the vast majority of issues in a given repo are not relevant to any individual developer, and with several thousand open issues in each repo and on the order of a hundred open PRs in each, we already need systems (e.g. labels) to successfully manage issues and PRs.  As such, we don’t believe the merging will have a significant impact on this aspect of developer productivity.  If it turns out to have an unexpectedly large negative impact, we will work with the community to find ways to mitigate the problem.  However, there are already a multitude of successful open source projects on GitHub with at least an order of magnitude more issues.\r\n\r\n#### What will happen to existing issues?\r\n\r\nWith the help of GitHub functionality, we plan to migrate all issues from old repos (e.g. dotnet/coreclr, dotnet/corefx) to the new repos (e.g. dotnet/platform).  We may also use this as a forcing function to revisit stale issues and either close those that are no longer relevant or reinvigorate those that are demanding of more immediate attention.\r\n\r\n#### What about git history?\r\n\r\nIn general, we plan to keep history, such that history from each constituent repo will be a part of the new repo.  However, we have made some mistakes in the past (e.g. large binaries, multitudes of automated PRs for flowing bits and source between repos, etc.), and we plan to rewrite history to correct those mistakes wherever possible and impactful.  Some rough calculations suggest this could end up significantly reducing the size of the repos as well as the time it takes to clone, which should not only help developers approaching the project but also CI.  This will end up meaning that SHAs may be different in the new repo than they were in the old repo; as previously mentioned, however, any references to the old SHAs in the old repos will continue to work, as those repos will remain accessible.\r\n\r\n#### Will I still show up in the contributor list due to previous contributions?\r\n\r\nYes.  We plan to merge all such history.\r\n\r\n#### Will this break debugging with SourceLink?\r\n\r\nNo.  The existing repos will continue to be accessible, and commit SHAs there will remain unchanged.\r\n\r\n#### Might plans change?\r\n\r\nSure.  Part of the goal of posting this announcement is to hear from you, hear about additional benefits you're excited about, and hear about additional concerns we may not have considered.  We will include such ideas in our planning and course correct as necessary."}],"ResultType":"GitHubEvent"},"CoreCLR":{"Events":[{"Id":"10350652061","Type":"PullRequestEvent","CreatedAt":"2019-09-05T03:44:13","Actor":"AArnott","Repository":"dotnet/coreclr","Organization":"dotnet","RawContent":null,"RelatedAction":"opened","RelatedUrl":"https://github.com/dotnet/coreclr/pull/26521","RelatedDescription":"Opened pull request \"Update null ref annotation for object.Equals(object?)\" (#26521) at dotnet/coreclr","RelatedBody":"The `object.Equals(object)` method accepts a null argument, but if the method returns `true`, it's a guarantee to the caller that the argument is *not* null, since an instance can never be equal to a null reference.

Turns out, C# ordering of mathematical operations has multiplication first before bit-shifts, but we want to do bit-shifts first.  Also, rename the constant to fix transpose error: Base46 -> Base64.\r\n\r\n## Customer Impact\r\n\r\nThe bug was customer-reported where the user was unable to return a 3.5MB byte[] from a controller's action within an aspnet app. Effectively, trying to write a byte[] as Base64-encoded string that is > 2.5MB wouldn't work, which falls within the \"reasonable\" size for binary payload. The actual token size limit was intended to be ~125 MB, which customers have not run up against (this limitation is due to the way `Utf8JsonWriter` is implemented). Direct users of the `Utf8JsonWriter` have a sub-optimal workaround for this bug, where they could explicitly encode the byte[] to Base64 string themselves, and pass that to `Utf8JsonWriter.WriteString()`. However, most folks would hit this via the JsonSerializer or from within an asp.net app, where they may not be able to modify their object model from byte[] to string (encoding to base64 up-front themselves), and there is no workaround for them.\r\n\r\n```text\r\nArgumentException: The JSON value of length 3145728 is too large and not supported.\r\nSystem.Text.Json.ThrowHelper.ThrowArgumentException_ValueTooLarge(int tokenLength)\r\nSystem.Text.Json.Utf8JsonWriter.WriteBase64StringValue(ReadOnlySpan<byte> bytes)\r\nSystem.Text.Json.Serialization.Converters.JsonConverterByteArray.Write(Utf8JsonWriter writer, byte[] value, JsonSerializerOptions options)\r\nSystem.Text.Json.JsonPropertyInfoNotNullable<TClass, TDeclaredProperty, TRuntimeProperty, TConverter>.OnWrite(ref WriteStackFrame current, Utf8JsonWriter writer)\r\nSystem.Text.Json.JsonPropertyInfo.Write(ref WriteStack state, Utf8JsonWriter writer)\r\nSystem.Text.Json.JsonSerializer.Write(Utf8JsonWriter writer, int originalWriterDepth, int flushThreshold, JsonSerializerOptions options, ref WriteStack state)\r\nSystem.Text.Json.JsonSerializer.WriteAsyncCore(Stream utf8Json, object value, Type type, JsonSerializerOptions options, CancellationToken cancellationToken)\r\nMicrosoft.AspNetCore.Mvc.Formatters.SystemTextJsonOutputFormatter.WriteResponseBodyAsync(OutputFormatterWriteContext context, Encoding selectedEncoding)\r\nMicrosoft.AspNetCore.Mvc.Formatters.SystemTextJsonOutputFormatter.WriteResponseBodyAsync(OutputFormatterWriteContext context, Encoding selectedEncoding)\r\nMicrosoft.AspNetCore.Mvc.Infrastructure.ResourceInvoker.<InvokeNextResultFilterAsync>g__Awaited|29_0<TFilter, TFilterAsync>(ResourceInvoker invoker, Task lastTask, State next, Scope scope, object state, bool isCompleted)\r\nMicrosoft.AspNetCore.Mvc.Infrastructure.ResourceInvoker.Rethrow(ResultExecutedContextSealed context)\r\nMicrosoft.AspNetCore.Mvc.Infrastructure.ResourceInvoker.ResultNext<TFilter, TFilterAsync>(ref State next, ref Scope scope, ref object state, ref bool isCompleted)\r\nMicrosoft.AspNetCore.Mvc.Infrastructure.ResourceInvoker.InvokeResultFilters()\r\nMicrosoft.AspNetCore.Mvc.Infrastructure.ResourceInvoker.<InvokeNextResourceFilter>g__Awaited|24_0(ResourceInvoker invoker, Task lastTask, State next, Scope scope, object state, bool isCompleted)\r\nMicrosoft.AspNetCore.Mvc.Infrastructure.ResourceInvoker.Rethrow(ResourceExecutedContextSealed context)\r\nMicrosoft.AspNetCore.Mvc.Infrastructure.ResourceInvoker.Next(ref State next, ref Scope scope, ref object state, ref bool isCompleted)\r\nMicrosoft.AspNetCore.Mvc.Infrastructure.ResourceInvoker.InvokeFilterPipelineAsync()\r\nMicrosoft.AspNetCore.Mvc.Infrastructure.ResourceInvoker.<InvokeAsync>g__Logged|17_1(ResourceInvoker invoker)\r\nMicrosoft.AspNetCore.Routing.EndpointMiddleware.<Invoke>g__AwaitRequestTask|6_0(Endpoint endpoint, Task requestTask, ILogger logger)\r\nMicrosoft.AspNetCore.Authorization.AuthorizationMiddleware.Invoke(HttpContext context)\r\nMicrosoft.AspNetCore.Diagnostics.DeveloperExceptionPageMiddleware.Invoke(HttpContext context)\r\n```\r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/6527137/64230746-7f766480-cea2-11e9-80ac-5b2586980d1a.png)\r\n\r\n\r\n## Regression?\r\n\r\nNo.\r\n\r\n## Risk\r\n\r\n`Utf8JsonWriter.WriteBase64String(...)` breaks. Given how isolated the fix is (just a single line - math operation ordering corrected), the risk of this change having unintentional side effects is low. Previously, any caller trying to write large binary data as Base64 string would have hit an exception (which is fixed now) and most callers wouldn't hit this issue. There is a workaround when using `Utf8JsonWriter` directly. However, since there isn't a workaround for folks using the `JsonSerializer` or returning byte[] within an ASP.NET app, this certainly meets the servicing bar and given the code change, I believe this should be ported.\r\n\r\n## Tests run / added\r\n\r\n* An explicit test for writing 3.5MB byte[] via the writer verifying that writing large binary data as Base64 works as expected.\r\n* Add outerloop tests for writing larger arrays (right up to the 125 MB threshold) and augment existing tests to validate that anything just above 125MB continues to fail as expected (not just really large arrays).\r\n* Verified end-to-end in an ASP.NET MVC app that returning reasonably sized byte[] work as expected (and outputs base64 encoded strings)."},{"Id":"10350289838","Type":"IssuesEvent","CreatedAt":"2019-09-05T02:10:16","Actor":"danmosemsft","Repository":"dotnet/corefx","Organization":"dotnet","RawContent":null,"RelatedAction":"reopened","RelatedUrl":"https://github.com/dotnet/corefx/issues/40476","RelatedDescription":"Reopened issue \"Regression in System.Data.SqlClient >= 4.7.0-preview7 on Docker\" (#40476) at dotnet/corefx","RelatedBody":"The newest versions of `System.Data.SqlClient` throws when connecting to SQL Azure when running inside a Docker linux container.\r\n\r\n* `4.7.0-preview6.19303.8` does not throw\r\n* `4.7.0-preview7.19362.9` and `4.7.0-preview8.19405.3` throws when run in Docker\r\n\r\nI have tried both the debian and alpine images and both seems to produce the exception.

lie","State":"open","Body":"# General\r\n\r\nWith .NET Core 3.0-preview8 -- I compiled a standalone exe for Windows 7 (x86) RID using the following command:\r\n`dotnet publish -c Release -r win7-x86 -o .\\bin\\Redist\\windows /p:PublishSingleFile=true /p:PublishTrimmed=true /p:DebugType=None`\r\n\r\nThis produces a single .exe file output that runs fine on Windows 10 (x64).\r\n\r\nBut when I copy this .exe file to a Windows 7 Home Basic (x86) machine, I get the following error message when trying to run it:\r\n```\r\nThe program can't start because api-ms-win-crt-runtime-l1-1-0.dll is missing from your computer. Try reinstalling the program to fix this problem. \r\n```\r\nAccording to this issue: https://github.com/dotnet/core-setup/issues/3220 it looks like this external dependency is possibly the \"Windows Universal C Runtime\", which can be found at this location: https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/help/2999226/update-for-universal-c-runtime-in-windows\r\n\r\nThere does appear to be a download link for Windows 7 (x86), but when you try to install it on said operating system, you get the following message: `The update is not applicable to your computer.` -- This leads me to believe that it is impossible to run my app on Windows 7 (x86).\r\n\r\n# Expected Behavior:\r\n - My app runs on Windows 7 (x86) without having to install anything that does not ship with\r\n   the OS. (Many Corporate and Enterprise environments do not have the ability to install\r\n   random service packs on their machines without significant IT involvement and overhead.)\r\n    - Also, I'd like to avoid dependency issues, e.g. if a user has the wrong version installed, etc.\r\n\r\n - If I do have to install some random service pack, tell me about it and where to download it\r\n   instead of a random missing dll notice, as that's a disaster waiting to happen.

This is a slight rework of the original code with enhancements but is mainly targeted to revert changes done in earlier PR #35363 that caused regression.\r\n\r\n## Customer Impact\r\n\r\nAll Unix and UAP customers are impacted as they cannot connect to SQL Server with SSL enabled.\r\n\r\n## Regression\r\n\r\nYes. This PR fixes a regression reported in #40476 caused with PR #35363 in .NET Core SDK 3.0 Preview7.\r\n\r\n## Risk\r\n\r\nSmall. The change-set is small and selective code introduced in earlier PR #35363 is being reverted here.\r\n\r\n## Tests\r\n\r\nNo tests added as part of this change.

Turns out, C# ordering of mathematical operations has multiplication first before bit-shifts, but we want to do bit-shifts first.  Also, rename the constant to fix transpose error: Base46 -> Base64.\r\n\r\n## Customer Impact\r\n\r\nThe bug was customer-reported where the user was unable to return a 3.5MB byte[] from a controller's action within an aspnet app. Effectively, trying to write a byte[] as Base64-encoded string that is > 2.5MB wouldn't work, which falls within the \"reasonable\" size for binary payload. The actual token size limit was intended to be ~125 MB, which customers have not run up against (this limitation is due to the way `Utf8JsonWriter` is implemented). Direct users of the `Utf8JsonWriter` have a sub-optimal workaround for this bug, where they could explicitly encode the byte[] to Base64 string themselves, and pass that to `Utf8JsonWriter.WriteString()`. However, most folks would hit this via the JsonSerializer or from within an asp.net app, where they may not be able to modify their object model from byte[] to string (encoding to base64 up-front themselves), and there is no workaround for them.\r\n\r\n```text\r\nArgumentException: The JSON value of length 3145728 is too large and not supported.\r\nSystem.Text.Json.ThrowHelper.ThrowArgumentException_ValueTooLarge(int tokenLength)\r\nSystem.Text.Json.Utf8JsonWriter.WriteBase64StringValue(ReadOnlySpan<byte> bytes)\r\nSystem.Text.Json.Serialization.Converters.JsonConverterByteArray.Write(Utf8JsonWriter writer, byte[] value, JsonSerializerOptions options)\r\nSystem.Text.Json.JsonPropertyInfoNotNullable<TClass, TDeclaredProperty, TRuntimeProperty, TConverter>.OnWrite(ref WriteStackFrame current, Utf8JsonWriter writer)\r\nSystem.Text.Json.JsonPropertyInfo.Write(ref WriteStack state, Utf8JsonWriter writer)\r\nSystem.Text.Json.JsonSerializer.Write(Utf8JsonWriter writer, int originalWriterDepth, int flushThreshold, JsonSerializerOptions options, ref WriteStack state)\r\nSystem.Text.Json.JsonSerializer.WriteAsyncCore(Stream utf8Json, object value, Type type, JsonSerializerOptions options, CancellationToken cancellationToken)\r\nMicrosoft.AspNetCore.Mvc.Formatters.SystemTextJsonOutputFormatter.WriteResponseBodyAsync(OutputFormatterWriteContext context, Encoding selectedEncoding)\r\nMicrosoft.AspNetCore.Mvc.Formatters.SystemTextJsonOutputFormatter.WriteResponseBodyAsync(OutputFormatterWriteContext context, Encoding selectedEncoding)\r\nMicrosoft.AspNetCore.Mvc.Infrastructure.ResourceInvoker.<InvokeNextResultFilterAsync>g__Awaited|29_0<TFilter, TFilterAsync>(ResourceInvoker invoker, Task lastTask, State next, Scope scope, object state, bool isCompleted)\r\nMicrosoft.AspNetCore.Mvc.Infrastructure.ResourceInvoker.Rethrow(ResultExecutedContextSealed context)\r\nMicrosoft.AspNetCore.Mvc.Infrastructure.ResourceInvoker.ResultNext<TFilter, TFilterAsync>(ref State next, ref Scope scope, ref object state, ref bool isCompleted)\r\nMicrosoft.AspNetCore.Mvc.Infrastructure.ResourceInvoker.InvokeResultFilters()\r\nMicrosoft.AspNetCore.Mvc.Infrastructure.ResourceInvoker.<InvokeNextResourceFilter>g__Awaited|24_0(ResourceInvoker invoker, Task lastTask, State next, Scope scope, object state, bool isCompleted)\r\nMicrosoft.AspNetCore.Mvc.Infrastructure.ResourceInvoker.Rethrow(ResourceExecutedContextSealed context)\r\nMicrosoft.AspNetCore.Mvc.Infrastructure.ResourceInvoker.Next(ref State next, ref Scope scope, ref object state, ref bool isCompleted)\r\nMicrosoft.AspNetCore.Mvc.Infrastructure.ResourceInvoker.InvokeFilterPipelineAsync()\r\nMicrosoft.AspNetCore.Mvc.Infrastructure.ResourceInvoker.<InvokeAsync>g__Logged|17_1(ResourceInvoker invoker)\r\nMicrosoft.AspNetCore.Routing.EndpointMiddleware.<Invoke>g__AwaitRequestTask|6_0(Endpoint endpoint, Task requestTask, ILogger logger)\r\nMicrosoft.AspNetCore.Authorization.AuthorizationMiddleware.Invoke(HttpContext context)\r\nMicrosoft.AspNetCore.Diagnostics.DeveloperExceptionPageMiddleware.Invoke(HttpContext context)\r\n```\r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/6527137/64230746-7f766480-cea2-11e9-80ac-5b2586980d1a.png)\r\n\r\n\r\n## Regression?\r\n\r\nNo.\r\n\r\n## Risk\r\n\r\n`Utf8JsonWriter.WriteBase64String(...)` breaks. Given how isolated the fix is (just a single line - math operation ordering corrected), the risk of this change having unintentional side effects is low. Previously, any caller trying to write large binary data as Base64 string would have hit an exception (which is fixed now) and most callers wouldn't hit this issue. There is a workaround when using `Utf8JsonWriter` directly. However, since there isn't a workaround for folks using the `JsonSerializer` or returning byte[] within an ASP.NET app, this certainly meets the servicing bar and given the code change, I believe this should be ported.\r\n\r\n## Tests run / added\r\n\r\n* An explicit test for writing 3.5MB byte[] via the writer verifying that writing large binary data as Base64 works as expected.\r\n* Add outerloop tests for writing larger arrays (right up to the 125 MB threshold) and augment existing tests to validate that anything just above 125MB continues to fail as expected (not just really large arrays).\r\n* Verified end-to-end in an ASP.NET MVC app that returning reasonably sized byte[] work as expected (and outputs base64 encoded strings).","Url":"https://github.com/dotnet/corefx/pull/40796","RelatedDescription":"Closed or merged PR \"[release/3.0] Fix the max token size threshold to correctly compute to 125MB for Base64 bytes.\" (#40796)"},{"Id":"489461548","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2019-09-05T01:17:57","Actor":"madmir","Number":"40824","RawContent":null,"Title":"Hide/Redefine inherited NameValueCollection.HasKeys() method for WebHeaderCollection class","State":"closed","Body":"Fixes #33628\r\n\r\nEarlier, HasKeys() behavior was changed by overriding InternalHasKeys().","Url":"https://github.com/dotnet/corefx/pull/40824","RelatedDescription":"Closed or merged PR \"Hide/Redefine inherited NameValueCollection.HasKeys() method for WebHeaderCollection class\" (#40824)"},{"Id":"489416044","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2019-09-05T01:03:35","Actor":"stephentoub","Number":"40821","RawContent":null,"Title":"Reduce number of PFX loads in System.Net tests","State":"closed","Body":"Contributes to https://github.com/dotnet/corefx/issues/38931.","Url":"https://github.com/dotnet/corefx/pull/40821","RelatedDescription":"Closed or merged PR \"Reduce number of PFX loads in System.Net tests\" (#40821)"},{"Id":"489406371","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2019-09-04T23:14:39","Actor":"Dotnet-GitSync-Bot","Number":"40819","RawContent":null,"Title":"Mirror changes from dotnet/coreclr,corert","State":"closed","Body":"This PR contains mirrored changes from dotnet/coreclr,corert\n\n\n**Please REBASE this PR when merging**\n\n cc @stephentoub @NextTurn","Url":"https://github.com/dotnet/corefx/pull/40819","RelatedDescription":"Closed or merged PR \"Mirror changes from dotnet/coreclr,corert\" (#40819)"},{"Id":"489430944","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2019-09-04T22:22:37","Actor":"Anipik","Number":"40823","RawContent":null,"Title":"Updating assembly version for oob and inbox assemblies","State":"open","Body":"- Wrote a small code to increment the assembly version in directory.build.props by 1\r\n- manually increment the shims version\r\n- manually added a netcoreapp3.1 for inbox assemblies (Microsoft.private.corefx validation fails without this)\r\n- some of the assembly version cant be updating because they require the same verison on full framework, so they needed to be revereted\r\n- used UpdateRepoPackageIndex target to update the assembly-package dependency for shipping nuget packages","Url":"https://github.com/dotnet/corefx/pull/40823","RelatedDescription":"Open PR \"Updating assembly version for oob and inbox assemblies\" (#40823)"},{"Id":"489424535","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2019-09-04T22:03:47","Actor":"carlossanlop","Number":"40822","RawContent":null,"Title":"Match src param name of BrotliEncoder.GetMaxCompressedLength to ref param name","State":"open","Body":"Fixes https://github.com/dotnet/corefx/issues/39654\r\n\r\nThis PR addresses the last comment by @bartonjs :\r\n\r\n>\r\n> The API review (#25785) brought in `public static int GetMaximumCompressedSize(int inputSize) { throw null; }` and exited with `public static int GetMaxCompressedLength(int length);`, looks like the ref only caught half of that change.\r\n\r\n> Given that changing the src is less breaking than the ref, I'd make the src match the ref (and update the exception as well).","Url":"https://github.com/dotnet/corefx/pull/40822","RelatedDescription":"Open PR \"Match src param name of BrotliEncoder.GetMaxCompressedLength to ref param name\" (#40822)"},{"Id":"489415848","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2019-09-04T21:47:16","Actor":"scalablecory","Number":"40820","RawContent":null,"Title":"[release/3.0] Move wildcard bind in Socket.ConnectAsync to be Windows-only","State":"open","Body":"Ports https://github.com/dotnet/corefx/pull/40767 to release/3.0\r\nResolves #40737 \r\n\r\n## Description\r\n\r\nUpdates `Socket.ConnectAsync` to avoid binding the socket to `IPAddress.Any` when not on Windows.

It allows to keep a value alive as long as the key is alive. This functionality is not possible to implement outside the GC so it is a very valuable primitive, just like `GCHandle` and `WeakReference`.\r\n\r\nHowever note that GCHandle is public, unlike DependentHandle, so users could implement their own WeakReference implementation if it wouldn't exist. Currently it is not possible to implement your own ConditionalWeakTable because the underlying GC primitive is not exposed.\r\n\r\nCompared to WeakReference the desire to implement your own variation of CWT is much higher because it is a complex data structure. While theoretically you can use CWT itself as a building block for your other data structures, since CWT is a _collection_ you have to take a compromise:\r\n\r\n* Create a single shared CWT with the associated lookup overhead and locking contention. If you cannot guarantee that your keys are unique you also have to make the `TValue` of the CWT a collection which adds another level of indirection and overhead. This is the recommended usage of CWT but its not suited for use cases which are more complex and would be better suited by having an individual reference as building block.\r\n* Create a CWT for every site where you need a single reference, with the associated unnecessary indirection and overhead.\r\n* Use reflection to access the native static methods on DependentHandle\r\n\r\nThe third option is currently by far the preferable one due to the much lower overhead when CWT doesn't provide a fit, though having to poke into runtime internals with reflection also feels wrong.\r\n\r\nNote that there is a related but different request dotnet/coreclr#5508 to expose the `DependentHandle` directly. This proposal is not a duplicate, it adds a currently missing \"safe\" high level primitive in contrast to exposing the low level primitive of DependentHandle. If it were exposed you could implement the high level primitive yourself, but it would still be valuable to have in the framework, just as you have WeakReference and GCHandle living alongside.\r\n\r\n**Motivation**\r\n\r\nWe often encounter situations where we want to make use of the GC liveness semantics of a DependentHandle without requiring the lookup semantics of a CWT, so being forced to go through a CWT adds a lot of unnecessary overhead to any implementation wanting to make use of this GC feature.\r\n\r\nOne particular important example are weak event managers. Historically these have been using WeakReference and regular polling of the table, but these implementations are inferior to a general purpose solution. What you want to say is _\"keep this delegate alive as long as that other object is not GC'ed\"_, a single DependentHandle would exactly represent this semantic. Note that you don't actually want to lookup events based on their keys, you have a list of DependentHandles as your weak event subscriptions. This is not possible to implement cleanly with the currently exposed ConditionalWeakTable API.\r\n\r\nSimilar scenarios keep happening over the years, where we just want a list of weak references being kept alive by something else, usually with interfaces instead of delegates, where we want to keep some sort of interface alive as long as something else is still alive.\r\n\r\n**Proposal**\r\n\r\nImplement and expose an analogue to `WeakReference<T>` wrapping the GC primitive used by CWT. I suggest the naming to be `ConditionalWeakReference<TKey, TValue>` because it accurately represents its semantics and relates in naming to both ConditionalWeakTable and WeakReference.\r\n\r\nWhile you could also expose DependentHandle as analogue to GCHandle I currently have no practical use case for the low level access, all use cases I have encountered would be solvable by having a high level construct of a single conditional reference.\r\n\r\n**Proposed API**\r\n\r\n```C#\r\nnamespace System\r\n{\r\n    public sealed class ConditionalWeakReference<TKey, TValue>\r\n        where TKey : class\r\n        where TValue : class\r\n    {\r\n        public ConditionalWeakReference(TKey key, TValue value);\r\n        ~ConditionalWeakReference();\r\n        public bool TryGetKey(out TKey key);\r\n        public bool TryGetValue(out TValue value);\r\n        public bool TryGetKeyValue(out TKey key, out TValue value);\r\n        public void SetKey(TKey key);\r\n        public void SetValue(TValue value);\r\n    }\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\n- Making the class sealed is symmetric to `WeakReference<T>`\r\n- `bool IsAlive { get; }` is not present on `WeakReference<T>` either so I omitted it. If you want to implement it, it would be equivalent to calling `TryGetKey` and discarding the key, like you can do with `WeakReference<T>.TryGetTarget`.\r\n- Clearing the reference can be done by `SetKey(null)` which is the analogue to `WeakReference<T>.SetTarget(null)`\r\n- Nullability annotations are missing, they are still new to me.\r\n\r\n**Reference implementation**\r\n\r\n<details><summary>expand</summary>\r\n\r\n```C#\r\nnamespace System\r\n{\r\n    public sealed class ConditionalWeakReference<TKey, TValue>\r\n        where TKey : class\r\n        where TValue : class\r\n    {\r\n        private DependentHandle _handle;\r\n\r\n        public ConditionalWeakReference(TKey key, TValue value)\r\n        {\r\n            if (key is null)\r\n            {\r\n                // if key is null then value also has to be null\r\n                if (!(value is null))\r\n                    throw new ArgumentNullException(nameof(key));\r\n            }\r\n            else\r\n            {\r\n                _handle = new DependentHandle(key, value);\r\n            }\r\n        }\r\n\r\n        ~ConditionalWeakReference()\r\n        {\r\n            // ConditionalWeakTable does not free handles during AppDomain shutdown, so we don't do it either\r\n            if (!Environment.HasShutdownStarted)\r\n            {\r\n                lock (this)\r\n                {\r\n                    _handle.Free();\r\n                }\r\n            }\r\n        }\r\n\r\n        public bool TryGetKey(out TKey key)\r\n        {\r\n            lock (this)\r\n            {\r\n                if (_handle.IsAllocated)\r\n                {\r\n                    var primary = _handle.GetPrimary();\r\n                    if (primary != null)\r\n                    {\r\n                        key = (TKey)primary;\r\n                        return true;\r\n                    }\r\n                }\r\n\r\n                key = default;\r\n                return false;\r\n            }\r\n        }\r\n\r\n        public bool TryGetValue(out TValue value)\r\n        {\r\n            lock (this)\r\n            {\r\n                if (_handle.IsAllocated)\r\n                {\r\n                    var primary = _handle.GetPrimaryAndSecondary(out var secondary);\r\n                    if (primary != null)\r\n                    {\r\n                        value = (TValue)secondary;\r\n                        return true;\r\n                    }\r\n                }\r\n\r\n                value = default;\r\n                return false;\r\n            }\r\n        }\r\n\r\n        public bool TryGetKeyValue(out TKey key, out TValue value)\r\n        {\r\n            lock (this)\r\n            {\r\n                if (_handle.IsAllocated)\r\n                {\r\n                    var primary = _handle.GetPrimaryAndSecondary(out var secondary);\r\n                    if (primary != null)\r\n                    {\r\n                        key = (TKey)primary;\r\n                        value = (TValue)secondary;\r\n                        return true;\r\n                    }\r\n                }\r\n\r\n                key = default;\r\n                value = default;\r\n                return false;\r\n            }\r\n        }\r\n\r\n        public void SetKey(TKey key)\r\n        {\r\n            lock (this)\r\n            {\r\n                if (key is null)\r\n                {\r\n                    _handle.Free();\r\n                }\r\n                else\r\n                {\r\n                    if (!_handle.IsAllocated)\r\n                        throw new InvalidOperationException();\r\n\r\n                    _handle.SetPrimary(key);\r\n                }\r\n            }\r\n        }\r\n\r\n        public void SetValue(TValue value)\r\n        {\r\n            lock (this)\r\n            {\r\n                if (!_handle.IsAllocated)\r\n                    throw new InvalidOperationException();\r\n\r\n                _handle.SetSecondary(value);\r\n            }\r\n        }\r\n    }\r\n}\r\n```\r\n</details>\r\n\r\n**Open questions**\r\n\r\n- I'm not sure how much sense my reference implementation of `SetKey` and `SetValue` makes, they are primitives on DependentHandle so I included them in the API because they are required for being symmetric with WeakReference. If you feel like you don't want that an alternative would be making the class IDisposable instead.\r\n- Should there be a `SetKeyValue(TKey, TValue)` to reinitialize the handle without reallocation of the ConditionalWeakReference?\r\n- Should `SetKey(TKey)` with non-null key be allowed on an uninitialized handle and (instead of throwing) allocate a new handle with `TValue` set to null?\r\n- The `lock (this)` in my reference implementation is not great. How is WeakReference<T> handling thread safety, does it just delegate to the runtime implementation? It should probably be analogous if possible, but this means the IsAllocated check must happen in DependentHandle or the runtime, not in the caller (invocation on IntPtr.Zero as handle should not throw)\r\n","Url":"https://github.com/dotnet/corefx/issues/40805","RelatedDescription":"Open issue \"Proposal: ConditionalWeakReference<TKey, TValue>\" (#40805)"},{"Id":"489010965","IsPullRequest":false,"CreatedAt":"2019-09-04T08:18:12","Actor":"AriNuer","Number":"40799","RawContent":null,"Title":"Test failure: System.Diagnostics.Tests.EventLogTraceListenerTests.TraceEventTest","State":"open","Body":"Test `System.Diagnostics.Tests.EventLogTraceListenerTests.TraceEventTest` has failed.\r\n```\r\nSystem.Diagnostics.Tests.EventLogTraceListenerTests.TraceEventTest(eventType: Information, expectedType: Information, id: 65536, expectedId: 65535) [FAIL]\r\n      System.AggregateException : One or more errors occurred.

We have already moved IDE0055 (Formatting analyzer) to this NuGet package, and I tried to move an additional analyzer to the package (https://github.com/dotnet/roslyn/pull/38481), but ran into bunch of design questions/issues that need to be discussed.\r\n\r\n1. **Diagnostic Analyzer:** This is the core piece that needs to be ported from IDE Features project to CodeStyle project. Design questions in this effort:\r\n   1. **Should we re-use the same IDE diagnostic IDs for the ported analyzer?**\r\n       Design Proposal: \"yes\", otherwise we run into issue about identical diagnostics with just a differing ID for each violation, duplicate suppressions, duplicate configuration (editorconfig/ruleset/nowarn entries) etc.\r\n   2. **De-duping of diagnostics from different sources:** If we re-use the diagnostic IDs for the ported analyzer, this will likely happen by default. We should confirm with @heejaechang. \r\n   3. **De-duping of diagnostic analyzers from different sources:** Given that the analyzer assembly containing these analyzers have different name (CodeStyle versus Features), there will be no automatic-deduping of analyzers and the analyzer from both these sources will execute. Do we care about the performance impact from duplicate analyzer execution? Should we add custom logic to IDE diagnostic service to not execute the IDE analyzer when there is an identical analyzer (say with same name and reporting same supported diagnostic IDs)?\r\n   4. **Should we move the CodeStyle package to reference Microsoft.CodeAnalysis 3.x?** Currently, the CodeStyle NuGet package targets Microsoft.CodeAnalysis 2.8.2 to enable running on Dev15 to promote dogfooding. However, this prevents porting of bunch of analyzers which use APIs from Microsoft.CodeAnalysis 3.x. We can take couple of approaches here:\r\n      1. Move to Microsoft.CodeAnalysis 3.x and officially state that newer CodeStyle NuGet packages are only supported with Dev16 and 3.x compiler toolset. Dev15 users can use prior CodeStyle packages.\r\n      2. Stay on Microsoft.CodeAnalysis 2.8.2, and use Reflection based approach to light up analyzers using newer APIs if user is on Dev16.\r\n      Personally, I hate the reflection based approach and would strongly prefer just moving to Microsoft.CodeAnalysis 3.x.\r\n\r\n2. **Code fixer:** This is likely the most controversial and tricky piece to port, given that majority of our code fixers depend on internal IDE workspace and language services and extension methods, which in turn use bunch of internal utilities, helper utilities (for example, symbol equivalence comparer), etc.\r\n   1. **Should we port IDE code fixers to Code Style layer?** Theoretically speaking, this is not required as code fixers never execute in CI. Following are the pros and cons of this porting effort:\r\n      1. PROS:\r\n         1. Code style layer can remain isolated from IDE, and can be on par with other third party analyzer/fix packages. This can help us identify potential IDE internal APIs and utilities that should be made public.\r\n         2. Protects us against breaking change in the analyzer, where IDE code fixers do not need to handle all versions of analyzer (from different version of NuGet packages)\r\n       2. CONS:\r\n          1. Implementation cost: As mentioned above, porting code fixers would likely be the most costly part of the port effort, possibly also making this whole work item unfeasible and unrealistic.\r\n          2. Unmaintainable code: The entire IDE Workspaces and Features layer would be filled with linked files, #ifdefs based on code style preprocessor directive, splitting of extension methods into two separate files, one included in both Code Style and IDE layers, and one only in IDE layer. IMO, the code keeps getting pretty mess to work with and maintain.\r\n           3. De-duping code fixers: We will end up showing duplicate, identical code fixes from CodeStyle NuGet and IDE (need to confirm), which means we need to design a way to de-dupe code fixers and implement it. This would mean more work.\r\n\r\n      **Design Proposal:** Given the extremely large number of highly impactful CONS and the overall implementation and maintenance cost likely being a deal breaker for this effort, I would like to propose that we don't port the code fixers to code style layer. We should harden the code fixers so they gracefully bail out if the diagnostic location/properties is not as it expects, so it can handle analyzer breaking changes gracefully, and we can recommend customers to just upgrade to latest analyzer NuGet package to light-up the IDE code fixers again.\r\n\r\n2. **Unit tests:** \r\n   1. **Should we port and/or clone unit tests for analyzers/fixers CodeStyle project?** We have following possible approaches, each with its own PROS and CONS:\r\n      1. **Clone unit test files into CodeStyle project:** This approach is only applicable if we decide that we are going to port the code fixers into CodeStyle NuGet layer, otherwise the unit tests need to continue using IDE code fixers and hence cannot be moved to CodeStyle unit tests project. Formatting analyzer port did not port any existing formatting tests, but added just a few additional formatting analyzer tests in the CodeStyle package for the ported analyzer. This approach will certainly not work for other analyzers, as we want to run every authored analyzer/fixer unit test for both the IDE version of the analyzer and the ported analyzer in CodeStyle package. Creating cloned test files in CodeStyle unit test project will likely be impossible to maintain and keep them in sync with Features unit test project. Additionally, if we decide not to re-use the IDE test framework, and use the new Microsoft.CodeAnalysis testing library, we will have to edit each and every ported unit test, which will enormously increase the port and maintenance effort.\r\n      2. **Link unit test files into CodeStyle project and continue using the IDE test framework:** This is comparatively much easier to implement and maintain compared to the prior approach. Again this approach is only applicable if we decide to port the code fixers into CodeStyle NuGet layer. I think this might be the most feasible approach if we decide to keep the CodeStyle package and its test project isolated from rest of Roslyn.sln.\r\n      3. **Tweak the existing IDE test helpers in Features test project to test analyzers and/or fixers from both the Features and Code Style layer:** With this approach, the core unit test helpers just have an additional test dimension where they run with CodeStyle analyzer and/or CodeStyle fixer (latter is needed if we decide to port the fixers). This would be similar to how our IDE analyzer/fixer tests run for both regular and script code kind by default. Each test file would just need to override a helper indicating additional analyzer/fixer against which to run all the tests. This approach would likely be minimal porting effort and also easiest to maintain.\r\n\r\n**Overall Design Proposal:** I think we should try to keep a very good balance between ideal and practical aspects of the above approaches. I fear taking the ideal approach, which would be to port analyzer, code fixers and unit tests (also moving them to new analyzer/fixer test library) would make this effort almost impossible to complete.\r\nIMO, we should do the minimal implementation/maintenance cost approach which would be feasible and also gives end user value add: **port just the diagnostic analyzers and do not port the code fixers or unit tests**, but just ensure that the code fixers are hardened against analyzer breaking changes and tweak existing IDE unit tests to also run with ported CodeStyle analyzers.\r\n\r\n","Url":"https://github.com/dotnet/roslyn/issues/38480","RelatedDescription":"Open issue \"Design issues around moving IDE code style analyzers to CodeStyle Analyzers NuGet package\" (#38480)"},{"Id":"489121102","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2019-09-04T14:21:47","Actor":"dotnet-maestro[bot]","Number":"38478","RawContent":null,"Title":"[master] Update dependencies from dotnet/arcade","State":"closed","Body":"This pull request updates the following dependencies\r\n\r\n[marker]: <> (Begin:567feadf-e495-4ebb-cee4-08d67668456c)\r\n## From https://github.com/dotnet/arcade\r\n- **Build**: 20190903.5\r\n- **Date Produced**: 9/3/2019 10:25 PM\r\n- **Commit**: 6e94f0da0f12c7663ab39ce5bd6a67c4ab58b5ee\r\n- **Branch**: refs/heads/master\r\n- **Updates**:\r\n  - **Microsoft.DotNet.Arcade.Sdk** -> 1.0.0-beta.19453.5\r\n\r\n[marker]: <> (End:567feadf-e495-4ebb-cee4-08d67668456c)\r\n\r\n","Url":"https://github.com/dotnet/roslyn/pull/38478","RelatedDescription":"Closed or merged PR \"[master] Update dependencies from dotnet/arcade\" (#38478)"},{"Id":"488875891","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2019-09-04T13:58:57","Actor":"dotnet-bot","Number":"38473","RawContent":null,"Title":"Merge release/dev16.3 to master","State":"closed","Body":"\nThis is an automatically generated pull request from release/dev16.3 into master.\n\n``` bash\ngit fetch --all\ngit checkout merges/release/dev16.3-to-master\ngit reset --hard upstream/master\ngit merge upstream/release/dev16.3\n# Fix merge conflicts\ngit commit\ngit push upstream merges/release/dev16.3-to-master --force\n```\n\nOnce all conflicts are resolved and all the tests pass, you are free to merge the pull request.","Url":"https://github.com/dotnet/roslyn/pull/38473","RelatedDescription":"Closed or merged PR \"Merge release/dev16.3 to master\" (#38473)"},{"Id":"488889073","IsPullRequest":false,"CreatedAt":"2019-09-04T01:03:51","Actor":"dibarbet","Number":"38477","RawContent":null,"Title":"Liveshare FAR requires UI thread","State":"open","Body":"Currently, liveshare FAR requires the UI thread as it calls into the [AbstractFindUsagesService](http://source.roslyn.io/#Microsoft.CodeAnalysis.EditorFeatures/FindUsages/AbstractFindUsagesService.cs,bc260059e380e9ca).

However, this separation has led to a variety of complications for contributors and maintainers alike.  For example:\r\n- **Confusion about where issues should be opened.**  It’s not always clear in which repo an issue should be reported, complicated by the fact that some implementations actually span repositories (e.g. a type might be exposed through a reference assembly and have its tests in corefx but actually be implemented in System.Private.CoreLib in coreclr).\r\n- **Difficulty sharing source.**  System.Private.CoreLib is intricately connected to the rest of the runtime, and thus has lived with the runtime code.  That, however, means that although corefx has been intended as the place to share as much core library code as possible across any underlying runtime, we’ve needed to keep a significant body of code in System.Private.CoreLib, which then has meant it’s needed to be “mirrored” to each runtime repo (coreclr, corert, mono) that needs to consume it as source; similarly, corefx has similarly required access to much of that source, for example to use the same interop DllImports that are employed elsewhere in the runtimes.  The automatic mirror that shares this source needs to be maintained, and even when it has been, it’s often led to lag.  It’s also complicated developer processes, where to validate a change in one repo generally requires manually mirroring the code to other local repos in order to validate the change and ensure merging into one repo won’t break the others.\r\n- **PRs spanning multiple repos.**  Because the runtime, CoreLib, and the core libraries are all intricately linked, changing runtime behaviors, adding new APIs, or changing various build processes (e.g. improving static analysis) often requires multiple PRs carefully staged across time and multiple repos.  For example, to add a new method to a type like Dictionary<>, a developer must first make the source changes in her local coreclr repo and the test and reference assembly changes in her local corefx repo.  When satisfied with the fix, the developer must submit a PR to coreclr as well as a PR to corefx, the latter of which will fail.  Eventually the coreclr PR will be merged, and the changes will mirror to the other runtimes that also require the update.  Eventually those mirror PRs will be merged, and builds will be created containing the fix for each runtime.  At some point later those builds will be consumed into the corefx repo, after which point the original corefx PR can be re-validated and eventually merged.  That’s the best case; things get more complicated in situations where there are bidirectional dependencies.\r\n- **Building an installable runtime.** Self-hosting a custom built .NET requires intricate knowledge of how all the repos work and interact.  A developer can’t just clone a single repo, make a desired change, and easily produce an installer.\r\n- **Consistency.**  One goal we had for more fine-grained repos was to enable isolation and independence for teams working within each repo’s confines, but this has led to non-trivial duplication of effort on things like build systems and CI, and then the resulting lack of consistency as each system ends up diverging from the others.\r\n\r\nThe issues go beyond the runtime.  For example, the ASP.NET maintainers and community did a great job in the past year or so consolidating from ~55 repos down to ~5 repos, but that’s still more repos than is desirable, leading to similar issues as cited above for the runtime.  On top of that, these ASP.NET repositories are in the aspnet GitHub org, which adds an additional set of issues, for example:\r\n- **Complications moving issues between repos.**  If a developer opens an issue in aspnet/aspnetcore and it’s determined that the cause of the issue is actually in dotnet/corefx, there is no GitHub mechanism to enable easily moving that issue across the aspnet to dotnet organizational boundary.\r\n- **Permissions.** Each organization’s permissions end up needing to be managed and maintained separately.\r\n\r\nThe issues extend into tooling as well.  For example, we currently have multiple repositories that all logically make up the dotnet CLI, but actually creating a working installer spans multiple repos.\r\n\r\n### Plan\r\n\r\nTo address these issues, we’re planning to make some changes to our repository structure:\r\n- **dotnet/platform.**  We plan to combine dotnet/coreclr, dotnet/corefx, dotnet/corert, dotnet/core-setup, and the relevant portions of mono/mono into a new dotnet/platform repo.  Everything needed to build and produce the Microsoft.NETCore.App shared framework will be in this repo.  We will no longer suffer from the complications of source mirroring.  Features like changing runtime behavior or adding an API will no longer require a complicated dance across multiple repos.  Etc.\r\n- **dotnet/aspnetcore.**  We plan to move the existing aspnet/aspnetcore repository into the dotnet organization.  Along with that, we aim to combine a variety of the other aspnet repositories into aspnetcore, such as aspnet/blazor.  Whether repos like entityframeworkcore remain separate or combined remains an open question.  A goal is that, just as dotnet/platform will be responsible for the creation of Microsoft.NETCore.App, dotnet/aspnetcore will be responsible for the creation of Microsoft.AspNETCore.App.\r\n- **dotnet/cli.**  We plan to combine dotnet/toolset and dotnet/sdk into the dotnet/cli repo.\r\n\r\n### FAQ\r\n\r\n#### Why are we merging repos?\r\n\r\nWe believe we can significantly improve several aspects of .NET on GitHub by combining repos, benefiting both maintainers and contributors.  These improvements will manifest in a variety of ways, such as in better issue management, much easier models of contribution, and easier and faster ways to build and install the resulting bits.\r\n\r\n####  What will happen to the aspnet org?\r\n\r\nThe aspnet org as a separate entity is legacy and artificial.  In time we hope to absorb it into the dotnet org and sunset the aspnet org.\r\n\r\n#### Will the coreclr and corefx repos go away?\r\n\r\nWith the help of GitHub, we plan to migrate all issues from these repos to the new dotnet/platform repo, and then lock down creation of additional issues, such that the repos will no longer be used for issue management.  We will also inhibit the creation of PRs to the master branch, which will effectively become an archive for read-only review of history.  In this sense, these repos will be archived, and no active development will happen with them.  However, we plan to continue servicing previous .NET Core releases out of these repos, so the various release branches (e.g. release/2.1, release/3.0, etc.) will continue to see (limited) activity.\r\n\r\n#### Will the mono repo go away?\r\n\r\nNo. mono/mono contains the source for the full mono stack and will continue to live on happily.  We will simply be moving the managed source associated with System.Private.CoreLib and copying the relatively small amount of source that makes up the native mono runtime to dotnet/platform.  We may choose to then use some mirroring technology to keep the runtime copy in sync (this will, however, not suffer from the same mirroring issues we currently experience, as we would not be mirroring between two components required to build the same binaries), or we may choose to let them diverge and manually sync only those changes deemed relevant to both implementations.\r\n\r\n#### Will the corert repo go away?\r\n\r\nYes.  We plan to retire/archive the corert repo.  Some of the technology in the corert repo will be migrated to the master branch of dotnet/platform, where it will be productized as part of .NET.  Other portions of the corert repo will be migrated to feature branches of dotnet/platform, where the experimentation can continue.  In this way, we will use feature branches to continue experimenting with the corert technology, while making it easier to share portions with its shipping counterpart and also graduate functionality into master if/when it’s ready.\r\n\r\n#### Does this mean there will be a single repo for all of .NET?\r\n\r\nNo.  We will be reducing the number of repos that contribute to .NET, but currently we do not believe that going all the way down to one is the right answer.\r\n\r\n#### Doesn’t this mean that issue and PR tracking will now be overwhelming?\r\n\r\nIt is already the case that the vast majority of issues in a given repo are not relevant to any individual developer, and with several thousand open issues in each repo and on the order of a hundred open PRs in each, we already need systems (e.g. labels) to successfully manage issues and PRs.  As such, we don’t believe the merging will have a significant impact on this aspect of developer productivity.  If it turns out to have an unexpectedly large negative impact, we will work with the community to find ways to mitigate the problem.  However, there are already a multitude of successful open source projects on GitHub with at least an order of magnitude more issues.\r\n\r\n#### What will happen to existing issues?\r\n\r\nWith the help of GitHub functionality, we plan to migrate all issues from old repos (e.g. dotnet/coreclr, dotnet/corefx) to the new repos (e.g. dotnet/platform).  We may also use this as a forcing function to revisit stale issues and either close those that are no longer relevant or reinvigorate those that are demanding of more immediate attention.\r\n\r\n#### What about git history?\r\n\r\nIn general, we plan to keep history, such that history from each constituent repo will be a part of the new repo.  However, we have made some mistakes in the past (e.g. large binaries, multitudes of automated PRs for flowing bits and source between repos, etc.), and we plan to rewrite history to correct those mistakes wherever possible and impactful.  Some rough calculations suggest this could end up significantly reducing the size of the repos as well as the time it takes to clone, which should not only help developers approaching the project but also CI.  This will end up meaning that SHAs may be different in the new repo than they were in the old repo; as previously mentioned, however, any references to the old SHAs in the old repos will continue to work, as those repos will remain accessible.\r\n\r\n#### Will I still show up in the contributor list due to previous contributions?\r\n\r\nYes.  We plan to merge all such history.\r\n\r\n#### Will this break debugging with SourceLink?\r\n\r\nNo.  The existing repos will continue to be accessible, and commit SHAs there will remain unchanged.\r\n\r\n#### Might plans change?\r\n\r\nSure.  Part of the goal of posting this announcement is to hear from you, hear about additional benefits you're excited about, and hear about additional concerns we may not have considered.  We will include such ideas in our planning and course correct as necessary.\r\n\r\n## Discussion\r\n\r\nTo discuss these plans, please comment on the corresponding issue at https://github.com/dotnet/coreclr/issues/26175.\r\n","Url":"https://github.com/dotnet/announcements/issues/119","RelatedDescription":"Open issue \"Consolidating .NET GitHub repos\" (#119)"},{"Id":"470434872","IsPullRequest":false,"CreatedAt":"2019-07-19T16:54:02","Actor":"richlander","Number":"118","RawContent":null,"Title":".NET Core master branches have switched to \"5.0\"","State":"open","Body":"# .NET Core master branches have switched to \"5.0\"\r\n\r\nVarious .NET Core repos have switched their `master` branches to \"5.0\", and will use 3.x branches for 3.0 and 3.1 projects.

These files, along with the top level [releases-index.json](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dotnet/core/master/release-notes/releases-index.json), are becoming increasingly important .NET Core release assets. These files, one for each major.minor channel, are relied upon by many to detect when updates for .NET Core are available, discover security update details and other uses.\r\n\r\nChanges are sometimes necessary, and the growing dependencies require that we treat compatibility of the schema with the utmost care. This announcement describes an addition to the releases.json schema.\r\n\r\n## SDK Versions and Visual Studio\r\n\r\nBecause of current .NET Core SDK product construction dependencies, there is a hard link between the Runtime, SDK, toolset (compilers, MSBuild, NuGet, and other components), and Visual Studio. Simplistically, this means that when anything updates, everything updates. The unfortunate result of this linking is that multiple versions of the SDK are released with each monthly update for each supported versions of Visual Studio. For example, the May Update for .NET Core 2.2 included the 2.2.5 runtime, 2.2.107 SDK for Visual Studio 2017 and 2.2.204 for Visual Studio 2019 and yet another pair of SDK versions for .NET Core 2.1. An example of this is the [2.2.5 Release Notes](https://github.com/dotnet/core/blob/master/release-notes/2.2/2.2.5/2.2.5.md). \r\n\r\nThis is a confusing situation and we are working to mitigate the need to release multiple SDKs with .NET Core 3.0. The need for multiple SDK versions will persist for 2.1 LTS.\r\n\r\n## Adding the SDKS array\r\n\r\nTo appropriately model multiple SDKs per release, we are adding an SDKs array to releases.json, which will contain SDK objects. The top-level SDK object will represent the highest versioned SDK for a given update. Using the previous 2.2.5 update example, SDK 2.2.204 is in the top SDK object as well as duplicated in the SDKS array. All other applicable 2.2* SDK objects are included in the SDKS array. The SDK objects within the array will carry specific Visual Studio compatibility and version inclusion information to provide appropriate context.\r\n\r\nHere is an example of the new array based on the upcoming July update.\r\nAgain, this will be additive and the previous SDK object will include the highest SDK version for the release.\r\n\r\n```json\r\n{\r\n    \"sdk\": {\r\n        \"version\": \"2.2.301\",\r\n        \"version-display\": \"2.2.301\",\r\n        \"runtime-version\": \"2.2.6\",\r\n        \"vs-version\": \"16.1.3\",\r\n        \"vs-support\": \"Visual Studio 2019 (v16.1)\",\r\n        \"csharp-version\": \"7.3\",\r\n        \"fsharp-version\": \"4.5\",\r\n        \"vb-version\": null,\r\n        \"files\": []\r\n    },\r\n    \"sdks\": [\r\n        {\r\n            \"version\": \"2.2.301\",\r\n            \"version-display\": \"2.2.301\",\r\n            \"runtime-version\": \"2.2.6\",\r\n            \"vs-version\": \"16.1.3\",\r\n            \"vs-support\": \"Visual Studio 2019 (v16.1)\",\r\n            \"csharp-version\": \"7.3\",\r\n            \"fsharp-version\": \"4.5\",\r\n            \"vb-version\": null,\r\n            \"files\": []\r\n        },\r\n        {\r\n          \"version\": \"2.2.205\",\r\n          \"version-display\": \"2.2.205\",\r\n          \"runtime-version\": \"2.2.6\",\r\n          \"vs-version\": \"16.0.5\",\r\n          \"vs-support\": \"Visual Studio 2019 (v16.0)\",\r\n          \"csharp-version\": \"7.3\",\r\n          \"fsharp-version\": \"4.5\",\r\n          \"vb-version\": null,\r\n          \"files\": []\r\n        }\r\n    ]\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\n## vs-version and the Runtime\r\n\r\nThe same version of the runtime is included in multiple versions of Visual Studio. To account for this, the vs-version field is being updated to a comma-delimited string. The string will represent all versions of Visual Studio which first include the particular .NET Core update. Again, an example from the upcoming July Update.\r\n\r\n```json\r\n\"runtime\": {\r\n        \"version\": \"2.2.6\",\r\n        \"version-display\": \"2.2.6\",\r\n        \"vs-version\": \"15.9.13, 16.1.3, 16.2.0\",\r\n```\r\n\r\nThe same `vs-versions` changes will be seen in the `aspnetcore-runtime` object.\r\n\r\n## Future Enhancements\r\n\r\nThere are other improvements to the schema which have been suggested by the community which we are evaluating. Generally, theses enhancements are additive and should not represent compatibility compromises for existing parsers and similar announcements will be published ahead of any changes.\r\n\r\n","Url":"https://github.com/dotnet/announcements/issues/116","RelatedDescription":"Open issue \"Updates to releases.json (.NET Core release metadata)\" (#116)"},{"Id":"444065225","IsPullRequest":false,"CreatedAt":"2019-05-14T18:38:23","Actor":"TaraOverfield","Number":"114","RawContent":null,"Title":"May 2019 .NET Updates","State":"open","Body":"# May 2019 .NET Updates\r\n\r\nThe following .NET updates were released in May 2019.

Either target .NET Core 2.1 or lower, or use a version of the .NET SDK that supports .NET Core 2.2.`\r\n\r\nIf you downloaded the .NET Core SDK 2.2 between April 2 and April 12, 2019, the main [.NET downloads page](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/download/) included only 2.2.2nn. Starting April 12th, a new button marked \"Compatible with Visual Studio 2017\" is provided to target 2.2.1nn.

This article explains why this happens and how you can fix your installation.\r\n\r\nWhen Visual Studio can't find an appropriate version of the .NET Core SDK, you'll receive an error message. This may appear in the Error pane as NETSDK1045:\r\n\r\n\"The current .NET SDK does not support targeting .NET Core 2...\"\r\n\r\nYou can check what .NET Core SDKs you have on your machine with the following command:\r\n\r\n```bash\r\ndotnet --list-sdks\r\n```\r\n\r\nUnless you have a global.json file, when you use `dotnet` from the command line, the latest .NET Core SDK is used.\r\n\r\n> [TIP!] \r\n> Open a command prompt and try to build with `dotnet build`. If the command line build works, but Visual Studio doesn't suggestions in this article may help.\r\n\r\nThe last two digits of the .NET Core SDK version numbers are in the format are a patch number, which is represented by `nn` in this article because we will continue to service them to include the latest runtimes. To find out more, vist the [Overview of how .NET Core is versioned page](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/core/versions/).\r\n\r\n## Fixes for Common Problems\r\n\r\n### Visual Studio 2017 can't target .NET Core 2.2\r\n\r\nIf you receive the error message in Visual Studio 2017:\r\n\r\n`The current .NET SDK does not support targeting .NET Core 2.2… Either target .NET Core 2.1 or lower, or use a version of the .NET SDK that supports .NET Core 2.2.`\r\n\r\nUse `dotnet --list-sdks` to ensure you have .NET Core SDK 2.2.1nn. As an example, 2.2.106 would be a valid entry.\r\n\r\nIf you downloaded the .NET Core SDK 2.2 after April 2, 2019, version 2.2.2nn (such as 2.2.203) is listed first and is the highest version available. However, Visual Studio 2017 requires 2.2.1nn (such as 2.2.106). .NET Core SDK 2.2.2nn works with Visual Studio 2019. Visual Studio 2017 and Visual Studio 2019 can be installed side by side, but this requires both .NET Core SDK 2.2.1nn and .NET Core SDK 2.2.2nn to develop .NET Core 2.2 applications.\r\n\r\nTo download .NET Core SDK 2.2.2nn, visit the [.NET downloads page](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/download/dotnet-core/2.2).\r\n\r\n### Visual Studio 2017 can't target .NET Core 2.1\r\n\r\nIf you receive this error message in Visual Studio 2017:\r\n\r\n`The current .NET SDK does not support targeting .NET Core 2.1. Either target .NET Core 2.0 or lower, or use a version of the .NET SDK that supports .NET Core 2.1.`\r\n\r\nUse `dotnet --list-sdks` to ensure you have .NET Core SDK 2.1.5nn. As an example, 2.1.505 would be a valid entry. \r\n\r\nThis problem occurs of you manually uninstall the 2.1.5nn version.\r\n\r\nThe Visual Studio 2019 installation will not remove this file and Visual Studio 2017 will continue to work side by side.\r\n\r\nTo reinstall .NET Core SDK 2.1.5nn, visit the [.NET downloads page](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/download/dotnet-core/2.1).\r\n\r\n### Visual Studio 2019 can't target .NET Core 3.0 Preview\r\n\r\nIf you receive this error message in Visual Studio 2019:\r\n\r\n`The current .NET SDK does not support targeting .NET Core 2.1. Either target .NET Core 2.0 or lower, or use a version of the .NET SDK that supports .NET Core 2.1.`\r\n\r\nUse `dotnet --list-sdks` to ensure you have .NET Core SDK 3.0.100-preview... As an example, SDK 3.0.100-preview3-010431 would be a valid entry.\r\n\r\nTo install .NET Core SDK 3.0.1nn preview, visit the [.NET downloads page](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/download/dotnet-core/3.0).\r\n\r\nIn Visual Studio, go to `Tools\\Options\\Projects and Solutions\\.NET Core` and check the box `Use Previews of the .NET Core SDK`.\r\n\r\n> [NOTE!]\r\n> This option will be moving to `Tools\\Options\\Environment` and renamed `Preview Features` in Visual Studio 2019 version 16.1 Preview 2.\r\n\r\nIf you are targeting .NET Core 3.0 preview, the [C# language version will be C# 8.0 Preview by default](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/visualstudio/releases/2019/release-notes#csharp-defaults) allowing you to use new C# features.\r\n\r\n## Understand the relationship between .NET Core SDKs and Visual Studio build tools\r\n\r\nVisual Studio has its own copies of tools like MSBuild, NuGet and the compilers. If you install the .NET Core workload, it also installs the .NET Core SDK which has versions of these tools and provides tasks and targets. These two versions are built from the same repositories, but target .NET Framework and .NET Core respectively. \r\n\r\nWhen you build a .NET Core project in Visual Studio, it uses Visual Studio's copy of MSBuild, but the tasks and targets are supplied from the selected version of the .NET Core SDK. \r\n\r\nWhen you upgrade the .NET Core SDK, you get new tasks and targets. These new tasks and targets may contain features that are not supported by older versions of MSBuild. Like all of the .NET Core SDK, MSBuild is backwards compatible. It is not forwards compatible.\r\n\r\nThis generally works well, but requires a guarantee that the tasks and targets work with the MSBuild version. To ensure this, each .NET Core SDK indicates an MSBuild version range that is used by Visual Studio to determine compatibility. Versions of the .NET Core SDK that have a higher MSBuild identifier than expected are ignored by Visual Studio. In the normal case, this simply means you use the tasks and targets that were installed with your version of Visual Studio.\r\n\r\nBecause of this, you may have many versions of the .NET Core SDK on your machine and Visual Studio still fail to find one it considers appropriate. This is compounded by a poor error message, which we cannot fully correct because it is from the old version of the .NET Core SDK on your machine. Confusion is also compounded by a complex non-linear release matrix that makes it difficult to predict the right .NET Core SDK to select. We are working to improve all this. \r\n\r\n## The Visual Studio / .NET Core SDK support matrix\r\n\r\nThe last two digits of the .NET Core SDK version number are a patch number, which are represented by a `nn` in this table. You can learn more about .NET Core SDK and .NET Core Runtime versioning at the [Overview of how .NET Core is versioned page](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/core/versions/).\r\n\r\nThe following table shows which Visual Studio versions and .NET Core SDKs are compatible and how they are acquired if you are working with Visual Studio. \r\n\r\n| .NET Core SDK | .NET Core Runtime | Compatible Visual Studio | MSBuild | Notes                                     |\r\n|---------------|-------------------|--------------------------|---------|-------------------------------------------|\r\n| 2.1.5nn       | 2.1               | 2017                     | 15      | Installed as part of VS 2017 version 15.9 |\r\n| 2.1.6nn       | 2.1               | 2019                     | 16      | Installed as part of VS 2019              |\r\n| 2.2.1nn       | 2.2               | 2017                     | 15      | Installed manually                        |\r\n| 2.2.2nn       | 2.2               | 2019                     | 16      | Installed as part of VS 2019              |\r\n| 3.0.1nn       | 3.0 (Preview)     | 2019                     | 16      | Installed manually                        |\r\n\r\nVisual Studio 2017 cannot work with .NET Core SDK 2.1.6nn or 2.2.2nn.\r\n\r\nTo find out more about removing older versions of the .NET Core Runtime and .NET Core SDK, visit the [How to remove the .NET Core Runtime and SDK page](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/core/versions/remove-runtime-sdk-versions?tabs=macos).\r\n\r\nTo download the .NET Core SDK, visit the [.NET downloads page](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/download/dotnet-core).","Url":"https://github.com/dotnet/announcements/issues/108","RelatedDescription":"Open issue \".NET Core SDK 2.2.2nn and 2.1.6nn do not work with Visual Studio 2017\" (#108)"},{"Id":"432081093","IsPullRequest":false,"CreatedAt":"2019-04-11T15:16:43","Actor":"KathleenDollard","Number":"107","RawContent":null,"Title":"Limit DotNetCliToolReference Tools to .NET Core 2.2 and Below","State":"open","Body":"# Limit DotNetCliToolReference Tools to .NET Core 2.2 and Below\r\n\r\n.NET Core 3 takes the next step in the .NET Core tool strategy with local tools.

You can now access local tools via `dotnet <toolname>`.\r\n\r\nDotNetCliToolReference tools have a flaw in how their dependencies are restored which can create [difficult to diagnose bugs when running these tools](https://github.com/NuGet/Home/issues/5067).

Restricting tools to target only .NET Core 2.2 and below means existing scenarios to continue to work (as well as they previously did), regardless of the framework version targeted by the project or the current .NET Core SDK. \r\n\r\nThe new .NET Core tool strategy avoids this flaw in restore strategy and offers other benefits, like the ability to author one type of tool and install it in different ways depending on project and user needs.\r\n\r\nWe look forward to your feedback on .NET Core Local Tools, and on challenges you face moving away from DotNetCliToolReference tools. \r\n\r\n[dotnet/sdk #3057](https://github.com/dotnet/sdk/pull/3057)","Url":"https://github.com/dotnet/announcements/issues/107","RelatedDescription":"Open issue \"Limit DotNetCliToolReference Tools to .NET Core 2.2 and Below\" (#107)"},{"Id":"431012407","IsPullRequest":false,"CreatedAt":"2019-04-09T14:51:18","Actor":"MichaelSimons","Number":"106","RawContent":null,"Title":".NET Core SDK container images now contain the Visual Studio 2019 toolset","State":"open","Body":"# .NET Core SDK container images now contain the Visual Studio 2019 toolset\r\n\r\n.NET Core SDK container images now include Visual Studio 2019 tools.

There are two primary reasons for this change:\r\n\r\n* Syndicate Microsoft-provided container images to multiple registries, like Docker Hub and Red Hat.\r\n* Use Microsoft Azure as a global CDN for delivering Microsoft-provided container images.\r\n\r\nYou will use and see MCR as a storage back-end for Microsoft images. The primary way you learn about Microsoft container images and tags will be through a registry, which for most users will continue to be Docker Hub. Most of the experience you've had browsing for .NET Core container images will continue unchanged with this new model. The Docker Hub URLs you've used for Microsoft repos will continue to work, and forward to updated locations on Docker Hub. Existing Docker Hub will images will be maintained as-is.\r\n\r\nSee [.NET Core Container Images now Published to Microsoft Container Registry](https://devblogs.microsoft.com/dotnet/net-core-container-images-now-published-to-microsoft-container-registry/) for the most updated information on our use of MCR.\r\n\r\n## Discussion\r\nPlease share your thoughts on this change and see what others are saying at:\r\n\r\n* [dotnet-docker #935](https://github.com/dotnet/dotnet-docker/issues/935)\r\n\r\n## Starting with .NET Core nightly repo\r\n\r\nOn the .NET team, we started our [transition to MCR](https://github.com/dotnet/dotnet-docker/issues/745) with the .NET Core \"nightly\" repo. [dotnet-nightly](dockerhub.com/r/microsoft/dotnet-nightly) is now hosted on MCR and syndicated to Docker Hub. We started with the nightly repo in order to discover and fix any challenges we found with this new model before we move our higher-traffic primary container repository.\r\n\r\nWe will start publishing [dotnet](dockerhub.com/r/microsoft/dotnet) to MCR a bit later, in either February or March. This issue will be updated when that happens.\r\n\r\n## Repo Split\r\n\r\nThe [.NET Core repo](https://hub.docker.com/r/microsoft/dotnet) currently includes 4 major categories of tags: \r\n\r\n* `sdk`\r\n* `aspnetcore-runtime`\r\n* `runtime` \r\n* `runtime-deps`\r\n\r\nProviding all of the tags in one place has helped with discoverability but made for a repo with an enormous README that can be challenging to navigate and consume. It is large enough that we exceeded Docker Hub README limits and had to artificially make it smaller.\r\n\r\nGoing forward, we will provide a repo for each of the tag categories listed above. We'll also provide a \"product repo\" that will hierarchicaly group all of our repos together. This will satisfy discoverability needs so that it will be easy to find the tags you want.\r\n\r\nYou can already see this experience with [microsoft-dotnet-core-nightly](https://hub.docker.com/_/microsoft-dotnet-core-nightly). There are now multiple repos for our nightly builds:\r\n\r\n* [.NET Core Nightly product repo](https://hub.docker.com/_/microsoft-dotnet-core-nightly)\r\n* [.NET Core SDK Nightly repo](https://hub.docker.com/_/microsoft-dotnet-core-nightly-sdk/)\r\n* [.NET Core ASP.NET Core Nightly repo](https://hub.docker.com/_/microsoft-dotnet-core-nightly-aspnet/)\r\n* [.NET Core Runtime Nightly repo](https://hub.docker.com/_/microsoft-dotnet-core-nightly-runtime/)\r\n* [.NET Core Runtime-deps Nightly repo](https://hub.docker.com/_/microsoft-dotnet-core-nightly-runtime-deps/)\r\n\r\nThe same split will exist for the non-nightly stable repo (currently hosted at  [microsoft/dotnet](https://hub.docker.com/r/microsoft/dotnet)) when we start publishing it to MCR and syndicating it back to DockerHub.\r\n\r\n## Changes to registry URL\r\n\r\nThe biggest change is that your Dockerfiles need to be updated to point to the MCR registry in order get access to new .NET Core container tags. The same change is required for scripts or human operations that pull images via `docker pull`.\r\n\r\nThe following example shows the registry path, repo and tag for the .NET Core 2.2 \"Nightly\" SDK on MCR:\r\n\r\n```console\r\nmcr.microsoft.com/dotnet/core-nightly/sdk:2.2\r\n```\r\n\r\nAs comparison, the following repo and tag have been used to date for the .NET Core 2.2 \"Nightly\" SDK on Docker Hub:\r\n\r\n```console\r\nmicrosoft/dotnet-nightly:2.2-sdk\r\n```\r\n\r\nThe new repo URL is provided at each of the news repos. For example, the new .NET Core SDK \"nightly\" repo provides a box on the right where you can copy and paste the correct MCR-based repo syntax that you can use for `docker pull` or in `FROM` statements in your Dockerfiles.\r\n\r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/2608468/52811702-95c5eb80-304a-11e9-8de8-e6ea1f4b4d75.png)\r\n\r\n## Servicing existing Docker Hub tags\r\n\r\nWe will continue to service existing non-version-specific or floating tags on Docker Hub while the associated .NET Core version is supported. For example the `microsoft/dotnet:2.1-sdk` tag is a floating tag that will continue to be serviced for the lifetime of .NET Core 2.1. You can continue using floating tags without issue.\r\n\r\nIf you use non-floating tags, like `microsoft/dotnet:2.1.504-sdk-alpine`, then you will need to update your Dockerfile to use a new non-floating tag. No new non-floating tags will be published to `microsoft/dotnet` and `microsoft/dotnet-nightly` after we fully transition to MCR.\r\n\r\n.NET Core 3.0 Preview 3 and later will only be made available on MCR.\r\n\r\n## Microsoft is a Verified Publisher\r\n\r\nUntil now, Microsoft-provided container images were considered \"community images\". As part of this change, we are re-classifying Microsoft as a \"verified publisher\" on Docker Hub. This designation should make it clearer that .NET and other Microsoft-provided images are coming from a verified source. There clearly was that expectation previously, but Docker is now making that clearer in the Docker Hub pages they host for Microsoft.\r\n\r\nWe will provide official vulnerability scanning Microsoft-provided images as a second phase of this transition.","Url":"https://github.com/dotnet/announcements/issues/101","RelatedDescription":"Open issue \"Publishing .NET Core images to Microsoft Container Registry (MCR)\" (#101)"},{"Id":"410784442","IsPullRequest":false,"CreatedAt":"2019-02-15T14:06:29","Actor":"TaraOverfield","Number":"100","RawContent":null,"Title":"RESOLVED: Advisory on February 2019 Security update for Windows 10 update 1809","State":"open","Body":"<strong><em>Final Update 2/19/19 @1:30 PM (PST)</em></strong><em>: This </em><em>advisory is now resolved with no action needed from Microsoft Customers.

Assuming we publish 3.9 images in March, we'll stop producing and supporting Alpine 3.7 and 3.8 images after June (2019).\r\n\r\n## Using Alpine-based .NET Core images\r\n\r\nWe produce a variety of Alpine-based images. You can either depend on a specific Alpine version, like with `microsoft/dotnet:2.2-sdk-alpine3.8` or opt to use the latest Alpine image we have to offer, like with `microsoft/dotnet:2.2-sdk-alpine`. Either are good choices. It is just a question of whether you want to make a conscious decision to move to later Alpine releases.\r\n\r\n## Support for ARM32?\r\n\r\nWe produce Alpine images for x64 (and ARM64, shortly). The [Alpine 3.9 announcement](https://twitter.com/alpinelinux/status/1090416212822110214) made mention of support for ARM32v7. We would like to enable .NET Core [Alpine-based images on ARM32](https://github.com/gliderlabs/docker-alpine/issues/463#issuecomment-460530395). We are patiently waiting for that to happen. If that's important to you, you should comment on that thread.","Url":"https://github.com/dotnet/announcements/issues/99","RelatedDescription":"Open issue \"Supporting new Alpine versions (for containers)\" (#99)"},{"Id":"409840927","IsPullRequest":false,"CreatedAt":"2019-02-13T14:48:21","Actor":"TaraOverfield","Number":"98","RawContent":null,"Title":"February 2019 .NET Updates","State":"open","Body":"# February 2019 .NET Updates\r\nThe following .NET updates were released in February 2019.

To check the currently installed runtimes, open a command prompt and run the `dotnet --info` command. If you have a 2.1 or greater runtime installed, you'll see output like the following;\r\n\r\n```text\r\n.NET Core SDK (reflecting any global.json):\r\n Version:   2.2.100\r\n Commit:    b9f2fa0ca8\r\n\r\nRuntime Environment:\r\n OS Name:     Windows\r\n OS Version:  10.0.17134\r\n OS Platform: Windows\r\n RID:         win10-x64\r\n Base Path:   C:\\Program Files\\dotnet\\sdk\\2.2.100\\\r\n\r\nHost (useful for support):\r\n  Version: 2.2.0\r\n  Commit:  1249f08fed\r\n\r\n.NET Core SDKs installed:\r\n  2.1.5 [C:\\Program Files\\dotnet\\sdk]\r\n  2.1.502 [C:\\Program Files\\dotnet\\sdk]\r\n  2.2.100 [C:\\Program Files\\dotnet\\sdk]\r\n\r\n.NET Core runtimes installed:\r\n  Microsoft.AspNetCore.All 2.1.6 [C:\\Program Files\\dotnet\\shared\\Microsoft.AspNetCore.All]\r\n  Microsoft.AspNetCore.App 2.1.6 [C:\\Program Files\\dotnet\\shared\\Microsoft.AspNetCore.App]\r\n  Microsoft.AspNetCore.All 2.2.0 [C:\\Program Files\\dotnet\\shared\\Microsoft.AspNetCore.All]\r\n  Microsoft.AspNetCore.App 2.2.0 [C:\\Program Files\\dotnet\\shared\\Microsoft.AspNetCore.App]\r\n  Microsoft.NETCore.App 2.1.6 [C:\\Program Files\\dotnet\\shared\\Microsoft.NETCore.App]\r\n  Microsoft.NETCore.App 2.2.0 [C:\\Program Files\\dotnet\\shared\\Microsoft.NETCore.App]\r\n\r\nTo install additional .NET Core runtimes or SDKs:\r\n  https://aka.ms/dotnet-download\r\n```\r\n\r\nIf your host version is 2.1.x and the highest `Microsoft.NETCore.App` runtime version is less than 2.1.7, you're vulnerable to this issue.\r\nIf your host version is 2.2.x and the highest 2.1.x `Microsoft.NETCore.App` runtime version is less than 2.2.1, you're vulnerable to this issue.\r\n\r\nYou will not see SDK versions if you have only installed the runtime.\r\n\r\n#### Applications not using Microsoft.NetCore.App\r\n\r\nThe affected assembly is also available separately as a NuGet package. If you are not using Microsoft.NetCore.App, you may still be affected if you are referencing the packages listed above.\r\n\r\n##### Direct dependencies\r\n\r\nDirect dependencies are discoverable by examining your `csproj` file. They can be fixed by [editing the project file](#fixing-direct-dependencies) or using NuGet to update the dependency.\r\n\r\n##### Transitive dependencies\r\n\r\nTransitive dependencies occur when you add a package to your project that in turn relies on another package. For example, if Contoso publishes a package `Contoso.Utility` which, in turn, depends on `Contoso.Internals` and you add the `Contoso.Utility` package to your project now your project has a direct dependency on `Contoso.Utility` and, because `Contoso.Utility` depends 'Contoso.Internals', your application gains a transitive dependency on the `Contoso.Internals` package.\r\n\r\nTransitive dependencies are reviewable in two ways:\r\n\r\n* In the Visual Studio Solution Explorer window, which supports searching.\r\n* By examining the `project.assets.json` file contained in the obj directory of your project for `csproj` based projects\r\n\r\nThe `project.assets.json` files are the authoritative list of all packages used by your project, containing both direct and transitive dependencies.\r\n\r\nThere are two ways to view transitive dependencies. You can either [use Visual Studio’s Solution Explorer](#vs-solution-explorer), or you can review [the `project.assets.json` file](#project-assets-json)).\r\n\r\n##### <a name=\"vs-solution-explorer\"></a>Using Visual Studio Solution Explorer\r\n\r\nTo use Solution Explorer, open the project in Visual Studio, and then press Ctrl+; to activate the search in Solution Explorer. Search for the [vulnerable package](#affected-software) and make a note of the version numbers of any results you find.\r\n\r\nFor example, searching for `Microsoft.AspNetCore.Mvc.Core` in an example project that contains a package that takes a dependency on `Microsoft.AspNetCore.Mvc` shows the following results in Visual Studio 2017:\r\n\r\n![Screenshot of search results in Visual Studio 2017](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/796298/25858816/8ecdc2b4-3491-11e7-9363-746804bb9832.png)\r\n\r\nThe search results appear as a tree. In the previous results, you can see that a reference to `Microsoft.AspNetCore.Mvc.Core` version 1.1.2 is discovered.\r\n\r\nUnder the Dependencies node is a NuGet node. Under the NuGet node is the list of packages you have directly taken a dependency on and their versions.\r\nIn screenshot, the application takes a direct dependency on `Microsoft.AspNetCore.Mvc`. `Microsoft.AspNetCore.Mvc` in turn has leaf nodes that list its dependencies and their versions.\r\nThe `Microsoft.AspNetCore.Mvc` package takes a dependency on a version of `Microsoft.AspNetCore.Mvc.ApiExplorer`, that in turn takes a dependency on a version of `Microsoft.AspNetCore.Mvc.Core`.\r\n\r\n##### <a name=\"project-assets-json\"></a> Manually reviewing project.assets.json\r\n\r\nOpen the *project.assets.json* file from your project’s obj directory in your editor. We suggest you use an editor that understands JSON and allows you to collapse and expand nodes to review this file.\r\nVisual Studio and Visual Studio Code provide JSON friendly editing.\r\n\r\nSearch the *project.assets.json* file for the [vulnerable package](#affected-software), using the format `packagename/` for each of the package names from the preceding table. If you find the assembly name in your search:\r\n\r\n* Examine the line on which they are found, the version number is after the `/`.\r\n* Compare to the [vulnerable versions table](#affected-software).\r\n\r\nFor example, a search result that shows `System.Private.Uri/4.3.0` is a reference to version 4.3.0 of `System.Private.Uri`.\r\n\r\nIf your *project.assets.json* file includes references to the [vulnerable package](#affected-software), then you need to fix the transitive dependencies.\r\n\r\nIf you have not found any reference to any vulnerable packages, this means either\r\n\r\n* None of your direct dependencies depend on any vulnerable packages, or\r\n* You have already fixed the problem by updating the direct dependencies.\r\n\r\n### <a name=\"how-fix\"></a>How do I fix the issue?\r\n\r\n#### Updating the version of Microsoft.NETCore.App\r\n\r\nIf your host version is a 2.1.x host you must install version 2.1.8 or later of the [.NET Core 2.1 runtime](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/download/dotnet-core/2.1), or corresponding [.NET Core 2.1 SDK](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/download/dotnet-core/2.1).\r\n\r\nIf your host version is a 2.2.x you must install version 2.2.2 or later of the [.NET Core 2.2 runtime](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/download/dotnet-core/2.2), or corresponding  [.NET Core 2.2 SDK](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/download/dotnet-core/2.2).\r\n\r\n#### <a name=\"fixing-direct-dependencies\"></a>Fixing direct dependencies\r\n\r\nOpen *projectname.csproj* in your editor. If you're using Visual Studio, right-click the project and choose **Edit projectname.csproj** from the context menu, where projectname is the name of your project. Look for `PackageReference` elements. The following shows an example project file:\r\n\r\n```xml\r\n<Project Sdk=\"Microsoft.NET.Sdk.Web\">\r\n  <PropertyGroup>\r\n    <TargetFramework>netcoreapp2.1</TargetFramework>\r\n  </PropertyGroup>\r\n  <ItemGroup>\r\n    <PackageReference Include=\"System.Private.Uri\" Version=\"4.3.0\" />\r\n  </ItemGroup>\r\n</Project>\r\n```\r\n\r\nThe preceding example has a reference to the [vulnerable package](#affected-software), as seen by the single `PackageReference` element. The name of the package is in the `Include` attribute.\r\nThe package version number is in the `Version` attribute. The previous example shows a single direct dependency on `System.Private.Uri` version 4.3.0\r\n\r\nTo update the version to the secure package, change the version number to the updated package version as listed on the table [previously](#affected-software).\r\nIn this example, update `System.Private.Uri` to the appropriate [fixed package number](#affected-software) for your major version. Save the *csproj* file. The example *csproj* now looks as follows:\r\n\r\n```xml\r\n<Project Sdk=\"Microsoft.NET.Sdk.Web\">\r\n  <PropertyGroup>\r\n    <TargetFramework>netcoreapp2.1</TargetFramework>\r\n  </PropertyGroup>\r\n  <ItemGroup>\r\n    <PackageReference Include=\"System.Private.Uri\" Version=\"4.3.0\" />\r\n  </ItemGroup>\r\n</Project>\r\n```\r\n\r\nIf you're using Visual Studio and you save your updated *csproj* file, Visual Studio will restore the new package version.\r\nYou can see the restore results by opening the **Output** window (Ctrl+Alt+O) and changing the **Show output from** drop-down list to **Package Manager**.\r\n\r\nIf you're not using Visual Studio, open a command line and change to your project directory. Execute the `dotnet restore` command to restore the updated dependencies.\r\n\r\nNow recompile your application. If after recompilation you see a *Dependency conflict warning*, you must update your other direct dependencies to versions that take a dependency on the updated package.\r\n\r\n#### <a name=\"transitive-dependencies\"></a>Fixing transitive dependencies\r\n\r\nIf your transitive dependency review found references to the [vulnerable package](#affected-software), you must add a direct dependency to the updated package to your *csproj* file to override the transitive dependency.\r\n\r\nOpen *projectname.csproj* in your editor. If you're using Visual Studio, right-click the project and choose **Edit projectname.csproj** from the context menu, where projectname is the name of your project.\r\nLook for `PackageReference` nodes, for example:\r\n\r\n```xml\r\n<Project Sdk=\"Microsoft.NET.Sdk.\">\r\n  <PropertyGroup>\r\n    <TargetFramework>net461</TargetFramework>\r\n  </PropertyGroup>\r\n  <ItemGroup>\r\n    <PackageReference Include=\"ThirdParty.NotUpdatedYet\" Version=\"2.0.0\" />\r\n  </ItemGroup>\r\n</Project>\r\n```\r\n\r\nYou must add a direct dependency to the updated version of the [vulnerable package](#affected-software) by adding it to the *csproj* file.\r\nYou do this by adding a new line to the dependencies section, referencing the fixed version.\r\nFor example, if your search showed a transitive reference to a vulnerable `System.ServiceModel.Http` version, you'd add a reference to the [fixed package number](#affected-software).\r\n\r\n```xml\r\n<Project Sdk=\"Microsoft.NET.Sdk.Web\">\r\n  <PropertyGroup>\r\n    <TargetFramework>net461</TargetFramework>\r\n  </PropertyGroup>\r\n  <ItemGroup>\r\n    <PackageReference Include=\"System.Private.Uri\" Version=\"4.3.0\" />\r\n    <PackageReference Include=\"ThirdParty.NotUpdatedYet\" Version=\"2.0.0\" />\r\n  </ItemGroup>\r\n</Project>\r\n```\r\n\r\nAfter you've added the direct dependency reference, save your *csproj* file.\r\n\r\nIf you're using Visual Studio, save your updated *csproj* file and Visual Studio will restore the new package versions.\r\nYou can see the restore results by opening the **Output** window (Ctrl+Alt+O) and changing the **Show output from** drop-down list to **Package Manager**.\r\n\r\nIf you're not using Visual Studio, open a command line and change to your project directory. Execute the `dotnet restore` command to restore the new dependencies.\r\n\r\n##### Rebuilding your application\r\n\r\nFinally, you must rebuild your application, test, and redeploy.\r\n\r\n## Other Information\r\n\r\n### Reporting Security Issues\r\n\r\nIf you have found a potential security issue in .NET Core, please email details to secure@microsoft.com.

This advisory also provides guidance on what developers can do to update their applications to remove this vulnerability.\r\n\r\nMicrosoft is aware of an information disclosure vulnerability exists in .NET Framework and .NET Core which allows bypassing Cross-origin Resource Sharing (CORS) configurations. An attacker who successfully exploited the vulnerability could retrieve content, that is normally restricted, from a web application.\r\n\r\nThe security update addresses the vulnerability by enforcing CORS configuration to prevent its bypass.\r\n\r\n## Discussion\r\n\r\nDiscussion for this issue can be found at https://github.com/dotnet/corefx/issues/34428\r\n\r\n### <a name=\"mitigation-factors\"></a>Mitigation factors\r\n\r\nMicrosoft has not identified any mitigating factors for this vulnerability.\r\n\r\n## <a name=\"affected-software\"></a>Affected software\r\n\r\nAny .NET Core based application that uses the [System.Net.Http](https://www.nuget.org/packages/System.Net.Http/) package with a vulnerable version listed below.\r\n\r\nPackage name | Vulnerable versions | Secure versions\r\n------------ | ------------------- | -------------------------\r\nMicrosoft.NETCore.App (System.Net.Http) | 2.1.0, 2.1.1, 2.1.2, 2.1.3, 2.1.4, 2.1.5, 2.1.6 | 2.1.7\r\nMicrosoft.NETCore.App (System.Net.Http) | 2.2.0 | 2.2.1\r\n\r\n## <a name=\"advisory-faq\"></a>Advisory FAQ\r\n\r\n### <a name=\"how-affected\"></a>How do I know if I am affected?\r\n\r\n#### Applications that use Microsoft.NetCore.App\r\n\r\n`System.Net.Http` is distributed as part of the .NET Core 2.1 runtime. To check the currently installed runtimes, open a command prompt and run the `dotnet --info` command. If you have a 2.1 or greater runtime installed, you'll see output like the following;\r\n\r\n```text\r\n.NET Core SDK (reflecting any global.json):\r\n Version:   2.2.100\r\n Commit:    b9f2fa0ca8\r\n\r\nRuntime Environment:\r\n OS Name:     Windows\r\n OS Version:  10.0.17134\r\n OS Platform: Windows\r\n RID:         win10-x64\r\n Base Path:   C:\\Program Files\\dotnet\\sdk\\2.2.100\\\r\n\r\nHost (useful for support):\r\n  Version: 2.2.0\r\n  Commit:  1249f08fed\r\n\r\n.NET Core SDKs installed:\r\n  2.1.5 [C:\\Program Files\\dotnet\\sdk]\r\n  2.1.502 [C:\\Program Files\\dotnet\\sdk]\r\n  2.2.100 [C:\\Program Files\\dotnet\\sdk]\r\n\r\n.NET Core runtimes installed:\r\n  Microsoft.AspNetCore.All 2.1.6 [C:\\Program Files\\dotnet\\shared\\Microsoft.AspNetCore.All]\r\n  Microsoft.AspNetCore.App 2.1.6 [C:\\Program Files\\dotnet\\shared\\Microsoft.AspNetCore.App]\r\n  Microsoft.AspNetCore.All 2.2.0 [C:\\Program Files\\dotnet\\shared\\Microsoft.AspNetCore.All]\r\n  Microsoft.AspNetCore.App 2.2.0 [C:\\Program Files\\dotnet\\shared\\Microsoft.AspNetCore.App]\r\n  Microsoft.NETCore.App 2.1.6 [C:\\Program Files\\dotnet\\shared\\Microsoft.NETCore.App]\r\n  Microsoft.NETCore.App 2.2.0 [C:\\Program Files\\dotnet\\shared\\Microsoft.NETCore.App]\r\n\r\nTo install additional .NET Core runtimes or SDKs:\r\n  https://aka.ms/dotnet-download\r\n```\r\n\r\nIf your host version is 2.1.x and the highest `Microsoft.NETCore.App` runtime version is less than 2.1.7, you're vulnerable to this issue.\r\nIf your host version is 2.2.x and the highest 2.1.x `Microsoft.NETCore.App` runtime version is less than 2.1.7, you're vulnerable to this issue.\r\n\r\nYou will not see SDK versions if you have only installed the runtime.\r\n\r\n#### Applications not using Microsoft.NetCore.App\r\n\r\nThe affected assembly is also available separately as a NuGet package. If you are not using Microsoft.NetCore.App, you may still be affected if you are referencing the packages listed above.\r\n\r\n##### Direct dependencies\r\n\r\nDirect dependencies are discoverable by examining your `csproj` file. They can be fixed by [editing the project file](#fixing-direct-dependencies) or using NuGet to update the dependency.\r\n\r\n##### Transitive dependencies\r\n\r\nTransitive dependencies occur when you add a package to your project that in turn relies on another package. For example, if Contoso publishes a package `Contoso.Utility` which, in turn, depends on `Contoso.Internals` and you add the `Contoso.Utility` package to your project now your project has a direct dependency on `Contoso.Utility` and, because `Contoso.Utility` depends 'Contoso.Internals', your application gains a transitive dependency on the `Contoso.Internals` package.\r\n\r\nTransitive dependencies are reviewable in two ways:\r\n\r\n* In the Visual Studio Solution Explorer window, which supports searching.\r\n* By examining the `project.assets.json` file contained in the obj directory of your project for `csproj` based projects\r\n\r\nThe `project.assets.json` files are the authoritative list of all packages used by your project, containing both direct and transitive dependencies.\r\n\r\nThere are two ways to view transitive dependencies. You can either [use Visual Studio’s Solution Explorer](#vs-solution-explorer), or you can review [the `project.assets.json` file](#project-assets-json)).\r\n\r\n##### <a name=\"vs-solution-explorer\"></a>Using Visual Studio Solution Explorer\r\n\r\nTo use Solution Explorer, open the project in Visual Studio, and then press Ctrl+; to activate the search in Solution Explorer. Search for the [vulnerable package](#affected-software) and make a note of the version numbers of any results you find.\r\n\r\nFor example, searching for `Microsoft.AspNetCore.Mvc.Core` in an example project that contains a package that takes a dependency on `Microsoft.AspNetCore.Mvc` shows the following results in Visual Studio 2017:\r\n\r\n![Screenshot of search results in Visual Studio 2017](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/796298/25858816/8ecdc2b4-3491-11e7-9363-746804bb9832.png)\r\n\r\nThe search results appear as a tree. In the previous results, you can see that a reference to `Microsoft.AspNetCore.Mvc.Core` version 1.1.2 is discovered.\r\n\r\nUnder the Dependencies node is a NuGet node. Under the NuGet node is the list of packages you have directly taken a dependency on and their versions.\r\nIn screenshot, the application takes a direct dependency on `Microsoft.AspNetCore.Mvc`. `Microsoft.AspNetCore.Mvc` in turn has leaf nodes that list its dependencies and their versions.\r\nThe `Microsoft.AspNetCore.Mvc` package takes a dependency on a version of `Microsoft.AspNetCore.Mvc.ApiExplorer`, that in turn takes a dependency on a version of `Microsoft.AspNetCore.Mvc.Core`.\r\n\r\n##### <a name=\"project-assets-json\"></a> Manually reviewing project.assets.json\r\n\r\nOpen the *project.assets.json* file from your project’s obj directory in your editor. We suggest you use an editor that understands JSON and allows you to collapse and expand nodes to review this file.\r\nVisual Studio and Visual Studio Code provide JSON friendly editing.\r\n\r\nSearch the *project.assets.json* file for the [vulnerable package](#affected-software), using the format `packagename/` for each of the package names from the preceding table. If you find the assembly name in your search:\r\n\r\n* Examine the line on which they are found, the version number is after the `/`.\r\n* Compare to the [vulnerable versions table](#affected-software).\r\n\r\nFor example, a search result that shows `SSystem.Net.Http/4.3.0` is a reference to version 4.3.0 of `System.Net.Http`.\r\n\r\nIf your *project.assets.json* file includes references to the [vulnerable package](#affected-software), then you need to fix the transitive dependencies.\r\n\r\nIf you have not found any reference to any vulnerable packages, this means either\r\n\r\n* None of your direct dependencies depend on any vulnerable packages, or\r\n* You have already fixed the problem by updating the direct dependencies.\r\n\r\n### <a name=\"how-fix\"></a>How do I fix the issue?\r\n\r\n#### Updating the version of Microsoft.NETCore.App\r\n\r\nIf your host version is a 2.1.x host you must install version 2.1.7 or later of the [.NET Core 2.1 runtime](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/download/dotnet-core/2.1), or corresponding [.NET Core 2.1 SDK](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/download/dotnet-core/2.1).\r\n\r\nIf your host version is a 2.2.x you must install version 2.2.1 or later of the [.NET Core 2.2 runtime](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/download/dotnet-core/2.2), or corresponding  [.NET Core 2.2 SDK](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/download/dotnet-core/2.2).\r\n\r\n#### <a name=\"fixing-direct-dependencies\"></a>Fixing direct dependencies\r\n\r\nOpen *projectname.csproj* in your editor. If you're using Visual Studio, right-click the project and choose **Edit projectname.csproj** from the context menu, where projectname is the name of your project. Look for `PackageReference` elements. The following shows an example project file:\r\n\r\n```xml\r\n<Project Sdk=\"Microsoft.NET.Sdk.Web\">\r\n  <PropertyGroup>\r\n    <TargetFramework>netcoreapp2.1</TargetFramework>\r\n  </PropertyGroup>\r\n  <ItemGroup>\r\n    <PackageReference Include=\"System.Net.Http\" Version=\"4.3.0\" />\r\n  </ItemGroup>\r\n</Project>\r\n```\r\n\r\nThe preceding example has a reference to the [vulnerable package](#affected-software), as seen by the single `PackageReference` element. The name of the package is in the `Include` attribute.\r\nThe package version number is in the `Version` attribute. The previous example shows a single direct dependency on `System.Net.Http` version 4.3.0\r\n\r\nTo update the version to the secure package, change the version number to the updated package version as listed on the table [previously](#affected-software).\r\nIn this example, update `System.IO.Pipelines` to the appropriate [fixed package number](#affected-software) for your major version. Save the *csproj* file. The example *csproj* now looks as follows:\r\n\r\n```xml\r\n<Project Sdk=\"Microsoft.NET.Sdk.Web\">\r\n  <PropertyGroup>\r\n    <TargetFramework>netcoreapp2.1</TargetFramework>\r\n  </PropertyGroup>\r\n  <ItemGroup>\r\n    <PackageReference Include=\"System.Net.Http\" Version=\"4.3.5\" />\r\n  </ItemGroup>\r\n</Project>\r\n```\r\n\r\nIf you're using Visual Studio and you save your updated *csproj* file, Visual Studio will restore the new package version.\r\nYou can see the restore results by opening the **Output** window (Ctrl+Alt+O) and changing the **Show output from** drop-down list to **Package Manager**.\r\n\r\nIf you're not using Visual Studio, open a command line and change to your project directory. Execute the `dotnet restore` command to restore the updated dependencies.\r\n\r\nNow recompile your application. If after recompilation you see a *Dependency conflict warning*, you must update your other direct dependencies to versions that take a dependency on the updated package.\r\n\r\n#### <a name=\"transitive-dependencies\"></a>Fixing transitive dependencies\r\n\r\nIf your transitive dependency review found references to the [vulnerable package](#affected-software), you must add a direct dependency to the updated package to your *csproj* file to override the transitive dependency.\r\n\r\nOpen *projectname.csproj* in your editor. If you're using Visual Studio, right-click the project and choose **Edit projectname.csproj** from the context menu, where projectname is the name of your project.\r\nLook for `PackageReference` nodes, for example:\r\n\r\n```xml\r\n<Project Sdk=\"Microsoft.NET.Sdk.\">\r\n  <PropertyGroup>\r\n    <TargetFramework>net461</TargetFramework>\r\n  </PropertyGroup>\r\n  <ItemGroup>\r\n    <PackageReference Include=\"ThirdParty.NotUpdatedYet\" Version=\"2.0.0\" />\r\n  </ItemGroup>\r\n</Project>\r\n```\r\n\r\nYou must add a direct dependency to the updated version of the [vulnerable package](#affected-software) by adding it to the *csproj* file.\r\nYou do this by adding a new line to the dependencies section, referencing the fixed version.\r\nFor example, if your search showed a transitive reference to a vulnerable `System.ServiceModel.Http` version, you'd add a reference to the [fixed package number](#affected-software).\r\n\r\n```xml\r\n<Project Sdk=\"Microsoft.NET.Sdk.Web\">\r\n  <PropertyGroup>\r\n    <TargetFramework>net461</TargetFramework>\r\n  </PropertyGroup>\r\n  <ItemGroup>\r\n    <PackageReference Include=\"System.Net.Http\" Version=\"4.3.5\" />\r\n    <PackageReference Include=\"ThirdParty.NotUpdatedYet\" Version=\"2.0.0\" />\r\n  </ItemGroup>\r\n</Project>\r\n```\r\n\r\nAfter you've added the direct dependency reference, save your *csproj* file.\r\n\r\nIf you're using Visual Studio, save your updated *csproj* file and Visual Studio will restore the new package versions.\r\nYou can see the restore results by opening the **Output** window (Ctrl+Alt+O) and changing the **Show output from** drop-down list to **Package Manager**.\r\n\r\nIf you're not using Visual Studio, open a command line and change to your project directory. Execute the `dotnet restore` command to restore the new dependencies.\r\n\r\n##### Rebuilding your application\r\n\r\nFinally, you must rebuild your application, test, and redeploy.\r\n\r\n## Other Information\r\n\r\n### Reporting Security Issues\r\n\r\nIf you have found a potential security issue in .NET Core, please email details to secure@microsoft.com.

However, .NET hasn't had a (great) built-in way to deal with JSON. Instead we've relied on [Json.NET] which continues to serve the .NET ecosystem well.\r\n\r\n[Json.NET]: https://www.newtonsoft.com/json\r\n\r\nMoving forward, we plan on making some changes to our JSON support:\r\n\r\n* **We need high-performance JSON APIs**. We need a new set of JSON APIs that are highly tuned for performance by using `Span<T>` and allows for processing UTF-8 directly without having to transcode to UTF-16 `string` instances. Both aspects are critical for our web server Kestrel, where throughput is a key requirement.\r\n\r\n* **Remove dependency from ASP.NET Core to Json.NET**. Today, ASP.NET Core has a dependency on Json.NET. While this provides a tight integration between ASP.NET Core and Json.NET, it also means that application developers cannot freely choose which JSON library they are using. This is also problematic for customers of Json.NET as the version is dictated by the underlying platform. However, Json.NET is frequently updated and application developers often want to -- or even have to -- use a specific version. Thus, we want to remove the dependency from ASP.NET Core 3.0 to Json.NET so that customers can choose which version to use, without fearing they might accidentally break the underlying platform. In addition, this makes it also possible to plug-in an entirely different JSON library.\r\n\r\n* **Provide an ASP.NET Core integration package for Json.NET**. Json.NET has basically become the Swiss Army knife of JSON processing in .NET. It provides many options and facilities that allow customers to handle their JSON needs with ease. We don't want to compromise on the Json.NET support customers are getting today, for example, the ability to configure the JSON serialization via the `AddJsonOptions` extension method. Thus, we want to provide the Json.NET integration as a NuGet package that developers can optionally install so they get all the bells and whistles they get from Json.NET today. The other part of this work item is to ensure we have the right extension points so that other parties can provide similar integration packages for their JSON library of choice.\r\n\r\nBelow are more details around this plan.\r\n\r\n## The need for high-performance JSON APIs\r\n\r\nThe requirements for the .NET stack have changed a bit since the arrival of .NET Core. Historically, .NET has valued usability and convenience. With .NET Core, we've added a focus on performance, and we've made significant investments to serve high performance needs. And the [improvements we made][techempower] in the popular TechEmpower benchmark are a testament to that.\r\n\r\n[techempower]: https://www.techempower.com/blog/2016/11/16/framework-benchmarks-round-13/\r\n\r\nWith .NET Core 2.1, we've added a brand new primitive called [Span\\<T>][span-msdn] that allows us to represent native memory and arrays in a uniform way. With this type, we've also added a set of parsing and encoding APIs that are much more memory efficient without having to resort to unsafe code.\r\n\r\n[span-msdn]: https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/magazine/mt814808.aspx\r\n\r\nPart of the work of minimizing allocations is to avoid having to transcode UTF-8 payloads into UTF-16 strings, purely for parsing reasons. Currently, Json.NET is implemented by reading UTF-16. We need the ability to read (and write) JSON documents directly in UTF-8 because most network protocols (including HTTP) use UTF-8.\r\n\r\nDuring .NET Core 2.1 we've learned that updating our existing APIs to leverage `Span<T>` has limits. While we did add a bunch of overloads that accept spans, we also had to produce brand new APIs that are designed around minimizing allocations and dealing with buffers, which we exposed in `System.Buffers` namespaces. And with `System.IO.Pipelines` we've also added a programming model that enables developers to share buffers without having to deal with lifetime issues.\r\n\r\nBased on these experiences we believe in order to support JSON parsing, we'll need to expose a new set of JSON APIs that are specifically geared for high-performance scenarios.\r\n\r\nYou might wonder why we can't just update Json.NET to include support for parsing JSON using `Span<T>`? Well, James Newton-King -- the author of Json.NET -- has the following to say about that:\r\n\r\n> Json.NET was created over 10 years ago, and since then it has added a wide range of features aimed to help developers work with JSON in .NET. In that time Json.NET has also become far and away NuGet's most depended on and downloaded package, and is the go-to library for JSON support in .NET. Unfortunately, Json.NET's wealth of features and popularity works against making major changes to it. Supporting new technologies like `Span<T>` would require fundamental breaking changes to the library and would disrupt existing applications and libraries that depend on it.\r\n>\r\n> Going forward Json.NET will continue to be worked on and invested in, both addressing known issues today and supporting new platforms in the future. Json.NET has always existed alongside other JSON libraries for .NET, and there will be nothing to prevent you using one or more together, depending on whether you need the performance of the new JSON APIs or the large feature set of Json.NET.\r\n\r\n## Move Json.NET integration into a separate NuGet package\r\n\r\nToday, you cannot use ASP.NET Core without Json.NET because it is a dependency of ASP.NET Core itself. Over the years, we've received feedback that the dependency can conflict with other libraries that have their own dependency on a different version of Json.NET. In the past, we've considered addressing this issue by using a private copy of Json.NET in ASP.NET. However, this would create problems when developers want to configure Json.NET (for instance, in order to control how the serializer behaves when formatting JSON objects).\r\n\r\nMoving forward we'd like to:\r\n\r\n1. Replace the internal usage of Json.NET in ASP.NET Core by the new platform-provided JSON APIs.\r\n\r\n2. Factor the public facing usage of Json.NET into an optional integration package that can be acquired from NuGet.\r\n\r\nSo the existing integration between ASP.NET Core and Json.NET will continue to be supported, but will be moving out of the platform and into a separate package. However, since the integration is then designed to sit on top of the platform, it will also allow customers to update Json.NET to later versions.\r\n\r\nFurthermore, customers who need more performance can also choose to use the new JSON APIs, at the expense of the rich feature set that Json.NET offers.\r\n\r\n## Discussion\r\n\r\nFor a discussion, please go to https://github.com/dotnet/corefx/issues/33115.","Url":"https://github.com/dotnet/announcements/issues/90","RelatedDescription":"Open issue \"The future of JSON in .NET Core 3.0\" (#90)"}],"ResultType":"GitHubIssue"},"Twitter":{"ResultType":"TwitterTimeline","Tweets":[{"Id":"1169325641541357568","CreatedAt":"2019-09-04T19:05:32+00:00","UserScreenname":"dotnet","Text":"Announcing .NET Core 3.0 Preview 9 https://t.co/eOTg9Nc4Su","Source":"<a href=\"https://about.twitter.com/products/tweetdeck\" rel=\"nofollow\">TweetDeck</a>","RetweetCount":267,"FavoriteCount":138,"RawContent":null},{"Id":"1169325512033878016","CreatedAt":"2019-09-04T19:05:01+00:00","UserScreenname":"dotnet","Text":"https://t.co/iOiV9qNspl Core and Blazor updates in .NET Core 3.0 Preview 9 https://t.co/esDON00GK9","Source":"<a href=\"https://about.twitter.com/products/tweetdeck\" rel=\"nofollow\">TweetDeck</a>","RetweetCount":103,"FavoriteCount":62,"RawContent":null},{"Id":"1169016977245032449","CreatedAt":"2019-09-03T22:39:01+00:00","UserScreenname":"dotnet","Text":"Do you care about performance or low-level stuff like SIMD and popcnt?
