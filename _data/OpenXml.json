This leads to bugs if the numbering definitions contain [numbering level definition overrides](https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/documentformat.openxml.wordprocessing.leveloverride.aspx).\n\nFor an example, see the [example document](https://github.com/OfficeDev/Open-Xml-PowerTools/files/434902/Example.of.numbering.definitions.with.same.abstract.numering.definition.docx) and the [processed version](https://github.com/OfficeDev/Open-Xml-PowerTools/files/434917/Example.of.numbering.definitions.with.same.abstract.numering.definition-processed.docx). When opened in Word, the example document displays three lists, each numbered from 1 to 3. After being included in a document built with `DocumentBuilder`, however, the processed version displays as three lists with a consecutive numbering from 1 to 9.\n\nTechnically, this is due to the `CopyNumbering` method in `WordBuilder` only creating a new numbering definition if it can't find one using the same abstract numbering definition. Instead, it should use a map like `CopyComments`.\n\nThis issue is the cause of a bug in our system, so I'll will start working on a fix.\n"}],"ResultType":"GitHubEvent"}},"RunOn":"2018-02-25T05:30:28.4040385Z","RunDurationInMilliseconds":1617}
