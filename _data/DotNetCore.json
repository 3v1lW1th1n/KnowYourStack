If you are using version 6.0.x, you should update to 6.0.6 and if you’re using 5.2.x, you can update to 5.2.4. Of course, you can update to a higher major version too, but we are distributing security updates for all impacted major versions (currently 5.2.x, 5.3.x, 5.4.x and 6.0.x). Additionally, whether or not you update your NuGet packages, all applications submitted to the store after today will be automatically fixed during submission processing.\r\n\r\nIf you do not update your app in the Store, it will automatically be reprocessed and distributed via an application update in the next few weeks. Users who have automatic app updates enabled will get the fix with no intervention on your or their parts. Because updated apps are distributed through the Windows Store, sideloaded apps will not be automatically updated. We recommend that developers who distribute sideloaded apps update the affected NuGet packages, rebuild their applications and distribute them to their users.\r\n\r\nMicrosoft is committed to keeping UWP applications secure and to supporting developers. If you have feedback on the fix distribution process, please let us know at dotnetnative@microsoft.com. \r\n\r\n## Other Information\r\n### Reporting Security Issues\r\n\r\nIf you have found a potential security issue in .NET Core, please email details to secure@microsoft.com.

The Announcements repo for each product (https://github.com/dotnet/Announcements and https://github.com/aspnet/Announcements) will contain this bulletin as an issue and will include a link to a discussion issue where you can ask questions.\r\n\r\n### What if the update breaks my application?\r\nAn application can be pinned to a previous version of the runtime by editing the [application.runtime.config](https://github.com/dotnet/cli/blob/ede74b6be1406ba0c086b6d5fc1a5d4eacff1f01/Documentation/specs/runtime-configuration-file.md#appnameruntimeconfigjson) file for that application and editing the framework version and setting `rollForward` to `false`. This should be treated as a temporary measure and the application updated to work with the patched versions of the framework.\r\n\r\nNote that this file is optional, you may need to create it for each application alongside the executable.\r\n\r\n### External Links\r\n\r\n[CVE-2018-0786](https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2018-0786)\r\n\r\n### Revisions\r\n\r\nV1.0 (Jan 9, 2018): Advisory published.\r\n\r\n_Version 1.0_\r\n_Last Updated 2018-01-09_"},{"Id":"6948315401","Type":"IssuesEvent","CreatedAt":"2017-12-05T23:41:57","Actor":"richlander","Repository":"dotnet/announcements","Organization":"dotnet","RawContent":null,"RelatedAction":"closed","RelatedUrl":"https://github.com/dotnet/announcements/issues/50","RelatedDescription":"Closed issue \".Net Core ARM32 SDK availability\" (#50) at dotnet/announcements","RelatedBody":"Referencing #29.\r\n\r\nWill it be possible to : \r\n\r\na) Provide ARM32 builds for the SDK at its current state\r\nor\r\nb) Provide links on how to build the .Net Core SDK for ARM32?\r\n\r\nThe thing is I am planning to use it in a virtual environnement, through proot + qemu-arm-static.

(Granted, sometimes this will be\r\nobvious \"Open project, VS crashes\" but in general, I need to understand how\r\ncommon a scenario is)\r\n\r\n### Bugs this fixes\r\n\r\n(either VSO or GitHub links)\r\n\r\n### Workarounds, if any\r\n\r\nAlso, why we think they are insufficient for RC vs. RC2, RC3, or RTW\r\n\r\n### Risk\r\n\r\nThis is generally a measure our how central the affected code is to adjacent\r\nscenarios and thus how likely your fix is to destabilize a broader area of code\r\n\r\n### Performance impact\r\n\r\n(with a brief justification for that assessment (e.g. \"Low perf impact because no extra allocations/no complexity changes\" vs. \"Low\")\r\n\r\n### Is this a regression from a previous update?\r\n\r\n### Root cause analysis\r\n\r\nHow did we miss it?  What tests are we adding to guard against it in the future?\r\n\r\n### How was the bug found?\r\n\r\n(E.g. customer reported it vs. ad hoc testing)\r\n\r\n### Test documentation updated?\r\n\r\nIf this is a new non-compiler feature or a significant improvement to an existing feature, update https://github.com/dotnet/roslyn/wiki/Manual-Testing once you know which release it is targeting.\r\n\r\n</details>\r\n"},{"Id":"7109091216","Type":"PullRequestEvent","CreatedAt":"2018-01-17T03:54:47","Actor":"VSadov","Repository":"dotnet/roslyn","Organization":"dotnet","RawContent":null,"RelatedAction":"reopened","RelatedUrl":"https://github.com/dotnet/roslyn/pull/24183","RelatedDescription":null,"RelatedBody":"Fixes https://github.com/dotnet/roslyn/issues/24174"},{"Id":"7109090974","Type":"PullRequestEvent","CreatedAt":"2018-01-17T03:54:40","Actor":"VSadov","Repository":"dotnet/roslyn","Organization":"dotnet","RawContent":null,"RelatedAction":"closed","RelatedUrl":"https://github.com/dotnet/roslyn/pull/24183","RelatedDescription":"Closed pull request \"Capture stackalloc size expression only if needed\" (#24183) at dotnet/roslyn","RelatedBody":"Fixes https://github.com/dotnet/roslyn/issues/24174"},{"Id":"7109064661","Type":"IssuesEvent","CreatedAt":"2018-01-17T03:44:31","Actor":"terrajobst","Repository":"dotnet/roslyn","Organization":"dotnet","RawContent":null,"RelatedAction":"closed","RelatedUrl":"https://github.com/dotnet/roslyn/issues/24278","RelatedDescription":"Closed issue \"# Dear , You sent a payment of 50.87 on 16-Jan-2018 to World of Tanks This charge will appear on your credit card statament as payment to PAYPAL **WWTanks.
