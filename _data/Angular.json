It's currently not the case:\r\n- in component schematic `ngOnInit()`\r\n- in e2e schematics\r\n\r\nThe first one is especially annoying as then we need to add `: void` each time we create a new component.\r\n\r\nThat would also be more consistent with other schematics where the functions return type is indeed explicit (like guards, interceptors, etc.).\r\n\r\nPR done in #16755.

([#&#8203;1450](https://togithub.com/bazelbuild/rules_nodejs/issues/1450)) ([f19245b](https://togithub.com/bazelbuild/rules_nodejs/commit/f19245b))\n\n##### Performance Improvements\n\n-   avoid unnecessary nested depset() ([#&#8203;1435](https://togithub.com/bazelbuild/rules_nodejs/issues/1435)) ([f386322](https://togithub.com/bazelbuild/rules_nodejs/commit/f386322))\n\n##### BREAKING CHANGES\n\n-   `templated_args_file` removed from nodejs_binary, nodejs_test & jasmine_node_test. This was a separation of concerns and complicated node.bzl more than necessary while also being rigid in how the params file is formatted. It is more flexible to expose this functionality as another simple rule named params_file.\n\nTo match standard $(location) and $(locations) expansion, params_file args location expansions are also in the standard short_path form (this differs from the old templated_args behavior which was not Bazel idiomatic)\nUsage example:\n\n    load(\"@&#8203;build_bazel_rules_nodejs//:index.bzl\", \"params_file\", \"nodejs_binary\")\n\n    params_file(\n        name = \"params_file\",\n        args = [\n            \"--some_param\",\n            \"$(location //path/to/some:file)\",\n            \"--some_other_param\",\n            \"$(location //path/to/some/other:file)\",\n        ],\n        data = [\n            \"//path/to/some:file\",\n            \"//path/to/some/other:file\",\n        ],\n    )\n\n    nodejs_binary(\n        name = \"my_binary\",\n        data = [\":params_file\"],\n        entry_point = \":my_binary.js\",\n        templated_args = [\"$(location :params_file)\"],\n    )\n\n-   bootstrap attribute in nodejs_binary, nodejs_test & jasmine_node_test removed\n\nThis can be replaced with the `--node_options=--require=$(location label)` argument such as,\n\n    nodejs_test(\n    name = \"bootstrap_test\",\n    templated_args = [\"--node_options=--require=$(rlocation $(location :bootstrap.js))\"],\n    entry_point = \":bootstrap.spec.js\",\n    data = [\"bootstrap.js\"],\n    )\n\nor\n\n    jasmine_node_test(\n    name = \"bootstrap_test\",\n    srcs = [\"bootstrap.spec.js\"],\n    templated_args = [\"--node_options=--require=$(rlocation $(location :bootstrap.js))\"],\n    data = [\"bootstrap.js\"],\n    )\n\n`templated_args` `$(location)` and `$(locations)` are now correctly expanded when there is no space before `$(location`\nsuch as `templated_args = [\"--node_options=--require=$(rlocation $(location :bootstrap.js))\"]`.\n\nPath is returned in runfiles manifest path format such as `repo/path/to/file`. This differs from how $(location)\nand $(locations) expansion behaves in expansion the `args` attribute of a _\\_binary or _\\_test which returns\nthe runfiles short path of the format `./path/to/file` for user repo and `../external_repo/path/to/file` for external\nrepositories. We may change this behavior in the future with $(mlocation) and $(mlocations) used to expand\nto the runfiles manifest path.\nSee <https://docs.bazel.build/versions/master/be/common-definitions.html#common-attributes-binaries>.\n\n-   -   pkg_npm attribute packages renamed to nested_packages\n-   pkg_npm attribute replacements renamed to substitutions\n-   **builtin:** legacy [@&#8203;build](https://togithub.com/build)\\_bazel_rules_nodejs//internal/jasmine_node_test removed; use jasmine_node_test from [@&#8203;bazel/jasmine](https://togithub.com/bazel/jasmine) npm package instead\n-   **builtin:** `args` in yarn_install and npm_install can be used to pass arbitrary arguments so we removed the following attributes:\n-   prod_only from yarn_install and npm_install; should be replaced by args = [\"--prod\"] and args = [\"--production\"] respectively\n-   frozen_lockfile from yarn_install; should be replaced by args = [\"--frozen-lockfile\"]\n-   network_timeout from yanr_install; should be replaced by args = [\"--network_timeout\", \"<time in ms>\"]\n-   **builtin:** `npm_package` renamed to `pkg_npm`.

Migrating the entire code base to Angular is not technically viable at this point in time. As a solution I have dual bootstrap the AngularJS application with the Angular ngUpgrade module so the application can be migrated over time. \r\n\r\nAt this initial stage of the project I am using the existing webpack.config to build the app. My webpack.config handles the transpilation of the Typescript and Angular by way of the ts-loader. Everything compiles and loads and I can proceed with Angular while maintaining existing AngularJS code.\r\n\r\nAt present I do not get the full benefit of the Angular CLI, but will in future as more legacy code is migrated and the CLI is used to it's full capability. At present thou it should be possible for me to use the lint and test commands against all new Angular code even thou it isn't being built or served by the Angular CLI.\r\n\r\n#### The actual feature request\r\n\r\nThe issue comes into play when I attempt to use `ng test` to test new Angular components. `ng test`, or more specifically the angular-devkit/build-angular:karma plugin. Out of the box it doesn't support native ES6 imports for html files within Angular components. Running `ng test` on files written like:\r\n\r\n```\r\nimport {Component} from '@angular/core';\r\n\r\nimport template from './my-component.component.html';\r\n\r\n@Component({\r\n    selector: 'my-component',\r\n    template\r\n})\r\npublic class MyComponent {\r\n```\r\n\r\nresults in:\r\n\r\n```\r\nERROR in ./src/app/my-component/my-component.component.html 1:0\r\nModule parse failed: Unexpected token (1:0)\r\nYou may need an appropriate loader to handle this file type, currently no loaders are configured to process this file. See https://webpack.js.org/concepts#loaders\r\n```\r\n\r\nI cannot use the Angular CLI to build at this time, so using templateUrl is out as it results distribution  making requests to the server for the templates. I assume this is because I don't have a full AOT configuration provided natively by the Angular CLI.\r\n\r\n### Describe the solution you'd like\r\n\r\nI would like the `\\.html$` files to be handled by the webpack config generated by @angular-devkit/build-angular/plugins/karma`. This can be achieved simply by adding (or something similar):\r\n\r\n```\r\nwebpackConfig.module.rules.push({\r\n    test: /\\.html$/,\r\n    use: [{loader: 'raw-loader'}]\r\n});\r\n```\r\n\r\nI was thinking `raw-loader` only because you already have it as a dependency; otherwise `html-loader` would also work with the additional configuration option for `caseSensitive: true`. It's a little insane that the plugin supports imports of every other typical file type but not html:\r\n\r\n```\r\n[\r\n  {\r\n    test: /\\.(eot|svg|cur|jpg|png|webp|gif|otf|ttf|woff|woff2|ani)$/,\r\n    loader: 'file-loader',\r\n    options: { name: '[name].[ext]' }\r\n  },\r\n  {\r\n    test: /[\\/\\\\]@angular[\\/\\\\]core[\\/\\\\].+\\.js$/,\r\n    parser: { system: true }\r\n  },\r\n  { test: /[\\/\\\\]hot[\\/\\\\]emitter\\.js$/, parser: { node: [Object] } },\r\n  {\r\n    test: /[\\/\\\\]webpack-dev-server[\\/\\\\]client[\\/\\\\]utils[\\/\\\\]createSocketUrl\\.js$/,\r\n    parser: { node: [Object] }\r\n  },\r\n  { test: /\\.js$/, exclude: /(ngfactory|ngstyle)\\.js$/ },\r\n  {\r\n    test: /\\.js$/,\r\n    exclude: /(ngfactory|ngstyle)\\.js$/,\r\n    enforce: 'pre'\r\n  },\r\n  { exclude: [], test: /\\.css$/, use: [ [Object], [Object] ] },\r\n  {\r\n    exclude: [],\r\n    test: /\\.scss$|\\.sass$/,\r\n    use: [ [Object], [Object], [Object] ]\r\n  },\r\n  {\r\n    exclude: [],\r\n    test: /\\.less$/,\r\n    use: [ [Object], [Object], [Object] ]\r\n  },\r\n  {\r\n    exclude: [],\r\n    test: /\\.styl$/,\r\n    use: [ [Object], [Object], [Object] ]\r\n  },\r\n  {\r\n    test: /\\.tsx?$/,\r\n    loader: '/<omitted>/node_modules/@angular-devkit/build-angular/node_modules/@ngtools/webpack/src/index.js'\r\n  },\r\n  {\r\n    test: /\\.(jsx?|tsx?)$/,\r\n    loader: '/<omitted>/node_modules/coverage-istanbul-loader/lib/index.js',\r\n    options: { esModules: true },\r\n    enforce: 'post',\r\n    exclude: [ /\\.(e2e|spec)\\.ts$/, /node_modules/ ],\r\n    include: '<omitted>'\r\n  }\r\n]\r\n```\r\n\r\nThis shouldn't impact the usage of Angular's template or templateUrls because they aren't native requires or imports; just strings and webpack will ignore them.\r\n\r\n### Describe alternatives you've considered\r\n\r\nI have tried several work arounds including attempting to preprocess the files like in AngularJS and replace templateUrl with the embedded html string. Looked into other angular tooling that will build angular in my existing webpack config; but all these solutions feel dirty.\r\n\r\nMy least offensive workaround for my issue is to publish my own hacked version of the angular-devkit/build-angular library that applies the above mentioned patch so I can process test files in a way I expect until which time I can move to a world strictly with the angular-cli.","Url":"https://github.com/angular/angular-cli/issues/16746","RelatedDescription":"Closed issue \"Add support for *.html via the raw-loader to the webpack.config generated by @angular-devkit/build-angular:karma\" (#16746)"},{"Id":"554563780","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2020-01-24T06:16:36","Actor":"alan-agius4","Number":"16749","RawContent":null,"Title":"ci: restore check for renovate pr user","State":"closed","Body":"We are now back on renovate fork.

(You can also reproduce the issue by manually selecting the text.)\r\n3. Without clicking anywhere else, try the mat-slide-toggle again, and note that it no longer toggles upon click.
