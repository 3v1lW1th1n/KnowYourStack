I'm planning on doing some renames after addressing feedback (see below).\r\n\r\n## Summary\r\n\r\nThis change makes `Frame` the base class for the HTTP/1.1 and HTTP/2 implementations.\r\n\r\nThe HTTP/1.x-specific code in `Frame` is in a subclass called `Http1Frame` (so now `Frame<T>` subclasses `Http1Frame`).\r\n\r\n`Http2Stream` is a subclass of `Frame`.\r\n\r\n`Frame` exposes a few more abstract properties and methods that must be implemented by protocol-specific classes.\r\n\r\nProducing HTTP/1.1 and HTTP/2 output is done via the same interface (`IHttpOutputProducer`), which `OutputProducer` and `Http2OutputProducer` implement.\r\n\r\n## Things I'm not crazy about\r\n\r\n1) Multiple `.FeatureCollection.cs` files. I think the ideal would be to have a single one (`Frame.FeatureCollection.cs`). It would implement HTTP/1.1 and HTTP/2-specific features (upgrade and stream ID, respectively), but those could be nulled out in `OnReset()` where they're not supposed to be implemented. What do you guys think?\r\n\r\n1) The way `Frame.Output` is instantiated by each subclass. It's all internal but ugly still. What do you guys think of moving it to `IHttpProtocolContext` i.e. have it passed to `Frame` instead of instantiated by it?\r\n\r\n1) Protected member variables. They were already there, but now they're uglier IMO because some are not accessed by a direct subclass of `Frame` (e.g. `Frame<T>` accesses `Frame._applicationException`).\r\n\r\n## Planned renames\r\n\r\n* `Frame` -> `HttpProtocol` (I wanted to name it `HttpStream` but @davidfowl didn't like that)\r\n* `FrameAdapter` -> `Http1FrameAdapter`\r\n* `IFrameControl` -> `IHttpResponseControl`\r\n* `FrameRequestStream` -> `HttpRequestStream`\r\n* `FrameResponseStream` -> `HttpResponseStream`\r\n* `FrameRequestHeaders` -> `HttpRequestHeaders`\r\n* `FrameResponseHeaders` -> `HttpResponseHeaders`\r\n* `FrameConnection` -> `HttpConnection`\r\n* `OutputProducer` -> `Http1OutputProducer`\r\n\r\nI believe these would be better done as part of the Bedrock refactoring:\r\n\r\n* `FrameConnectionManager` -> `ConnectionManager` or `HttpConnectionManager` (if HTTP-specific)\r\n* `FrameHeartbeatManager` -> `HeartbeatManager` or `HttpHeartbeatManager` (if HTTP-specific)"}],"ResultType":"GitHubEvent"},"Razor":{"Events":[{"Id":"6597857930","Type":"IssuesEvent","CreatedAt":"2017-09-15T22:20:39","Actor":"ajaybhargavb","Repository":"aspnet/Razor","Organization":"aspnet","RawContent":null,"RelatedAction":"closed","RelatedUrl":"https://github.com/aspnet/Razor/issues/1618","RelatedDescription":"Closed issue \"Port to 2.0.1: TagHelper error: A local or parameter named '__model' cannot be declared in this scope because that name is used in an enclosing local scope to define a local or parameter\" (#1618) at aspnet/Razor","RelatedBody":"Port this fix to 2.0.1: https://github.com/aspnet/Razor/issues/1614"},{"Id":"6597853248","Type":"PullRequestEvent","CreatedAt":"2017-09-15T22:18:52","Actor":"ajaybhargavb","Repository":"aspnet/Razor","Organization":"aspnet","RawContent":null,"RelatedAction":"merged","RelatedUrl":"https://github.com/aspnet/Razor/pull/1687","RelatedDescription":"Merged pull request \"Port to 2.0.1: Fix ModelExpression's in section directive blocks.\" (#1687) at aspnet/Razor","RelatedBody":"Fixes #1618 \r\n\r\nPort of #1614 \r\n\r\nFrom @NTaylorMullen,\r\n- Changed `SectionDirectivePass` to move non-token body nodes from the original `DirectiveIntermediateNode` to the `SectionIntermediateNode`.
