This was a struct that allowed for an immutable context that came in handy to mimic a callstack (such as in nested validation for the union validator).  However, there's a lot of overlap between these context types and it makes sense to combine them. Now, the current element is tracked in a stack based system so that as the validation dives into the documents, the state can easily be tracked."},{"Id":"11131615165","Type":"PullRequestEvent","CreatedAt":"2019-12-20T03:24:31","Actor":"twsouthwick","Repository":"OfficeDev/Open-XML-SDK","Organization":"OfficeDev","RawContent":null,"RelatedAction":"merged","RelatedUrl":"https://github.com/OfficeDev/Open-XML-SDK/pull/662","RelatedDescription":"Merged pull request \"Use ApplicationType to retrieve validators\" (#662) at OfficeDev/Open-XML-SDK","RelatedBody":""},{"Id":"11131458311","Type":"PullRequestEvent","CreatedAt":"2019-12-20T02:48:24","Actor":"twsouthwick","Repository":"OfficeDev/Open-XML-SDK","Organization":"OfficeDev","RawContent":null,"RelatedAction":"opened","RelatedUrl":"https://github.com/OfficeDev/Open-XML-SDK/pull/662","RelatedDescription":"Opened pull request \"Use ApplicationType to retrieve validators\" (#662) at OfficeDev/Open-XML-SDK","RelatedBody":""},{"Id":"11131141787","Type":"PullRequestEvent","CreatedAt":"2019-12-20T01:34:47","Actor":"twsouthwick","Repository":"OfficeDev/Open-XML-SDK","Organization":"OfficeDev","RawContent":null,"RelatedAction":"merged","RelatedUrl":"https://github.com/OfficeDev/Open-XML-SDK/pull/660","RelatedDescription":"Merged pull request \"Allow comparers for hashcode generation\" (#660) at OfficeDev/Open-XML-SDK","RelatedBody":""},{"Id":"11130845688","Type":"PullRequestEvent","CreatedAt":"2019-12-20T00:26:41","Actor":"twsouthwick","Repository":"OfficeDev/Open-XML-SDK","Organization":"OfficeDev","RawContent":null,"RelatedAction":"opened","RelatedUrl":"https://github.com/OfficeDev/Open-XML-SDK/pull/661","RelatedDescription":"Opened pull request \"Add a RootPart property to OpenXmlPackage\" (#661) at OfficeDev/Open-XML-SDK","RelatedBody":""},{"Id":"11130560295","Type":"PullRequestEvent","CreatedAt":"2019-12-19T23:26:10","Actor":"twsouthwick","Repository":"OfficeDev/Open-XML-SDK","Organization":"OfficeDev","RawContent":null,"RelatedAction":"opened","RelatedUrl":"https://github.com/OfficeDev/Open-XML-SDK/pull/660","RelatedDescription":"Opened pull request \"Allow comparers for hashcode generation\" (#660) at OfficeDev/Open-XML-SDK","RelatedBody":""},{"Id":"11130472686","Type":"PullRequestEvent","CreatedAt":"2019-12-19T23:10:08","Actor":"twsouthwick","Repository":"OfficeDev/Open-XML-SDK","Organization":"OfficeDev","RawContent":null,"RelatedAction":"merged","RelatedUrl":"https://github.com/OfficeDev/Open-XML-SDK/pull/657","RelatedDescription":"Merged pull request \"Update FxCop to latest version\" (#657) at OfficeDev/Open-XML-SDK","RelatedBody":""},{"Id":"11130245248","Type":"PullRequestEvent","CreatedAt":"2019-12-19T22:29:46","Actor":"twsouthwick","Repository":"OfficeDev/Open-XML-SDK","Organization":"OfficeDev","RawContent":null,"RelatedAction":"merged","RelatedUrl":"https://github.com/OfficeDev/Open-XML-SDK/pull/658","RelatedDescription":"Merged pull request \"Add fallback for ProjectLoadStyle in Directory.Build.props\" (#658) at OfficeDev/Open-XML-SDK","RelatedBody":"This commit fixes the Directory.Build.props by:\r\n\r\n- adding an Otherwise block for cases where the ProjectLoadStyle variable is not correctly defined and\r\n- renaming DevCore30 to DevCore31 to be consistent with the comment.\r\n\r\nFixes #652."}],"ResultType":"GitHubEvent"},"PowerTools":{"Events":[],"ResultType":"GitHubEvent"}},"RunOn":"2019-12-20T05:30:52.7996142Z","RunDurationInMilliseconds":1293}
