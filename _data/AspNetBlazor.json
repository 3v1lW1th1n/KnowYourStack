I reach for React when I do a SPA currently (although we have a non-critical IT only app we built in Blazor as well), and React Hooks have me pretty excited, because it groups similar logic together much like Feature Folders do for a folder structure.\r\n\r\n**Wrapper Hell**\r\n\r\n[One of the things they discussed](https://youtu.be/dpw9EHDh2bM?t=448) that React Hooks is solving is \"Wrapper Hell\" where you have tons of components nested beneath each other.  [Specifically they call out Context as one of the things they are getting rid of the need for wrappers with](https://youtu.be/dpw9EHDh2bM?t=1905), which is very close to how Cascading parameters work in Blazor with the `<CascadingValue>` wrapper component.\r\n\r\nCurious what the Blazor team thinks about this and if there are any thoughts around perhaps doing something similar to what the React team is moving to with Hooks and getting rid of the need for the wrapper component.\r\n\r\nMy quick thoughts would be something like making global state injectable instead of using a wrapped component... or having access to some grab bag off of the BlazorComponent base class where you could do something like .Get<T> and have it magically grab your value for you.  Those are my crappy 1 minute ideas, but feels like Blazor could do something similar to remove the need for the wrapper component and keep the component trees less nested and easier to follow.\r\n\r\n**React is getting rid of lifecycle methods**\r\n\r\n[React is also moving away from lifecycle methods](https://youtu.be/dpw9EHDh2bM?t=480) like componentDidMount (OnInit/OnInitAsync in Blazor).  They're mostly doing this so that setup (addEventListener) and cleanup (removeEventListener) is wired up in the same spot instead of separate lifecycle methods which led to bugs when you forgot to cleanup for instance.  Curious to hear other's thoughts on this and how it would apply to Blazor.  I personally haven't done any cleanup of my Blazor components, but maybe I'm causing a memory leak I don't know about.\r\n\r\nObviously it's very early days in React Hooks land, but the concepts behind them makes a lot of sense. \r\n Just wanted to generate some discussion.

This greatly simplifies the process of changing Mono versions.\r\n\r\nThis PR also drops the historical support for asm.js fallback. We're making this choice because better alternatives have now emerged for all the primary asm.js fallback scenarios:\r\n\r\n* For Safari, it now supports WebAssembly properly so there's no remaining need for asm.js fallback\r\n* For old browsers such as IE11, the best solution is server-side Blazor. This avoids putting heavy load on the browser, meaning you can get excellent compatibility and perf right back to really ancient versions of IE (given suitable JS polyfills). In the long run it wouldn't be realistic to rely on asm.js fallback because the JS engine in these older browsers typically wouldn't supply acceptable perf.\r\n\r\nThe reason we're making this change (removing asm.js fallback) now is that it's a necessary part of switching to use prebuilt Mono binaries (they don't ship asm.js versions).\r\n\r\n**Debugging improvements**\r\n\r\nThis PR also updates to a newer version of @kumpera's debug proxy.

The idea is to force the user to choose a value from the dropdown when submitting the form.  A value must be provided to the first option that is the empty string.  (see https://stackoverflow.com/a/6048891/189950)  This works, but if the content of the option element is, for example, provided by a field, Blazor incorrectly omits the `value` attribute, which breaks validation (in Chrome and Edge, anyway).\r\n\r\nYou can see this behavior in the example.  The first select element tries to make the \"none\" option text provided by a field (`@noneString`) whereas the second select element just hard codes it to `None`.\r\n\r\nIf you run it, you'll notice that when clicking the submit button, it highlights the second select element as being required and ignores the first one.
