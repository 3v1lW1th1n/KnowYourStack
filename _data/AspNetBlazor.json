Maybe there is a simpler solution.\r\n\r\n~~It works, but I'm not sure if this is a good general solution to the problem.~~ And the problem is that I want to call potentially slow `Blazor.platform.findMethod` only once and store the result in some variable. My first attempt was to call `Blazor.platform.findMethod` in `load` event handler, but it is to early - Blazor is not initialized yet. ~~The above code works because when the first resize event is generated Blazor is already initialized.~~ To solve the problem elegantly we need something like `blazorInitialized` event. Is it available?\r\n\r\n***Update:*** The above code works only if I have the application loaded and then press F5 to refresh the page. It does not work if I open the fresh instance of the browser and then try to load the application for the first time.

First, the URL parser apparently can't deal with whitespace, for no good reason.  And second, this failure causes an unhandled exception that doesn't get reported in the browser's console.
