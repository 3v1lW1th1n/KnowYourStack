There is also plenty of need for [such a feature](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/43097103/redirect-if-resolve-fails-angular-2) on Stackoverflow..","Url":"https://github.com/angular/angular/issues/29089","RelatedDescription":"Open issue \"Router Resolve<T> should have official support for UrlTree based redirection\" (#29089)"},{"Id":"416586145","IsPullRequest":false,"CreatedAt":"2019-03-04T00:24:20","Actor":"naveedahmed1","Number":"29088","RawContent":null,"Title":"Error after upgrade to 8.0.0-beta.6 setNgClass is not a function and applyChanges is not a function","State":"open","Body":"<!--🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅\r\n\r\nOh hi there! 😄\r\n\r\nTo expedite issue processing please search open and closed issues before submitting a new one.\r\nExisting issues often contain information about workarounds, resolution, or progress updates.\r\n\r\n🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅-->\r\n\r\n\r\n# 🐞 bug report\r\n\r\n### Affected Package\r\n<!-- Can you pin-point one or more @angular/* packages as the source of the bug? -->\r\n<!-- ✍️edit: --> The issue is caused by package @angular/....\r\n\r\n`\"@angular/common\": \"8.0.0-beta.6\",`\r\n\r\n### Is this a regression?\r\n\r\n<!-- Did this behavior use to work in the previous version? -->\r\n<!-- ✍️--> Yes, the previous version in which this bug was not present was: \"@angular/common\": \"8.0.0-beta.5\",\r\n\r\n\r\n### Description\r\n\r\nAfter upgrading my app to Angular 8.0.0-beta.6.

But if you want to get crazy to Chrome to test the bug, you can do the following:\r\n\r\nYou can test this on Chrome 72 Windows, the steps are not going to work on Chrome Mac. But I have logs that prove the bug happens in other Chrome version and platforms, maybe, doing different steps, but the state is the same, `serviceworker.controller` is `null`.\r\n\r\nSteps Chrome Windows.\r\n1. Create a app with a checkbox or switch button to activate/descativate notifications.\r\n2. Check the switch in your app will call `requestSubscription()`\r\n3. When the popup is shown, press Block.\r\n4. Go to de addressbar, click in the lock :lock:. Change the notifications state to Allow. Chrome will say you that the page should be reloaded.\r\n6. Reload the page.\r\n7. If you call `requestSubscription()`again, you won't get the popup. Or if you write in the console `serviceworker.controller` you will get `null`.\r\n\r\nHere is an example image. The app is started, `serviceworker.controller` is `null`, but I can get the service worker registration and the push subscription, so `serviceworker.controller` is not needed to get it.
