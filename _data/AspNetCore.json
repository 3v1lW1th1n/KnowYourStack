This is silly.  We are not testing UserManager<TUser>, we should not have to mock its dependencies, or include its functionality in our own tests.\r\n\r\nRight now, to support multiple services that use UserManager<TUser> we have to make something like this:\r\n\r\n```\r\n\tpublic class FakeUserManagerDependencies<T> where T : class\r\n\t{\r\n\t\tpublic readonly Mock<IdentityErrorDescriber> MockedIdentityErrorDescriber = new Mock<IdentityErrorDescriber>();\r\n\t\tpublic readonly Mock<IOptions<IdentityOptions>> MockedIdentityOptions = new Mock<IOptions<IdentityOptions>>();\r\n\t\tpublic readonly Mock<ILogger<UserManager<T>>> MockedLogger = new Mock<ILogger<UserManager<T>>>();\r\n\t\tpublic readonly Mock<ILookupNormalizer> MockedLookupNormalizer = new Mock<ILookupNormalizer>();\r\n\t\tpublic readonly Mock<IPasswordHasher<T>> MockedPasswordHasher = new Mock<IPasswordHasher<T>>();\r\n\r\n\t\tpublic readonly Mock<IEnumerable<IPasswordValidator<T>>>\r\n\t\t\tMockedPasswordValidators = new Mock<IEnumerable<IPasswordValidator<T>>>();\r\n\r\n\t\tpublic readonly Mock<IServiceProvider> MockedServiceProvider = new Mock<IServiceProvider>();\r\n\t\tpublic readonly Mock<IUserStore<T>> MockedUserStore = new Mock<IUserStore<T>>();\r\n\r\n\t\tpublic readonly Mock<IEnumerable<IUserValidator<T>>>\r\n\t\t\tMockedUserValidators = new Mock<IEnumerable<IUserValidator<T>>>();\r\n\t}\r\n\r\n\tpublic class FakeUserManager<T> : UserManager<T> where T : class\r\n\t{\r\n\t\tpublic FakeUserManagerDependencies<T> MockedDependencies { get; }\r\n\r\n\t\tpublic FakeUserManager() : this(new FakeUserManagerDependencies<T>())\r\n\t\t{\r\n\t\t}\r\n\r\n\t\tpublic FakeUserManager(FakeUserManagerDependencies<T> deps)\r\n\t\t\t: base(deps.MockedUserStore.Object,\r\n\t\t\t\tdeps.MockedIdentityOptions.Object,\r\n\t\t\t\tdeps.MockedPasswordHasher.Object,\r\n\t\t\t\tdeps.MockedUserValidators.Object,\r\n\t\t\t\tdeps.MockedPasswordValidators.Object,\r\n\t\t\t\tdeps.MockedLookupNormalizer.Object,\r\n\t\t\t\tdeps.MockedIdentityErrorDescriber.Object,\r\n\t\t\t\tdeps.MockedServiceProvider.Object,\r\n\t\t\t\tdeps.MockedLogger.Object\r\n\t\t\t)\r\n\t\t{\r\n\t\t\tMockedDependencies = deps;\r\n\t\t}\r\n\t}\r\n```\r\n\r\nNow let's say we want to test a method that will retrieve a user and perform some work with that user object.  In our test, we now have to build out the `IUserStore<TUser>`, figure out what `UserManager<TUser>` does \"under the hood\" to return the expected response, and mock out the requests.  Instead, all we should be doing is mocking the `IUserManager<TUser>.FindByNameAsync(string userName)` to return a specific user object.\r\n\r\nThe current way does not allow the tester to properly isolate the actual code under test; we _must_ test the `UserManager<TUser>`'s functionality along with our own.  If the test were to fail, we cannot say for certain that the problem is in our code; for all we know it could be in the inner workings of the `UserManager<TUser>` class.\r\n\r\nThe way this is set up violates many tenets and good practices of code design and unit testing, which are tenets and good practices for a reason.  The level of effort does not seem like it would be especially high either; mostly a 1:1 replacement in code where it's used as a dependency, than a little rewiring in the dependency configuration.\r\n\r\n"}],"ResultType":"GitHubEvent"},"Kestrel":{"Events":[{"Id":"7493427851","Type":"PullRequestEvent","CreatedAt":"2018-04-06T22:15:13","Actor":"ryanbrandenburg","Repository":"aspnet/KestrelHttpServer","Organization":"aspnet","RawContent":null,"RelatedAction":"opened","RelatedUrl":"https://github.com/aspnet/KestrelHttpServer/pull/2471","RelatedDescription":"Opened pull request \"Skip flaky tests\" (#2471) at aspnet/KestrelHttpServer","RelatedBody":"Skip tests from #2434 and #2464."},{"Id":"7493032038","Type":"IssuesEvent","CreatedAt":"2018-04-06T20:30:18","Actor":"joshmackey","Repository":"aspnet/KestrelHttpServer","Organization":"aspnet","RawContent":null,"RelatedAction":"opened","RelatedUrl":"https://github.com/aspnet/KestrelHttpServer/issues/2470","RelatedDescription":"Opened issue \"1000ms delay when only IPv4 address is used when specifying ListenOptions for Kestrel.\" (#2470) at aspnet/KestrelHttpServer","RelatedBody":"I've noticed that http requests to Kestrel take at least 1000ms if only a IPv4 endpoint is bound to.
