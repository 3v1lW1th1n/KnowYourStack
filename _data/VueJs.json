I have used v-model to bind input to vue data. It works perfect if i don't initialize jquery steps plugin. But When i Initialize jquery steps plugin v-model cannot bind the input.\r\n\r\nI think jquery steps is rerendering the html tags so that v-model could not access that input .

Great! However, when an anchor tag is appended to trigger an app behavior (e.g. www.my-vue-spa.com/playlist-1234#fullview), the router pushes this as part of the history so that the back-button undoes the anchor state instead of returning to the previous page.\r\n\r\n### What does the proposed API look like?\r\nThe proposed solution would be to enforce what the current documentation currently suggests: to not let anchor tags drive routing history.

The only action in our entire application that does not have such effects is our scroll to effect.  As it is the only transition-free state change, it often is jarring to users when it occurs.  Adding a simple scroll effect to the scroll behavior would go a long way to making the user experience for many Vue applications more seamless.\r\n\r\n### What does the proposed API look like?\r\nHonestly I have no idea what this would look like as I have only just begun looking into your docs today.  I am a firm believer in keeping the Vue api surface small and straightforward, so I don't think it's a big enough feature to necessitate adding if it is too clunky.

They are logged from inside `vue.runtime.common.js`.\r\nThe actual error with which the unit tests fail is:\r\n\r\n```\r\n    TypeError: Cannot read property 'getters' of undefined\r\n\r\n      at VueComponent.mappedGetter (node_modules/vuex/dist/vuex.common.js:850:73)\r\n      at Proxy.render (src/some-component.vue:726:50)\r\n      at Object.<anonymous> (src/__tests__/test-something.ts:19:21)\r\n```\r\n\r\n---\r\n### Hints\r\n\r\n * When removing `Vue.extend` in `src/some-component.vue` the failing test passes.\r\n * The error only occurs when the `SomeComponent` component is used inside a parent component, hence the test in `src/__tests__/test-some-component.ts` test is passing.\r\n * This also happens with version `2.x.x` of vuex and older versions of jest and vue.\r\n * This issue also happens when not using local vue.\r\n\r\nThis issue **might** be related to other issues across the web:\r\n\r\n * [Cannot read property 'getters' of undefined](https://github.com/vuejs/vue-test-utils/issues/363)\r\n * [Throws \"Cannot read property 'getters' of undefined\" using vuex's dynamic modules](https://github.com/vuejs/vuex-router-sync/issues/46)\r\n * [@vue/test-utils 1.0.0-beta.18 broke unit tests](https://github.com/vuejs/vue-test-utils/issues/699)\r\n\r\n<!-- generated by vue-issues.
