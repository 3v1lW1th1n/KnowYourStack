This advisory also provides guidance on what developers can do to update their applications correctly.\r\n\r\nMicrosoft is aware of a Denial of Service vulnerability in all public versions of .NET core due to improper processing of XML documents. An attacker who successfully exploited this vulnerability could cause a denial of service against a .NET application. A remote unauthenticated attacker could exploit this vulnerability by issuing specially crafted requests to a .NET Core application.\r\n\r\nThe update addresses the vulnerability by correcting how .NET core handles XML document processing.\r\n\r\nSystem administrators are advised to update their .NET Core runtimes to versions 1.0.9, 1.1.6 and 2.0.5. Developers are advised to update their .NET Core SDK to version 2.1.4 or 1.1.7. These runtime and SDK versions will also address CVE-2018-0786,  https://github.com/dotnet/announcements/issues/51\r\n\r\n### Discussion\r\n\r\nPlease use **** TODO: FILL IN ISSUE LINK *** for discussion of this advisory.\r\n\r\n## Affected Software\r\nThe vulnerability affects any Microsoft .NET Core project if it uses any of affected runtime versions listed below\r\n\r\n Runtime Version | Fixed runtime version\r\n----------------| -------------------------\r\n1.0.0, 1.0.1, 1.0.2, 1.0.3, 1.0.4, 1.0.5, 1.0.7, 1.0.8 | 1.0.9\r\n1.1.0, 1.1.1, 1.1.2, 1.1.4, 1.1.5 | 1.1.6\r\n2.0.0, 2.0.3, 2.0.4 |  2.0.5\r\n\r\n### Advisory FAQ\r\n#### How do I know if I am affected?\r\n\r\nTo check the runtimes installed on a computer you must view the contents of the runtime folder. By default these are\r\n\r\n| Operating System          | Location          |\r\n|---------------------------|-------------------|\r\n| Windows | C:\\Program Files\\dotnet\\shared\\Microsoft.NETCore.App\\ |\r\n| macOS | /usr/local/share/dotnet/shared/Microsoft.NETCore.App/    |\r\n| Supported Linux platforms | /usr/share/dotnet/shared/Microsoft.NETCore.App/   |\r\n\r\nEach runtime version is installed in its own directory, where the directory name is the version number. If you do not have a directory for 1.0.9, 1.1.6 or 2.0.2 then any applications targeting .NET Core will be vulnerable. Downloads for all supported platforms can be acquired from https://www.microsoft.com/net/download/\r\n\r\n#### How do I fix my affected application?\r\nApplications can be fixed by installing the latest runtimes or SDKs. Typically application servers only install a runtime package, developer machines install SDKs. Installers can be downloaded from the [Runtime and SDK download archive](https://github.com/dotnet/core/blob/master/release-notes/download-archive.md). Runtime version 1.1.6 will also install runtime version 1.0.9.\r\n\r\nIf you have built a [self-contained application](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/core/deploying/#self-contained-deployments-scd) you must install the new runtime and SDK, recompile your application and redeploy.\r\n\r\n## Other Information\r\n### Reporting Security Issues\r\n\r\nIf you have found a potential security issue in .NET Core, please email details to secure@microsoft.com. Reports may qualify for the .NET Core Bug Bounty. Details of the .NET Core Bug Bounty including Terms and Conditions are at [https://aka.ms/corebounty](https://aka.ms/corebounty).\r\n\r\n### Support\r\nYou can ask questions about this issue on GitHub in the .NET Core or ASP.NET Core organizations. These are located at https://github.com/dotnet/ and https://github.com/aspnet/. The Announcements repo for each product (https://github.com/dotnet/Announcements and https://github.com/aspnet/Announcements) will contain this bulletin as an issue and will include a link to a discussion issue where you can ask questions.\r\n\r\n### What if the update breaks my application?\r\nAn application can be pinned to a previous version of the runtime by editing the [application.runtime.config](https://github.com/dotnet/cli/blob/ede74b6be1406ba0c086b6d5fc1a5d4eacff1f01/Documentation/specs/runtime-configuration-file.md#appnameruntimeconfigjson) file for that application and editing the framework version and setting `rollForward` to `false`. This should be treated as a temporary measure and the application updated to work with the patched versions of the framework.\r\n\r\nNote that this file is optional, you may need to create it for each application alongside the executable.\r\n\r\n### External Links\r\n\r\n[CVE-2018-0764](https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2018-0764)\r\n\r\n### Revisions\r\n\r\nV1.0 (Jan 9, 2018): Advisory published.\r\n\r\n_Version 1.0_\r\n_Last Updated 2018-01-09_\r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  "},{"Id":"7076401836","Type":"IssuesEvent","CreatedAt":"2018-01-09T18:01:26","Actor":"blowdart","Repository":"dotnet/announcements","Organization":"dotnet","RawContent":null,"RelatedAction":"opened","RelatedUrl":"https://github.com/dotnet/announcements/issues/51","RelatedDescription":"Opened issue \"Microsoft Security Advisory CVE-2018-0786: Security Feature Bypass in X509 Certificate Validation\" (#51) at dotnet/announcements","RelatedBody":"# Microsoft Security Advisory CVE-2018-0786\r\n## Security Feature Bypass in X509 Certificate Validation\r\n### Executive Summary \r\n\r\nMicrosoft is releasing this security advisory to provide information about a vulnerability in the public versions of .NET Core 1.0 and 1.1, and 2.0. This advisory also provides guidance on what developers can do to update their applications correctly. \r\n\r\nMicrosoft is aware of a security vulnerability in the public versions of .NET Core where an attacker could present a certificate that is marked invalid for a specific use, but a component uses it for that purpose. This action disregards the Enhanced Key Usage tagging.\r\n\r\nThe security update addresses the vulnerability by ensuring that .NET Core components completely validate certificates.\r\n\r\nSystem administrators are advised to update their .NET Core runtimes to versions 1.0.9, 1.1.6 and 2.0.5. Developers are advised to update their .NET Core SDK to version 2.1.4 or 1.1.7. These runtime and SDK versions will also address CVE-2018-0764 ***** TODO: ADD LINK TO OTHER ISSUE *****\r\n\r\n### Discussion\r\n\r\nPlease use **** TODO: FILL IN ISSUE LINK *** for discussion of this advisory.\r\n\r\n## Affected Software\r\nThe vulnerability affects any Microsoft .NET Core project if it uses any of affected runtime versions listed below\r\n\r\n Runtime Version | Fixed runtime version\r\n----------------| -------------------------\r\n1.0.0, 1.0.1, 1.0.2, 1.0.3, 1.0.4, 1.0.5, 1.0.7, 1.0.8 | 1.0.9\r\n1.1.0, 1.1.1, 1.1.2, 1.1.4, 1.1.5 | 1.1.6\r\n2.0.0, 2.0.3, 2.0.4 |  2.0.5\r\n\r\nThis vulnerability also affects any .NET native applications using the following NuGet packages.\r\n\r\nNuGet Packages | Fixed NuGet Packages\r\n-- | --\r\nMicrosoft.NETCore.UniversalWindowsPlatform 5.2.* (contains   .NET native 1.4.*) | Microsoft.NETCore.UniversalWindowsPlatform 5.2.4\r\nMicrosoft.NETCore.UniversalWindowsPlatform 5.3.* (contains   .NET native 1.6.*) | Microsoft.NETCore.UniversalWindowsPlatform 5.3.5\r\nMicrosoft.NETCore.UniversalWindowsPlatform 5.4.* (contains   .NET native 1.7.*) | Microsoft.NETCore.UniversalWindowsPlatform 5.4.2\r\nMicrosoft.NETCore.UniversalWindowsPlatform 6.0.* (contains   .NET native 2.0.*) | Microsoft.NETCore.UniversalWindowsPlatform 6.0.6\r\n\r\n### Advisory FAQ\r\n#### How do I know if I am affected?\r\n\r\nTo check the runtimes installed on a computer you must view the contents of the runtime folder. By default these are\r\n\r\n| Operating System          | Location          |\r\n|---------------------------|-------------------|\r\n| Windows | C:\\Program Files\\dotnet\\shared\\Microsoft.NETCore.App\\ |\r\n| macOS | /usr/local/share/dotnet/shared/Microsoft.NETCore.App/    |\r\n| Supported Linux platforms | /usr/share/dotnet/shared/Microsoft.NETCore.App/   |\r\n\r\nEach runtime version is installed in its own directory, where the directory name is the version number. If you do not have a directory for 1.0.9, 1.1.6 or 2.0.2 then any applications targeting .NET Core will be vulnerable. Downloads for all supported platforms can be acquired from https://www.microsoft.com/net/download/\r\n\r\n#### How do I fix my affected application?\r\nApplications can be fixed by installing the latest runtimes or SDKs. Typically application servers only install a runtime package, developer machines install SDKs. Installers can be downloaded from the [Runtime and SDK download archive](https://github.com/dotnet/core/blob/master/release-notes/download-archive.md). Runtime version 1.1.6 will also install runtime version 1.0.9.\r\n\r\nIf you have built a [self-contained application](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/core/deploying/#self-contained-deployments-scd) you must install the new runtime and SDK, recompile your application and redeploy.\r\n\r\n#### How do I fix my .NET native application? \r\n\r\n.NET native requires that applications be re-processed by the .NET native compiler to incorporate the fixes and the re-processed version needs to be distributed via the Windows Store.\r\n\r\nWe recommend that you update your .NET UWP apps to use the latest minor version of the `Microsoft.NETCore.UniversalWindowsPlatform` NuGet package so that you can build and verify that your app works as expected when updated. If you are using version 6.0.x, you should update to 6.0.6 and if you’re using 5.2.x, you can update to 5.2.4. Of course, you can update to a higher major version too, but we are distributing security updates for all impacted major versions (currently 5.2.x, 5.3.x, 5.4.x and 6.0.x). Additionally, whether or not you update your NuGet packages, all applications submitted to the store after today will be automatically fixed during submission processing.\r\n\r\nIf you do not update your app in the Store, it will automatically be reprocessed and distributed via an application update in the next few weeks. Users who have automatic app updates enabled will get the fix with no intervention on your or their parts. Because updated apps are distributed through the Windows Store, sideloaded apps will not be automatically updated. We recommend that developers who distribute sideloaded apps update the affected NuGet packages, rebuild their applications and distribute them to their users.\r\n\r\nMicrosoft is committed to keeping UWP applications secure and to supporting developers. If you have feedback on the fix distribution process, please let us know at dotnetnative@microsoft.com. \r\n\r\n## Other Information\r\n### Reporting Security Issues\r\n\r\nIf you have found a potential security issue in .NET Core, please email details to secure@microsoft.com. Reports may qualify for the .NET Core Bug Bounty. Details of the .NET Core Bug Bounty including Terms and Conditions are at [https://aka.ms/corebounty](https://aka.ms/corebounty).\r\n\r\n### Support\r\nYou can ask questions about this issue on GitHub in the .NET Core or ASP.NET Core organizations. These are located at https://github.com/dotnet/ and https://github.com/aspnet/. The Announcements repo for each product (https://github.com/dotnet/Announcements and https://github.com/aspnet/Announcements) will contain this bulletin as an issue and will include a link to a discussion issue where you can ask questions.\r\n\r\n### What if the update breaks my application?\r\nAn application can be pinned to a previous version of the runtime by editing the [application.runtime.config](https://github.com/dotnet/cli/blob/ede74b6be1406ba0c086b6d5fc1a5d4eacff1f01/Documentation/specs/runtime-configuration-file.md#appnameruntimeconfigjson) file for that application and editing the framework version and setting `rollForward` to `false`. This should be treated as a temporary measure and the application updated to work with the patched versions of the framework.\r\n\r\nNote that this file is optional, you may need to create it for each application alongside the executable.\r\n\r\n### External Links\r\n\r\n[CVE-2018-0786](https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2018-0786)\r\n\r\n### Revisions\r\n\r\nV1.0 (Jan 9, 2018): Advisory published.\r\n\r\n_Version 1.0_\r\n_Last Updated 2018-01-09_"}],"ResultType":"GitHubEvent"},"CoreCLR":{"Events":[{"Id":"7228127045","Type":"PullRequestEvent","CreatedAt":"2018-02-11T05:17:59","Actor":"jkotas","Repository":"dotnet/coreclr","Organization":"dotnet","RawContent":null,"RelatedAction":"opened","RelatedUrl":"https://github.com/dotnet/coreclr/pull/16325","RelatedDescription":"Opened pull request \"Delete PEFingerPrint.*\" (#16325) at dotnet/coreclr","RelatedBody":"Unnecessary dummy type on CoreCLR"},{"Id":"7227932540","Type":"IssuesEvent","CreatedAt":"2018-02-11T02:40:00","Actor":"tannergooding","Repository":"dotnet/coreclr","Organization":"dotnet","RawContent":null,"RelatedAction":"closed","RelatedUrl":"https://github.com/dotnet/coreclr/issues/16216","RelatedDescription":"Closed issue \"[RyuJIT] Update emitIns_R_AR to support SSE4.1 instructions without VEX-encoding \" (#16216) at dotnet/coreclr","RelatedBody":"The SSE4.1 instruction `movntdqa` (used by HW intrinsic `LoadAlignedVector128NonTemporal`) can be correctly generated with  VEX-encoding. \r\nHowever, with legacy SSE encoding, RyuJIT compiles `movntdqa  xmm0, xmmword ptr [rdi]` to \r\n```\r\n66 0F 38 2F\r\n```\r\nand the correct encoding should be\r\n```\r\n66 0f 38 2a 07\r\n```\r\n\r\ncc @CarolEidt @tannergooding "},{"Id":"7227833453","Type":"PullRequestEvent","CreatedAt":"2018-02-11T01:23:36","Actor":"dotnet-maestro-bot","Repository":"dotnet/coreclr","Organization":"dotnet","RawContent":null,"RelatedAction":"opened","RelatedUrl":"https://github.com/dotnet/coreclr/pull/16324","RelatedDescription":"Opened pull request \"Update CoreClr to preview2-26210-06 (master)\" (#16324) at dotnet/coreclr","RelatedBody":"/cc @dotnet/coreclr-auto-update-notify"},{"Id":"7227442077","Type":"IssuesEvent","CreatedAt":"2018-02-10T20:48:30","Actor":"sandreenko","Repository":"dotnet/coreclr","Organization":"dotnet","RawContent":null,"RelatedAction":"closed","RelatedUrl":"https://github.com/dotnet/coreclr/issues/16289","RelatedDescription":"Closed issue \"debug/di/breakpoint.cpp generates warning C4800.\" (#16289) at dotnet/coreclr","RelatedBody":"The warning is 'BOOL': forcing value to bool 'true' or 'false' (performance warning).\r\nBecause all warnings are threated as errors it fails build.\r\n[Example](https://ci.dot.net/job/dotnet_coreclr/job/master/job/arm64_cross_checked_windows_nt_innerloop_flow_prtest/143/console).\r\nStarted to hit after #15819.\r\n\r\nThe full error report:\r\n```\r\nd:\\j\\workspace\\arm64_cross_c---f1ec3c8e\\src\\debug\\di\\breakpoint.cpp(210): error C2220: warning treated as error -

Previously we were passing the CancellationToken around to every method, eventually bottoming out in calls to the underlying Stream which then ends up passing them down to the underlying Socket.  But today Socket's support for cancellation is minimal, only doing up-front checks; if cancellation is requested during the socket operation rather than before, the request will be ignored.  Since HttpClient implements features like timeouts on top of cancellation support, it's important to do better than this.\r\n\r\nThe change implements cancellation by registering with the CancellationToken to dispose of the connection.  This will cause any reads/writes to wake up.  We then translate resulting exceptions into cancellation exceptions.  When in the main SendAsync method, we register once for the whole body of the operation until the point that we're returning the response message.  For individual operations on the response content stream, we register per operation; however, when feasible we try to avoid the registration costs by only registering if operations don't complete synchronously.  We also account for the case that on Unix, closing the connection may result in read operations waking up not with an exception but rather with EOF, which we also need to translate into cancellation when appropriate.\r\n\r\nAlong the way I cleaned up a few minor issues as well.\r\n\r\nI also added a bunch of cancellation-related tests:\r\n- Test cancellation occurring while sending request content\r\n- Test cancellation occurring while receiving response headers\r\n- Test cancellation occurring while receiving response body and using a buffered operation\r\n- Test that all of the above are triggerable with CancellationTokenSource.Cancel, HttpClient.CancelPendingRequests, and HttpClient.Dispose\r\n- Test cancellation occurring while receiving response body and using an unbuffered operation, either a ReadAsync or CopyToAsync on the response stream\r\n- Test that a CancelPendingRequests doesn't affect unbuffered operations on the response stream\r\n\r\nThere are deficiencies here in the existing handlers, and tests have been selectively disabled accordingly.  SocketsHttpHandler passes now for all of them.

This causes TestServiceInstaller to time out waiting for the stop, which causes it to throw TimeoutException which fails the test, after wasting 30 seconds waiting. The wasted time eventually causes the library to time out and we don't get a results.xml.\r\n\r\nI doubt this will fix all the NETFX failures, because some of the tests are supposed to connect to the pipe. My guess is they are failing for some other reason: with this fix, hopefully we will get the results.xml."},{"Id":"7227861103","Type":"IssuesEvent","CreatedAt":"2018-02-11T01:44:33","Actor":"danmosemsft","Repository":"dotnet/corefx","Organization":"dotnet","RawContent":null,"RelatedAction":"opened","RelatedUrl":"https://github.com/dotnet/corefx/issues/27027","RelatedDescription":"Opened issue \"ServiceBase tests failing on NETFX\" (#27027) at dotnet/corefx","RelatedBody":"https://mc.dot.net/#/product/netcore/master/source/official~2Fcorefx~2Fmaster~2F/type/test~2Ffunctional~2Fdesktop~2Fcli~2F/build/20180210.03/workItem/System.ServiceProcess.ServiceController.Tests/wilogs\r\n\r\n```\r\n2018-02-10 14:06:57,283: INFO: proc(54): run_and_log_output: Output:       System.ServiceProcess.TimeoutException : Time out has expired and the operation has not been completed.\r\n2018-02-10 14:06:57,283: INFO: proc(54): run_and_log_output: Output:       Stack Trace:\r\n2018-02-10 14:06:57,283: INFO: proc(54): run_and_log_output: Output:            at System.ServiceProcess.ServiceController.WaitForStatus(ServiceControllerStatus desiredStatus, TimeSpan timeout)\r\n2018-02-10 14:06:57,283: INFO: proc(54): run_and_log_output: Output:            at System.ServiceProcess.Tests.TestServiceInstaller.RemoveService()\r\n2018-02-10 14:06:57,283: INFO: proc(54): run_and_log_output: Output:            at System.ServiceProcess.Tests.TestServiceProvider.DeleteTestServices()\r\n2018-02-10 14:06:57,283: INFO: proc(54): run_and_log_output: Output:            at System.ServiceProcess.Tests.TestServiceProvider.DeleteTestServices()\r\n2018-02-10 14:06:57,283: INFO: proc(54): run_and_log_output: Output:            at System.ServiceProcess.Tests.ServiceBaseTests.Dispose()\r\n2018-02-10 14:06:57,283: INFO: proc(54): run_and_log_output: Output:         C:\\BuildAgent\\work\\cb37e9acf085d108\\src\\xunit.execution\\Extensions\\ReflectionAbstractionExtensions.cs(76,0): at ReflectionAbstractionExtensions.DisposeTestClass(ITest test, Object testClass, IMessageBus messageBus, ExecutionTimer timer, CancellationTokenSource cancellationTokenSource)\r\n\r\n```"}],"ResultType":"GitHubEvent"},"Roslyn":{"Events":[{"Id":"7227653765","Type":"PullRequestEvent","CreatedAt":"2018-02-10T23:06:50","Actor":"agocke","Repository":"dotnet/roslyn","Organization":"dotnet","RawContent":null,"RelatedAction":"opened","RelatedUrl":"https://github.com/dotnet/roslyn/pull/24765","RelatedDescription":"Opened pull request \"Fix ValidateBuildEnvironment task to work on multiple OSes\" (#24765) at dotnet/roslyn","RelatedBody":"It looks like MSBuild has a different extension on Windows and Unix.
