I've spent 4 days trying to figure out what the problem is, but all I can tell is that it comes from CommonModule being imported into the module. If I remove that, everything builds fine. In the real-world usage, the components are more complex, but I've been able to create an example in the following repo: https://github.com/trickeyone/angular-error-test\r\n\r\nIt consists of a single component and a single module. The example doesn't have any tests or anything, but the original project that I encountered the issue in has a demo/tests/etc. The demo builds fine. The tests run fine. It's only when I go to build the library that the error happens.\r\n\r\n### Mention any other details that might be useful\r\n<!-- Please include a link to the repo if this is related to an OSS project. -->\r\n","Url":"https://github.com/angular/angular-cli/issues/13440","RelatedDescription":"Closed issue \"Including CommonModule causes build to break\" (#13440)"},{"Id":"398794858","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2019-01-14T22:18:34","Actor":"alan-agius4","Number":"13432","RawContent":null,"Title":"build: update `webpack` and `postcss`","State":"closed","Body":"Update `webpack` to `4.28.4` and `postcss` to `7.0.11`","Url":"https://github.com/angular/angular-cli/pull/13432","RelatedDescription":"Closed or merged PR \"build: update `webpack` and `postcss`\" (#13432)"},{"Id":"399070296","IsPullRequest":false,"CreatedAt":"2019-01-14T21:25:52","Actor":"kolkov","Number":"13438","RawContent":null,"Title":"Automagic reload for clients after deploy with Angular Cli","State":"closed","Body":"Hi!\r\nAccording this article [Automagic reload for clients after deploy with Angular 4](https://blog.nodeswat.com/automagic-reload-for-clients-after-deploy-with-angular-4-8440c9fdd96c) mayby more good solution that `angular cli` create `version.json` file for us automatic when new version was builded?\r\nThanks!","Url":"https://github.com/angular/angular-cli/issues/13438","RelatedDescription":"Closed issue \"Automagic reload for clients after deploy with Angular Cli\" (#13438)"},{"Id":"398775092","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2019-01-14T19:08:21","Actor":"alan-agius4","Number":"13431","RawContent":null,"Title":"fix(@angular-devkit/build-angular): `vendorSourceMap` not being recognized w‚Ä¶","State":"closed","Body":"‚Ä¶hen passed directly\r\n\r\nFixes #13414","Url":"https://github.com/angular/angular-cli/pull/13431","RelatedDescription":"Closed or merged PR \"fix(@angular-devkit/build-angular): `vendorSourceMap` not being recognized w‚Ä¶\" (#13431)"},{"Id":"398766310","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2019-01-14T19:07:50","Actor":"alan-agius4","Number":"13430","RawContent":null,"Title":"fix(@angular-devkit/build-angular): only show production warning when‚Ä¶","State":"closed","Body":"‚Ä¶ having either styles on scripts optimization turn on\r\n\r\nFixes #13415","Url":"https://github.com/angular/angular-cli/pull/13430","RelatedDescription":"Closed or merged PR \"fix(@angular-devkit/build-angular): only show production warning when‚Ä¶\" (#13430)"},{"Id":"398670204","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2019-01-14T19:06:56","Actor":"cexbrayat","Number":"13427","RawContent":null,"Title":"feat(@schematics/angular): activate recommended tslint rules","State":"closed","Body":"PR https://github.com/angular/angular-cli/pull/13213 made `tslint.json` extend `tslint:recommended`.\r\nAs a first step, we deactivated explicitely all rules that were in the recommended set but were not in the old `tslint.json` file to keep the exact same configuration.\r\n\r\nThis PR activates a few of the recommended rules that were explicitely deactiviated, making te confoguration closer to the recommended one, and shorter.

It is a glob/pattern that specifies which specs should be included in the build. \r\n\r\nCommand:\r\n `ng test --spec=app/services/auth*`\r\n\r\nWhen karma is already running, selected spec can be updated by running following command: \r\n`ng test --spec=app/login* --spec-update`\r\n\r\nFew rules are applied to the pattern to make certain things possible:\r\n* `.spec.ts` is added automatically if missing (less typing)\r\n* if it ends with `*.ts` and doesn't have `.spec.ts`, extension will be replaced with `.spec.ts`\r\n* if path starts at root, source root directory will be trimmed. So that you could use relative file path from editor to make custom tasks to run the command\r\n\r\n\r\nBehind the scenes a new `test.generated.ts` is saved next to original `test.ts` which instead of using `require.context` imports all matching files. This gives quite a big boost in the project at work (at least 10s on each iterative build!)\r\n\r\nFixes #3603\r\n\r\nMotivation: It is a pain in a big application to wait until entire app is rebuilt just to run single `fit` block. Takes almost a minute with 4000+ tests and barely works when code coverage is enabled. \r\n\r\nMissing: docs(?)\r\n\r\nExample tasks for vscode:\r\n````\r\n{\r\n  // See https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkId=733558\r\n  // for the documentation about the tasks.json format\r\n  \"version\": \"2.0.0\",\r\n  \"tasks\": [\r\n    {\r\n      \"type\": \"shell\",\r\n      \"label\": \"test selected spec\",\r\n      \"command\": \"node_modules/.bin/ng\",\r\n      \"args\": [\r\n        \"test\",\r\n        \"--spec\",\r\n        \"${relativeFile}\"\r\n      ],\r\n      \"problemMatcher\": []\r\n    },\r\n    {\r\n      \"type\": \"shell\",\r\n      \"label\": \"switch selected spec\",\r\n      \"command\": \"node_modules/.bin/ng\",\r\n      \"args\": [\r\n        \"test\",\r\n        \"--spec\",\r\n        \"${relativeFile}\",\r\n        \"--spec-update\"\r\n      ],\r\n      \"problemMatcher\": [],\r\n      \"isBackground\": true\r\n    }\r\n  ]\r\n}\r\n````\r\n\r\nPS.
