We recommend moving to [.NET Core 3.1](https://devblogs.microsoft.com/dotnet/announcing-net-core-3-1/), our long term support (LTS) release.\r\n\r\n- [Download .NET Core 3.1](https://www.microsoft.com/net/download/dotnet-core/3.1)\r\n- [.NET Core 2.2 end-of-life statement](https://devblogs.microsoft.com/dotnet/net-core-2-2-will-reach-end-of-life-on-december-23-2019/)\r\n\r\nWe've created an issue at [dotnet/core#4084](https://github.com/dotnet/core/issues/4084) for your questions and comments.\r\n\r\n## .NET Core 2.2 Lifecycle\r\n\r\n.NET Core releases belong to one of two [support lifecycles](https://www.microsoft.com/net/platform/support-policy): long term support (LTS) and Current. LTS releases are stable release which receive critical updates and are supported for at least three years. Current releases can include new features that may undergo future change based on feedback. Current releases are supported for three months after the subsequent .NET Core major or minor release. Both LTS and Current releases receive critical fixes throughout their lifecycle, for security, reliability, or to add support for new operating system versions. You must stay up-to-date with the latest patches to qualify for support. \r\n\r\n[.NET Core 2.2](https://devblogs.microsoft.com/dotnet/announcing-net-core-2-2/) was released in December 2018 as a Current release. Per the lifecycle policy, Current releases reach end of life 3 months after a subsequent release (Current or LTS). **.NET Core 3.0** released in **September 2019** and began the end of life countdown for .NET Core 2.2 that concluded on December 23, 2019. \r\n\r\n## .NET Core 2.2 Downloads\r\n\r\n.NET Core 2.2 installers, zips and tar.gzs will remain available, but unsupported. This includes existing releases available on Linux package feeds. Previous versions, including 2.2, will be accessible through the [Download Archives](https://www.microsoft.com/net/download/archives). \r\n\r\n## Policy Information\r\n\r\nAdditional lifecycle and support details  and background can be seen in the following:\r\n\r\n* [.NET Core Support Lifecycle](https://www.microsoft.com/net/platform/support-policy)\r\n* [Microsoft Support for .NET Core](https://github.com/dotnet/core/blob/master/microsoft-support.md)\r\n* [.NET Core OS Lifecycle Policy](https://github.com/dotnet/core/blob/master/os-lifecycle-policy.md)\r\n* [Support and Versioning](https://blogs.msdn.microsoft.com/dotnet/2016/07/26/net-support-and-versioning/)\r\n"},{"Id":"11137901850","Type":"IssuesEvent","CreatedAt":"2019-12-20T20:42:34","Actor":"vivmishra","Repository":"dotnet/announcements","Organization":"dotnet","RawContent":null,"RelatedAction":"opened","RelatedUrl":"https://github.com/dotnet/announcements/issues/146","RelatedDescription":"Opened issue \"Announcing Availability of Localized IntelliSense for .NET Core 3.0 and 3.1\" (#146) at dotnet/announcements","RelatedBody":"This week we released localized [IntelliSense](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/visualstudio/ide/using-intellisense?view=vs-2019) files for .NET Core 3.0 and 3.1, in following 10 Visual Studio supported languages: \r\n- Brazilian Portuguese\r\n- Chinese (simplified)\r\n- Chinese (traditional)\r\n- French\r\n- German\r\n- Italian\r\n- Japanese\r\n- Korean\t\r\n- Russian\r\n- Spanish\r\n\r\nThe files (in zip archives) are available for download from [**Download localized .NET Core IntelliSense files**](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/download/dotnet-core/intellisense).\r\n\r\n * [Checksums for 3.0 zip files](https://dotnetcli.blob.core.windows.net/dotnet/checksums/3.0.0-intellisense-sha.txt)\r\n * [Checksums for 3.1 zip files](https://dotnetcli.blob.core.windows.net/dotnet/checksums/3.1.0-intellisense-sha.txt)\r\n\r\nYou can see [the .NET Core Guide](https://aka.ms/dotnet-core-intellisense) for instructions on how to use these files with Visual Studio.\r\n\r\nBy default, when you're developing .NET Core projects, the SDK only includes the English version of the IntelliSense files. But now you can enhance your localized Visual Studio development experience by adding the localized IntelliSense files from the download site into your local development environment.\r\n\r\nLastly, with this release we have made the localized IntelliSense available as zip archives that does require you to manually extract and copy the files to respective SDK install folders. But we plan to make this experience better in future releases.\r\n\r\n## Discussion\r\nTo discuss this issue, please comment on the corresponding issue at [dotnet/core #4032](https://github.com/dotnet/core/issues/4032).\r\n"},{"Id":"11059014848","Type":"IssuesEvent","CreatedAt":"2019-12-10T22:29:30","Actor":"TaraOverfield","Repository":"dotnet/announcements","Organization":"dotnet","RawContent":null,"RelatedAction":"opened","RelatedUrl":"https://github.com/dotnet/announcements/issues/145","RelatedDescription":"Opened issue \"December 2019 .NET Updates\" (#145) at dotnet/announcements","RelatedBody":"The following .NET updates were released on November 2019.

This means some folks will lose their Collaborator badge and the ability to interact with the CI system.*\r\n\r\nOver the years, we’ve added a bunch of folks as collaborators with read permissions to our public repos. The rationale was that we wanted to be able to assign issues to community members because GitHub only allowed assigning issues to users with an explicit permission grant for the repository. However, they changed this in [June 2019](https://github.blog/2019-06-25-assign-issues-to-issue-commenters/). Now, we can assign issues to all users with explicit permissions as well as to users that have commented on the specific issue.\r\n\r\nAlso, we recently started to audit and tighten the permissions for our organizations. As a result, it became clear that large number of repo-specific permission grants are hard to review and audit. Internally, our goal is to grant all permissions via teams instead.\r\n\r\nHence, we plan to remove all collaborators from public repos that only have read permissions (folks with triage permissions will remain). The full list of affected repos is listed below.\r\n\r\nThis shouldn’t impact your ability to work with us, but losing explicit read-only has the following implications:\r\n\r\n-   **You’ll lose the contributor badge**. We understand that this is visually appealing and for some people it might have been a badge of honor. But given that GitHub also shows a Contributor bade for folks whose PRs got merged, we don’t think it this will be a major take back.    \r\n    ![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/5169960/70491508-43acf580-1ab6-11ea-94df-74ea2dde98b4.png)\r\n\r\n\r\n-   **You lose the ability to interact with the CI system**. As a collaborator, you can use comments to [send commands to the CI system](https://github.com/dotnet/runtime/blob/master/docs/project/pullrequest-builds.md). While this can be useful at times, we generally don’t expect (or desire) contributors to do that. Of course, anyone can still access the CI logs.\r\n\r\n| Public Repo                | \\#collaborators with read |\r\n|----------------------------|---------------------------|\r\n| arcade                     | 1                         |\r\n| BenchmarkDotNet            | 11                        |\r\n| cli                        | 2                         |\r\n| command-line-api           | 14                        |\r\n| coreclr                    | 18                        |\r\n| corefx                     | 180                       |\r\n| corefxlab                  | 4                         |\r\n| corert                     | 7                         |\r\n| core-sdk                   | 1                         |\r\n| docs                       | 3                         |\r\n| interactive-window         | 1                         |\r\n| machinelearning            | 1                         |\r\n| machinelearning-samples    | 1                         |\r\n| msbuild-language-service   | 1                         |\r\n| runtime                    | 128                       |\r\n| spark                      | 5                         |\r\n| standard                   | 1                         |\r\n| windowsdesktop             | 1                         |\r\n| winforms-datavisualization | 1                         |\r\n| Grand Total                | 381                       |\r\n\r\n### Discussion\r\n\r\nTo discuss this, please comment on the corresponding issue at https://github.com/dotnet/runtime/issues/718."}],"ResultType":"GitHubEvent"},"CoreCLR":{"Events":[{"Id":"11343599505","Type":"IssuesEvent","CreatedAt":"2020-01-23T14:03:26","Actor":"jkotas","Repository":"dotnet/coreclr","Organization":"dotnet","RawContent":null,"RelatedAction":"closed","RelatedUrl":"https://github.com/dotnet/coreclr/issues/27955","RelatedDescription":"Closed issue \"Segmentation fault when running .NET Core 3.0 app on OpenVZ\" (#27955) at dotnet/coreclr","RelatedBody":"I have a .NET Core app that's a fairly basic gRPC service (unfortunately not open source yet, so I can't link to the source at the moment).

In fact, ENOSPEC can also mean \"the kernel failed to allocate a needed resource.\" We had no way to know it was anything other than \"too many files open.\" _The error message is misleading._\r\n\r\n> From the Man Page - The user limit on the total number of inotify watches was reached or the kernel failed to allocate a needed resource\r\n\r\nPhrased differently. **There's two Error Cases and we throw a message that implies there's just One.** \r\n\r\nThis is becoming more prevalent in container situations in **constrained sandboxes**. I'm trying to deploy https://github.com/shanselman/superzeit (just clone and \"now --public\" or run locally with docker) to Zeit.co and I'm hitting this regularly. I don't think I'm hitting a limit. I think Zeit (and others) are blocking the syscall.\r\n\r\nI think there are two issues here:\r\n\r\n**1 We should return a different error message if inotify_add_watch fails, and then circuit break so that FileSystemWatcher doesn't prevent the app from starting. If we CAN startup without a watch successfully, we should.**\r\n\r\n2 It seems DOTNET_USE_POLLING_FILE_WATCHER=1 is used in dotnet-watch and the aspnet file providers but the base System.IO FileSystemWatcher class doesn't support DOTNET_USE_POLLING_FILE_WATCHER? We should probably be consistent.\r\n\r\nIf I change reloadOnChange: false in Program.cs to bypass the first watch that is set on AppSettings.json, I end up hitting it later when Razor/MVC sets up its FileWatchers. \r\nWe need at a minimum, to have DOTNET_USE_POLLING_FILE_WATCHER respected everywhere.

We had changed the logic to match precisely what MSDN's documentation stated and to fix a possible data corruption bug; however, this broke a number of customers' applications by sending them into infinite loops.\r\n\r\nThis PR reverts that change.\r\n\r\n## Customer Impact\r\n\r\nIf customers were relying on the previous behavior of the _completed_ out parameter, their applications could end up in an infinite loop. What makes matters worse is that the sample code on the MSDN page for `Encoder.Convert` and `Decoder.Convert` is also susceptible to this pattern, so we suspect a large number of customers may have based their own application code on the sample.\r\n\r\n## Regression?\r\n\r\nYes, from .NET Framework 4.x and .NET Core 2.x. One half of this change was introduced in .NET Core 3.0 (see https://github.com/dotnet/coreclr/commit/43a5159d39bd52195c5095da4006183f791c696b); the other half was introduced in .NET Core 3.1 (see https://github.com/dotnet/coreclr/commit/c07ec4cd2f88c23edc87500893576d83c20f2e6d).\r\n\r\n## Testing\r\n\r\nThe reversion is already committed in the 5.0 branches (see https://github.com/dotnet/runtime/commit/d49b541ab156d992aeb4bbe410f7a816bb0ac039), so we have been getting test coverage on those nightlies. No notable regressions have been reported.\r\n\r\n## Risk\r\n\r\nSomewhere between minimal and moderate. It's possible that some applications may have taken a dependency on the new behavior. See for instance https://github.com/dotnet/aspnetcore/pull/17747, where ASP.NET appears to have unintentionally taken a dependency on the new behavior and had to proactively make a change so that they behave correctly both before and after this PR goes through.\r\n\r\n/cc @tarekgh @anurse @danmosemsft ","Url":"https://github.com/dotnet/coreclr/pull/27996","RelatedDescription":"Closed or merged PR \"[release/3.1] Port fix to revert EncoderNLS and DecoderNLS Convert changes\" (#27996)"},{"Id":"550396592","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2020-01-15T20:04:13","Actor":"dotnet-maestro-bot","Number":"27999","RawContent":null,"Title":"[automated] Merge branch 'release/3.0' => 'release/3.1'","State":"closed","Body":"I detected changes in the release/3.0 branch which have not been merged yet to release/3.1.

The intention of it is to be interchangeable with regular Dictionary implementations -- where, we always use the interface IDictionary<T, T> to interact with either.  Both Dictionary and ConcurrentDictionary implement IDictionary interface members.\r\n\r\nThe class looks like this:\r\n\r\n\r\n    public class CaseInsensitiveDictionary<TValue>\r\n        : ConcurrentDictionary<string, TValue>\r\n    {\r\n        public CaseInsensitiveDictionary()\r\n            : base(StringComparer.InvariantCultureIgnoreCase)\r\n        {\r\n        }\r\n\r\n        private CaseInsensitiveDictionary(IDictionary<string, TValue> attributes)\r\n            : this()\r\n        {\r\n            AddRange(attributes);\r\n        }\r\n\r\n        public void Add(string key, TValue value)\r\n        {\r\n            this.TryAdd(key, value);\r\n        }\r\n\r\n        public void AddRange(IDictionary<string, TValue> entries)\r\n        {\r\n            foreach (var item in entries)\r\n            {\r\n                this.TryAdd(item.Key, item.Value);\r\n            }\r\n        }\r\n\r\n        public static CaseInsensitiveDictionary<TValue> Create(IDictionary<string, TValue> attributes = null)\r\n        {\r\n            if (attributes == null)\r\n            {\r\n                return new CaseInsensitiveDictionary<TValue>();\r\n            }\r\n            return new CaseInsensitiveDictionary<TValue>(attributes);\r\n        }\r\n\r\n        public static implicit operator Dictionary<string, TValue>(CaseInsensitiveDictionary<TValue> data)\r\n        {\r\n            return new Dictionary<string, TValue>(data);\r\n        }\r\n\r\n        public static implicit operator CaseInsensitiveDictionary<TValue>(Dictionary<string, TValue> data)\r\n        {\r\n            return Create(data);\r\n        }\r\n\r\n    }\r\n\r\n\r\n`  \r\n\r\n\r\nLet's say then that we are trying to implicitly convert the ConcurrentDictionary to and from a dictionary.  To test, I wrote these methods:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n        public void FromDictionaryToCaseInsensitiveDictionaryTest()\r\n        {\r\n\r\n            Dictionary<string, string> dc2 = new Dictionary<string, string>();\r\n            dc2.Add(\"test1\", \"test1 value\");\r\n\r\n            var dc3 = (CaseInsensitiveDictionary<string>)dc2;\r\n            Console.WriteLine(\"FromDictionaryToCaseInsensitiveDictionaryTest success\");\r\n        }\r\n\r\n        public void FromIDictionaryToCaseInsensitiveDictionaryTest()\r\n        {\r\n            IDictionary<string, string> dc2 = new Dictionary<string, string>();\r\n            dc2.Add(\"test1\", \"test1 value\");\r\n\r\n            var dc3 = (CaseInsensitiveDictionary<string>)dc2;\r\n\r\n            Console.WriteLine(\"FromIDictionaryToCaseInsensitiveDictionaryTest success\");\r\n        }\r\n\r\n\r\n        public void FromCaseInsensitiveDictionaryToDictionaryTest()\r\n        {\r\n\r\n            var dc2 = new CaseInsensitiveDictionary<string>();\r\n            dc2.Add(\"test1\", \"test1 value\");\r\n\r\n            var dc3 = (Dictionary<string, string>)dc2;\r\n\r\n            Console.WriteLine(\"FromCaseInsensitiveDictionaryToDictionaryTest success\");\r\n\r\n        }\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe first (FromDictionaryToCaseInsensitiveDictionaryTest) and third methods (FromCaseInsensitiveDictionaryToDictionaryTest) work fine and correctly use the operators.\r\n\r\nThe second one fails with this exception: System.InvalidCastException: 'Unable to cast object of type 'System.Collections.Generic.Dictionary`2[System.String,System.String]' to type 'OpenToken.CaseInsensitiveDictionary`1[System.String]'.'\r\n.  In my opinion, FromIDictionaryToCaseInsensitiveDictionaryTest should work because the type is CaseInsensitiveDictionary and implements IDictionary.  If I do NOT have the first conversion operator, the first test method fails with this exact same error message, \r\n\r\nWith this evidence, it seems to me that something is missing when the runtime is looking for the appropriate operator.  FromIDictionaryToCaseInsensitiveDictionaryTest should work either from the Dictionary operator or automatically work because it implements the IDictionary interface.  (I cannot create an operator for IDictionary conversion because that is illegal).  \r\n\r\nPlease let me know if this is expected behavior and if there is some workaround for it.  This issue seems to be present in all versions of C#.\r\n\r\nThanks!\r\n\r\n","Url":"https://github.com/dotnet/standard/issues/1659","RelatedDescription":"Closed issue \"Generic class operators derived from interface seems broken\" (#1659)"},{"Id":"526765953","IsPullRequest":false,"CreatedAt":"2019-11-25T02:23:45","Actor":"arizvisa","Number":"1657","RawContent":null,"Title":"packages.microsoft.com: signature check for netstandard-targeting-pack-2.1.0 failed","State":"closed","Body":"Hey guys, the signature check for this package seems to be failing.

Previously, if a Document could not be read, a syntax tree would still be placed in the Compilation that was empty. Now, simply no syntax tree exists anymore.

I created an endless loop in the following setup (example).\n\n```\nIEnumerator Foo()\n{\n    int number = 0;\n    while(true)\n    {\n        if (number == 1)\n        {\n            yield return new WaitForSeconds(1.0f);\n        }\n\n// Missing a yield return outside if-block\n    }\n}\n```\n\nConsidering the code above, \"yield return new WaitForSeconds(1.0f);\" will never be reached and therefore, an endless loop is created.\nI would like to suggest that the compiler creates a warning or error when such a situation occurs similar to the following:\n\n```\npublic bool IsThatTrue(bool b)\n{\n    if (b)\n    {\n        return b;\n    }\n}\n```\n\nIn this case, the compiler tells me that not all code paths return a value.\n\nI feel like it should be possible to recognize the potential endless loop (while(true)) and give a warning if inside that loop not all paths have a \"yield return\".\n\nKind regards\nKevin\n\n---\n### Original Comments\n\n#### Fiona Niu[MSFT] on 1/22/2020, 07:09 PM: \n\n<p>Thank you for taking the time to provide your suggestion.

My nuget package uses the convention for native libraries `runtimes\\<rid>\\native\\<lib>`.  The grpc core package also uses this convention, but _doesn't_ have the linux-arm rid, just linux.  Both packages are required when publishing for arm, but with the native library from mine and the .net assembly from grpc core.  \r\n\r\nWhen I publish with `-r linux-arm`, my expectation is that it would find the library it's looking for preferring the matching directory for the rid being published.  It used to do this correctly in 3.0 preview, which was the last time I updated my package.  To get people going, I supply a dotnet new project template which demonstrates the library with a simple client / server they can deploy to the pi, and while trying to test my package by publishing with the 3.1.101 sdk, I get the following:\r\n\r\n```\r\nEncountered conflict between 'CopyLocal:C:\\Users\\Geocoder\\.nuget\\packages\\grpc.core\\2.26.0\\runtimes\\linux\\native\\libgrpc_csharp_ext.x86.so' and 'CopyLocal:C:\\Users\\Geocoder\\.nuget\\packages\\libgrpc_csharp_ext.arm7\\1.0.9\\runtimes\\linux-arm\\native\\libgrpc_csharp_ext.x86.so'. Choosing 'CopyLocal:C:\\Users\\Geocoder\\.nuget\\packages\\grpc.core\\2.26.0\\runtimes\\linux\\native\\libgrpc_csharp_ext.x86.so' arbitrarily as both items are copy-local and have equal file and assembly versions.\r\n```\r\n\r\nShouldn't it prefer the specific runtime before comparing file versions?  Seems more important as the other library isn't even going to load on the pi.\r\n\r\nAlso, as the file in question is a native lib, it doesn't have an assembly version, so it's not an accurate explanation besides.","Url":"https://github.com/dotnet/sdk/issues/4195","RelatedDescription":"Open issue \"Publish command doesn't respect runtime identifier when selecting native library from nuget packages\" (#4195)"},{"Id":"551921632","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2020-01-19T14:53:31","Actor":"dotnet-maestro[bot]","Number":"4194","RawContent":null,"Title":"[master] Update dependencies from dotnet/runtime","State":"closed","Body":"This pull request updates the following dependencies\r\n\r\n[marker]: <> (Begin:ea219f43-0754-4d2f-576e-08d76e1d56cb)\r\n## From https://github.com/dotnet/runtime\r\n- **Subscription**: ea219f43-0754-4d2f-576e-08d76e1d56cb\r\n- **Build**: 20200118.4\r\n- **Date Produced**: 1/19/2020 9:13 AM\r\n- **Commit**: 339b44734dad126a1241a10511ec1c5ecd1f41cf\r\n- **Branch**: refs/heads/master\r\n- **Updates**:\r\n  - **Microsoft.NET.HostModel** -> 5.0.0-alpha.1.20068.4\r\n\r\n[marker]: <> (End:ea219f43-0754-4d2f-576e-08d76e1d56cb)\r\n\r\n","Url":"https://github.com/dotnet/sdk/pull/4194","RelatedDescription":"Closed or merged PR \"[master] Update dependencies from dotnet/runtime\" (#4194)"},{"Id":"551769312","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2020-01-18T15:01:24","Actor":"dotnet-maestro[bot]","Number":"4192","RawContent":null,"Title":"[master] Update dependencies from dotnet/runtime","State":"closed","Body":"This pull request updates the following dependencies\r\n\r\n[marker]: <> (Begin:ea219f43-0754-4d2f-576e-08d76e1d56cb)\r\n## From https://github.com/dotnet/runtime\r\n- **Subscription**: ea219f43-0754-4d2f-576e-08d76e1d56cb\r\n- **Build**: 20200117.9\r\n- **Date Produced**: 1/18/2020 10:14 AM\r\n- **Commit**: c4bddfbe85c0ba3498a1129ec560eb24d2f1df85\r\n- **Branch**: refs/heads/master\r\n- **Updates**:\r\n  - **Microsoft.NET.HostModel** -> 5.0.0-alpha.1.20067.9\r\n\r\n[marker]: <> (End:ea219f43-0754-4d2f-576e-08d76e1d56cb)\r\n\r\n","Url":"https://github.com/dotnet/sdk/pull/4192","RelatedDescription":"Closed or merged PR \"[master] Update dependencies from dotnet/runtime\" (#4192)"},{"Id":"551766363","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2020-01-18T14:21:49","Actor":"dotnet-maestro[bot]","Number":"4191","RawContent":null,"Title":"[master] Update dependencies from dotnet/arcade","State":"closed","Body":"This pull request updates the following dependencies\r\n\r\n[marker]: <> (Begin:daa187e0-7e60-4c7a-c1ac-08d6354da8a8)\r\n## From https://github.com/dotnet/arcade\r\n- **Subscription**: daa187e0-7e60-4c7a-c1ac-08d6354da8a8\r\n- **Build**: 20200117.2\r\n- **Date Produced**: 1/17/2020 11:26 PM\r\n- **Commit**: 514e47a844ea7fe193978725c15e67ec16bff572\r\n- **Branch**: refs/heads/master\r\n- **Updates**:\r\n  - **Microsoft.DotNet.Arcade.Sdk** -> 5.0.0-beta.20067.2\r\n  - **Microsoft.DotNet.Helix.Sdk** -> 5.0.0-beta.20067.2\r\n  - **Microsoft.DotNet.SignTool** -> 5.0.0-beta.20067.2\r\n\r\n[marker]: <> (End:daa187e0-7e60-4c7a-c1ac-08d6354da8a8)\r\n\r\n","Url":"https://github.com/dotnet/sdk/pull/4191","RelatedDescription":"Closed or merged PR \"[master] Update dependencies from dotnet/arcade\" (#4191)"},{"Id":"551439162","IsPullRequest":false,"CreatedAt":"2020-01-17T14:15:09","Actor":"zii-dmg","Number":"4189","RawContent":null,"Title":"dotnet --info identation inconsistency","State":"open","Body":"`dotnet --info` prints first two sections (`.NET Core SDK` and `Runtime Environment`) with one whitespace indent and other sections with two whitespaces.

In an email attack scenario, an attacker could exploit the vulnerability by sending the specially crafted file to the user and convincing the user to open the file.\r\n\r\nThe security update addresses the vulnerability by correcting how .NET Core checks the source markup of a file.\r\n\r\n## Discussion\r\n\r\nDiscussion for this issue can be found at https://github.com/dotnet/wpf/issues/2424\r\n\r\n## <a name=\"mitigation-factors\"></a>Mitigation factors\r\n\r\nMicrosoft has not identified any mitigating factors for this vulnerability.\r\n\r\n## <a name=\"affected-software\"></a>Affected software\r\n\r\nAny .NET Core application running on .NET Core 3.0.0, 3.0.1 or 3.1.0.\r\n\r\n### <a name=\"how-affected\"></a>How do I know if I am affected?\r\n\r\nIf you have a runtime or SDK with a version listed in [affected software](#affected-software) you are exposed to the vulnerability.\r\n\r\n### <a name=\"how-fix\"></a>How do I fix the issue?\r\n\r\nTo fix the issue please install the latest version of .NET Core. If you have multiple versions of .NET Core installed you will need to install multiple runtimes, or SDKs depending on what you have installed.\r\n\r\nYou can list the versions you have installed by running the `dotnet --info` command. You will see output like the following;\r\n\r\n```\r\n.NET Core SDK (reflecting any global.json):\r\n Version:   3.1.100\r\n Commit:    cd82f021f4\r\n\r\nRuntime Environment:\r\n OS Name:     Windows\r\n OS Version:  10.0.18363\r\n OS Platform: Windows\r\n RID:         win10-x64\r\n Base Path:   C:\\Program Files\\dotnet\\sdk\\3.1.100\\\r\n\r\nHost (useful for support):\r\n  Version: 3.1.0\r\n  Commit:  65f04fb6db\r\n\r\n.NET Core SDKs installed:\r\n  3.0.101 [C:\\Program Files\\dotnet\\sdk]\r\n  3.1.100 [C:\\Program Files\\dotnet\\sdk]\r\n\r\n.NET Core runtimes installed:\r\n  Microsoft.AspNetCore.App 3.0.1 [C:\\Program Files\\dotnet\\shared\\Microsoft.AspNetCore.App]\r\n  Microsoft.AspNetCore.App 3.1.0 [C:\\Program Files\\dotnet\\shared\\Microsoft.AspNetCore.App]\r\n  Microsoft.NETCore.App 3.0.1 [C:\\Program Files\\dotnet\\shared\\Microsoft.NETCore.App]\r\n  Microsoft.NETCore.App 3.1.0 [C:\\Program Files\\dotnet\\shared\\Microsoft.NETCore.App]\r\n  Microsoft.WindowsDesktop.App 3.0.1 [C:\\Program Files\\dotnet\\shared\\Microsoft.WindowsDesktop.App]\r\n  Microsoft.WindowsDesktop.App 3.1.0 [C:\\Program Files\\dotnet\\shared\\Microsoft.WindowsDesktop.App]\r\n\r\nTo install additional .NET Core runtimes or SDKs:\r\n  https://aka.ms/dotnet-download\r\n```\r\n\r\n* For machines running .NET Core 3.0, you should download and install Runtime 3.0.2 or SDK 3.0.102 from https://dotnet.microsoft.com/download/dotnet-core/3.0.\r\n* For machines running .NET Core 3.1, you should download and install Runtime 3.1.1 or SDK 3.1.101 from https://dotnet.microsoft.com/download/dotnet-core/3.1.\r\n\r\nIf you have both 3.0 and 3.1 installed, you need to install the updates for both versions.\r\n\r\nOnce you have installed the updated runtime or SDK, restart your apps for the update to take effect.\r\n\r\nAdditionally, if you've deployed [self-contained applications](https://docs.microsoft.com/dotnet/core/deploying/#self-contained-deployments-scd) targeting any of the impacted versions, these applications are also vulnerable and must be recompiled and redeployed.\r\n\r\n## Other Information\r\n\r\n### Reporting Security Issues\r\n\r\nIf you have found a potential security issue in .NET Core, please email details to secure@microsoft.com.

LTS releases are stable release which receive critical updates and are supported for at least three years. Current releases can include new features that may undergo future change based on feedback. Current releases are supported for three months after the subsequent .NET Core major or minor release. Both LTS and Current releases receive critical fixes throughout their lifecycle, for security, reliability, or to add support for new operating system versions. You must stay up-to-date with the latest patches to qualify for support. \r\n\r\n[.NET Core 2.2](https://devblogs.microsoft.com/dotnet/announcing-net-core-2-2/) was released in December 2018 as a Current release. Per the lifecycle policy, Current releases reach end of life 3 months after a subsequent release (Current or LTS). **.NET Core 3.0** released in **September 2019** and began the end of life countdown for .NET Core 2.2 that concluded on December 23, 2019. \r\n\r\n## .NET Core 2.2 Downloads\r\n\r\n.NET Core 2.2 installers, zips and tar.gzs will remain available, but unsupported. This includes existing releases available on Linux package feeds. Previous versions, including 2.2, will be accessible through the [Download Archives](https://www.microsoft.com/net/download/archives). \r\n\r\n## Policy Information\r\n\r\nAdditional lifecycle and support details  and background can be seen in the following:\r\n\r\n* [.NET Core Support Lifecycle](https://www.microsoft.com/net/platform/support-policy)\r\n* [Microsoft Support for .NET Core](https://github.com/dotnet/core/blob/master/microsoft-support.md)\r\n* [.NET Core OS Lifecycle Policy](https://github.com/dotnet/core/blob/master/os-lifecycle-policy.md)\r\n* [Support and Versioning](https://blogs.msdn.microsoft.com/dotnet/2016/07/26/net-support-and-versioning/)\r\n","Url":"https://github.com/dotnet/announcements/issues/147","RelatedDescription":"Open issue \".NET Core 2.2 has reached end of life\" (#147)"},{"Id":"541189878","IsPullRequest":false,"CreatedAt":"2019-12-20T20:42:33","Actor":"vivmishra","Number":"146","RawContent":null,"Title":"Announcing Availability of Localized IntelliSense for .NET Core 3.0 and 3.1","State":"open","Body":"This week we released localized [IntelliSense](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/visualstudio/ide/using-intellisense?view=vs-2019) files for .NET Core 3.0 and 3.1, in following 10 Visual Studio supported languages: \r\n- Brazilian Portuguese\r\n- Chinese (simplified)\r\n- Chinese (traditional)\r\n- French\r\n- German\r\n- Italian\r\n- Japanese\r\n- Korean\t\r\n- Russian\r\n- Spanish\r\n\r\nThe files (in zip archives) are available for download from [**Download localized .NET Core IntelliSense files**](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/download/dotnet-core/intellisense).\r\n\r\n * [Checksums for 3.0 zip files](https://dotnetcli.blob.core.windows.net/dotnet/checksums/3.0.0-intellisense-sha.txt)\r\n * [Checksums for 3.1 zip files](https://dotnetcli.blob.core.windows.net/dotnet/checksums/3.1.0-intellisense-sha.txt)\r\n\r\nYou can see [the .NET Core Guide](https://aka.ms/dotnet-core-intellisense) for instructions on how to use these files with Visual Studio.\r\n\r\nBy default, when you're developing .NET Core projects, the SDK only includes the English version of the IntelliSense files.

This means some folks will lose their Collaborator badge and the ability to interact with the CI system.*\r\n\r\nOver the years, we’ve added a bunch of folks as collaborators with read permissions to our public repos. The rationale was that we wanted to be able to assign issues to community members because GitHub only allowed assigning issues to users with an explicit permission grant for the repository. However, they changed this in [June 2019](https://github.blog/2019-06-25-assign-issues-to-issue-commenters/). Now, we can assign issues to all users with explicit permissions as well as to users that have commented on the specific issue.\r\n\r\nAlso, we recently started to audit and tighten the permissions for our organizations. As a result, it became clear that large number of repo-specific permission grants are hard to review and audit. Internally, our goal is to grant all permissions via teams instead.\r\n\r\nHence, we plan to remove all collaborators from public repos that only have read permissions (folks with triage permissions will remain). The full list of affected repos is listed below.\r\n\r\nThis shouldn’t impact your ability to work with us, but losing explicit read-only has the following implications:\r\n\r\n-   **You’ll lose the collaborator badge**. We understand that this is visually appealing and for some people it might have been a badge of honor. But given that GitHub also shows a Contributor bade for folks whose PRs got merged, we don’t think it this will be a major take back.    \r\n    ![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/5169960/70491508-43acf580-1ab6-11ea-94df-74ea2dde98b4.png)\r\n\r\n-   ~~**You lose the ability to interact with the CI system**. As a collaborator, you can use comments to [send commands to the CI system](https://github.com/dotnet/runtime/blob/master/docs/project/pullrequest-builds.md). While this can be useful at times, we generally don’t expect (or desire) contributors to do that. Of course, anyone can still access the CI logs.~~\r\n\r\n- **You might lose the ability to interact with the CI system**. Based on your feedback we have decided to give externals access to interact with the CI system *on a case by case basis*. If you believe you need to have that ability, please [leave a comment like Kevin's](https://github.com/dotnet/runtime/issues/718#issuecomment-563717478).\r\n\r\n| Public Repo                | \\#collaborators with read |\r\n|----------------------------|---------------------------|\r\n| arcade                     | 1                         |\r\n| BenchmarkDotNet            | 11                        |\r\n| cli                        | 2                         |\r\n| command-line-api           | 14                        |\r\n| coreclr                    | 18                        |\r\n| corefx                     | 180                       |\r\n| corefxlab                  | 4                         |\r\n| corert                     | 7                         |\r\n| core-sdk                   | 1                         |\r\n| docs                       | 3                         |\r\n| interactive-window         | 1                         |\r\n| machinelearning            | 1                         |\r\n| machinelearning-samples    | 1                         |\r\n| msbuild-language-service   | 1                         |\r\n| runtime                    | 128                       |\r\n| spark                      | 5                         |\r\n| standard                   | 1                         |\r\n| windowsdesktop             | 1                         |\r\n| winforms-datavisualization | 1                         |\r\n| Grand Total                | 381                       |\r\n\r\n### Discussion\r\n\r\nTo discuss this, please comment on the corresponding issue at https://github.com/dotnet/runtime/issues/718.","Url":"https://github.com/dotnet/announcements/issues/144","RelatedDescription":"Open issue \"Removal of read-collaborator access\" (#144)"},{"Id":"532249858","IsPullRequest":false,"CreatedAt":"2019-12-03T20:36:29","Actor":"MichaelSimons","Number":"143","RawContent":null,"Title":".NET Core `latest` Docker tags updated to 3.1","State":"open","Body":"# .NET Core `latest` Docker tags updated to 3.1\r\n\r\nThe `latest` tags for the [dotnet/core](https://hub.docker.com/_/microsoft-dotnet-core) repos have been updated to reference [.NET Core 3.1](https://devblogs.microsoft.com/dotnet/announcing-net-core-3-1/).\r\n\r\n## Discussion\r\n \r\nYou can share your thoughts on this change or see what others are saying at:\r\n \r\n* [dotnet/dotnet-docker#1337](https://github.com/dotnet/dotnet-docker/issues/1511)\r\n\r\n## Details\r\n\r\n* [dotnet-docker#1509](https://github.com/dotnet/dotnet-docker/pull/1509)\r\n\r\nThe `latest` tags for the [dotnet/core](https://hub.docker.com/_/microsoft-dotnet-core) repos are always intended to reference the latest supported version of .NET Core.

These are tags that are supported on multiple operating systems, and do not contain the operating system in them. As a result of no longer producing new images for Windows Server, version 1803, manifest tags no longer include entries for Windows 10, version 1803, and Windows Server, version 1803. That means that .NET Core manifest tags are no longer usable on those Windows versions.\r\n\r\nIf you pull a manifest tag on one of the Windows versions described, you may get one of the following error messages:\r\n\r\n* `a Windows version 10.0.18362-based image is incompatible with a 10.0.17134 host`\r\n* `no matching manifest for windows/amd64 in the manifest list entries`\r\n* `no matching manifest for unknown in the manifest list entries`\r\n\r\nIf you need to still use Nano Server, version 1803 images (even though it is no longer supported), you will need to use tags that include the Nano Server version (these are non-manifest tags), for example `mcr.microsoft.com/dotnet/core/runtime:3.0-nanoserver-1803`.","Url":"https://github.com/dotnet/announcements/issues/140","RelatedDescription":"Open issue \"Windows Server, version 1803 no longer supported by .NET Core\" (#140)"},{"Id":"522994983","IsPullRequest":false,"CreatedAt":"2019-11-14T17:15:08","Actor":"leecow","Number":"139","RawContent":null,"Title":".NET Core 3.1.0 Preview 3","State":"open","Body":".NET Core 3.1.0 Preview 3 is available and https://github.com/dotnet/core/issues/3809 has been opened for discussion.\r\n\r\n[Release Notes](https://github.com/dotnet/core/blob/master/release-notes/3.1/preview/3.1.0-preview3.md)\r\n[Download](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/download/dotnet-core/3.1)\r\n\r\n**Blog posts**\r\n\r\n[.NET Core](https://devblogs.microsoft.com/dotnet/announcing-net-core-3-1-preview-3/)\r\n[ASP.NET Core](https://devblogs.microsoft.com/aspnet/asp-net-core-updates-in-net-core-3-1-preview-3/)\r\n\r\nPlease report any issues you find with .NET Core 3.1 Preview 3, either responding to this issue, creating a new issue or creating a new issue in one of the following repos:\r\n\r\n* [aspnet/Home](https://github.com/aspnet/Home) - for ASP.NET Core questions\r\n* [aspnet/EntityFrameworkCore](https://github.com/aspnet/EntityFrameworkCore) - for Entity Framework Core questions\r\n* [dotnet/cli](https://github.com/dotnet/cli/issues) - for CLI tools and questions\r\n* [dotnet/corefx](https://github.com/dotnet/corefx/issues) - for API issues and questions\r\n* [dotnet/coreclr](https://github.com/dotnet/coreclr/issues) - for runtime issues\r\n* [dotnet/core-setup](https://github.com/dotnet/core-setup/issues) - for installer issues\r\n* [dotnet/winforms](https://github.com/dotnet/winforms/issues) - for Winforms issues\r\n* [dotnet/wpf](https://github.com/dotnet/wpf/issues) - for WPF issues\r\n* [nuget/home](https://github.com/nuget/home/issues) - for NuGet questions and issues\r\n","Url":"https://github.com/dotnet/announcements/issues/139","RelatedDescription":"Open issue \".NET Core 3.1.0 Preview 3\" (#139)"},{"Id":"522864668","IsPullRequest":false,"CreatedAt":"2019-11-14T13:37:28","Actor":"TaraOverfield","Number":"138","RawContent":null,"Title":"November 2019 .NET Updates","State":"open","Body":"The following .NET updates were released on November 2019.

Our planning has reached a point where we have a schedule for the coreclr, corefx and core-setupmoves into dotnet/runtime that we want to share out with the community.\r\n\r\n### November 13th\r\nWe’ll move all changes from the original repositories into dotnet/runtime up to 5PM PST on November 13th. We’ll try to help as many pull requests as possible get merged by then. At that point, if there’s any pull requests still open we’ll have to close them. If you’d still like to continue those pull requests, we’d encourage you to bring them to dotnet/runtime in a new pull request.\r\n\r\nThe repositories themselves will be effectively archived at this point. The state of the “master” branch will be recorded with a tag, named “master-archive”, but the branch itself will be deleted. The default branch for the repositories will be named “archive” and it will be a single commit with a README.md and CONTRIBUTING.md file pointing to our dotnet/runtime repository.\r\n\r\nThe repositories will remain active for servicing changes to .NET Core 3.1 and earlier hence we will not be using the GitHub archive capability. \r\n\r\n### November 22nd\r\nThe dotnet/runtime repository will be made public and available for community contribution. Even though the repository will be created on November 13th it will take several days to get it back into a working order: fixing up our build scripts, recreating our Azure Dev Ops build definitions, etc … Until those tasks are completed it will not be possible to accept pull request and hence the repository will remain private. Once we are in a state that pull requests can be merged again the repository will be made public.\r\n\r\nOur expectation is that will occur on November 22nd. If it is ready sooner it will be made public sooner. If the work takes longer than we planned then we will add an update to this announcement with a new expected date.\r\n\r\n### December 1st-2nd\r\nAll issues, open and closed, will be migrated from corefx, coreclr and core-setup into dotnet/runtime. This will be using GitHub’s existing issue transfer feature in a bulk migration. This means all of the existing issue links will continue to function via redirects.\r\n\r\nThis does mean though that labels will not transfer with the issues. Labels will be re-applied as a post processing step by our engineering team once the issue migration completes.\r\n\r\nEven though our issues won’t be fully migrated until this time we’d like the community to begin filing issues on dotnet/runtime as soon as it’s public rather than continuing to file issues on the original repositories.\r\n\r\n### Migrating Commits\r\nThe dotnet/runtime repository will be a new commit history from the original repositories. We are using this consolidation as an opportunity to clean up our history with the goal of having a cleaner, smaller history as a starting point. This means commits will be rewritten in the following ways as they are migrated to dotnet/runtime:\r\n\r\n1. Author information, contributor information, changed file list and time stamps from the original commit will be preserved.\r\n1. Links to issues, pull requests or commits in the repository using GitHub short links will be rewritten so they continue to point the original repository. \r\n1. Every commit will be appended with a link to the original commit it was mapped from.\r\n\r\nThe actual contents of the commit though will be updated to match the new directory layout of the dotnet/runtime repository.","Url":"https://github.com/dotnet/announcements/issues/133","RelatedDescription":"Open issue \"Repository Consolidation Timeline\" (#133)"},{"Id":"513963125","IsPullRequest":false,"CreatedAt":"2019-10-29T14:32:55","Actor":"mthalman","Number":"132","RawContent":null,"Title":"Release of Alpine 3.10 Docker images","State":"open","Body":"# .NET Core Alpine Docker images updated to Alpine 3.10\r\n\r\nDocker images for .NET Core have been released that support Alpine 3.10.

With [.NET Standard 2.0](https://devblogs.microsoft.com/dotnet/announcing-net-standard-2-0/), we tried to make it much more viable to share code between .NET Framework, .NET Core, and Xamarin which resulted in approximately 38K .NET Frameworks APIs being available in .NET Core 2.0. We also built the [Windows Compatibility Pack](https://devblogs.microsoft.com/dotnet/announcing-the-windows-compatibility-pack-for-net-core/) which made another 21K .NET Framework APIs available to .NET Core, resulting in almost 60K additional APIs. And in .NET Core 3.0 we added WPF and WinForms, which increased the number of .NET Framework APIs ported to .NET Core to over 120k, which is more than half of all .NET Framework APIs.\r\n\r\nIt’s also worth pointing out that we added about 62K APIs to .NET Core that don’t exist in .NET Framework. If we compare their total number of APIs, .NET Core has about 80% of the API surface of .NET Framework.\r\n\r\n<p align=\"center\">\r\n<img src=\"https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/5169960/66777114-f8db7c80-ee7c-11e9-9161-acfe1c491586.png\" width=\"600\" align=\"center\">\r\n</p>\r\n\r\nWe announced that the [future of .NET](https://devblogs.microsoft.com/dotnet/net-core-is-the-future-of-net/) will be based on .NET Core. And at Build 2019, [Scott Hunter stated](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZlO1utbB2GQ&t=54m20s) that AppDomains, remoting, Web Forms, WCF server, and Windows Workflow won’t be ported to .NET Core.\r\n\r\nWith .NET Core 3.0, we’re at the point where we’ve ported all technologies that are required for modern workloads, be that desktop apps, mobile apps, console apps, web sites, or cloud services. That’s not to say that we don’t have any gaps or opportunities for new technologies, but we generally believe we won’t be finding them in the .NET Framework code base anymore. Moving forward, we’re focusing our resources on incorporating new technologies.\r\n\r\nSimultaneously, we’re looking into releasing more of the [.NET Framework code base under the MIT license](https://github.com/microsoft/referencesource) on GitHub to allow the community to create OSS projects for technologies we’re not intending to bring to .NET Core.

While this is still work in progress, we'd like to give you an update on where we are.\r\n\r\nSo far, we've identified the following repos:\r\n\r\n* dotnet/**runtime**\r\n\t- Will contain [coreclr](https://github.com/dotnet/coreclr), [corefx](https://github.com/dotnet/corefx), [core-setup](https://github.com/dotnet/core-setup), [aspnet/Extensions](https://github.com/aspnet/Extensions), and some of [mono/mono](https://github.com/mono/mono)\r\n* [dotnet/**sdk**](https://github.com/dotnet/sdk)\r\n\t- Will contain [toolset](https://github.com/dotnet/toolset), [sdk](https://github.com/dotnet/sdk), [cli](https://github.com/dotnet/cli)\r\n* dotnet/**installer**\r\n\t- Renamed from [core-sdk](https://github.com/dotnet/core-sdk)\r\n* dotnet/**aspnetcore**\r\n\t- Moved from [aspnet/AspNetCore](https://github.com/aspnet/AspNetCore) and will also contain [aspnet/AspNetCore-Tooling](https://github.com/aspnet/AspNetCore-Tooling)\r\n* dotnet/**efcore**\r\n\t- Moved from [aspnet/EntityFrameworkCore](https://github.com/aspnet/EntityFrameworkCore)\r\n* [dotnet/**winforms**](https://github.com/dotnet/winforms)\r\n\t- Unchanged, but listed for clarity \r\n* [dotnet/**wpf**](https://github.com/dotnet/wpf)\r\n\t- Unchanged, but listed for clarity\r\n\r\n### Name changes\r\n\r\nYou might notice that we changed our mind on naming from our [earlier announcement][ann]. Based on your feedback, we decided to go with **dotnet/runtime** instead of **dotnet/platform** and **dotnet/sdk** instead of **dotnet/cli**.\r\n\r\nSeveral people pointed out that the previous names weren't relatable to how we talk about the product, for example on download pages. So, we decided to match the product distributions as the primary design point for the new names. We generally refer to the bits you need to run your app as *the runtime* and the bits you need to build apps as *the SDK*. This also matches the naming chosen by other platforms.\r\n\r\n### New repos can't be used for .NET Core 3.x or earlier\r\n\r\nThe consolidated repositories are going to be about .NET 5 and going forward. It will not be possible to build .NET Core 3.1 or earlier from these repositories. As such, only the master branch from each of the repositories will be brought forward. There will be no porting of the individual release branches in the source repositories.\r\n\r\n### Personal names and email addresses\r\n\r\nSince we're planning on rebasing the history in the merged repositories, we can map your name and email address to new values as well. We primarily do this to support our friends in the LGBTQ+ community who have changed their names to reflect their identities. However, anybody is welcome to use this to change their email and name.\r\n\r\nWhatever your reason might be: we value your contributions and we hope this small gesture makes your life a little bit better. So if you changed your name/email – or simply prefer us to use different values – please [submit a request](mailto:dotnet@microsoft.com&subject=.NET%20repo%20consolidation%3A%20request%20for%20name%20change&body=Hey%2C%20%0A%0AI%E2%80%99d%20like%20to%20change%20my%20email%2Fdisplay%20name%20in%20the%20consolidated%20repo%20from%20%0A%0A%20%20%20%20%20%20%20%20My%20Old%20Name%20%3Cold.me%40example.org%3E%20%0A%0Ato%20%0A%0A%20%20%20%20%20%20%20%20My%20New%20Name%20%3Cnew.me%40example.org%3E%20%0A%0AThanks%21%20%0A).\r\n\r\n### More is coming\r\n\r\nWe'll share more updates in the upcoming months.
