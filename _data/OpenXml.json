Two of the fonts referenced have their name in asian characters so my wild guest is that I don't have those fonts on my system, and with the presence of the knownfonts, it causes Open-Xml to die painfully when trying to load that document.\r\n\r\n**Expected**\r\n\r\nI would expect that Open-Xml don't die when loading an excel document with if that tag is found (and fonts that I don't have on my system are referenced in that excel document).
