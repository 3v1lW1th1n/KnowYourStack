This is causing problems in case we try to recompile a Component with \"templateUrl\" or \"styleUrls\" (which were already resolved in case of AOT) and generally this unnecessary work that TestBed was doing is not required. This commit adds extra logic to check whether a Component/Directive/Pipe already have compiled NG def (like ngComponentDef) and whether there are no overrides present - in this case recompilation is skipped. Recopilation is also skipped in case a Component/Directive has only Provider overrides - in this situation providers resolver function is patched to reflect overrides. Provider overrides are very common in g3, thus this code path ensures no full recompilation.\r\n\r\nThis PR resolves FW-1103.\r\n\r\n## PR Type\r\nWhat kind of change does this PR introduce?\r\n\r\n- [x] Feature\r\n\r\n## Does this PR introduce a breaking change?\r\n\r\n- [ ] Yes\r\n- [x] No","Url":"https://github.com/angular/angular/pull/29294","RelatedDescription":"Open PR \"feat(ivy): avoid unnecessary recompilations in TestBed\" (#29294)"},{"Id":"420779604","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2019-03-14T00:31:01","Actor":"gkalpak","Number":"29293","RawContent":null,"Title":"build(docs-infra): automatically create previews for members of `aio-auto-previews`","State":"open","Body":"GitHub team: [aio-auto-previews][1]\r\n\r\n[1]: https://github.com/orgs/angular/teams/aio-auto-previews","Url":"https://github.com/angular/angular/pull/29293","RelatedDescription":"Open PR \"build(docs-infra): automatically create previews for members of `aio-auto-previews`\" (#29293)"},{"Id":"420775001","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2019-03-14T00:08:54","Actor":"matsko","Number":"29292","RawContent":null,"Title":"fix(ivy): introduce host-specific styling instructions","State":"open","Body":"This patch is the first of a few patches which separates the\r\nstyling logic between template bindings (e.g. `<div [style]`)\r\nfrom host bindings (e.g. `@HostBinding('style')`).

In this commit, default imports\r\nprocessed in a type-to-value conversion were recorded as non-local imports\r\nwith a '*' name, and the ImportManager generated a new default import for\r\nthem. When transpiled to ES2015 modules, this resulted in the following\r\ncorrect code:\r\n\r\nimport i3 from './module';\r\n\r\n// somewhere in the file, a value reference of i3:\r\n{type: i3}\r\n\r\nHowever, when the AST with this synthetic import and reference was\r\ntranspiled to non-ES2015 modules (for example, to commonjs) an issue\r\nappeared:\r\n\r\nvar module_1 = require('./module');\r\n{type: i3}\r\n\r\nTypeScript renames the imported identifier from i3 to module_1, but doesn't\r\nsubstitute later references to i3. This is because the import and reference\r\nare both synthetic, and never went through the TypeScript AST step of\r\n\"binding\" which associates the reference to its import. This association is\r\nimportant during emit when the identifiers might change.\r\n\r\nSynthetic (transformer-added) imports will never be bound properly. The only\r\npossible solution is to reuse the user's original import and the identifier\r\nfrom it, which will be properly downleveled. The issue with this approach\r\n(which prompted the fix in b6f6b117) is that if the import is only used in a\r\ntype position, TypeScript will mark it for deletion in the generated JS,\r\neven though additional non-type usages are added in the transformer. This\r\nagain would leave a dangling import.\r\n\r\nTo work around this, it's necessary for the compiler to keep track of\r\nidentifiers that it emits which came from default imports, and tell TS not\r\nto remove those imports during transpilation. A `DefaultImportTracker` class\r\nis implemented to perform this tracking. It implements a\r\n`DefaultImportRecorder` interface, which is used to record two significant\r\npieces of information:\r\n\r\n* when a WrappedNodeExpr is generated which refers to a default imported\r\n  value, the ts.Identifier is associated to the ts.ImportDeclaration via\r\n  the recorder.\r\n* when that WrappedNodeExpr is later emitted as part of the statement /\r\n  expression translators, the fact that the ts.Identifier was used is\r\n  also recorded.\r\n\r\nCombined, this tracking gives the `DefaultImportTracker` enough information\r\nto implement another TS transformer, which can recognize default imports\r\nwhich were used in the output of the Ivy transform and can prevent them\r\nfrom being elided. This is done by creating a new ts.ImportDeclaration for\r\nthe imports with the same ts.ImportClause. A test verifies that this works.\r\n","Url":"https://github.com/angular/angular/pull/29266","RelatedDescription":"Closed or merged PR \"fix(ivy): reuse default exports in type-to-value references\" (#29266)"},{"Id":"420218340","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2019-03-12T21:55:46","Actor":"devversion","Number":"29270","RawContent":null,"Title":"ci: run legacy saucelabs for every build [patch]","State":"closed","Body":"Patch version of #29255 ","Url":"https://github.com/angular/angular/pull/29270","RelatedDescription":"Closed or merged PR \"ci: run legacy saucelabs for every build [patch]\" (#29270)"},{"Id":"420215781","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2019-03-12T21:33:02","Actor":"matsko","Number":"29269","RawContent":null,"Title":"fix(ivy): ensure template styles/classes are applied before directives are instantiated","State":"open","Body":"Angular Ivy interprets inline static style/class attribute values as instructions that\r\nare processed whilst an element gets created.
