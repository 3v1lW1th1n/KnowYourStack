Vue is a relatively new passion for me, so please excuse me if this request does not fit well in the Vue's log term vision or if the proposed solution lacks completeness. I have read all GitHub issues that might touch upon the same problem, but none of them was described well or was adding useful business context. \r\n\r\n#### Problem\r\n\r\nThe business case is that I want to use Vue in the context of a multipage application, where the components used on the page are not known at build time. The decision is taken by content editors via a CMS page builder, which will generate dynamic HTML pages on the fly using the Vue components signatures corresponding to the Props they have modified at Page design time.\r\n\r\nAs a developer, I want to be able to provide extensibility points on top of Vue, that will allow content editors to choose between different set of predefiend templates for any Vue component that I have provided as a building block for the pages they will manage.\r\n\r\nVue already supports dynamic template compilation and static render functions for performance optimisations. This is part of its core and absolutely love the performance optimisations part of the VNode compilation analysis. The problem is that the internals of Vue that process this functionality are not well documented and or easy to use, so it took me couple of days of digging to find the solution (below).\r\n\r\nMy goal with reporting this issue is to improve the discoverability of that aspect of Vue, so it becomes a preferred choice for developers building various frameworks on top of Vue. I think, this will also help people develop better UI libraries on top of Vue, such as Vuetify, Bootstrap Vue and etc.. My feeling is that most developers did not found how to enable their UI components to support dynamic templates and improve the extensibility of their UI libraries. \r\n\r\nHere is the code that I developed to deal with it:\r\n\r\n``` JavaScript\r\n    export default {\r\n        name: \"Error\",\r\n        props: {\r\n            templateId: {\r\n                type: String  // templateId gives the address of the template to be used in the form of script tag Id\r\n            },\r\n            heading: {\r\n                type: String\r\n            },\r\n            message: {\r\n                type: String\r\n            }\r\n        },\r\n        render: function (h) {\r\n            let template = document.getElementById(this.templateId);\r\n            if (typeof this.templateId === 'undefined' || template === null)\r\n                return this.renderDefaultTemplate();\r\n\r\n            const compiled = Vue.compile(template.innerHTML.trim());\r\n            this.$options.staticRenderFns = [];\r\n            this._staticTrees = [];\r\n            compiled.staticRenderFns.map(fn => (this.$options.staticRenderFns.push(fn)));\r\n\r\n            return compiled.render.call(this);\r\n        },\r\n        methods: {\r\n            renderDefaultTemplate: function () {\r\n                // template generated with https://vuejs-tips.github.io/compiler/\r\n                const staticRender = new Function(`with (this) {\r\n            return _c('div', {\r\n                staticClass: \"error-message-box\"\r\n            }, [_c('div', {\r\n                staticClass: \"error-header\"\r\n            }, [_c('p', [_v(_s(heading))])]), _c('div', {\r\n                staticClass: \"error-main-message\"\r\n            }, [_c('p', [_v(_s(message))])])])\r\n        }`);\r\n                return staticRender.call(this);\r\n            }\r\n        }\r\n    };\r\n\r\n```\r\n\r\n### What does the proposed API look like?\r\nI see 3 possible directions for solution\r\n\r\n**Option 1:** if you think that the existing API is adequate, I would love to participate in improving the documentation for the render aspect of Vue.\r\n\r\n**Option 2:**  If you like the idea of refactoring current compilation functions in order to expose an easy-to-consume API function for developers, I would love to contribute too.\r\n\r\nI am thinking of something that will transform the following lines:\r\n\r\n```\r\n  const compiled = Vue.compile(template.innerHTML.trim());\r\n            this.$options.staticRenderFns = [];\r\n            this._staticTrees = [];\r\n            compiled.staticRenderFns.map(fn => (this.$options.staticRenderFns.push(fn)));\r\n\r\n            return compiled.render.call(this);\r\n```\r\n\r\nto the following lines:\r\n\r\n```\r\n            const compiledCode = Vue.compile(template.innerHTML.trim());\r\n            return compiledCode.toVirualNodes(options);\r\n```\r\n\r\n**Option 3:** . If you consider this to be more suitable for Vue 3, I would love to contribute there too.\r\n\r\nJust let me know on your thoughts of the relevance and value of this for the community and the project and I would love to make it happen!\r\n\r\n<!-- generated by vue-issues.

But there is no suitable place to get the dom snapshots. Of course, I can use the hook `beforeUpdate`, but there are some problems for it. Because the flip context should cache the state for all its related doms' snapshots (the dom may be a portal, which isn't the descendant of the flip context), and currently the schedule strategy for updating watchers may make the snapshot not reliable.\r\n\r\nFor example, the flip context includes componentA and componentB, and componentB is neighbor of componentA. When componentA and componentB both need to update, the scheduler will update componentA's watcher, and then componentB's.\r\nIn componentA's `beforeUpdate` hook, we cache its dom's snapshot, then updating its view, .e.g, its height. Then in componentB's `beforeUpdate` hook, we cache a WRONG snapshot, because a layout reflow will be triggered by previous componentA's update, affecting componentB's bounding rect (and here an unnecessary layout reflow is triggered).\r\n\r\nTo handle this case, we can do something like React, which updates watchers without updating dom, but collects their side effects (dom updates), and until the all states are stable. Then trigger watchers' some api like `getSnapshotBeforeUpdate()`, and finally flush all side effects.\r\n\r\n\r\n### What does the proposed API look like?\r\n`getSnapshotBeforeUpdate()`, triggered after all watchers' updated, and before flushing all side effects (dom updates).\r\n\r\n<!-- generated by vue-issues.

I have created an application with a large number of components and modules and therefore a large number of namespaced getters. Every time such a getter is invoked the makeLocalGetters function is called iterating trough all the getters in the store just to create the gettersProxy object. This is overkill for ssr performance and is being flagged as a CPU consuming process in the node profiler. \r\nI have managed to double the number of requests per second my ssr app can handle just by using memoization on the gettersProxy object creation. I think this is really impacting performance.\r\n\r\n### What is expected?\r\nNamespaced getters invokation not to be inefficient with large numbers of getters/modules\r\n\r\n### What is actually happening?\r\nA lot of hits to makeLocalGetters making performance go down\r\n\r\n<!-- generated by vue-issues.

Plugins _alter_ an existing store / module, modules provide some completed state based functionality. \r\n\r\nTherefore it can often be the case where a reusable and freely distributed module is desirable (e.g. to include in multiple projects or multiple component libraries). \r\n\r\nAt the moment Vuex's documentation strikes a surprising balance of brevity and coverage (although in my opinion plugins could use some more expansion). However, the mention of how to make and distribute vuex modules is completely absent. \r\n\r\nSince Vue and the Vue ecosystem has lowered the barrier to entry to web development, not using Vue has complete coverage of the nuances of JavaScript and the many core libraries that help it work on the web (e.g. Babel)\r\n\r\nThus it would be relevant and beneficial to provide a complete example (even if it is minimal) of how to make a truly reusable module.\r\n\r\n\r\n### What does the proposed API look like?\r\nI would consider something simplistic (e.g. the counter app). However, I would suggest 2  modifications:\r\n\r\n1. an async / await version (as this can cause trouble with bundling)\r\n2. a typescript variant\r\n\r\n```js\r\n// reusable module\r\n\r\nconst state = () => ({\r\n  count: 0,\r\n  delay: 500\r\n})\r\n\r\nconst getters = {\r\n\r\n}\r\n\r\nconst actions = {\r\n  async updateCount({state, commit}, byHowMuch) {\r\n    let newCount = await setTimeout( () => state.count   byHowMuch, state.delay)\r\n    commit('setCount', newCount)\r\n  }\r\n}\r\n\r\nconst mutations = {\r\n  setCount(state, amount) {\r\n    state.count = amount\r\n  }\r\n}\r\n\r\n\r\nexport {namespaced:true, state, mutations, actions, getters}\r\n```\r\n\r\n\r\nthen provide the configuration file for how to use rollup and deploy to npm / yarn \r\n\r\n\r\nthen provide how to incorporate with nuxt\r\n\r\n\r\n```\r\n// <nuxt-project>/store/AsyncCountModule/index.js\r\nimport AsyncCountModule from 'AsyncCountModule'\r\n\r\nexport AsyncCountModule //<-- this doesnt work \r\n```\r\n\r\n<!-- generated by vue-issues.

This would prevent unintended reading or manipulation of state which should be done through getters or actions/mutations respectively. As far as I know, there is no good way to achieve this today in Vuex.\r\n\r\n### What does the proposed API look like?\r\nThe API could look something like this:\r\n\r\nA store:\r\n```javascript\r\n{\r\n  state() {\r\n    return {\r\n      somethingPublic: ''\r\n    };\r\n  },\r\n\r\n  privateState() {\r\n    return {\r\n      somethingPrivate: []\r\n    };\r\n  },\r\n\r\n  getters: {\r\n    filtered: (state, getters, privateState) => privateState.somethingPrivate.filter(...)\r\n  }\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nIn a component:\r\n```javascript\r\n// works:\r\nthis.$store.state.somethingPublic\r\nthis.$store.getters.filtered\r\n// doesn't work:\r\nthis.$store.state.somethingPrivate\r\nthis.$store.privateState.somethingPrivate\r\n```\r\n\r\nThanks.\r\n\r\n<!-- generated by vue-issues.
