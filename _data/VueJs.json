There will be some logic implement in different component.However, does the parent component need to consider all the details of the child component?\r\n\r\nI think when I create a component.I would like to encapsulate all the logic related to this component inside the component.Because the logic should belong to the component.Next time, when use this component in new component, I just need to think about the logic of the new component.\r\n\r\nBesides,most applications now require asynchronous requests.Getting status from parent component is very common.So some time I will use ugly way to make it work.\r\n\r\ncomponent A\r\n```\r\n<template>\r\n  <div>\r\n    <component-b v-bind:go=\"ajax\"></component-b>\r\n  </div>\r\n</template>\r\n<script>\r\nexport default {\r\n  name: \"componentA\",\r\n  methods: {\r\n    ajax() {\r\n      return httprequest()\r\n    }\r\n  }\r\n}\r\n</script>\r\n```\r\n\r\ncomponent B\r\n```\r\n<template>\r\n  <button v-on:click=\"emit\">\r\n    <span v-if=\"loading\">loading...</span>\r\n    <span>component-b</span>\r\n  </button>\r\n</template>\r\n<script>\r\nexport default {\r\n  name: \"componentB\",\r\n  props: ['loading', 'go'],\r\n  methods: {\r\n    emit() {\r\n      this.loading = true\r\n      this.go().then(() => {\r\n        this.loading = false\r\n      })\r\n    }\r\n  }\r\n}\r\n</script>\r\n```\r\n\r\nI think it isn't a good way, but it's efficient.\r\n\r\nI have found a way to custom event modifiers in `vue-template-compiler`, If you want I can write a demo to show how it's efficient.\r\n\r\n🖖\r\n\r\n### What does the proposed API look like?\r\nAdd an async modifier.\r\n\r\n\r\ncomponent A \r\n```\r\n<template>\r\n  <div>\r\n    <component-b v-on:go.async=\"ajax\"></component-b>\r\n  </div>\r\n</template>\r\n<script>\r\nexport default {\r\n  name: \"componentA\",\r\n  methods: {\r\n    ajax() {\r\n      return httprequest()\r\n    }\r\n  }\r\n}\r\n</script>\r\n```\r\ncomponent B\r\n```\r\n<template>\r\n  <button v-on:click=\"emit\">\r\n    <span v-if=\"loading\">loading...</span>\r\n    <span>component-b</span>\r\n  </button>\r\n</template>\r\n<script>\r\nexport default {\r\n  name: \"componentB\",\r\n  props: ['loading'],\r\n  methods: {\r\n    emit() {\r\n      this.loading = true\r\n      this.$emit('go').then(() => {\r\n        this.loading = false\r\n      })\r\n    }\r\n  }\r\n}\r\n</script>\r\n```\r\n\r\n<!-- generated by vue-issues.

I want the whole card to be user-clickable.\r\n2. I prerender my pages using `prerenderer-spa-plugin` and I want only the title of the card to be an anchor element for SEO reasons.\r\n3. Again for SEO reasons, I don't want the whole card to be an anchor element since it will also contain `Content` and `More content` as anchor text.\r\n\r\nNow I understand where this behavior is coming from, it's trying to prevent a child anchor from triggering a full page navigation. Without using `router-link` I can get the best of both worlds by making a clickable div whose event does not propagate and trigger the inner anchor while web crawlers still relate `/route/3` to `I am a good link`:\r\n\r\n```\r\n<div class=\"card\" @click.prevent=\"$router.push({ name: 'MyRoute', params: { id: 3 } })\">\r\n  <h2><a href=\"/route/3\">I am a good link</a></h2>\r\n  <p>Content</p>\r\n  <p>More content</p>\r\n</div>\r\n```\r\n\r\nThese lines are responsible for this behavior:\r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/vuejs/vue-router/blob/9880cbda8dd299315a253abaab69da00eecdf635/src/components/link.js#L86-L99\r\n\r\nNote a shortcoming of this implementation: should the user place more than one anchor element inside the `router-link`, only the first one will get enhanced while the other ones will still trigger a full page reload. To me that scenario makes little sense and I have no idea of any real use case, but perhaps it should raise a warning.\r\n\r\nIs there any 'official' stance on my workaround?\r\n\r\n<!-- generated by vue-issues.

This is suboptimal since it doesn't allow users to provide their own store type.\r\n\r\nBy utilizing TS2.8's conditional type, we can write a `PermissiveAny<T>` type which allows users to customize interface with `any` as fall-back. It can provide **opt-in** type safety for store.\r\n\r\nThe store type is parameterized by `State`. By introducing a global `RootState` interface, we can annotate `$store` as `Store<PermissiveAny<RootState>>`. If users don't augment `RootState`, the $store type is equivalent to `Store<any>`. On the other hand, if users do augment `RootState`, the store type will be changed to `Store<RootState>`.\r\n\r\nEffectively, this feature allows users to manual annotate store type, but without breaking existing code.\r\n\r\ncc @blake-newman @ktsn ","Url":"https://github.com/vuejs/vuex/pull/1192","RelatedDescription":"Open PR \"[feat] [WIP] Store augmentation\" (#1192)"},{"Id":"305255470","IsPullRequest":false,"CreatedAt":"2018-03-14T17:24:15","Actor":"corsarioll","Number":"1190","RawContent":null,"Title":"push element in to state ","State":"closed","Body":"I try to add an element to an array but it returns this error\r\n\r\nTypeError: Cannot add property 5, object is not extensible\r\n    at Array.push (<anonymous>)\r\n    at Store.addProjectsMutation (store.js?adc6:67)\r\n    at wrappedMutationHandler (vuex.esm.js?358c:697)\r\n    at commitIterator (vuex.esm.js?358c:389)\r\n    at Array.forEach (<anonymous>)\r\n    at eval (vuex.esm.js?358c:388)\r\n    at Store._withCommit (vuex.esm.js?358c:495)\r\n    at Store.commit (vuex.esm.js?358c:387)\r\n    at Object.boundCommit [as commit] (vuex.esm.js?358c:335)\r\n    at eval (store.js?adc6:120)\r\n\r\neste es mi codigo \r\n\r\n`addProjectsMutation (state,newValue){\r\n            var test = {\r\n                name : \"jeisson\",\r\n                email : \"test@email.com\",\r\n                logoImage : \"https://files.genial.guru/files/news/part_2/20205/1215060-4-1-650-a542d8629a-1501787353.jpg\",\r\n                description : \"test description con espacios y saltos de linea   asd  asd  das  dasd\"\r\n            }\r\n            console.log(state.projects)\r\n            state.projects.push(test)\r\n        },\r\n`","Url":"https://github.com/vuejs/vuex/issues/1190","RelatedDescription":"Closed issue \"push element in to state \" (#1190)"}],"ResultType":"GitHubIssue"}},"RunOn":"2018-04-07T05:30:33.2731639Z","RunDurationInMilliseconds":4579}
