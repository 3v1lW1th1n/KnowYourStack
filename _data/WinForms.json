Windows-native","State":"open","Body":"* .NET Core Version: 3.0\r\n* Have you experienced this same bug with .NET Framework?: Yes\r\n\r\nWith the removal of MainMenu and ContextMenu native wrappers in

obvious, but there are a few usability differences as well:\r\n\r\n* In `RenderMode = System`, the hover highlight over a menu item with subitems - after the subitem menu becomes visible - lingers\r\n* In the native menu, clicking on a menu item when the window is unfocused immediately activates that item; MenuStrip requires a second click\r\n* In the native menu, pressing left arrow key when the first menu item is highlighted brings out the \"right-click on window title bar\" menu as if it was another menu item: \r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/3685160/70310763-b432e880-1810-11ea-98f5-f6072ad1f510.png)\r\n* The native menu does not take up any space in `Form.ClientHeight`; when migrating to a `MenuStrip`, you will lose 20 pixels of height\r\n* There is a positioning difference between the native and strip context menu when invoked by a dedicated context menu key instead of a mouse\r\n* Possibly more, this is just what I noticed after a few minutes of testing\r\n\r\n### Test Project\r\n\r\nThe test project targets .NET Core 3.0, and opens 3 windows (native + the 2 strip variations).\r\n\r\n[WindowsFormsStripControlsCore.zip](https://github.com/dotnet/winforms/files/3931357/WindowsFormsStripControlsCore.zip)\r\n","Url":"https://github.com/dotnet/winforms/issues/2476","RelatedDescription":"Open
