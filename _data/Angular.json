There is no way to actually grab the HTML inside ng-content with ALL events, nothing stripped.  This is a missing feature.  There is nowhere in angular to grab the content, change/modify it and then dump it back into a different element.  \r\n\r\nWhen using a component with ng-content in the template, there is no way to grab the actual templated HTML from the child component.  I can retrieve the angular-event stripped HTML but that does not help me.\r\n\r\nExample: Collapse Table\r\n\r\nCollapse Table Component\r\n`selector: 'collapse-table'`\r\n\r\nCollapse Table HTML Template\r\n```\r\n<table #tableContent>\r\n    <ng-content></ng-content>\r\n</table>\r\n```\r\n\r\nUsage: \r\n\r\n```\r\n<collapse-table>\r\n    <thead>\r\n        <tr>\r\n            <th>Test</th>\r\n        </tr>\r\n    </thead>\r\n    <tbody>\r\n        <tr *ngFor=\"let item of items\">\r\n            <td (click)=\"test()\">{{item.test}}</td>\r\n        </tr>\r\n    </tbody>\r\n</collapse-table>\r\n```\r\n\r\nInside Collapse Table Component I am using a @ViewChild and grabbing tableContent.  The innerHtml of tableContent strips out the (click)=\"test()\" event, which I need!  Why can I not grab the entire template?\r\n\r\nWhat I am attempting to do is grab the data, sort it via the collapse table component and output it into a new element and hide the original ng-content.  \r\n\r\n\r\n### Describe the solution you'd like\r\nShould be able to grab the actual content of ng-content with all events, and allow that HTML to then be place into another element's `[innerHtml]`.  \r\n\r\n\r\n### Describe alternatives you've considered\r\nThere are no workaround since the events get stripped out.  Theres seems to be no way to modify the data of ng-content at this time.\r\n","Url":"https://github.com/angular/angular/issues/27930","RelatedDescription":"Open issue \"Get HTML with angular events from ng-content\" (#27930)"},{"Id":"395949709","IsPullRequest":false,"CreatedAt":"2019-01-04T14:45:08","Actor":"rzvjerkovic","Number":"27929","RawContent":null,"Title":"Dot segments from path not removed","State":"open","Body":"# üêû bug report\r\n\r\n### Affected Package\r\n@angular/router\r\n\r\n### Is this a regression?\r\nNo\r\n\r\n### Description\r\nBy RFC3986 (https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc3986#page-33) dot segments should be removed from path.\r\n\r\nWhen accessing `localhost:4200/segment/./segment` by browser navigator, browser strips the dot segments and Angular router recieves `localhost:4200/segment/segment`.

Create a new project\r\n### 2. Create a lazy module\r\n\r\nI'm using this `app.routing.ts`:\r\n\r\n```js\r\nimport { Routes, RouterModule, PreloadAllModules  } from '@angular/router';\r\nimport { ModuleWithProviders } from '@angular/core';\r\n\r\nexport const routes: Routes = [\r\n    { path: '', loadChildren: './pages/dashboard/dashboard.module#DashboardModule', data: { breadcrumb: 'Dashboard' } },\r\n    { path: '**', redirectTo: '', pathMatch: 'full'},\r\n];\r\n\r\nexport const routing: ModuleWithProviders = RouterModule.forRoot(routes, {\r\n   preloadingStrategy: PreloadAllModules\r\n});\r\n```\r\n\r\n### 3. Run an AOT serve or build.\r\n\r\nCall build/serve using `--aot`\r\n\r\n```cmd\r\n> ng serve --aot\r\n```\r\n\r\nAnd, then, get an error on your browser console:\r\n\r\n```js\r\nERROR Error: Uncaught (in promise): Error: Cannot find module './pages/dashboard/dashboard.module'\r\nError: Cannot find module './pages/dashboard/dashboard.module'\r\n    at $_lazy_route_resource lazy namespace object:23\r\n    at ZoneDelegate.push../node_modules/zone.js/dist/zone.js.ZoneDelegate.invoke (zone.js:388)\r\n    at Object.onInvoke (core.js:14143)\r\n    at ZoneDelegate.push../node_modules/zone.js/dist/zone.js.ZoneDelegate.invoke (zone.js:387)\r\n    at Zone.push../node_modules/zone.js/dist/zone.js.Zone.run (zone.js:138)\r\n    at zone.js:872\r\n    at ZoneDelegate.push../node_modules/zone.js/dist/zone.js.ZoneDelegate.invokeTask (zone.js:421)\r\n    at Object.onInvokeTask (core.js:14134)\r\n    at ZoneDelegate.push../node_modules/zone.js/dist/zone.js.ZoneDelegate.invokeTask (zone.js:420)\r\n    at Zone.push../node_modules/zone.js/dist/zone.js.Zone.runTask (zone.js:188)\r\n    at resolvePromise (zone.js:814)\r\n    at resolvePromise (zone.js:771)\r\n    at zone.js:873\r\n    at ZoneDelegate.push../node_modules/zone.js/dist/zone.js.ZoneDelegate.invokeTask (zone.js:421)\r\n    at Object.onInvokeTask (core.js:14134)\r\n    at ZoneDelegate.push../node_modules/zone.js/dist/zone.js.ZoneDelegate.invokeTask (zone.js:420)\r\n    at Zone.push../node_modules/zone.js/dist/zone.js.Zone.runTask (zone.js:188)\r\n    at drainMicroTaskQueue (zone.js:595)\r\n```\r\n\r\n_Originally posted by @danielpcampagna in https://github.com/_render_node/MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDQ1MTUyNzk0OQ==/timeline/issue_comment#issuecomment-451527949_","Url":"https://github.com/angular/angular-cli/issues/13369","RelatedDescription":"Open issue \"Lazy Loading in AOT doesn't work in 7.1.4 \" (#13369)"},{"Id":"395895122","IsPullRequest":false,"CreatedAt":"2019-01-04T11:32:03","Actor":"DanielHabenicht","Number":"13368","RawContent":null,"Title":"ServiceWorker: Standard NavigationUrls do not respect baseHref","State":"open","Body":"### Bug Report or Feature Request (mark with an `x`)\r\n```\r\n- [x] bug report\r\n- [] feature request\r\n```\r\n\r\n### Command (mark with an `x`)\r\n```\r\n- [ ] new\r\n- [x] build\r\n- [ ] serve\r\n- [ ] test\r\n- [ ] e2e\r\n- [ ] generate\r\n- [ ] add\r\n- [ ] update\r\n- [ ] lint\r\n- [ ] xi18n\r\n- [ ] run\r\n- [ ] config\r\n- [ ] help\r\n- [ ] version\r\n- [ ] doc\r\n```\r\n\r\n### Versions\r\n<!--\r\nOutput from: `node --version`, `npm --version` and `ng --version`.\r\n  Windows (7/8/10).

Every language is served under a different path, e.g.:\r\n```\r\nhttps://coolapp.com/en/\r\nhttps://coolapp.com/de/\r\n```\r\nWhen changing the language both service workers do collide in their responsibility, as both match their pattern: \r\n```\r\n    {\r\n      \"positive\": true,\r\n      \"regex\": \"^\\\\/.*$\"\r\n    }\r\n```\r\nand want to serve their `index.html`. By scoping them to their respective location on the server they do not collide anymore. \r\n\r\n### Workaround (nasty)\r\nDefine different `\"ngswConfigPath\": \"src/ngsw-config.json\"` (full duplicates) in your `angular.json` for each environment and specify the `navigationUrls` accordingly:\r\n```\r\n\"navigationUrls\": [\r\n    \"/de/**\",\r\n    \"!/**/*.*\",\r\n    \"! /**/*__*\",\r\n    \"! /**/*__*/**\"\r\n  ]\r\n```","Url":"https://github.com/angular/angular-cli/issues/13368","RelatedDescription":"Open issue \"ServiceWorker: Standard NavigationUrls do not respect baseHref\" (#13368)"},{"Id":"395789182","IsPullRequest":false,"CreatedAt":"2019-01-04T08:23:41","Actor":"whoopnip","Number":"13364","RawContent":null,"Title":"assets not included in build or serve on one machine but works fine on another","State":"closed","Body":"<!--\r\nIF YOU DON'T FILL OUT THE FOLLOWING INFORMATION YOUR ISSUE MIGHT BE CLOSED WITHOUT INVESTIGATING\r\n-->\r\n### Bug Report or Feature Request (mark with an `x`)\r\n```\r\n- [x] bug report -> please search issues before submitting\r\n- [ ] feature request\r\n```\r\n\r\n### Command (mark with an `x`)\r\n```\r\n- [ ] new\r\n- [x] build\r\n- [x] serve\r\n- [ ] test\r\n- [ ] e2e\r\n- [ ] generate\r\n- [ ] add\r\n- [ ] update\r\n- [ ] lint\r\n- [ ] xi18n\r\n- [ ] run\r\n- [ ] config\r\n- [ ] help\r\n- [ ] version\r\n- [ ] doc\r\n```\r\n\r\n### Versions\r\n<!--\r\nOutput from: `node --version`, `npm --version` and `ng --version`.\r\n  Windows (7/8/10).
