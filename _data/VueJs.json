[Vanilla vue.js warns when assigment in v-if happens](https://codepen.io/grandsong/pen/xoLxvM)\r\n2. [My modified vue.js doesn't warn when assigment in v-if happens](https://codepen.io/grandsong/pen/PrKwQj)\r\n\r\nRemember to open Dev Tools and check the Console.\r\n\r\nThe code in question is `<span v-if=\"pet = person.pet\">`.\r\n\r\n### What happens in vanilla vue.js?\r\n\r\nvue.js doesn't check the content of the expression of a `v-if`.\r\n\r\nTo it, `pet = person.pet` is just an arbitrary expression.\r\n\r\nIt desn't care whether assigment happens in a `v-if`.\r\n\r\nAll if conditions will be compiled as ternary statements.\r\n\r\nIn the example, the compiled codes will be like:\r\n\r\n  \t((pet = person.pet) ? `${person.name}'s pet's name is ${pet.name}.` : `${person.name} has no pet.`)\r\n\r\nAs a result, while the template is being rendered, at the beginning when the renderer meets this identifier `pet`, the **proxy** of vue instane (let's name it as `vm`) will automatically try to get `pet` as a property of the instance.\r\n\r\nOf course it will fail. `vm.pet` has not been defined yet.\r\nSo, a **warning** will be thrown.\r\n\r\n    [Vue warn]: Property or method \"pet\" is not defined on the instance but referenced during render.\r\n\r\nThen, the renderer meets `= person.pet`, so it assigns the `pet` as a property of the vue instance, namely, `vm.pet = person.pet`.\r\n\r\nAfter that, when it meets `pet` again in `pet.name`, it gets `pet` (namely, `vm.pet`) successfully.\r\n\r\nIf we would manually do the rendering in place of vue (without the help of the magical proxy and its get-handler), we will deal with codes like this:\r\n\r\n    ((vm.pet = person.pet) ? `${person.name}'s pet's name is ${vm.pet.name}.` : `${person.name} has no pet.`)\r\n\r\nA spoiler: `person` is different. It doesn't bother the proxy.\r\n\r\n## Why do we need assigment in v-if?\r\n\r\nWhy do we need any shorthand (like `:` for `v-bind:`), or sugar syntax (`for in` instead of `for(var ..;..<..length;..++)`), etc?\r\n\r\nMaking life easier!\r\n\r\nWe can live with inconvenience. But we still ask for better life when we have chance.\r\n\r\n#### The above demos\r\n\r\nWithout the assigment, the codes would become\r\n\r\n    <span v-if=\"person.pet\">{{person.name}}'s pet's name is {{person.pet.name}}.</span>\r\n\r\nWell, looks completely tolerable...\r\n\r\nBut, what if the design is more complex?\r\n\r\n    <span v-if=\"person.pet\">\r\n    \t<span v-if=\"person.pet.hunger > 0\">\r\n    \t\t{{person.name}}'s pet's {{person.pet.name}} needs to eat\r\n    \t\t<span> {{foodDict[person.pet.favFoodId]}}</span>\r\n    \t\t, which\r\n    \t\t<span v-if=\"foodQtyInStore[person.pet.favFoodId]\"> you have {{foodQtyInStore[person.pet.favFoodId]}}.</span>\r\n    \t\t<span v-else class=\"color-warning\"> is out of stock!<span>\r\n    \t</span>\r\n    </span>\r\n\r\nCompare it with\r\n\r\n    <span v-if=\"pet = person.pet\">\r\n    \t<span v-if=\"pet.hunger > 0\">\r\n    \t\t{{person.name}}'s pet's {{pet.name}} needs to eat\r\n    \t\t<span> {{foodDict[pet.favFoodId].name}}</span>\r\n    \t\t, which\r\n    \t\t<span v-if=\"foodQty = foodQtyInStore[pet.favFoodId]\"> you have {{foodQty}}.</span>\r\n    \t\t<span v-else class=\"color-warning\"> is out of stock!<span>\r\n    \t</span>\r\n    </span>\r\n\r\n\r\n#### `slotScope`\r\n\r\nAnd let's take another example - an example in the source of **vue.js itself**:\r\n\r\n\t\tfunction processSlotContent (el) {\r\n\t\t  let slotScope\r\n\t\t  if (el.tag === 'template') {\r\n\t\t    ...\r\n\t\t  } else if ((slotScope = getAndRemoveAttr(el, 'slot-scope'))) {\r\n\t\t    ...\r\n\t\t    el.slotScope = slotScope\r\n\t\t  }\r\n\t\t  ...\r\n\t\t}\r\n\r\n(It purposely uses double brackets to fool lint-flow-types, which forbids assigment in if.)\r\n\r\nWithout the assigment, it would become\r\n\r\n\t\tfunction processSlotContent (el) {\r\n\t\t  let slotScope\r\n\t\t  if (el.tag === 'template') {\r\n\t\t    ...\r\n\t\t  } else if (getAndRemoveAttr(el, 'slot-scope')) {\r\n\t\t    ...\r\n\t\t    el.slotScope = getAndRemoveAttr(el, 'slot-scope')\r\n\t\t  }\r\n\t\t  ...\r\n\t\t}\r\n\r\nI don't know if it is OK for `getAndRemoveAttr(el, 'slot-scope')` to be called twice.\r\nProbably not.\r\n\r\nMaybe we still have to use assigment, just not in if-condition.\r\n\r\n\t\tfunction processSlotContent (el) {\r\n\t\t  let slotScope\r\n\t\t  if (el.tag === 'template') {\r\n\t\t    ...\r\n\t\t  } else {\r\n\t\t\t  slotScope = getAndRemoveAttr(el, 'slot-scope')\r\n\t\t\t\tif (slotScope) {\r\n\t\t\t    ...\r\n\t\t\t    el.slotScope = slotScope\r\n\t\t\t  }\r\n\t\t\t}\r\n\t\t  ...\r\n\t\t}\r\n\r\n#### `if let`\r\n\r\nAnother thing we can analogize to is the `if let` in Swift.\r\n\r\nSee [Optional Binding](https://docs.swift.org/swift-book/LanguageGuide/TheBasics.html#ID333) if you haven't learnt it or don't quite recall.\r\n\r\nBefore I learnt this feature of Swift, I was very reluctant to assigment in if-condition.\r\n\r\nBecause it would remind me of my several stupid mistakes of `=` for `==` as well as my old time as a JS newbie.\r\n\r\nI would rather write more codes (like the `slotScope` one) to avoid assigment in if-condition.\r\n\r\nBut Swift gave me a good lesson.\r\nSmart people should embrace useful features when opportunity allows (designing a new language).\r\n\r\n#### What about danger?\r\n\r\nIn pure JS, thanks to js linters, assigment in if-condition is not as dangerous as it used to be. Mistakes of `=` for `==` can be easily detected.\r\n\r\n(That's why [#7631 warn when assignment in v-if in development mode](https://github.com/vuejs/vue/issues/7631) was closed by @posva.)\r\n\r\n## Then, what's wrong with vue?\r\n\r\nIn vue, it is another story.\r\n\r\nThere is no way to easily create local variables yet.\r\n\r\nSo, even if I just want assignment outside v-if, I cannot assign at all.\r\n\r\n(There is [a solution](https://github.com/posva/vue-local-scope) for `slot-scope`. But I seldom use slots.)\r\n\r\nWhether we deserve such freedom is beyond this issue. Let's leave it and focus on assignment in `v-if`.\r\n\r\nPlease remember these fact:\r\n\r\n- assignment in `v-if` **already** works\r\n\r\n- the warning thrown is not very helpful\r\n\r\nThe warning is thrown, not because vue has a rule which forbids assignment in `v-if`, but because vue fails to recognize the identifier as a new one, which of course is not defined.\r\n\r\n### And, bug?\r\n\r\nAnd there can be possible conflict (I don't know if it can be called a bug/loophole):\r\n\r\nIf somehow the developer writes\r\n\r\n\t\tdata() {\r\n      return {\r\n        b: false,\r\n        pet: {\r\n        \t// some other pet\r\n        \tname: 'Tom'\r\n      \t},\r\n        persons: [...]\r\n      }\r\n    }\r\n\r\nNow, there is `vm.pet` (Tom) before the template is rendered.\r\n\r\nSo, when the renderer meets `v-if=\"pet = perons.pet\"`, it will happily get it!\r\nAnd then, `vm.pet` will be overwritten and Tom will no longer exist!\r\n\r\n\r\n### Compare `v-for`\r\n\r\n`v-for` naturally contains assignment.\r\n\r\nAlthough not mentioned in the doc, vue actually even \"[support destructuring assignment](https://github.com/vuejs/vue/issues/8780)\". It is a little secret.\r\n\r\nSo, what goes on with `v-for`? Why identifiers in it doesn't lead to warnings?\r\n\r\nThe answer is simple: compiled codes for `v-for` are functions, so that the identifiers are local varibles within the functions.\r\n\r\nThat's why you dont' see `vm.person.name` in the \"If we would manually do the rendering\" code:\r\n\r\n    ((vm.pet = person.pet) ? `${person.name}'s pet's name is ${vm.pet.name}.` : `${person.name} has no pet.`)\r\n\r\nThis inspired me when I was trying to make a solution.\r\n\r\n## What solution?\r\n\r\nSimple.\r\n\r\nYou can see that I added/modified only very few lines below.\r\n\r\nQuick explanation:\r\n\r\n1. In \"parser/index.js\", `assignmentInIfRE` is define.\r\n\r\n2. In `function addIfCondition`, `assignmentInIfRE` is used to find the identifier, and store it as `condition.alias`.\r\n\r\n3. In \"codegen/index.js\", save the original compiled result to `ternaryExp`.\r\n\r\n4. If `condition.alias` exists, add a declaration of the identifier. Then, wrap the codes as an IIFE (Immediately Invoked Function Expression).\r\n\r\nWith IIFE, it works in a way very similar to the optional binding (`if let`) in Swift.\r\n\r\n### BTW, Why `alias`?\r\n\r\nThe parser for `v-for` stores identifiers (i.e. `person`) as `alias` of the node.\r\n\r\nI don't know what uses are of these aliases, but I like the choice of name.\r\n\r\n## Hey, no test yet? How dare you!\r\n\r\nSorry.\r\nI tried to follow the instruction but I failed to do the test.\r\nTwice.\r\n\r\nI run `yarn`, then I got stuck. It shows several \"waiting...\" **forever**.\r\n\r\nI had to stop it manually, and a rerun was no luck either.\r\n\r\nAnyway, I've already made a **working** modified vue.js, in **my Demo 2**.\r\n\r\nSo I guess it is highly likely for my simple solution to run well with this pull request, too.\r\n\r\nBesides, there might be problems that I cannot anticipate.\r\nToday it was the first time I've delved into the source of vue.\r\n\r\nReal experts may be needed for polishing this feature.\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n## PULL REQUEST TEMPLATE\r\n<!--\r\nPlease make sure to read the Pull Request Guidelines:\r\nhttps://github.com/vuejs/vue/blob/dev/.github/CONTRIBUTING.md#pull-request-guidelines\r\n-->\r\n\r\n<!-- PULL REQUEST TEMPLATE -->\r\n<!-- (Update \"[ ]\" to \"[x]\" to check a box) -->\r\n\r\n**What kind of change does this PR introduce?** (check at least one)\r\n\r\n- [ ] Bugfix\r\n- [x] Feature\r\n- [ ] Code style update\r\n- [ ] Refactor\r\n- [ ] Build-related changes\r\n- [ ] Other, please describe:\r\n\r\n**Does this PR introduce a breaking change?** (check one)\r\n\r\n- [ ] Yes\r\n- [x] No\r\n\r\nIf yes, please describe the impact and migration path for existing applications:\r\n\r\n**The PR fulfills these requirements:**\r\n\r\n- [x] It's submitted to the `dev` branch for v2.x (or to a previous version branch), _not_ the `master` branch\r\n- [x] When resolving a specific issue, it's referenced in the PR's title (e.g. `fix #xxx[,#xxx]`, where \"xxx\" is the issue number)\r\n- [ ] All tests are passing: https://github.com/vuejs/vue/blob/dev/.github/CONTRIBUTING.md#development-setup\r\n- [x] New/updated tests are included\r\n\r\nIf adding a **new feature**, the PR's description includes:\r\n- [x] A convincing reason for adding this feature (to avoid wasting your time, it's best to open a suggestion issue first and wait for approval before working on it)\r\n\r\n**Other information:**\r\n","Url":"https://github.com/vuejs/vue/pull/10193","RelatedDescription":"Closed or merged PR \"fix #10184: Recognize assigment in v-if and do not throw warning\" (#10193)"},{"Id":"460895810","IsPullRequest":false,"CreatedAt":"2019-06-26T12:20:37","Actor":"mavajee","Number":"10201","RawContent":null,"Title":"New slot syntax not working with \"is\"","State":"closed","Body":"### Version\r\n2.6.10\r\n\r\n### Reproduction link\r\n[https://codesandbox.io/s/vue-template-7x6nl](https://codesandbox.io/s/vue-template-7x6nl)\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n### Steps to reproduce\r\nUse `v-slot` directive with \"is\" attribute\r\n\r\n### What is expected?\r\nsimilar behavior with the old syntax of slots\r\n\r\n\r\n### What is actually happening?\r\nscoped slot not working with dynamic component\r\n\r\n<!-- generated by vue-issues.

(a line chart of last 5 trainings) ...\r\n                .no-records(else) No records yet.\r\n\r\nYou can see `training-records-by-trainee[trainee.id]` is used many times and the codes are terribly **long and messy**.\r\n\r\nThis example is a bit extreme, but you can get the idea.\r\n\r\nThe good news is: we can assign a **local variale** in **v-if**!\r\n\r\n    ...\r\n                .training-records-details(v-if=\"record-data = training-records-by-trainee[trainee.id]\")\r\n                    .count Count: {{record-data.count}}\r\n                    .last-date Last trained on {{record-data.recent-records[record-data.recent-records.length - 1].date}}\r\n                    .recent-records\r\n                        .record(for=\"record in record-data.recent-records\")\r\n                            ... (a line chart of last 5 trainings) ...\r\n\r\nThis makes life much easier.\r\n\r\n### Alternatives?\r\n\r\nYes, I know, we can always use a component to handle `record-data`.\r\n\r\nBut that would be **overkill**, unless the component can be reused.\r\n\r\nAnother way to ease the pain would be baking data beforehand.\r\n\r\nFor example,\r\n\r\n        data: function(){\r\n            trainees.forEach((trainee)=>{\r\n                trainee.record-data = training-records-by-trainee[trainee.id]\r\n            });\r\n            return {\r\n                trainees\r\n            };\r\n\r\nThen we can write `trainee.record-data`.\r\n\r\nNeeter than `training-records-by-trainee[trainee.id]`, but not as neet as \"optional binding\".\r\n\r\n### So, what's the problem?\r\n\r\nThis \"optional binding\" already works well and is as helpful just as in Swift.\r\n\r\nThen, here's the bad news: it invites such a warning (actually, a red error):\r\n\r\n    [Vue warn]: Property or method \"record-data\" is not defined on the instance but referenced during render.\r\n\r\nThis is an eyesore.\r\n\r\n\r\n## What does the proposed API look like?\r\n\r\nJust make vue **recognize** optional binding and thus **do not** warn about the local variable, which **IS** \"defined on the instance\".\r\n\r\n\r\n### Possible controversy\r\n\r\nSome people may dislike the idea of \"allowing\" or even \"encouraging\" assignment in `if` condition.\r\n\r\nAn example is issue #7631: \"warn when assignment in v-if in development mode\"\r\n\r\nAs @posva said, \"this is a js common pitfall for beginners\" to mistakenly write \"=\" when they actually want \"==\".\r\n\r\nAnd they usually would lean the lesson in hard way, having paid much for such mistakes.\r\n\r\nI was one of them, of course. So I know how natural it is to have a reflexive aversion to \"optional binding\" when learning Swift.\r\n\r\nBut after a while, I realized we should not object to a very good thing only because of some other mistake, which is not its fault.\r\n\r\nIn pure js, even today, you can still make such a mistake like `if(a = b){console.log(a);}`, and you get a global `window.a` as an unexpected result.\r\n\r\nI hope someday \"strict mode\" will forbid this noxious pitfall and optional binding will be introduced into JavaScript, just like **\"for let\" which already is in ES5**.\r\n\r\nAnyway, in vue, there is **no worry** about mistakenly creating a global variale via assignment in v-if.\r\n\r\nNo matter why, vue has the feature \"optional binding\" **already**, partially but effectively!\r\n\r\nIt is just unknown to the public. It is a hidden gem.\r\n\r\nAnd that warning makes developers feel uneasy, although it is not a result of intention of guarding \"=\" in \"v-if\" at all.\r\n\r\n<!-- generated by vue-issues.

For example:\r\n\r\n```html\r\n<router-link to=\"/documents\">Documents</router-link>\r\n```\r\nand\r\n```ts\r\nthis.$router.push(\"/documents\");\r\n```\r\n\r\nInline constants like these are subject to rot over time, human error when refactoring multiple documents and other similar errors. As an application grows in size, these issues become more prominent.\r\n\r\n### What does the proposed API look like?\r\nAs a solution, our shop often uses a mapping from route name to a route definition. Sample implementation:\r\n\r\n```ts\r\ninterface IRouteMap {\r\n  [key: string]: ReturnType<Router['resolve']> & { name: string };\r\n}\r\n\r\nfunction mapRoutes(routeMap: IRouteMap, routes: RouteConfig[] = []) {\r\n  return routes.reduce((map, route) => {\r\n    const name = route.name;\r\n    if (name) {\r\n      map[name] = Object.assign({\r\n        name,\r\n      }, router.resolve(name));\r\n    }\r\n    if (route.children) {\r\n      mapRoutes(map, route.children);\r\n    }\r\n    return map;\r\n  }, routeMap);\r\n}\r\n\r\nexport const routeMap = mapRoutes({}, routes);\r\n```\r\n\r\nLinks and navigation can then simply use the resulting mapping:\r\n\r\n```html\r\n<router-link v-bind:to=\"routeMap.documents.location\">Documents</router-link>\r\n```\r\nand\r\n```ts\r\nthis.$router.push(routeMap.documents.location);\r\n```\r\nor\r\n```ts\r\nrouter.beforeEach((to, from, next) => {\r\n  if (to.name !== routeMap.login.name && !store.state.user) ...\r\n});\r\n```\r\n\r\nThis means that changing a route's path requires a single change in the route definition itself and no further refactoring is necessary. Route names are internal and aren't subject to change over time as route paths often can be.\r\n\r\nAdding a similar mapping (or exposing existing internals) to vue-router's public API would provide a standardized solution to the given problem and allow all vue-router consumers to reap the benefits.\r\n\r\n<!-- generated by vue-issues.
