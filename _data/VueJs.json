Colloquially, DOM API becomes strongly typed.\r\n\r\nFor example, with Trusted Types Element.innerHTML property setter accepts a TrustedHTML object.\r\n\r\nTrusted Type objects stringify to their inner value. This API shape is a deliberate choice that enables existing web applications and libraries to gradually migrate from strings to Trusted Types without breaking functionality. In our example, it makes it possible to write the following:\r\n\r\n```javascript\r\nconst policy = TrustedTypes.createPolicy('foo', { \r\n  createHTML: (s) => { /* some validation*/; return s} \r\n});\r\n\r\nconst trustedHTML = policy.createHTML('bar');\r\nanElement.innerHTML = trustedHTML\r\n\r\nanElement.innerHTML === 'bar'\r\n```\r\n\r\nThe above code works regardless if the Trusted Types enforcement is enabled or not.\r\n\r\nReading from the DOM is unaffected, so Element.innerHTML getter returns a string. That's for practical reasons -- web applications read from DOM more often than they write to it, and only writing exposes the application to DOM XSS risks. Typing only the setters allows us to secure web applications with minimal code changes.\r\n\r\n### Integrating Trusted Types to Vue\r\nThe integration is fairly simple as there are not many places which break when using Vue with Trusted Types. There one place though, which I am not sure if it's even called (couldn't trigger it myself). It's marked in a code with `TT_TODO: ...` comment. I hope someone can clarify this for me. **The PR doesn't introduce any breaking changes**. All of the code is applied only when the trustedTypes API is available in the global object.\r\n\r\n**What kind of change does this PR introduce?** (check at least one)\r\n\r\n- [ ] Bugfix\r\n- [x] Feature\r\n- [ ] Code style update\r\n- [ ] Refactor\r\n- [ ] Build-related changes\r\n- [ ] Other, please describe:\r\n\r\n**Does this PR introduce a breaking change?** (check one)\r\n\r\n- [ ] Yes\r\n- [x] No\r\n\r\nIf yes, please describe the impact and migration path for existing applications:\r\n\r\n**The PR fulfills these requirements:**\r\n\r\n- [x] It's submitted to the `dev` branch for v2.x (or to a previous version branch), _not_ the `master` branch\r\n- [x] When resolving a specific issue, it's referenced in the PR's title (e.g. `fix #xxx[,#xxx]`, where \"xxx\" is the issue number)\r\n- [x] All tests are passing: https://github.com/vuejs/vue/blob/dev/.github/CONTRIBUTING.md#development-setup\r\n- [x] New/updated tests are included\r\n\r\nIf adding a **new feature**, the PR's description includes:\r\n- [x] A convincing reason for adding this feature (to avoid wasting your time, it's best to open a suggestion issue first and wait for approval before working on it)\r\n\r\n**Other information:**\r\nThe PR adds support for Trusted Types only on client side, but it might be beneficial to use them also on server side. There is no DOM on server side, however we can check if the values are trusted before creating markup with dangerous attributes. This also makes the applications render the same thing on the server and on client. There is already a similar [PR for this for React](https://github.com/facebook/react/pull/16555).\r\n\r\nIf you would like to try this change there is a [really simple application](https://github.com/Siegrift/vue-example-app) with the instructions how to setup vue locally in which you can play with Trusted Types. Vue cli uses webpack for development which provides features like hot-reloading. This currently breaks, but the [PR is already fired and we are waiting for review](https://github.com/webpack/webpack/pull/9426).","Url":"https://github.com/vuejs/vue/pull/10491","RelatedDescription":"Open PR \"feat(web): Integrate trusted types into Vue\" (#10491)"},{"Id":"490325379","IsPullRequest":false,"CreatedAt":"2019-09-06T13:27:30","Actor":"592192890","Number":"10490","RawContent":null,"Title":"input event has a bug in IE","State":"closed","Body":"### Version\r\n2.6.10\r\n\r\n### Reproduction link\r\n[https://jsfiddle.net/zhoulu_hp/x2ab4cug/1/](https://jsfiddle.net/zhoulu_hp/x2ab4cug/1/)\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n### Steps to reproduce\r\n1.

data like:\r\n    data:{ arr : [1] }\r\n2. binding arr[0] to template: <div>{{ arr[0] }}</div>\r\n3. change arr with index: arr[0] = 2\r\n\r\n\r\n### What is expected?\r\nwe should get <div>2</div>\r\n\r\n### What is actually happening?\r\nnow we get <div>1</div>,the arr[0] is not responsive\r\n\r\n---\r\nIn my opinion, we can regard arr as an plain object to make arr[0] = 2 responsive. \r\n\r\nIn fact,we know that Object.keys(arr) => [\"0\"], and it means that arr is an object with a property \"0\".so if we execute this.walk(arr),arr[0]will be a responsive property now.In this case, we don't need function observeArray.We can make a change in constructor of Observer like this:\r\n\r\nsrc/core/observer/index.js\r\n\r\nif (Array.isArray(value)) {\r\n\r\n      if (hasProto) {\r\n\r\n        protoAugment(value, arrayMethods)\r\n\r\n      } else {\r\n\r\n        copyAugment(value, arrayMethods, arrayKeys)\r\n\r\n      }\r\n\r\n      this.observeArray(value)\r\n\r\n    } else {\r\n\r\n      this.walk(value)\r\n\r\n    }\r\n\r\nmake a change:\r\n\r\nif (Array.isArray(value)) {\r\n\r\n      if (hasProto) {\r\n\r\n        protoAugment(value, arrayMethods)\r\n\r\n      } else {\r\n\r\n        copyAugment(value, arrayMethods, arrayKeys)\r\n\r\n      }\r\n\r\n}\r\n\r\nthis.walk(value)\r\n\r\nIn this time,we regard arr = [1] as arr = { \"0\": 1 }.So, we don't need observeArray in the constructor of Observer and make all initial items of arr responsive.But if arr[0] doesn't exist initially, it is not responsive because it's a new property for arr.\r\n\r\n<!-- generated by vue-issues.

But I've traced the issue to `tokensToFunction` from `path-to-regexp`. The issue seems to have been fixed in v3.1.0 due to [this pr](https://github.com/pillarjs/path-to-regexp/pull/191). You can check eg [`dist/vue-router.esm.js`](https://github.com/vuejs/vue-router/blob/dev/dist/vue-router.esm.js#L619) to see the RegExp does not set the `i` modifier\r\n\r\nThat makes this report more or less a fyi / request to upgrade `path-to-regexp` 😃 \r\n\r\nLocally the error is caused by a route similar to\r\n```\r\n  routes: [{\r\n      path: \"/:locale(en|pt-br)?/:source(.*)?\",\r\n      component: myComponent,\r\n    }],\r\n```\r\n\r\nwhich fails when you browse to e.g. `/pt-BR/path`:\r\n\r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/1067403/64534777-5af11100-d316-11e9-9225-f34616eee0fe.png)\r\n\r\n### What is expected?\r\nThat the token / param is matched case-insensitively\r\n\r\n### What is actually happening?\r\nIt doesnt, causing a missing param error\r\n\r\n<!-- generated by vue-issues.

This means that currently a Nuxt.js app will include two copies of that function, one from vue-router and one from Nuxt.js itself which increases the bundle size needlessly.\r\n\r\nAnother solution for the above could be that `vue-router` would expose the path-to-regexp methods like `tokensToFunction` method so Nuxt.js can use those, but using dependencies has more benefits ofc like quicker delivery of patches for `path-to-regexp`.\r\n\r\n### What does the proposed API look like?\r\nRevert: 76d83b6eb4af507763c5ee6f61a52ed9a7804572\r\n\r\n<!-- generated by vue-issues.

When that expectation failed I opened the developer console and expected an error or a warning.\r\n\r\n### What is actually happening?\r\nThe parent has no component so nothing renders in the router view, which terminates rendering before the child component can be rendered. The router-view does not produce a console error or warning when it has been included in the template even though it has not been provided a component to render by the router.\r\n\r\n---\r\nThis issue has a lot of overlap with #2105, but this issue is focused on the developer experience rather than adding functionality to support the desired syntax. There are reasonable workarounds proposed in #2105, but they don't address the fact that developers who fall into this pattern have to spend time and effort debugging this undefined behavior due to the lack of feedback from the library. This deviates from the expectations established by the useful console warnings provided when using named routes incorrectly.\r\n\r\nSome solutions to this problem that were not explored in #2105 include:\r\n\r\n- Warning about router views with no component in the console\r\n- Adding more explicit requirements to the documentation. All router views must specify a component containing a router view to propagate rendering to child route components\r\n\r\n<!-- generated by vue-issues.

The breaking change is the use of `Promise` in the `VueRouter.prototype.push` callback. The problem might be located in the file [`vue-router@3.1.2 history/base.js#87`](https://github.com/vuejs/vue-router/blob/v3.1.2/src/history/base.js#L87):\r\n\r\n```\r\nif (onAbort) {\r\n  onAbort(err)\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nHere, `onAbort` is equal to the `reject` function of the Promise. `err` can be equal to many things depending on what is being passed to `next()`, but there's no way that I know of to catch the error thrown.\r\n\r\nDowngrading to version 3.0.7 solves the issue.\r\n\r\n<!-- generated by vue-issues.

We now need to traverse all around the app to find out.\r\n\r\nIf the payload was instead passed by value then updating the value would not actually do anything. All mutation functions would need to update the state object. This would make vuex stores more explicit and understandable as well as ensure there is a clear boundary between it and the app. \r\n\r\nThe second is that Vuex plugins cannot log the mutations to a server and replay them back later. Here is a pseudocode example:\r\n\r\n```javascript\r\n// replaying back mutation logs\r\nlet logs = await getLogsFromServer();\r\nfor (log in logs) {\r\n  // any editTodo mutations passed in below will not work\r\n  // as the mutation will update the \"log\" object instead of \r\n  // the actual todo in the state object\r\n  this.store.commit(log.type, log.payload);\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nI'm working on a plugin that does this (similar to [redux-vcr](https://github.com/joshwcomeau/redux-vcr)) and it would be great if there was a systematic guarantee that it would work with all Vuex stores. \r\n\r\n### What does the proposed API look like?\r\nExample - No changes needed\r\n```javascript\r\nmutations: {\r\n  // current: n is passed by reference\r\n  increment (state, n) { \r\n    state.count  = n\r\n  }\r\n}\r\n\r\nmutations: {\r\n  // proposed: n is passed by value\r\n  increment (state, n) { \r\n    state.count  = n\r\n  }\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nExample B - editTodo\r\n\r\n```javascript\r\nmutations: {\r\n  // current - can update payload\r\n  editTodo (state, { todo, text = todo.text, done = todo.done }) {\r\n    todo.text = text\r\n    todo.done = done\r\n  }\r\n}\r\n\r\nmutations: {\r\n  // proposed - with pass by value we \r\n  // must update the state object\r\n  editTodo (state, todo) {\r\n     const index = state.todos.findIndex(t => t.id === todo.id);\r\n     state.todos[index] = todo;\r\n  }\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\n<!-- generated by vue-issues.
