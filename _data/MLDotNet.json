This creates correct trainer with only 2 features, but prediction engine still requires to specify original input model and uses all 10+ features, even though all features except selected 2 were set to 0.  \r\n\r\n### What did you do?\r\n- use input model with 10 features / properties\r\n- create data view and select only 2 of these features \r\n- use LGBM as a trainer \r\n- create 3 input items with labels - Strategy1, Strategy2, Strategy3 and train estimator \r\n- try to make prediction providing test item identical to Strategy3\r\n\r\n### What happened?\r\n- output schema in CreatePredictionEngine shows that there are 10+ columns, even though, when I created a data view for training, I selected only 2 features\r\n- result of prediction is always the same - Strategy1, most probably because trainer always compares 10+ features instead of 2, even though all features except selected 2 were set to 0 \r\n\r\n### What did you expect?\r\n- if estimator was trained to use only 2 features / input properties, then prediction engine should use provided data view schema and should also work only with 2 selected properties\r\n- in the code below I'd like to make sure that properties Contrast, Param1 ...
