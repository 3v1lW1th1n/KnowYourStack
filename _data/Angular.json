If any results\r\nfor a particular query were nested inside embedded views (e.g.\r\n*ngIfs), that query would be resolved after change detection ran.\r\nOtherwise, the query would be resolved as soon as nodes were created.\r\n\r\nThis inconsistency in resolution timing had the potential to cause\r\nconfusion because query results would sometimes be available in\r\nngOnInit, but sometimes wouldn't be available until ngAfterContentInit\r\nor ngAfterViewInit. Code depending on a query result could suddenly\r\nstop working as soon as an *ngIf or an *ngFor was added to the template.\r\n\r\nWith this commit, users can dictate when they want a particular\r\n`ViewChild` or `ContentChild` query to be resolved with the `static` flag.\r\nFor example, one can mark a particular query as `static: false` to\r\nensure change detection always runs before its results are set:\r\n\r\n```ts\r\n@ContentChild('foo', {static: false}) foo !: ElementRef;\r\n```\r\n\r\nThis means that even if there isn't a query result wrapped in an\r\n*ngIf or an *ngFor now, adding one to the template later won't change\r\nthe timing of the query resolution and potentially break your component.\r\n\r\nSimilarly, if you know that your query needs to be resolved earlier\r\n(e.g. you need results in an ngOnInit hook), you can mark it as\r\n`static: true`.\r\n\r\n```ts\r\n@ViewChild(TemplateRef, {static: true}) foo !: TemplateRef;\r\n```\r\n\r\nNote: this means that your component will not support *ngIf results.\r\n\r\nIf you do not supply a `static` option when creating your `ViewChild` or\r\n`ContentChild` query, the default query resolution timing will kick in.\r\n\r\nNote: This new option only applies to `ViewChild` and `ContentChild` queries,\r\nnot `ViewChildren` or `ContentChildren` queries, as those types already\r\nresolve after CD runs.","Url":"https://github.com/angular/angular/pull/28810","RelatedDescription":"Open PR \"feat(core): allow users to define timing of ViewChild/ContentChild queries\" (#28810)"},{"Id":"411679468","IsPullRequest":false,"CreatedAt":"2019-02-18T23:10:33","Actor":"joeldenning","Number":"28809","RawContent":null,"Title":"Integration with single-spa","State":"open","Body":"# üöÄ feature request\r\n\r\nHi there üëã.

We now have an ecosystem of people who are using single-spa and angular together. However, I'm having trouble getting things working with angular 7 and with angular-cli, since angular is used to owning the whole html file and (afaik) does not have a way to lazy load an entire application.\r\n\r\nI'd love to collaborate with your team on options available for this -- so far I've explored ngx-build-plus and a variety of other things and have created a list of my open questions at https://github.com/CanopyTax/single-spa-angular/issues/14.\r\n\r\nIs there anybody on the Angular team who'd like to work with me on this?

This was an unneeded breaking change.\r\n\r\nIssue Number: #28427\r\n\r\n\r\n## What is the new behavior?\r\nThis commit partially restores the old sanitizer behavior (namely traversing content of unsafe elements), but introduces a list of elements whose content should not be traversed if the elements themselves are considered unsafe.

It should resolve after the first value is emitted.\r\n\r\nAssuming I use this `CacheInterceptor`...:\r\n\r\n```typescript\r\nexport class CacheInterceptor implements HttpInterceptor {\r\n    intercept(req: HttpRequest<any>, next: HttpHandler) {\r\n        if (req.method !== 'GET') {\r\n            return next.handle(req);\r\n        }\r\n\r\n        const cachedResponse = cache.get(req);\r\n        const results$ = sendRequest(req, next);\r\n        return cachedResponse ? results$.pipe(startWith(cachedResponse)) : results$;\r\n    }\r\n}\r\n\r\nfunction sendRequest(req: HttpRequest<any>, next: HttpHandler): Observable<HttpEvent<any>> {\r\n    return next.handle(req).pipe(\r\n        tap(event => {\r\n            if (event instanceof HttpResponse) {\r\n                cache.put(req, event);\r\n            }\r\n        })\r\n    );\r\n}\r\n\r\nexport class HttpCache {\r\n    cache: Map<string, HttpResponse<any>>;\r\n\r\n    constructor() {\r\n        this.cache = new Map();\r\n    }\r\n\r\n    get(req: HttpRequest<any>): HttpResponse<any> | undefined {\r\n        return this.cache.get(req.urlWithParams);\r\n    }\r\n\r\n    put(req: HttpRequest<any>, response: HttpResponse<any>): void {\r\n        this.cache.set(req.urlWithParams, response);\r\n    }\r\n}\r\n\r\nconst cache: HttpCache = new HttpCache();\r\n```\r\n\r\nI can then make HTTP requests using the following `DataService`:\r\n\r\n```typescript\r\n@Injectable()\r\nexport class DataService {\r\n    constructor(private http: HttpClient) {}\r\n\r\n    getData(): Observable<string> {\r\n        return this.http.get<string>(url).pipe(delay(2000));\r\n    }\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nAs such, if I make 3 HTTP requests from a component, like this...:\r\n\r\n```typescript\r\n@Component({...})\r\nexport class DataComponent {\r\n    constructor(private dataService: DataService) {}\r\n\r\n    ngOnInit() {\r\n        return this.dataService.getData().subscribe(\r\n            (data: string) => console.log(data);\r\n        );\r\n    }\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nThen, the following should (and does) occur:\r\n\r\n1. The first request will take at least 2 seconds, since there is a delay of 2 seconds in the service method. \r\n2. The 2nd call will be instant since it comes from the cache. \r\n3. The 3rd call will also take at least 3 seconds since it is being called again from the service.\r\n\r\nNow, if I add a resolver to the route that loads the component, like this...:\r\n\r\n```typescript\r\n@Injectable()\r\nexport class DataResolver implements Resolve<string> {\r\n    constructor(private dataService: DataService) {}\r\n\r\n    resolve(route: ActivatedRouteSnapshot, state: RouterStateSnapshot): Observable<string> {\r\n        return this.dataService.getData();\r\n    }\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nThen, in my component I should be able to subscribe to the route data, and experience _**_the same_**_ functionality as in the first example...right?:\r\n\r\n```typescript\r\n@Component({...})\r\nexport class DataComponent {\r\n    constructor(private route: ActivatedRoute) {}\r\n\r\n    ngOnInit() {\r\n        return this.route.data.subscribe(\r\n            (data: any) => console.log(data);\r\n        );\r\n    }\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nNope. This doesn't work the same way as the first example. In the component here, the cached result is not immediately available. No data is streamed to the component until the entire observable stream has completed. So the cache is essentially ignored here, because the resolver waits for the entire observable to complete.\r\n\r\nMy HTTP interceptor unit tests on the `CacheInterceptor` seem to fail for the same reason as they do in the resolver. Seems the testing HTTP controller waits for the observable to complete as well.\r\n\r\nHope that makes sense. If this is not a bug, please advise on a way to remedy this issue. I need to use a resolver and I need the RxJS `startWith` to work the same way on a resolver as it does for without a resolver. Adding in this functionality shouldn't have an effect on anything else, cause the \"first value\" also acts as a \"completion\" in RxJS terms, so for routes that don't emit multiple times this shouldn't break backwards compatibility at all.

Not many business owners want to use TypeScript in their projects. For that reason, AngularJS 1.x is still more popular than Angular 2+ w/ Typescript. The majority of companies, I say over 90%, will still choose ES6+ over typescript. \r\n\r\n### Describe the solution you'd like\r\n\r\nWe need ES6+ option in Angular. Please let developers choose between ES6+ and Typescript when starting an Angular project. This is a very urgent update we need in Angular 8. Even if you guys create Angular 10, without ES6+ support, Angular still won't become more popular than AngularJS 1.x. That's completely abnormal. Current job market for Angular 2+ is horrible. It doesn't seem to be profitable at all. \r\n\r\n### Describe alternatives you've considered\r\n\r\nI've been developing with React. It's been more stable experience because it's based on JS and more business owners want React now. However, I would still like to see Angular with ES6+ support.  In my opinion, TypeScript is destroying Angular.\r\nLook, now we have Angular 7. But there are still more companies which prefer to use AngularJS 1.x. \r\nThis is not very funny. Pushing typescript to Angular was apparently corporation's choice, not community's.  \r\n\r\nTypeScript is an advanced language but it's not endorsed by the majority of businesses out there. I don't understand why Google want all Angular developers to use typescript?\r\nPlease admit Angular with TypeScript is a big failure.. it will never beat AngularJS 1.x and React. Honestly, I feel the whole Angular community is isolated due to TypeScript. Why do we need this when ES6+ can solve any problem and there are more job positions for it? \r\n\r\nI'm sure the developer community will welcome ES6+ based Angular 8.\r\nThis typescript nonsense should stop here. We need normal/compatible Angular back to community. \r\n\r\n","Url":"https://github.com/angular/angular/issues/28793","RelatedDescription":"Open issue \"Roll back to ES6+.

Yet, this setting has no effect without the extension that provides that configuration option namely [xaver.clang-format][1]).\r\n    For people that didn't have the extension installed, VSCode would use the default formatters, resulting in vastly different file fomatting.\r\n\r\n    This commit adds a set of [rcommended workspace extensions][2], to help people get the right extensions when checking out the repository.\r\n\r\n    The recommended extensions are:\r\n    - [gkalpak.aio-docs-utils][3]: Utilities to aid in authoring/viewing Angular documentation source code. Currently, mainly aid in working with\r\n  `{@example}`/`<code-example>` tags.\r\n    - [ms-vscode.vscode-typescript-tslint-plugin][4]: Add auto-linting for TS files using `tslint` while editing.\r\n    - [xaver.clang-format][1]: Add auto-formatting for JS/TS files using `clang-format`.\r\n\r\n\r\n## Does this PR introduce a breaking change?\r\n\r\n- [ ] Yes\r\n- [x] No\r\n\r\n[1]: https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=xaver.clang-format\r\n[2]: http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkId=827846\r\n[3]: https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=gkalpak.aio-docs-utils\r\n[4]: https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ms-vscode.vscode-typescript-tslint-plugin\r\n","Url":"https://github.com/angular/angular/pull/28784","RelatedDescription":"Open PR \"build: improve VSCode settings for workspace\" (#28784)"}],"ResultType":"GitHubIssue"},"AngularCli-Issues":{"Issues":[{"Id":"411634099","IsPullRequest":false,"CreatedAt":"2019-02-19T05:24:49","Actor":"pavll05","Number":"13701","RawContent":null,"Title":"\"ng update --all\" typescript error!","State":"closed","Body":"If i run \"npm install\" in the angular project, i got following error: \r\n<pre>npm WARN @angular/compiler-cli@7.2.5 requires a peer of @angular/compiler@7.2.5 but none is installed.

One of the features of this library is watching and reporting route changes.  There is a configuration option to clean up `id` references in routes, documentation is [here](https://github.com/angulartics/angulartics2#remove-ids-from-url-paths).\r\n\r\nMy configuration for this module is as follows:\r\n```ts\r\n    Angulartics2Module.forRoot({\r\n      pageTracking: {\r\n        clearIds: true,\r\n        idsRegExp: /^[a-zA-Z]+-[0-9a-zA-Z_-]{22}$/\r\n      }\r\n    })\r\n```\r\n\r\nWhen building for production (`ng build --prod`) and using a RegExp (non-constructor variant), it gives me this exception.\r\n\r\n```\r\nDate: 2019-02-18T20:42:19.190Z\r\nHash: f87abc34a327d3cd4386\r\nTime: 5030ms\r\nchunk {0} runtime.a5dd35324ddfd942bef1.js (runtime) 1.41 kB [entry] [rendered]\r\nchunk {1} es2015-polyfills.67c5cff8371af1f9a1d4.js (es2015-polyfills) 56.4 kB [initial] [rendered]\r\nchunk {2} main.cde404c57fbcc43faae1.js (main) 128 bytes [initial] [rendered]\r\nchunk {3} polyfills.70c2c870c3a0f5c90635.js (polyfills) 130 bytes [initial] [rendered]\r\nchunk {4} styles.3ff695c00d717f2d2a11.css (styles) 0 bytes [initial] [rendered]\r\n\r\nERROR in app/app.module.ts(18,20): Error during template compile of 'AppModule'\r\n  Expression form not supported.\r\n```\r\n\r\nAlternatively, when using the constructor format, \r\n```ts\r\n    Angulartics2Module.forRoot({\r\n      pageTracking: {\r\n        clearIds: true,\r\n        idsRegExp: new RegExp('^[a-zA-Z]+-[0-9a-zA-Z_-]{22}$')\r\n      }\r\n    })\r\n```\r\n\r\nThe above actually compiles and builds the distribution, but if you look at the distributed JS, it has removed that particular line and the output JS looks like:\r\n```js\r\nr.qb(256,H,{settings:{pageTracking:{clearIds:!0}}}\r\n```\r\n\r\n\r\n## üî¨ Minimal Reproduction\r\n<!--\r\nSimple steps to reproduce this bug.\r\n\r\nPlease include: commands run (including args), packages added, related code changes.\r\n\r\nIf reproduction steps are not enough for reproduction of your issue, please create a minimal GitHub repository with the reproduction of the issue.

The previous behavior of the Angular CLI prevented this from occuring and resulted in an inability to reference stylesheet assets in this manner.  The initial reason for this behavior is no longer present in the internal implementation of the Angular CLI.  Therefore, this now unnecessary and non-standard behavior is being phased out.  If an application currently relies on this behavior, a compatibility option `rebaseRootRelativeCssUrls` has been provided for the 8.x release cycle to facilitate transition away from this non-standard and limiting behavior.  The recommended method to transition is to use relative paths within the source stylesheet.  This allows the build system to process and generate a full URL for the asset.\r\n\r\nThe compatibility option will only be needed for projects that used root relative URLs within stylesheets and also used either a custom HTML base HREF and/or deploy URL option.\r\nThis option is a new option for the `build` target of an application (using the default `@angular-devkit/build-angular:browser` builder).  For example:\r\n```\r\n\"build\": {\r\n    \"builder\": \"@angular-devkit/build-angular:browser\",\r\n    \"options\": {\r\n        ...\r\n        \"rebaseRootRelativeCssUrls\": true,\r\n        ...\r\n    },\r\n    ...\r\n}\r\n```\r\n","Url":"https://github.com/angular/angular-cli/pull/13684","RelatedDescription":"Open PR \"fix(@angular-devkit/build-angular): disable by default stylesheet root relative URL rebasing\" (#13684)"},{"Id":"410728068","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2019-02-15T16:01:42","Actor":"clydin","Number":"13682","RawContent":null,"Title":" feat(@angular-devkit/core): support console logger color customization","State":"closed","Body":"","Url":"https://github.com/angular/angular-cli/pull/13682","RelatedDescription":"Closed or merged PR \" feat(@angular-devkit/core): support console logger color customization\" (#13682)"},{"Id":"410445727","IsPullRequest":false,"CreatedAt":"2019-02-15T12:36:10","Actor":"pedromcunha","Number":"13677","RawContent":null,"Title":"CORS issue while using Angular proxy to proxy an API with response-type application/vnd.apple.mpegurl","State":"closed","Body":"<!--üîÖüîÖüîÖüîÖüîÖüîÖüîÖüîÖüîÖüîÖüîÖüîÖüîÖüîÖüîÖüîÖüîÖüîÖüîÖüîÖüîÖüîÖüîÖüîÖüîÖüîÖüîÖüîÖüîÖüîÖüîÖ\r\n\r\nOh hi there! üòÑ\r\n\r\nTo expedite issue processing please search open and closed issues before submitting a new one.\r\nExisting issues often contain information about workarounds, resolution, or progress updates.\r\n\r\nüîÖüîÖüîÖüîÖüîÖüîÖüîÖüîÖüîÖüîÖüîÖüîÖüîÖüîÖüîÖüîÖüîÖüîÖüîÖüîÖüîÖüîÖüîÖüîÖüîÖüîÖüîÖüîÖüîÖüîÖüîÖüîÖüîÖ-->\r\n\r\n\r\n# üêû Bug report\r\n\r\n### Command (mark with an `x`)\r\n<!-- Can you pin-point the command or commands that are effected by this bug? -->\r\n<!-- ‚úçÔ∏èedit: -->\r\n```\r\n- [ ] new\r\n- [ ] build\r\n- [ x ] serve\r\n- [ ] test\r\n- [ ] e2e\r\n- [ ] generate\r\n- [ ] add\r\n- [ ] update\r\n- [ ] lint\r\n- [ ] xi18n\r\n- [ ] run\r\n- [ ] config\r\n- [ ] help\r\n- [ ] version\r\n- [ ] doc\r\n```\r\n\r\n### Description\r\n\r\n<!-- ‚úçÔ∏è--> A clear and concise description of the problem...\r\nI'm trying to proxy a request to my backend which has a response-type of **application/vnd.apple.mpegurl**.
