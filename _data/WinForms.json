We can't, however, use classes that implement from different assemblies. If we wanted to use Control in interop calls in assemblies other than System.Windows.Forms we'd have to make this an actual shared interface. The only practical way to do that is to introduce a higher level shared assembly that contains it. While SWF is effectively top-level, making internals visible would be less than ideal.\r\n\r\nUltimately we may want to create an Interop assembly that all of our other assemblies can rely on. It would make this really reusable, reduce code duplication, and generally make maintenance a bit easier.\r\n\r\nrelated to https://github.com/dotnet/winforms/pull/2221#issuecomment-551417744\n\n###### Microsoft Reviewers: [Open in CodeFlow](http://wpcp.azurewebsites.net/CodeFlowProtocolProxy2.php?pullrequest=https://github.com/dotnet/winforms/pull/2348)","Url":"https://github.com/dotnet/winforms/pull/2348","RelatedDescription":"Closed or merged PR \"Move IHandle to Interop.\" (#2348)"},{"Id":"521218413","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2019-11-11T22:18:13","Actor":"JuditRose","Number":"2347","RawContent":null,"Title":"Port DataGridViewCellStyleEditor","State":"open","Body":"Fixes #2336 \r\nContributes to #1115 ","Url":"https://github.com/dotnet/winforms/pull/2347","RelatedDescription":"Open PR \"Port DataGridViewCellStyleEditor\" (#2347)"},{"Id":"521209030","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2019-11-11T21:55:38","Actor":"JuditRose","Number":"2345","RawContent":null,"Title":"Port ColumnHeaderCollectionEditor","State":"open","Body":"Fixes #2334 \r\nContributes to #1115 \r\n\r\n###### Microsoft Reviewers: [Open in CodeFlow](http://wpcp.azurewebsites.net/CodeFlowProtocolProxy2.php?pullrequest=https://github.com/dotnet/winforms/pull/2345)","Url":"https://github.com/dotnet/winforms/pull/2345","RelatedDescription":"Open PR \"Port ColumnHeaderCollectionEditor\" (#2345)"},{"Id":"521161177","IsPullRequest":false,"CreatedAt":"2019-11-11T20:07:26","Actor":"JuditRose","Number":"2344","RawContent":null,"Title":"Port TreeNodeStyleCollectionEditor","State":"open","Body":"Contributes to #1115 ","Url":"https://github.com/dotnet/winforms/issues/2344","RelatedDescription":"Open issue \"Port TreeNodeStyleCollectionEditor\" (#2344)"},{"Id":"521160772","IsPullRequest":false,"CreatedAt":"2019-11-11T20:06:33","Actor":"JuditRose","Number":"2343","RawContent":null,"Title":"Port TreeNodeCollectionEditor","State":"open","Body":"Contributes to #1115 ","Url":"https://github.com/dotnet/winforms/issues/2343","RelatedDescription":"Open issue \"Port TreeNodeCollectionEditor\" (#2343)"},{"Id":"521160460","IsPullRequest":false,"CreatedAt":"2019-11-11T20:05:51","Actor":"JuditRose","Number":"2342","RawContent":null,"Title":"Port ToolStripImageIndexEditor","State":"open","Body":"Contributes to #1115 ","Url":"https://github.com/dotnet/winforms/issues/2342","RelatedDescription":"Open issue \"Port ToolStripImageIndexEditor\" (#2342)"},{"Id":"521160139","IsPullRequest":false,"CreatedAt":"2019-11-11T20:05:07","Actor":"JuditRose","Number":"2341","RawContent":null,"Title":"Port ToolStripCollectionEditor","State":"open","Body":"Contributes to #1115 ","Url":"https://github.com/dotnet/winforms/issues/2341","RelatedDescription":"Open issue \"Port ToolStripCollectionEditor\" (#2341)"},{"Id":"521159733","IsPullRequest":false,"CreatedAt":"2019-11-11T20:04:16","Actor":"JuditRose","Number":"2340","RawContent":null,"Title":"Port StyleCollectionEditor","State":"open","Body":"Contributes to #1115 ","Url":"https://github.com/dotnet/winforms/issues/2340","RelatedDescription":"Open issue \"Port StyleCollectionEditor\" (#2340)"},{"Id":"521159417","IsPullRequest":false,"CreatedAt":"2019-11-11T20:03:33","Actor":"JuditRose","Number":"2339","RawContent":null,"Title":"Port DataMemberFieldEditor","State":"open","Body":"Contributes to #1115 ","Url":"https://github.com/dotnet/winforms/issues/2339","RelatedDescription":"Open issue \"Port DataMemberFieldEditor\" (#2339)"},{"Id":"521159001","IsPullRequest":false,"CreatedAt":"2019-11-11T20:02:39","Actor":"JuditRose","Number":"2338","RawContent":null,"Title":"Port DataMemberListEditor","State":"open","Body":"Contributes to #1115 ","Url":"https://github.com/dotnet/winforms/issues/2338","RelatedDescription":"Open issue \"Port DataMemberListEditor\" (#2338)"},{"Id":"521158498","IsPullRequest":false,"CreatedAt":"2019-11-11T20:01:35","Actor":"JuditRose","Number":"2337","RawContent":null,"Title":"Port DataGridViewColumnDataPropertyNameEditor","State":"open","Body":"Contributes to #1115 ","Url":"https://github.com/dotnet/winforms/issues/2337","RelatedDescription":"Open issue \"Port DataGridViewColumnDataPropertyNameEditor\" (#2337)"},{"Id":"521158011","IsPullRequest":false,"CreatedAt":"2019-11-11T20:00:33","Actor":"JuditRose","Number":"2336","RawContent":null,"Title":"Port DataGridViewCellStyleEditor","State":"open","Body":"Contributes to #1115 ","Url":"https://github.com/dotnet/winforms/issues/2336","RelatedDescription":"Open issue \"Port DataGridViewCellStyleEditor\" (#2336)"}],"ResultType":"GitHubIssue"}},"RunOn":"2019-11-14T05:30:57.696201Z","RunDurationInMilliseconds":835}
