Simplest solution is and additional Option for System.Windows.Forms.ProgressBarStyle (TextOverlay) and possibly any text properties if the developer can set the message. \r\n- What impact will it have on accessibility?If AccessibleDescription already works automatically it would not have an impact. If it requires developer to constantly change it on every increment then this might be where to get the text to display.\r\n- Will this feature need to be localized or be localizable? If the string is \"x of Y\" yes, if it is provided the user will need to deal with that. The text should be centered so Right to Left shouldn't matter.\r\n\r\n","Url":"https://github.com/dotnet/winforms/issues/2760","RelatedDescription":"Open issue \"Discussion/proposal: Add support to ProgressBar to display Text  AND Bars\" (#2760)"},{"Id":"554331820","IsPullRequest":false,"CreatedAt":"2020-01-23T18:35:37","Actor":"hughbe","Number":"2759","RawContent":null,"Title":"MessageDecoder.MsgToString is missing several values defined in `WM_`","State":"open","Body":"Should be a 1-1 mapping.","Url":"https://github.com/dotnet/winforms/issues/2759","RelatedDescription":"Open issue \"MessageDecoder.MsgToString is missing several values defined in `WM_`\" (#2759)"},{"Id":"554272283","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2020-01-23T16:38:04","Actor":"M-Lipin","Number":"2758","RawContent":null,"Title":"Fixing issue 2704: Cannot find the RichEdit control of the \"Text\" property in UIA structure of a PropertyGrid control","State":"open","Body":"Adding PropertyGrid DropDown control holder and its child edit control to the UIA hierarchy of the PropertyGrid.\r\n\r\n<!-- Please read CONTRIBUTING.md before submitting a pull request -->\r\n\r\nFixes #2704 \r\n\r\n\r\n## Proposed changes\r\n\r\n- Adding accessible object for PropertyGrid's DropDownControlHolder;\r\n- Implementing accessible navigation to find DropDownControlHolder pane and its child edit control in UIA hierarchy in PropertyGrid.\r\n- Adding resource to announce DropDownControlHolder pane accessible name to inform users that the currently edited RichEdit control or another edit control is hosted in PropertyGrid's DropDown control holder.\r\n\r\n<!-- We are in TELL-MODE the following section must be completed -->\r\n\r\n## Customer Impact\r\n\r\n- Customers will be able to distinguish the dropped down control from another form controls if using Narrator or another screen reader.\r\n\r\n## Regression? \r\n\r\n- No\r\n\r\n## Risk\r\n\r\n- Minimal\r\n\r\n<!-- end TELL-MODE -->\r\n\r\n\r\n## Screenshots <!-- Remove this section if PR does not change UI -->\r\n\r\n### Before\r\n\r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/23213980/73003863-605b7d80-3e17-11ea-92af-f66d92fec2a1.png)\r\n\r\n### After\r\n\r\n<!-- TODO -->\r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/23213980/73004026-ae708100-3e17-11ea-845d-448e48585d7d.png)\r\n\r\n\r\n## Test methodology <!-- How did you ensure quality? -->\r\n\r\n- Manual testing;\r\n- Unit tests (to be implemented);\r\n- UI tests.\r\n\r\n## Accessibility testing  <!-- Remove this section if PR does not change UI -->\r\n\r\n<!--\r\n     Microsoft prioritizes making our products accessible. \r\n     WinForms has a key role in allowing developers to create accessible apps. \r\n     \r\n     When submitting a change which impacts UI in any way, including adding new UI or\r\n     modifying existing controls the developer needs to run the Accessibility Insights\r\n     tool (https://accessibilityinsights.io/) and verify that there are no changes or\r\n     regressions. \r\n     \r\n     The developer should run the Fast Pass over the impacted control(s) and provide\r\n     a snapshot of the passing results along with before/after snapshots of the UI.\r\n     More info: (https://accessibilityinsights.io/docs/en/web/getstarted/fastpass)\r\n  -->\r\n\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n## Test environment(s) <!-- Remove any that don't apply -->\r\n\r\n<!-- use `dotnet --info` -->\r\n\r\n.NET Core SDK (reflecting any global.json):\r\n Version:   5.0.100-alpha1-015763\r\n Commit:    0d0c902b77\r\n\r\nRuntime Environment:\r\n OS Name:     Windows\r\n OS Version:  10.0.18363\r\n OS Platform: Windows\r\n RID:         win10-x64\r\n Base Path:   C:\\Program Files\\dotnet\\sdk\\5.0.100-alpha1-015763\\\r\n\r\n<!-- Mention language, UI scaling, or anything else that might be relevant -->\r\n\n\n###### Microsoft Reviewers: [Open in CodeFlow](http://wpcp.azurewebsites.net/CodeFlowProtocolProxy2.php?pullrequest=https://github.com/dotnet/winforms/pull/2758)","Url":"https://github.com/dotnet/winforms/pull/2758","RelatedDescription":"Open PR \"Fixing issue 2704: Cannot find the RichEdit control of the \"Text\" property in UIA structure of a PropertyGrid control\" (#2758)"}],"ResultType":"GitHubIssue"}},"RunOn":"2020-01-30T05:30:55.7299339Z","RunDurationInMilliseconds":638}
