It all started with weird behavior in change detection but ONLY in `rxjs` observable streams...\r\n\r\nThe stream in element did not trigger change detection...\r\n\r\nExample, we have an `@Input() username` and we display it inside of element but also use it to load repositories from github API, the change to username will:\r\n1. trigger component re-render ( and display actual username in template )\r\n2.  trigger `ngOnChanges`\r\n3.  trigger backend request as a part of observable stream ( also receive data)\r\n\r\nbut the change will NOT:\r\n1. trigger re-render as a result of received data from backend\r\n\r\n\r\n## Causes\r\nIt seems to be the case when current zone is logged out inside of the `rxjs` steam it is the parent Angular app zone instead of the element zone... \r\n\r\n## Explored solution 1: `zone.js/dist/zone-patch-rxjs`\r\nI tried to solve it in various ways, the most promising was to add `import 'zone.js/dist/zone-patch-rxjs';` to the element BUT....\r\n\r\nThis leads to second more serious problem ....\r\n\r\nIf the consumer SPA or ( any of it libs ) already uses `import 'zone.js/dist/zone-patch-rxjs'; ` then any subsequent call of import `'zone.js/dist/zone-patch-rxjs';` which calls `Zone.__load_patch('rxjs', handler ...)` will be ignored because in` zone.js` there is\r\n\r\n```typescript\r\nstatic __load_patch(name, fn) {\r\n            if (patches.hasOwnProperty(name)) {                    // only first rxjs patch will be applied\r\n              if (checkDuplicate) {\r\n                    throw Error('Already loaded patch: ' + name);   // this will not happen because checkDuplicate = false by default\r\n                }\r\n            }\r\n            else if (!global['__Zone_disable_' + name]) {\r\n                const perfName = 'Zone:' + name;\r\n                mark(perfName);\r\n                patches[name] = fn(global, Zone, _api);             // patch rxjs\r\n                performanceMeasure(perfName, perfName);\r\n            }\r\n        }\r\n```\r\n\r\nso then if element comes with it's own `rxjs` in its bundle and tries to `import 'zone.js/dist/zone-patch-rxjs';`  patch it, it will be ignored because zone already has `rxjs` patch...\r\n\r\n## Explored solution 2: pass parent Angualr app `NgZone` into the element\r\n\r\nIn terms of solutions what we do now is\r\n\r\nIn element:\r\n1. do not import any zone or any patch\r\n2.  use `.bootstrapModule(AppModule, { ngZone: (window as any).ngZone })`\r\n\r\nIn consumer SPA:\r\n1.\r\n```\r\nexport class AppModule {\r\n  constructor(private ngZone: NgZone) {\r\n    (window as any).ngZone = this.ngZone // store reference on window to be used by element during its bootstrap\r\n  }\r\n}\r\n````\r\n\r\nThe solution seems pretty dirty, would be curious about  why we can't patch more than one `rxjs` and in what direction will the element go and if anybody ever struggled with this ?\r\n\r\n## Reproduction (copy)\r\n\r\nYou can get running example of the last solution using this one liner `git clone \r\n https://github.com/tomastrajan/angular-elements-cd-example.git && cd angular-elements-cd-example && npm i && npm start`\r\n\r\nThe error behavior (when rxjs does NOT trigger change detection after receiving of data) we can simply remove `{ ngZone: (window as any).ngZone }` from the element `main.ts` file\r\n\r\n\r\n## Questions\r\n\r\n1. why is rxjs broken at all ? (everything else seems to be working)\r\n2. why we're not allowed to `zone-patch-rxjs` for multiple `rxjs` bundles in the single  page ?\r\n3. which solution makes most sense based on the roadmap of Angular and elements?\r\n4. what can go wrong when sharing parent ANgular `NgZone` instance with the child element?\r\n5. are the other solutions ( which does NOT involve manual CD because we need  to convert existing Angular apps into elements without major rewrite)?\r\n\r\ncc: @JiaLiPassion @robwormald @manfredsteyer\r\n\r\n\r\n## Versions\r\n\r\nAngular / CLI / elements 8","Url":"https://github.com/angular/angular/issues/31870","RelatedDescription":"Open issue \"@angular/elements + zone.js change detection related to RxJs stream runs in wrong zone\" (#31870)"},{"Id":"473568307","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2019-07-26T23:22:23","Actor":"alexeagle","Number":"31868","RawContent":null,"Title":"doc(zone.js): update release documentation","State":"open","Body":"Misko observed that interactive prompt from npm publish to get an otp didn't make it to his terminal, I think removing yarn will fix it.\r\nAlso pull out the mktemp command, so that you don't do a needless re-build between the pack (dry-run) and publish steps\r\n\r\n## PR Checklist\r\nPlease check if your PR fulfills the following requirements:\r\n\r\n- [ ] The commit message follows our guidelines: https://github.com/angular/angular/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md#commit\r\n- [ ] Tests for the changes have been added (for bug fixes / features)\r\n- [ ] Docs have been added / updated (for bug fixes / features)\r\n\r\n\r\n## PR Type\r\nWhat kind of change does this PR introduce?\r\n\r\n<!-- Please check the one that applies to this PR using \"x\". -->\r\n\r\n- [ ] Bugfix\r\n- [ ] Feature\r\n- [ ] Code style update (formatting, local variables)\r\n- [ ] Refactoring (no functional changes, no api changes)\r\n- [ ] Build related changes\r\n- [ ] CI related changes\r\n- [ ] Documentation content changes\r\n- [ ] angular.io application / infrastructure changes\r\n- [ ] Other...

But this is not possible with dynamic imports, assuming there is no loader being used because webpack supports dynamic imports.\r\n\r\nFor example, if I want to do some magic when a lazy module is being loaded. I can do the following with ```SystemJsNgModuleLoader```:\r\n\r\n```ts\r\nexport class YourCustomLoader extends SystemJsNgModuleLoader {\r\n\r\n  load(path: string): Promise<NgModuleFactory<any>> {\r\n    return super.load(path).then((factory: NgModuleFactory<any>) => {\r\n      return {\r\n        moduleType: factory.moduleType,\r\n        create: (parentInjector: Injector) => {\r\n          const module = factory.create(parentInjector);\r\n          const getMethod = module.injector.get.bind(module.injector);\r\n\r\n          module.injector['get'] = (token: any) => {\r\n            const getResult = getMethod(token);\r\n\r\n            if (token === ROUTES) {\r\n              // This is the place where routes are loaded, but not yet returned\r\n              // Do some custom magic here, throw a custom event etc.\r\n              return getResult;\r\n            } else {\r\n              return getResult;\r\n            }\r\n          };\r\n          return module;\r\n        }\r\n      };\r\n    });\r\n  }\r\n}\r\n```\r\nand use this custom loader. \r\n\r\nThis issues is related to this [one](https://github.com/angular/angular/issues/16282) \r\n\r\n\r\n### Describe the solution you'd like\r\nIf somehow it is possible to override `loadModuleFactory` from [RouterConfigLoader](https://github.com/angular/angular/blob/master/packages/router/src/router_config_loader.ts) . That would do the trick.

The reason is the default value of `max_old_space_size` of node is only 1Gb, and it is not enough to build [Jigsaw](https://github.com/rdkmaster/jigsaw) with `--aot --prod` options.\r\n\r\nTo bypass this issue, I need to use the following command \r\n\r\n```\r\nnode --max_old_space_size=4096 node_modules/@angular/cli/bin/ng build  --aot --prod ...\r\n```\r\n\r\nIt's working perfectly for now, but I think this is not right, angular cli should give us a param to do this, like: \r\n\r\n```\r\nng b --max_old_space_size=4096 --aot --prod ...\r\n```\r\n\r\nBy the way, use the following commands to reproduce the issue:\r\n\r\n```\r\ngit clone https://github.com/rdkmaster/jigsaw.git\r\ncd jigsaw\r\nnpm i\r\nng b --aot --prod\r\n```\r\n\r\n### Describe the solution you'd like\r\n<!-- ✍️--> If you have a solution in mind, please describe it.\r\n\r\nangular cli should give us a param to do this, like: \r\n\r\n```\r\nng b --max_old_space_size=4096 --aot --prod ...\r\n```\r\n\r\n### Describe alternatives you've considered\r\n<!-- ✍️--> Have you considered any alternative solutions or workarounds?\r\n","Url":"https://github.com/angular/angular-cli/issues/15184","RelatedDescription":"Open issue \"angular cli should add a param to indicate the max amount of runtime memory\" (#15184)"},{"Id":"473807856","IsPullRequest":false,"CreatedAt":"2019-07-29T01:06:17","Actor":"rdkmaster","Number":"15183","RawContent":null,"Title":"angular cli will remove the target of the soft symbolic hardly in the dist dir","State":"open","Body":"<!--🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅\r\n\r\nOh hi there! 😄\r\n\r\nTo expedite issue processing please search open and closed issues before submitting a new one.\r\nExisting issues often contain information about workarounds, resolution, or progress updates.\r\n\r\n🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅-->\r\n\r\n\r\n# 🐞 Bug report\r\n\r\n### Command (mark with an `x`)\r\n<!-- Can you pin-point the command or commands that are effected by this bug?

I want to use the target es2015 to take advantage of ES6 and differential loading. Is it possible to add an option `add-target-suffix` to `ng build --watch` so that it will build, for example, `main-es2015.js` and not just `main.js`? I'm asking for this request because I'm using `ng build` to fully generate the script files as part of a Spring Application build and at the same time use `ng build --watch` to speed up coding and testing of TypeScript code but these two operations generate differently named scripts.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Describe the solution you'd like\r\nDepending on the `target` in tsconfig.json, `ng build --watch --add-target-suffix` should do the following:\r\n`es5`: build `main.js` in order to align with `ng build` with `es5` as the target\r\n`es2015`: build `main-es2015.js` in order to align with `ng build` with `es2015` as the target\r\n\r\nIf `--add-target-suffix` is not specified, then `ng build --watch` will perform the default behavior, so as not to break any existing build pipelines.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Describe alternatives you've considered\r\nNone at the moment","Url":"https://github.com/angular/angular-cli/issues/15157","RelatedDescription":"Open issue \"Add option to ng build --watch to include the target in the filename\" (#15157)"},{"Id":"472302252","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2019-07-24T14:32:21","Actor":"alan-agius4","Number":"15155","RawContent":null,"Title":"wip! test","State":"closed","Body":"","Url":"https://github.com/angular/angular-cli/pull/15155","RelatedDescription":"Closed or merged PR \"wip! test\" (#15155)"},{"Id":"472313531","IsPullRequest":false,"CreatedAt":"2019-07-24T14:23:29","Actor":"mcgear","Number":"15156","RawContent":null,"Title":"Schematics that worked in 7.x no longer work with 8.x","State":"open","Body":"<!--🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅\r\n\r\nOh hi there! 😄\r\n\r\nTo expedite issue processing please search open and closed issues before submitting a new one.\r\nExisting issues often contain information about workarounds, resolution, or progress updates.\r\n\r\n🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅-->\r\n\r\n\r\n# 🐞 Bug report\r\n\r\n### Command (mark with an `x`)\r\n<!-- Can you pin-point the command or commands that are effected by this bug? -->\r\n<!-- ✍️edit: -->\r\n```\r\n- [ ] new\r\n- [ ] build\r\n- [ ] serve\r\n- [ ] test\r\n- [ ] e2e\r\n- [x ] generate\r\n- [ ] add\r\n- [ ] update\r\n- [ ] lint\r\n- [ ] xi18n\r\n- [ ] run\r\n- [ ] config\r\n- [ ] help\r\n- [ ] version\r\n- [ ] doc\r\n```\r\n\r\n### Is this a regression?\r\n\r\n<!-- Did this behavior use to work in the previous version? -->\r\n<!-- ✍️--> Yes, the previous version in which this bug was not present was: 7.3.9\r\n\r\n\r\n### Description\r\n\r\n<!-- ✍️--> We have a series of Schematics that are managed at the following github repo:\r\nhttps://github.com/lowcodeunit-devkit/ng-lcu\r\n\r\nIn the 'master' branch are all the old schematics that we had working in older version of angular.  As we work on our upgrade to 8, everything was going smooth until the ng-lcu schematics.  We upgraded the project, and when running schematics locally with 'schematics .:lcu-core-app' or something everything succeeds as would be expected.  The issue arises after releasing schematics to an npm package and trying to reference them from there.  It is at this point we run into issues after adding the schematic and attempting to use ng g to execute.  More explained in repro steps.\r\n\r\nWe have seen this issue against 8.1.2 and attempted upgrad to the 8.2.0-next.1 and saw the same issue.\r\n\r\n\r\n## 🔬 Minimal Reproduction\r\n\r\nWe believe that the issue is in the ng g command as the ng add command does actually succeed.  To simplify the reproduction of this issue (and in our own attempt to resolve) we have taken the integration branch of our repo (https://github.com/lowcodeunit-devkit/ng-lcu) and turned it into a reproduction of this issue.  This provides both the code we are seeing and a build usable from npm.  To reproduce this issue in a new project, try the following:\r\n\r\n1. mkdir tester\r\n2. cd tester\r\n3. ng new tester --directory=./ --defaults\r\n4. ng add @lowcodeunit-devkit/ng-lcu\r\n5. ng-add worked - verify version 0.37.226-integration of @lowcodeunit-devkit/ng-lcu is installed in package.json and verify the existence of an ng-add.json at the root of the angular workspace \r\n6. ng g @lowcodeunit-devkit/ng-lcu:hello\r\n\r\nIt is at this point the simple hello schematic fails to run:\r\n<pre><code>\r\nimport { Rule, SchematicContext, Tree } from '@angular-devkit/schematics';\r\n\r\n\r\n// You don't have to export the function as default. You can also have more than one rule factory\r\n// per file.\r\nexport function hello(_options: any): Rule {\r\n  return (tree: Tree, _context: SchematicContext) => {\r\n    tree.create('hello.json', JSON.stringify({ workspace: 'hey' }));\r\n    \r\n    return tree;\r\n  };\r\n}\r\n<!-- ✍️-->\r\n\r\n</code></pre>\r\n\r\nThe way that ng add works and ng g fails to do anything is what leads me to believe the issue is in ng generate.  \r\n\r\n## 🔥 Exception or Error\r\nWe receive no errors.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n## 🌍 Your Environment\r\n<pre><code>\r\n<!-- run `ng version` and paste output below -->\r\n<!-- ✍️-->\r\n@angular-devkit/architect         0.801.2\r\n@angular-devkit/build-angular     0.801.2\r\n@angular-devkit/build-optimizer   0.801.2\r\n@angular-devkit/build-webpack     0.801.2\r\n@angular-devkit/core              8.1.2\r\n@angular-devkit/schematics        8.1.2\r\n@ngtools/webpack                  8.1.2\r\n@schematics/angular               8.1.2\r\n@schematics/update                0.801.2\r\nrxjs                              6.4.0\r\ntypescript                        3.4.5\r\nwebpack                           4.35.2\r\n</code></pre>\r\n\r\n**Anything else relevant?**\r\n<!-- ✍️Is this a browser specific issue?

Open the [deployed project](https://testproject-4fc07.firebaseapp.com/?46571) in **Safari** and summon forth a snackbar.\r\n \r\n \r\n#### Expected Behavior\r\n\r\nWhat behavior were you expecting to see?\r\nA snackbar\r\n\r\n\r\n#### Actual Behavior\r\n\r\nWhat behavior did you actually see?\r\nA supersized jumbo snackbar\r\n\r\n<img width=\"654\" alt=\"Screen Shot 2019-07-24 at 6 48 30 PM\" src=\"https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/4210581/61838180-56939600-ae45-11e9-9392-c4356c2ac72b.png\">\r\n\r\n\r\n#### Environment\r\n\r\nSafari, on Mac OS and IOS\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThis only happens on the deployment version, I can't figure out what is causing it.  But i'm hoping someone could help know what changes can be made in the stackblitz project in order for the bug not to show up on deploy.  Or is this strictly a firebase deployment bug?\r\n\r\nI found a reference to a similar issue [here](https://github.com/angular/components/issues/14376), the solution seemed simple enough and was due to not closing html tag(s) properly or not having an html doc type declaration.  However I tried checking both of those things and it still happens after deploy.\r\n","Url":"https://github.com/angular/components/issues/16605","RelatedDescription":"Open issue \"Snackbar fills whole screen on deploy\" (#16605)"},{"Id":"472513627","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2019-07-24T23:52:23","Actor":"crisbeto","Number":"16604","RawContent":null,"Title":"fix(popover-edit): blending in with background in high contrast mode","State":"closed","Body":"Fixes the popover edit's overlay blending in with the background in high contrast mode, because it doesn't have a border or an outline.","Url":"https://github.com/angular/components/pull/16604","RelatedDescription":"Closed or merged PR \"fix(popover-edit): blending in with background in high contrast mode\" (#16604)"},{"Id":"472485842","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2019-07-24T19:57:58","Actor":"crisbeto","Number":"16603","RawContent":null,"Title":"refactor(dialog): allow matDialogClose on non-button nodes","State":"open","Body":"Loosens up the selector on `MatDialogClose` so that it can be added on everything, not just buttons.\r\n\r\nFixes #16597.","Url":"https://github.com/angular/components/pull/16603","RelatedDescription":"Open PR \"refactor(dialog): allow matDialogClose on non-button nodes\" (#16603)"},{"Id":"472478623","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2019-07-24T19:46:12","Actor":"crisbeto","Number":"16602","RawContent":null,"Title":"fix(sidenav): focus trap enabled state not updated if mode changes while open","State":"open","Body":"Currently we update the focus trap enabled state only on open/close, however this means that it'll be incorrect if the sidenav mode changes while it's open.\r\n\r\nFixes #16601.","Url":"https://github.com/angular/components/pull/16602","RelatedDescription":"Open PR \"fix(sidenav): focus trap enabled state not updated if mode changes while open\" (#16602)"},{"Id":"472460863","IsPullRequest":false,"CreatedAt":"2019-07-24T19:16:37","Actor":"phyrephox","Number":"16601","RawContent":null,"Title":"Responsive sidenav doesn't update focus trap","State":"open","Body":"#### Reproduction\r\n\r\nUse StackBlitz to reproduce your issue: https://stackblitz.com/edit/angular-lkt2qw\r\n\r\nSteps to reproduce:\r\n1. Open the sidenav with the hamburger menu\r\n2. Shrink the stackblitz preview window until it switches to 'over' mode\r\n3. Tab through the sidenav\r\n \r\n \r\n#### Expected Behavior\r\n\r\nAs the sidenav is now in over mode, the focus trap should be enabled.\r\n\r\n\r\n#### Actual Behavior\r\n\r\nThe focus trap is not enabled so the user can tab past the sidenav into the main content.\r\nThis also happens in reverse, when opening the sidenav in over mode and switching to side mode. The focus trap remains enabled even though the user should be able to tab away from the sidenav.\r\n\r\n\r\n#### Environment\r\n\r\n- Angular: 8.x\r\n- CDK/Material: 8.x\r\n- Browser(s): Tested in chrome\r\n- Operating System (e.g. Windows, macOS, Ubuntu): Ubuntu, ChromeOS\r\n\r\nI think the issue is [this line](https://github.com/angular/components/blob/8ecfc72269a58e0e1cb4a7c40b030ebf26de9310/src/material/sidenav/drawer.ts#L249), where the focus trap is only updated on open/close, rather than mode change as well.","Url":"https://github.com/angular/components/issues/16601","RelatedDescription":"Open issue \"Responsive sidenav doesn't update focus trap\" (#16601)"},{"Id":"472375575","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2019-07-24T16:17:37","Actor":"mertdeg2","Number":"16600","RawContent":null,"Title":"_updateElementSize should not fail if pane is disposed.","State":"open","Body":"Note that this._pane will be set to null if the OverlayRef.dispose is called()\r\n\r\nThis could happen due to variety of reasons.","Url":"https://github.com/angular/components/pull/16600","RelatedDescription":"Open PR \"_updateElementSize should not fail if pane is disposed.\" (#16600)"}],"ResultType":"GitHubIssue"}},"RunOn":"2019-07-29T05:30:05.7674458Z","RunDurationInMilliseconds":3314}
