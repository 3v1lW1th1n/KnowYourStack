You can see the problem in action now by loading [this page](https://boardgamegeek.com/image/100/stephensons-rocket) in IE. You can also see the same problem in older versions of Firefox (52) and Chrome(49);  those aren't even nominally supported by Angular, but I mention them because the dev tools may be better.

For that, a bazel aspect has been created that re-runs previous TypeScript compilations a second time with `esm5` as target.\r\n\r\nThe logic for re-running previous compilations is currently very limited because it's not possible to re-use the *exact* same compiler used in the initial compilation. This is problematic because sometimes the `compiler` is customized through the public `compiler` attribute on `ts_library`.\r\n\r\nIf that is the case, the wrong compiler will be used to create the ESM5 output flavor. Causing \r\nthe compilation to break. \r\n\r\nA simple scenario is that someone just turns on `tsickle` in the `bazelOptions`, but the default `tsc_wrapped` compiler does not have a dependency on `@npm//tsickle`. So a new binary target will be created that adds a dependency on `@npm//tsickle`. Now if targets compiled with that compiler are processed by the esm5 output aspect, tsickle will not be available as the _standard_ compiler will be used.","Url":"https://github.com/angular/angular/issues/32389","RelatedDescription":"Open issue \"bazel: esm5 output aspect not respecting custom typescript compiler\" (#32389)"},{"Id":"486796043","IsPullRequest":false,"CreatedAt":"2019-08-29T07:48:33","Actor":"vajahath","Number":"32388","RawContent":null,"Title":"Broken routerLink when used with Ivy","State":"open","Body":"# 🐞 bug report\r\n\r\n```html\r\n<a routerLink=\"hiya\">link</a>\r\n```\r\nThe `routerLink` breaks when application recompiles.

So far this only happens with **mat-table**\r\n- I don't use third party builders. Standard ng serve\r\n- **Only reload with dev-server breaks**, build etc. are fine\r\n- Any change in SCSS files that are included in compilation will cause error\r\n- _**(!)(!)No caching problem. This also happens with build --watch, the created bundles are corrupt(!)(!)**_ You have to restart the build / serve task completely.\r\n\r\nSo far the workarounds are (one Of):\r\n- Inline SCSS changes do not cause break\r\n- Disable aot for ng serve\r\n- Disable ivy for ng serve \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n#### Reproduction\r\nGithub Repo: https://github.com/kqadem/ivy-test\r\n\r\nSteps to reproduce:\r\n1. npm start\r\n2. change sth in src/app/app.component.scss, linebreak is enough\r\n3. refresh browser \r\n \r\n#### Expected Behavior\r\nI was expection the usual behaviour --> Run without any issues\r\n\r\n#### Actual Behavior\r\nError at bootstrap / startup / Initializing with following error:\r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/5240450/63797906-4883da00-c909-11e9-9c10-4d90ea23a589.png)\r\n\r\n#### Environment\r\n\r\n- Angular: 8.2.0 (error still happens with 9-next)\r\n- CDK/Material: 8.1.4\r\n- Browser(s): Chrome 76\r\n- Operating System (e.g. Windows, macOS, Ubuntu): So far tested on Windows 7 and Ubuntu 19.04\r\n","Url":"https://github.com/angular/components/issues/16897","RelatedDescription":"Open issue \"mat-table + ivy + elements + serve + scss = error\" (#16897)"},{"Id":"485920689","IsPullRequest":false,"CreatedAt":"2019-08-27T18:36:29","Actor":"willyboy","Number":"16893","RawContent":null,"Title":"Regression: TemplatePortalDirective no longer selectable via ViewChild","State":"closed","Body":"#### Reproduction\r\nNot present in 8.1.2, present in 8.1.4\r\n\r\nSteps to reproduce:\r\n1) Add to template file\r\n\r\n```\r\n<ng-template cdkPortal>\r\n      <stuff></stuff>\r\n</ng-template>\r\n```\r\n2) Add to component file\r\n```\r\n@ViewChild(TemplatePortalDirective, { static: true }) templatePortal: Portal<any>;\r\n```\r\n3) In ngOnInit\r\n```\r\nconsole.log(this.templatePortal); // undefined\r\n```\r\nThe error associated with this was:\r\n\r\n>  Must provide a portal to attach\r\n\r\nEmanating from:\r\n```\r\nthis.overlayRef.attach(this.templatePortal);\r\n```\r\n\r\n\r\n#### Expected Behavior\r\n\r\nWhat behavior were you expecting to see?\r\n\r\ntemplatePortal should be the portal\r\n\r\n#### Actual Behavior\r\n\r\nWhat behavior did you actually see?\r\n\r\n>  Must provide a portal to attach\r\n\r\n#### Environment\r\n\r\n- Angular:\r\n```\r\nAngular CLI: 8.0.4\r\nNode: 12.4.0\r\nOS: darwin x64\r\nAngular: 8.2.0\r\n... animations, common, compiler, compiler-cli, core, forms\r\n... language-service, platform-browser, platform-browser-dynamic\r\n... router\r\n\r\nPackage                           Version\r\n-----------------------------------------------------------\r\n@angular-devkit/architect         0.800.1\r\n@angular-devkit/build-angular     0.800.6\r\n@angular-devkit/build-optimizer   0.800.6\r\n@angular-devkit/build-webpack     0.800.6\r\n@angular-devkit/core              8.0.1\r\n@angular-devkit/schematics        8.0.1\r\n@angular/cdk                      8.1.4\r\n@angular/cli                      8.0.4\r\n@angular/flex-layout              8.0.0-beta.26\r\n@ngtools/webpack                  8.0.6\r\n@schematics/angular               8.0.1\r\n@schematics/update                0.800.4\r\nrxjs                              6.5.2\r\ntypescript                        3.4.5\r\nwebpack                           4.30.0\r\n```\r\n- CDK/Material: 8.1.4\r\n- Browser(s): All\r\n- Operating System (e.g. Windows, macOS, Ubuntu): macOs\r\n","Url":"https://github.com/angular/components/issues/16893","RelatedDescription":"Closed issue \"Regression: TemplatePortalDirective no longer selectable via ViewChild\" (#16893)"},{"Id":"485965858","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2019-08-27T18:31:02","Actor":"crisbeto","Number":"16896","RawContent":null,"Title":"fix(icon): not copying attributes from symbol nodes","State":"open","Body":"Currently we have some special handling for the cases where an icon resolves to a `symbol` node, because cloning it directly won't display anything.
