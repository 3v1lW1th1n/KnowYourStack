As I seem to get very large minus values. Whereas I did something similar in sci-kit learns NaiveBayes and the log probabilities were much lower negative values. How do you suggest converting these scores to probabilities? Should I call an exponential function on them if they are in fact log probabilities?\r\n\r\nThanks\r\n","Url":"https://github.com/dotnet/machinelearning/issues/5061","RelatedDescription":"Closed issue \"Converting Naive Bayes Scores to Probabilities\" (#5061)"},{"Id":"606057417","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2020-04-25T06:04:11","Actor":"frank-dong-ms","Number":"5059","RawContent":null,"Title":"simplify baseline files","State":"closed","Body":"many baseline file in SingleDebug and SingleRelease folder are identical, move them to Common folder to avoid duplication\r\n\r\n","Url":"https://github.com/dotnet/machinelearning/pull/5059","RelatedDescription":"Closed or merged PR \"simplify baseline files\" (#5059)"},{"Id":"605927008","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2020-04-25T03:53:50","Actor":"mstfbl","Number":"5057","RawContent":null,"Title":"Fixed X64Fact tests","State":"closed","Body":"Fixed X64Fact tests with x86 specific baselines added\r\n\r\nCurrently obtaining baselines from x86 builds from CI","Url":"https://github.com/dotnet/machinelearning/pull/5057","RelatedDescription":"Closed or merged PR \"Fixed X64Fact tests\" (#5057)"},{"Id":"606526503","IsPullRequest":false,"CreatedAt":"2020-04-24T19:14:55","Actor":"MatiKingloom","Number":"5062","RawContent":null,"Title":"Can i use ML.NET do train a face recognition model","State":"open","Body":"Hi\r\n\r\nIm new to ML, so this might seem like a stupid question, but, id like to use C# to train a face recognition model.\r\n\r\nThe face detection part would be done by Dlib which will extract the face encodings  (double[128])\r\n\r\nSo the question would be can i use ML.NET to train a model that gets face vectors for input\r\nInput would be:\r\nLabel: string \r\nFeature: double array\r\n\r\nAnd trains a model that when an image comes in and i extract the face encodings from it, it could predict which person it is.
