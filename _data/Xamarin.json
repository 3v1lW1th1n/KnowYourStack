I could not find any way to\r\n  hit that message with the current code.  Moreover, the only reports of\r\n  the message I could find on the web were from capitalization\r\n  mismatches, and those are now explicitly ignored by the use of the\r\n  `StringComparison.OrdinalIgnoreCase` argument in the call to\r\n  `string.Compare()`.  Since this message does not currently indicate an\r\n  actionable problem, I changed it from a warning to a debug message.\r\n\r\n* Neither of the warnings in\r\n  `GetAdditionalResourcesFromAssemblies.AddAttributeValue()` is\r\n  actionable for Xamarin.Android app developers.  The first warning can\r\n  only arise if a new attribute name has been added to the `switch`\r\n  statement in `DoExecute()`.  The second warning can only occur in a\r\n  library that uses one of those attributes.  Since the attributes are\r\n  not formally documented, they are currently only intended for use by\r\n  the Xamarin team.  Since these warnings aren't aimed at end-users,\r\n  they don't need to have their own codes.  So for now, I just updated\r\n  the warnings to reuse the `errorCode`.\r\n\r\n* The first warning in\r\n  `GetAdditionalResourcesFromAssemblies.MakeSureLibraryIsInPlace()` is\r\n  just an informational message.  The download step is *expected* to be\r\n  skipped during design-time builds.  I changed the warning to a debug\r\n  message accordingly.\r\n\r\n* I changed the warning in `ReadAdditionalResourcesFromAssemblyCache` to\r\n  a debug message because it is just informational.  For example, in the\r\n  normal process of building application projects, the\r\n  Xamarin.Android.Common.targets checks if `CacheFile` exists before it\r\n  invokes the task, so an absent `CacheFile` is often normal.  In cases\r\n  where the warning could be actionable for an end-user, the warning\r\n  would indicate that something went wrong earlier when creating the\r\n  `CacheFile` in `GetAdditionalResourcesFromAssemblies`, so even in that\r\n  case this warning would not be needed because more actionable messages\r\n  should come from the earlier task.  On top of that, this whole old\r\n  mechanism of downloading external files is rarely used now that the\r\n  large majority of the NuGet packages from the Xamarin team have been\r\n  updated to use the newer Xamarin.Build.Download mechanism.\r\n\r\n* I also changed the warnings in `ReadImportedLibrariesCache` and\r\n `ReadLibraryProjectImportsCache` to debug messages for similar reasons.\r\n A missing cache file in one of these tasks indicates that something\r\n went wrong during the corresponding earlier `GetImportedLibraries` or\r\n `ResolveLibraryProjectImports` task, so any actionable messages would\r\n need to get logged in the earlier task instead.\r\n\r\n* The warnings in\r\n  `ResolveAssemblies.ResolveRuntimeAssemblyForReferenceAssembly()`\r\n  should not occur during normal use.  They both depend on *generated*\r\n  content related to the NuGet target framework moniker.  Based on these\r\n  considerations, I assigned just one shared warning code to both\r\n  warnings for now."},{"Id":"8375514523","Type":"PullRequestEvent","CreatedAt":"2018-10-05T16:39:54","Actor":"dellis1972","Repository":"xamarin/xamarin-android","Organization":"xamarin","RawContent":null,"RelatedAction":"opened","RelatedUrl":"https://github.com/xamarin/xamarin-android/pull/2269","RelatedDescription":"Opened pull request \"[Xamarin.Android.Build.Tasks] `ResourcePatcher` for API 19+.\" (#2269) at xamarin/xamarin-android","RelatedBody":""},{"Id":"8374387962","Type":"PullRequestEvent","CreatedAt":"2018-10-05T13:33:29","Actor":"dellis1972","Repository":"xamarin/xamarin-android","Organization":"xamarin","RawContent":null,"RelatedAction":"merged","RelatedUrl":"https://github.com/xamarin/xamarin-android/pull/2222","RelatedDescription":"Merged pull request \"Don't ignore IntentFilter attribute on content provider classes\" (#2222) at xamarin/xamarin-android","RelatedBody":"Fixes: https://github.com/xamarin/xamarin-android/issues/2202\r\nContext: https://forums.xamarin.com/discussion/96028/android-documentsprovider-intent-filter\r\n\r\nWhen generating `AndroidManifest.xml` we currently fail to take into account any\r\ninstances of the `IntentFilterAttribute` custom attribute decorating all the\r\ncontent provider classes (that is ones with another custom attribute -\r\n`ContentProviderAttribute`).
