This surely has to do with the translation to virtual desktop coordinates.  It works fine when only one monitor is attached, but not in multi-monitor.  Well, at least not in my configuration:  2160x3840 (200%) and 3440x1440 (100%):\r\n\r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/15221213/71020246-d0f0db00-20b0-11ea-8109-71da662ae6d9.png)\r\n\r\nThis is not urgent, as our standard testing is done on single-monitor machines.  But it will need to be fixed before making the tests public, as contributors will surely run tests in multi-monitor, and will get false failures.\r\n\r\nNote:  There are at least two copies of this code in the test repo - one used by DRTs, another by feature tests.\r\n\r\n **Actual behavior:** <!-- callstack for crashes / exceptions -->\r\n Mouse sometimes ends up one pixel away from the intended position.  It depends on the position, and how the actual pixels align with the virtual-desktop coordinates.  Thus the test results can be different on repeated attempts, depending on where the OS chooses to display the test's main window.\r\n\r\n **Expected behavior:**\r\n Mouse moves to the intended position.\r\n\r\n **Minimal repro:**\r\n1. DrtWindowResizeGripFlowDirection\r\n\"Did not get correct Height after changing FlowDirection and resizing through ResizeGrip. expected:350 -- actual:351\"\r\n(The mouse drag to resize the window ended one pixel below the intended.)\r\n\r\n2. DrtControls -suite Menu.Capture\r\n\" ASSERT failed [Suite: Menu.Capture  Test: CaptureTest]   AutoClose popup should be open\"\r\n(Test intended to move the mouse to the top-left of an open popup, and click to close a nested ComboBox and restore capture to the popup.  Instead the mouse moved just off the popup, and the click closed the popup.)\r\n\r\n3. Presumably many more false failures in feature tests.","Url":"https://github.com/dotnet/wpf/issues/2329","RelatedDescription":"Open issue \"[Test] Mouse-move injection is slightly off on multi-monitor systems\" (#2329)"},{"Id":"539080960","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2019-12-17T14:05:25","Actor":"dotnet-maestro[bot]","Number":"2328","RawContent":null,"Title":"[master] Update dependencies from dotnet/winforms","State":"closed","Body":"This pull request updates the following dependencies\r\n\r\n[marker]: <> (Begin:256c8be3-de58-46f5-d219-08d6ba11f126)\r\n## From https://github.com/dotnet/winforms\r\n- **Build**: 20191217.1\r\n- **Date Produced**: 12/17/2019 1:31 PM\r\n- **Commit**: b58173e9c1806d96ccf65cf2cd5ce15481f24cc0\r\n- **Branch**: refs/heads/master\r\n- **Updates**:\r\n  - **Microsoft.Private.Winforms** -> 5.0.0-alpha1.19617.1\r\n\r\n[marker]: <> (End:256c8be3-de58-46f5-d219-08d6ba11f126)\r\n\r\n","Url":"https://github.com/dotnet/wpf/pull/2328","RelatedDescription":"Closed or merged PR \"[master] Update dependencies from dotnet/winforms\" (#2328)"},{"Id":"539060214","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2019-12-17T13:27:36","Actor":"dotnet-maestro[bot]","Number":"2327","RawContent":null,"Title":"[master] Update dependencies from dnceng/internal/dotnet-wpf-int","State":"closed","Body":"This pull request updates the following dependencies\r\n\r\n[marker]: <> (Begin:46a15fe4-6c2c-480d-9cdd-08d71053b252)\r\n## From https://dev.azure.com/dnceng/internal/_git/dotnet-wpf-int\r\n- **Build**: 20191217.2\r\n- **Date Produced**: 12/17/2019 12:09 PM\r\n- **Commit**: 178cc6206b05d0f5b028ae0282570f4bc01b55fb\r\n- **Branch**: refs/heads/master\r\n- **Updates**:\r\n  - **Microsoft.DotNet.Wpf.DncEng** -> 5.0.0-alpha.1.19617.2\r\n\r\n[marker]: <> (End:46a15fe4-6c2c-480d-9cdd-08d71053b252)\r\n\r\n","Url":"https://github.com/dotnet/wpf/pull/2327","RelatedDescription":"Closed or merged PR \"[master] Update dependencies from dnceng/internal/dotnet-wpf-int\" (#2327)"},{"Id":"539016265","IsPullRequest":false,"CreatedAt":"2019-12-17T11:46:49","Actor":"paiden","Number":"2326","RawContent":null,"Title":"Japanese IME crashes application with ExecutionEngineException","State":"open","Body":"* .NET Core Version: 3.1.100\r\n* Windows version: 1809\r\n* Does the bug reproduce also in WPF for .NET Framework 4.8?: Yes\r\n\r\n **Problem description:**\r\nIME crashes the application if the text changed event handler sets a text that is shorter than the text currently inside the textbox.\r\n\r\n **Actual behavior:**\r\nThe application crashes with ExecutionEngineException\r\n\r\n```\r\nSystem.ExecutionEngineException\r\n  HResult=0x80131506\r\n  Message=Exception of type 'System.ExecutionEngineException' was thrown.\r\n```\r\n\r\nOn Full .Net framework I get a little more of an error message:\r\n```\r\nManaged Debugging Assistant 'FatalExecutionEngineError' \r\n  Message=Managed Debugging Assistant 'FatalExecutionEngineError' : 'The runtime has \r\nencountered a fatal error.

The text contain a combination of text and date and month separated by ‘/’. The application is crashing when the user select the ‘/’ along with the number(i.e. date and month). In Windows 10 1909, with the .Net Framework version 4.8 is the environment where the application is experiencing the crash.\r\n \r\n**Steps to reproduce:**\r\n\r\nCreate a WPF application.\r\nUse a Textbox with the below properties and text.\r\n\r\nTextWrapping=\"Wrap\" FlowDirection=\"RightToLeft\" Margin=\"10\" Text=\"נסה לסמן את הלוכסן שבין הספרות 07/1997 והתוכנה תקרוס\" \r\n\r\n(Text Translation:  Try to mark the slash between the digits 07/1997 and the software will crash)\r\nSet the window size as below\r\n\r\nHeight=\"200\" Width=\"250\"\r\nPlease the below code, in App.xaml.cs\r\n\r\n          private void Application_Startup(object sender, StartupEventArgs e)\r\n\r\n        {\r\n\r\n            AppContext.SetSwitch(\"Switch.System.Windows.Controls.Text.UseAdornerForTextboxSelectionRendering\", false);\r\n\r\n        }\r\nPlease the below code in App.xaml\r\n\r\n  Startup=\"Application_Startup\"\r\nRun the application and select the text including the '/' in the text using the mouse.\r\nThe application will crash in few seconds \r\n\r\n**Notes:**\r\n1.

I can only reproduce it with a specific layout and I have created a sample app to reproduce. I tried debugging the decompiled source in PresentationFramework, but was not able to find the true source.\r\n\r\nThe basics: I have a Grid layout in which I have put in a TreeView with some items in one column, a DataGrid in another column that shows details of the selected item in the TreeView. In the row below both the DataGrid and the TreeView, I have a button (I've tested a few different controls that all reprod) and it's in the same column as the DataGrid.\r\n\r\nWhen the TreeView is scrolled down and an item is selected, the DataGrid populates with the details of the selected item and then an UpdateLayout is called on the TreeView which causes the ScrollInfo values on it's ScrollViewer to revert to a Y value of 0 and the TreeView scrolls to the top.\r\n\r\nIn my sample application, you can just run it, click the Fill button to add items then click Expand All to expand them. Scroll down a bit and select any leaf item and the TreeView will scroll back to the top.\r\n\r\nIf the button at the bottom is removed from the xaml or if the first Grid column that houses the TreeView is set to a set width or *, the errant scroll won't repro.\r\n\r\nThe sample project can be found here: https://github.com/climbak/TreeViewScrollingIssue","Url":"https://github.com/dotnet/wpf/issues/2302","RelatedDescription":"Closed issue \"TreeView scroll issue\" (#2302)"},{"Id":"536545271","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2019-12-11T23:09:14","Actor":"rladuca","Number":"2305","RawContent":null,"Title":"Remove dependency on .NET SDK installs for IL Tools","State":"closed","Body":"Fixes #2298\r\n\r\nUse a set of matched, private IL tools in order to inject a module constructor into `PresentationCore`.
