I have ported my DirectX 11 rendering engine ([Ab3d.DXEngine](https://www.ab4d.com/DXEngine.aspx)) and WPF 3D toolkit ([Ab3d.PowerToys](https://www.ab4d.com/PowerToys.aspx)) to .Net Core 3 and they work without any problems from Preview1. Except changing the csproj files there were no changes in the code needed. The code is quite complex and uses SharpDX to call DirectX 11 API and it runs without any problems. I also tested the WPF 3D part and this also runs very well. One of the first things that I did, was to check the performance. I have expected a slight performance improvement, but just recompiling the code for .Net Core 3 brings no performance benefits to my rendering engine. Anyway, in the future, I plan to use new options like Slice and SIMD vectors and this should have more impact.","Url":"https://github.com/dotnet/wpf/issues/521","RelatedDescription":"Open issue \"Problem with WPF's Slider style (and a few thoughts on porting DX11 rendering engine to Core3)\" (#521)"},{"Id":"430142860","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2019-04-07T13:01:22","Actor":"dotnet-maestro[bot]","Number":"520","RawContent":null,"Title":"[master] Update dependencies from dotnet/core-setup","State":"closed","Body":"This pull request updates the following dependencies\r\n\r\n## From https://github.com/dotnet/core-setup\r\n- **Build**: 20190406.09\r\n- **Date Produced**: 4/7/2019 8:05 AM\r\n- **Commit**: 42a6743d709c3d74f1cb7a2af8740e3183a022f4\r\n- **Branch**: refs/heads/master\r\n- **Updates**:\r\n  - **Microsoft.NETCore.App** -> 3.0.0-preview5-27606-09\r\n\r\n## Coherency Updates\r\n\r\nThe following updates ensure that dependencies with a *CoherentParentDependency*\r\nattribute were produced in a build used as input to the parent dependency's build.\r\nSee [Dependency Description Format](https://github.com/dotnet/arcade/blob/master/Documentation/DependencyDescriptionFormat.md#dependency-description-overview)\r\n\r\n- **Microsoft.Win32.Registry** -> 4.6.0-preview5.19206.5 (parent: Microsoft.NETCore.App)\r\n- **System.Configuration.ConfigurationManager** -> 4.6.0-preview5.19206.5 (parent: Microsoft.NETCore.App)\r\n- **System.Diagnostics.EventLog** -> 4.6.0-preview5.19206.5 (parent: Microsoft.NETCore.App)\r\n- **System.Reflection.Emit** -> 4.6.0-preview5.19206.5 (parent: Microsoft.NETCore.App)\r\n- **System.Security.AccessControl** -> 4.6.0-preview5.19206.5 (parent: Microsoft.NETCore.App)\r\n- **System.Security.Cryptography.Xml** -> 4.6.0-preview5.19206.5 (parent: Microsoft.NETCore.App)\r\n- **System.Security.Permissions** -> 4.6.0-preview5.19206.5 (parent: Microsoft.NETCore.App)\r\n- **System.Security.Principal.Windows** -> 4.6.0-preview5.19206.5 (parent: Microsoft.NETCore.App)\r\n- **System.Windows.Extensions** -> 4.6.0-preview5.19206.5 (parent: Microsoft.NETCore.App)\r\n- **System.CodeDom** -> 4.6.0-preview5.19206.5 (parent: Microsoft.NETCore.App)\r\n- **System.Reflection.MetadataLoadContext** -> 4.6.0-preview5.19206.5 (parent: Microsoft.NETCore.App)\r\n- **System.Drawing.Common** -> 4.6.0-preview5.19206.5 (parent: Microsoft.NETCore.App)\r\n- **System.DirectoryServices** -> 4.6.0-preview5.19206.5 (parent: Microsoft.NETCore.App)\r\n\r\n","Url":"https://github.com/dotnet/wpf/pull/520","RelatedDescription":"Closed or merged PR \"[master] Update dependencies from dotnet/core-setup\" (#520)"},{"Id":"430027276","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2019-04-07T12:12:52","Actor":"dotnet-maestro[bot]","Number":"512","RawContent":null,"Title":"[master] Update dependencies from dotnet/arcade","State":"closed","Body":"This pull request updates the following dependencies\r\n\r\n## From https://github.com/dotnet/arcade\r\n- **Build**: 20190405.6\r\n- **Date Produced**: 4/5/2019 11:26 PM\r\n- **Commit**: 4217db4a23ffd15abb3771d635b66162994fb9e4\r\n- **Branch**: refs/heads/master\r\n- **Updates**:\r\n  - **Microsoft.DotNet.Arcade.Sdk** -> 1.0.0-beta.19205.6\r\n  - **Microsoft.DotNet.CodeAnalysis** -> 1.0.0-beta.19205.6\r\n\r\n## From https://github.com/dotnet/arcade\r\n- **Build**: 20190406.5\r\n- **Date Produced**: 4/6/2019 5:35 PM\r\n- **Commit**: 9d8abf998866f10bc19d97e1916ff1c0ada3fd42\r\n- **Branch**: refs/heads/master\r\n- **Updates**:\r\n  - **Microsoft.DotNet.Arcade.Sdk** -> 1.0.0-beta.19206.5\r\n  - **Microsoft.DotNet.CodeAnalysis** -> 1.0.0-beta.19206.5\r\n\r\n","Url":"https://github.com/dotnet/wpf/pull/512","RelatedDescription":"Closed or merged PR \"[master] Update dependencies from dotnet/arcade\" (#512)"},{"Id":"430110271","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2019-04-07T06:25:38","Actor":"hughbe","Number":"519","RawContent":null,"Title":"Make build.sh executable","State":"open","Body":"","Url":"https://github.com/dotnet/wpf/pull/519","RelatedDescription":"Open PR \"Make build.sh executable\" (#519)"},{"Id":"430085559","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2019-04-06T23:08:34","Actor":"stevenbrix","Number":"518","RawContent":null,"Title":"Dev/stevenbrix/enable analyzers for pbt","State":"closed","Body":"Enabling analyzers and running some code-fixers for PBT.
