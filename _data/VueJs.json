The correct way to modify the state tree is to create a mutation to set the value of the key in the state. This means a lot of repetitive code is written (as shown below):\r\n\r\n```\r\nexport default {\r\n  state: {\r\n    name: null,\r\n    value: 0\r\n  },\r\n  mutations: {\r\n    setName (state, name) {\r\n      state.name = name;\r\n    },\r\n    setValue (state, value) {\r\n      state.value = value;\r\n    }\r\n  }\r\n};\r\n\r\n$store.commit('setName', 'John Doe');\r\n```\r\n\r\n`mapSetters` will allow users to create all these setters using a single like of code.\r\n\r\n### What does the proposed API look like?\r\n```\r\nimport { mapSetters } from 'vuex'\r\n\r\nexport default {\r\n  state: {\r\n    name: null,\r\n    value: 0\r\n  },\r\n  mutations: {\r\n    ...mapSetters(['name', 'value']),\r\n    //...\r\n  }\r\n};\r\n```\r\n\r\nUsage: `$store.commit('name', \"John Doe\")` OR `$store.commit('setValue', 4)` depending on how it is implemented. I prefer the second approach myself.\r\n\r\n<!-- generated by vue-issues.
