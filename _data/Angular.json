It is unclear what is trying to resolve the module and why `rules_nodejs`s linker is not being used to give it the right path information. When I manually provide `tslib` within my local node modules directory to the build target, it continues to try to resolve node modules within my workspace rather than within `@npm`\r\n\r\n## 🔬 Minimal Reproduction\r\n\r\nI've made an example repo with a build target which invokes the ng-packager builder here: https://github.com/mrmeku/prototype-nx-bazel/blob/master/libs/shared-buildable-lib/BUILD.bazel#L51\r\n\r\nClone the repo and run `bazel build //libs/shared-buildable-lib:build` to reproduce the error.\r\n\r\n## 🔥 Exception or Error\r\n<pre><code>\r\nERROR: EPERM: operation not permitted, open '/private/var/tmp/_bazel_mrmeku/2862b1b0ca0f4fada19488b52142c2e3/sandbox/darwin-sandbox/2/execroot/prototype_nx_bazel/node_modules/tslib/package.json'\r\nAn unhandled exception occurred: EPERM: operation not permitted, open '/private/var/tmp/_bazel_mrmeku/2862b1b0ca0f4fada19488b52142c2e3/sandbox/darwin-sandbox/2/execroot/prototype_nx_bazel/node_modules/tslib/package.json'\r\nSee \"/var/folders/y4/35jxk5nx0tb9lnx7863fx2v80000gn/T/ng-8xnE0A/angular-errors.log\" for further details.\r\n</code></pre>\r\n","Url":"https://github.com/angular/angular-cli/issues/16182","RelatedDescription":"Open issue \"@angular-devkit/build-ng-packagr:build incompatible with Bazel\" (#16182)"},{"Id":"521986182","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2019-11-13T19:41:26","Actor":"renovate[bot]","Number":"16172","RawContent":null,"Title":"build: update pacote to version 10.1.3","State":"closed","Body":"This PR contains the following updates:\n\n| Package | Type | Update | Change |\n|---|---|---|---|\n| [pacote](https://togithub.com/npm/pacote) | dependencies | patch | [`10.1.2` -> `10.1.3`](https://renovatebot.com/diffs/npm/pacote/10.1.2/10.1.3) |\n| [pacote](https://togithub.com/npm/pacote) | devDependencies | patch | [`10.1.2` -> `10.1.3`](https://renovatebot.com/diffs/npm/pacote/10.1.2/10.1.3) |\n\n---\n\n### Release Notes\n\n<details>\n<summary>npm/pacote</summary>\n\n### [`v10.1.3`](https://togithub.com/npm/pacote/compare/v10.1.2...v10.1.3)\n\n[Compare Source](https://togithub.com/npm/pacote/compare/v10.1.2...v10.1.3)\n\n</details>\n\n---\n\n### Renovate configuration\n\n:date: **Schedule**: \"after 10pm every weekday,before 4am every weekday,every weekend\" in timezone America/Tijuana.\n\n:vertical_traffic_light: **Automerge**: Disabled by config.

So the Chrome team created a babel preset for getting more compact modern JavaScript.\r\n\r\nPlease see more https://github.com/babel/preset-modules#how-does-it-work. \r\n\r\nI guess that idea can help also Angular CLI's build process. Generate original bundles for browsers that support ES Modules, and down-leveling it for legacy browsers.\r\n\r\nI'm not sure how we can achieve it with TypeScript-based toolchain, but I hope it isn't impossible.\r\n\r\n","Url":"https://github.com/angular/angular-cli/issues/16170","RelatedDescription":"Open issue \"Proposal: More intelligent transpilation for Differential Loading\" (#16170)"},{"Id":"521372868","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2019-11-12T19:48:23","Actor":"renovate[bot]","Number":"16157","RawContent":null,"Title":"build: update core-js to version 3.4.1","State":"closed","Body":"This PR contains the following updates:\n\n| Package | Type | Update | Change |\n|---|---|---|---|\n| [core-js](https://togithub.com/zloirock/core-js) | dependencies | patch | [`3.4.0` -> `3.4.1`](https://renovatebot.com/diffs/npm/core-js/3.4.0/3.4.1) |\n\n---\n\n### Release Notes\n\n<details>\n<summary>zloirock/core-js</summary>\n\n### [`v3.4.1`](https://togithub.com/zloirock/core-js/blob/master/CHANGELOG.md#&#8203;341---20191112)\n\n[Compare Source](https://togithub.com/zloirock/core-js/compare/v3.4.0...v3.4.1)\n\n-   Throw when `(Async)Iterator#flatMap` mapper returns a non-iterable, per [tc39/proposal-iterator-helpers/55](https://togithub.com/tc39/proposal-iterator-helpers/issues/55) and [tc39/proposal-iterator-helpers/59](https://togithub.com/tc39/proposal-iterator-helpers/pull/59)\n-   Removed own `AggregateError#toString`, per [tc39/proposal-promise-any/49](https://togithub.com/tc39/proposal-promise-any/pull/49)\n-   Global `core-js` `Promise` polyfill passes feature detection in the pure versions\n-   Fixed indexes in `String#replaceAll` callbacks\n-   `String#replaceAll` marked as supported by FF72\n\n</details>\n\n---\n\n### Renovate configuration\n\n:date: **Schedule**: \"after 10pm every weekday,before 4am every weekday,every weekend\" in timezone America/Tijuana.\n\n:vertical_traffic_light: **Automerge**: Disabled by config.
