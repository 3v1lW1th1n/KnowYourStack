It seems to work (so far) on\r\nWindows, MacOS, and Linux and doesn’t require elevation or\r\nmodify your system.\r\n\r\nxabuild.exe works by doing the following:\r\n- Reference `MSBuild.exe` or `MSBuild.dll` depending on the platform\r\n- Overrides the `app.config` file of MSBuild to set various properties\r\n- This allows `xabuild.exe` to build Xamarin.Android projects using\r\nlocal Xamarin.Android build output\r\n- Creates symbolic links to `.NETPortable` and `.NETFramework`\r\ndirectories inside the Xamarin.Android build output directory\r\n- Run MSBuild’s `Main()` method\r\n\r\n### Changes\r\n- Added `xabuild.csproj` to Xamarin.Android.sln\r\n- tools/scripts/xabuild now just runs xabuild.exe\r\n- Xamarin.Android.Build.Tests run xabuild.exe\r\n\r\n### Limitations\r\n- xbuild will not work, use `MSBUILD=msbuild` for all `make` commands\r\n- On Linux I had to use Mono 5.2 to get a version of msbuild that\r\nworked (I think probably was installation issue, as building a plain\r\nproject didn’t work)\r\n\r\n### Usage\r\n\r\nAn example on MacOS:\r\n```\r\nmake prepare all MSBUILD=msbuild\r\nmake all-tests MSBUILD=msbuild\r\nmake run-nunit-tests MSBUILD=msbuild NUNIT_TESTS=bin/TestDebug/Xamarin.Android.Build.Tests.dll\r\n```\r\n\r\nAn example on Windows (msbuild should be 15.3 from VS 2017):\r\n```\r\nmsbuild build-tools\\scripts\\PrepareWindows.targets\r\nmsbuild Xamarin.Android.sln\r\nbin\\Debug\\bin\\xabuild.exe Xamarin.Android-Tests.sln /p:XAIntegratedTests=False\r\npackages\\NUnit.ConsoleRunner.3.7.0\\tools\\nunit3-console.exe bin\\TestDebug\\Xamarin.Android.Build.Tests.dll\r\n```\r\nNote, these tests are not all passing on Windows yet.

The\r\nproblem with this is that `Microsoft.Build.Utilities.ToolTask` has its\r\nown validation that checks if the file exists. On Windows, a file named\r\n`adb` does not exist, because it is named `adb.exe`.\r\n\r\nThe solution here is to not set `base.ToolExe` if the incoming value\r\nalready matches `ToolBaseName`. This prevents the validation, and\r\n`PathToolTask` can continue to use `Which` appropriately to either find\r\n`adb` or `adb.exe` depending on the platform. This also allows\r\n`$(AdbToolExe)` to be overidden if needed."},{"Id":"6654373764","Type":"PullRequestEvent","CreatedAt":"2017-09-29T12:33:57","Actor":"grendello","Repository":"xamarin/xamarin-android","Organization":"xamarin","RawContent":null,"RelatedAction":"opened","RelatedUrl":"https://github.com/xamarin/xamarin-android/pull/909","RelatedDescription":"Opened pull request \"Use API9 includes directory for 32-bit ARM builds\" (#909) at xamarin/xamarin-android","RelatedBody":"NDK 14+ (which we use) doesn't have android-4 anymore"},{"Id":"6651770525","Type":"PullRequestEvent","CreatedAt":"2017-09-28T21:22:22","Actor":"jonpryor","Repository":"xamarin/xamarin-android","Organization":"xamarin","RawContent":null,"RelatedAction":"merged","RelatedUrl":"https://github.com/xamarin/xamarin-android/pull/905","RelatedDescription":"Merged pull request \"[Xamarin.Android.Build.Tests] Fix Lint Error in the latest Android tools\" (#905) at xamarin/xamarin-android","RelatedBody":"Lint is now reporting\r\n\r\n\t`obj/Debug/android/src/md5f80e635856c5c6d2b732d9b14f8f2b1f/MainActivity.java(27,13): error XA0103:  Overriding method should call super.onCreate [MissingSuperCall]`\r\n\r\nbecause we don't call `super.onCreate` in our JCW genearted code.\r\nThis is by design so we need to ignore this particular error.\r\n\r\nThat said we now have 4 issues we ignore, so rather than keep duplicating\r\ncode it has been refectored to use a `string[]`."},{"Id":"6651740718","Type":"PullRequestEvent","CreatedAt":"2017-09-28T21:14:45","Actor":"jonpryor","Repository":"xamarin/xamarin-android","Organization":"xamarin","RawContent":null,"RelatedAction":"merged","RelatedUrl":"https://github.com/xamarin/xamarin-android/pull/907","RelatedDescription":"Merged pull request \"[tests] fixes for emulator creation on Windows\" (#907) at xamarin/xamarin-android","RelatedBody":"- `JAVA_HOME` needs to be set for `avdmanager.bat`\r\n- Installing apks on the emulator was failing with\r\n`INSTALL_FAILED_INSUFFICIENT_STORAGE` on Windows\r\n- A newer revision of the emulator fixes this, now using\r\n`x86-21_r05.zip`"},{"Id":"6651727385","Type":"PullRequestEvent","CreatedAt":"2017-09-28T21:11:21","Actor":"jonpryor","Repository":"xamarin/xamarin-android","Organization":"xamarin","RawContent":null,"RelatedAction":"merged","RelatedUrl":"https://github.com/xamarin/xamarin-android/pull/906","RelatedDescription":"Merged pull request \"[create-vsix] Update the icon for the .vsix file\" (#906) at xamarin/xamarin-android","RelatedBody":"The previous icon was the Visual Studio default icon for a `.vsix`\r\nproject.
