That is ngOnDestroy gets called.\r\n\r\nGood thing is that it works as expected at runtime, but only breaks in unit tests. So not too important.\r\n\r\nAs a workaround I'll remove the tests as they are a bit questionable (testing the framework...), but decided to create an issue as you might want to know that this change occurred.\r\n\r\nFood for thought for you guys is that I've also tried adding the service to a test bed module (or even `providedIn:'root'`), and would kind of expect that it's ngOnDestroy gets called once fixture is destroyed, but it does not (same in VE though).

We build them, next - deploy. On build stage we create artifacts which consists of compiled files. On deploy stage we apply environment settings to our artifacts (change configs or replace placeholders). Next we run application which read config and stands up.\r\n\r\nThis is common situation for any projects because of their artifacts contains separate config files (or files in archive which we can simply repack). For any except web. Web-artifact is a bunch of compiled html/js files which also include config. This is not simple to find and replace it.\r\n\r\nWhat are possible solutions?\r\n1. Store src in the artifact and build them any deploy. This contradicts the concept of an artifact.\r\n2. Store config as separate js-chunk. This is possible but the issue shouldn't define structure of our bundles\r\n4. Store config as asset and load it asynchronously. This makes our application more difficult\r\n3. Find and replace config into the compiled js-files. This is possible, but it is too hard to find place of config correctly.\r\n\r\nWell, we can combine 2 and 4 ways to simplify work with configs. E.g.\r\nAngular-cli can make separate chunk for file which contains special `/* angular-cli:chunk-name:config */` directive on the top of file and stay this comment in the main chunk. So, we can process our config chunk and replace the comment on our processed config or any other config.\r\nOr it can be settings in angular.json.\r\n\r\nMaybe there are other ways.

I can no longer specify a package name in the \"schematics\" property of the package.json file. The path specified there is always resolved relative to the package.json location. I can make it work again if I change it to this:\r\n```\r\n\"schematics\": \"../mylib-schematics/collection.json\"\r\n```\r\n\r\nThe problem is within `packages/angular_devkit/schematics/tools/node-module-engine-host.ts`:\r\n\r\n```\r\n  protected _resolveCollectionPath(name: string): string {\r\n    let collectionPath: string | undefined = undefined;\r\n    if (name.startsWith('.') || name.startsWith('/')) {\r\n      name = resolve(name);\r\n    }\r\n\r\n    if (extname(name)) {\r\n      // When having an extension let's just resolve the provided path.\r\n      collectionPath = require.resolve(name, { paths: this.paths });\r\n    } else {\r\n      const packageJsonPath = require.resolve(join(name, 'package.json'), { paths: this.paths });\r\n      const { schematics } = require(packageJsonPath);\r\n\r\n      if (!schematics || typeof schematics !== 'string') {\r\n        throw new NodePackageDoesNotSupportSchematics(name);\r\n      }\r\n\r\n// !!!\r\n// the below line is wrong: it should only try to resolve it that way if the path starts with '.' or '/'\r\n// (i.e. when dealing with a relative or absolute path)\r\n// otherwise it should use require.resolve() like above\r\n// !!!\r\n      collectionPath = resolve(dirname(packageJsonPath), schematics);\r\n    }\r\n```\r\n\r\n## üî¨ Minimal Reproduction\r\n\r\nAs described above, create a library and add a \"collections\" property to its package.json that points to another node_module, then try to \"ng

Package\r\n<!-- Can you pin-point one or more @angular/* packages as the source of the bug? -->\r\n<!-- ‚úçÔ∏èedit: --> The issue is caused by package @angular/router\r\n\r\n\r\n### Is this a regression?\r\n\r\n<!-- Did this behavior use to work in the previous version? -->\r\n<!-- ‚úçÔ∏è--> Yes, the previous version in which this bug was not present was: Angular 8\r\n\r\n\r\n### Description\r\n\r\n<!-- ‚úçÔ∏è--> I have a library project that i put everything common in it from my over all theme and common forms and components and directives and so on in it. recently i migrated this library(is built with ng-packagr) from angular 8 to angular 9. i fixed errors, corrected 3rd party libraries etc till that both \"ng build --prod\" and ng-packagr build was successful with no errors. After these i tried to use my library in my other projects that depend on it and got bellow error              \r\n```\r\nERROR in symbol RouterOutlet declared in appProject/node_modules/@angular/router/router.d.ts is not exported from @angular/router (import into appProject/node_modues/library/fesm2015/library.js)\r\n```\r\nThe thing is i checked this `library.js` and not a single occurrence of `RouterOutlet` was found in it but i have `<router-outlet>` in my shared components of library. As suggested Ivy is disabled for this library project.                               \r\nI really have no clue what this error means or what i can do to solve it. I will be really happy if you could provide me help to pass this. Thanks in advanced.\r\n\r\n## üî• Exception or Error\r\n<pre><code>\r\nERROR in symbol RouterOutlet declared in appProject/node_modules/@angular/router/router.d.ts is not exported from @angular/router (import into appProject/node_modues/library/fesm2015/library.js)\r\n</code></pre>\r\n\r\n\r\n## üåç  Your Environment\r\n\r\n**Angular Version:**\r\n<pre><code>\r\n<!-- run `ng version` and paste output below -->\r\n<!-- ‚úçÔ∏è-->\r\nAngular CLI: 9.0.2\r\nNode: 12.16.0\r\nOS: win32 x64\r\n\r\nAngular: 9.0.1\r\n... animations, common, compiler, compiler-cli, core, forms\r\n... language-service, platform-browser, platform-browser-dynamic\r\n... router\r\nIvy Workspace: Yes\r\n\r\nPackage                           Version\r\n-----------------------------------------------------------\r\n@angular-devkit/architect         0.900.3\r\n@angular-devkit/build-angular     0.900.3\r\n@angular-devkit/build-optimizer   0.900.3\r\n@angular-devkit/build-webpack     0.900.3\r\n@angular-devkit/core              9.0.3\r\n@angular-devkit/schematics        9.0.2\r\n@angular/cli                      9.0.2\r\n@angular/http                     7.2.16\r\n@ngtools/webpack                  9.0.3\r\n@schematics/angular               9.0.2\r\n@schematics/update                0.900.2\r\nrxjs                              6.5.4\r\ntypescript                        3.7.5\r\nwebpack                           4.41.2\r\n</code></pre>\r\n\r\n**Anything else relevant?**\r\nI really didnt know if i should post this in ng-packagr or angular. so please forgive me if i mistakenly posted in here.\r\n","Url":"https://github.com/angular/angular-cli/issues/17078","RelatedDescription":"Open issue \"ERROR in Symbol RouterOutlet declared in router.d.ts is not exported from @angular/router\" (#17078)"},{"Id":"570419844","IsPullRequest":false,"CreatedAt":"2020-02-25T10:06:24","Actor":"MartinM25","Number":"17076","RawContent":null,"Title":"ng new error","State":"closed","Body":"ENOENT: no such file or directory, mkdir error shown when  i try to create a new angular project","Url":"https://github.com/angular/angular-cli/issues/17076","RelatedDescription":"Closed issue \"ng new error\" (#17076)"},{"Id":"570354800","IsPullRequest":false,"CreatedAt":"2020-02-25T07:00:52","Actor":"anton-gorbikov","Number":"17070","RawContent":null,"Title":"Differential loading produces ES5 for new Edge with Yarn","State":"open","Body":"# üêû Bug report\r\n\r\n### Command (mark with an `x`)\r\n- [ ] new\r\n- [x] build\r\n- [ ] serve\r\n- [ ] test\r\n- [ ] e2e\r\n- [ ] generate\r\n- [ ] add\r\n- [ ] update\r\n- [ ] lint\r\n- [ ] xi18n\r\n- [ ] run\r\n- [ ] config\r\n- [ ] help\r\n- [ ] version\r\n- [ ] doc\r\n\r\n### Is this a regression?\r\nNo\r\n\r\n\r\n### Description\r\nDepending on package manager (NPM or Yarn) Angular CLI treats Edge 79/80 as ES2015 (NPM) or ES5 (Yarn) compatible browser.\r\n\r\n## üî¨ Minimal Reproduction\r\n1.

Since the array has objects with a property `type`, I added those types as CSS classes and tried to add them dynamically using `[ngClass]`. However, these dynamically generated classes behave differently than when I'm setting them as \"regular\" CSS classes.\r\n\r\nThis is what happens, when I set the classes dynamically:\r\n\r\n[![The placeholder and the elements in the `dropList` overlap][1]][1]\r\n\r\nThe placeholder and the elements in the `dropList` overlap. Here's the relevant code:\r\n\r\n`example.component.ts`\r\n```typescript\r\ncontentItems: ContentItem[] = [\r\n  { type: 'text', /* more props */ },\r\n  { type: 'text', /* more props */ },\r\n  { type: 'image', /* more props */ }\r\n];\r\n```\r\n`example.component.html`\r\n```html\r\n<div *ngFor=\"let item of contentItems\" class=\"editor-item\" cdkDrag>\r\n  <div [ngClass]=\"['dropzone-placeholder', item.type]\" *cdkDragPlaceholder>\r\n    <p>{{ 'EDITOR.INSERT HERE' | translate }}</p>\r\n  </div>\r\n\r\n  <app-language-tab-editor *ngIf=\"item.type === 'text'\"></app-language-tab-editor>\r\n  <app-image-upload *ngIf=\"item.type === 'image'\"></app-image-upload>\r\n</div>\r\n```\r\n`example.component.scss`\r\n```scss\r\n$dropzone-placeholder-dark: #00973B;\r\n$dropzone-placeholder-light: #00973B0D;\r\n$text-placeholder-height: 135px;\r\n$image-placeholder-height: 375px;\r\n\r\n.dropzone-placeholder {\r\n  border: 1px dashed $dropzone-placeholder-dark;\r\n  color: $dropzone-placeholder-dark;\r\n  background: $dropzone-placeholder-light;\r\n\r\n  &.text {\r\n    height: $text-placeholder-height;\r\n  }\r\n\r\n  &.image {\r\n    height: $image-placeholder-height;\r\n  }\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nI currently only have two different types, but the goal is to make it easily expandable to add more later on. I have also already tried to instead use `class=\"dropzone-placeholder {{ item.type }}\"` as well as `[class]=\"'dropzone-placeholder ' + item.type\"`, to no avail.\r\n\r\nAfter further testing I have also found out, that it generally doesn't work using `[ngClass]`, even if we don't use a variable. Using `[ngClass]=\"['dropzone-placeholder', 'text']\"` didn't work either.\r\n\r\nThis is the expected behaviour:\r\n\r\n[![The placeholder and the elements in the `dropList` don't overlap and are instead placed properly below each other][2]][2]\r\n\r\nThe placeholder and the elements in the `dropList` don't overlap and are instead placed properly below each other.

Approach 1 is not viable because it requires developers to maintain a list of all used icons. Alternatively all icons could be added manually. This is an improvement over the sprite as users only download the used icons. The downside is that still all icon \"metadata\" has to be included in the app, even if 95% of icons are not used.\r\n\r\nThe ultimate goal would be to only include the icons in the build that are actually used. But it would be sufficient if the webapp (as seen from the user) only downloads the necessary icons (and metadata), even if the build includes all icons. Having the option to configure a directory for a svg icon set (where each icon resides as a single svg file) would solve this issue. An icon defined as `<mat-icon svgIcon=\"foo\"></mat-icon>` would look up the icon `foo.svg` in the configured directory.\r\n\r\n**Current configuration of an SVG icon set:**\r\n\r\n```ts\r\n// Approach 1: either add all icons individually\r\nfor (...) {\r\n  matIconRegistry.addSvgIcon('foo', domSanitizer.bypassSecurityTrustResourceUrl('foo.svg'));\r\n}\r\n\r\n// Approach 2: or the icon set\r\nmatIconRegistry.addSvgIconSet(domSanitizer.bypassSecurityTrustResourceUrl('foo-set.svg'));\r\n```\r\n\r\n**Desired configuration:**\r\n```ts\r\n// Approach 3\r\nmatIconRegistry.addSvgIconSetWithPath('/assets/icons/');\r\n```\r\n\r\n#### Use Case\r\n\r\nThe primary goal is to reduce the size of the app the user loads. Popular svg sprites are large and most of those items are not used in apps.\r\n\r\nAdding icons individually (approach 1) works, but requires to maintain a list of all *used* icons or having a list of all possible icons (e.g. a string array of icon names) which again adds unnecessary data that has to be downloaded.\r\n\r\nThere should be a third approach that solves the issue and only actually loads the icons and metadata that are used by an app.","Url":"https://github.com/angular/components/issues/18607","RelatedDescription":"Open issue \"feat(MatIconRegistry): \"Wildcard-URL\" support for svg icon sets\" (#18607)"},{"Id":"570373234","IsPullRequest":false,"CreatedAt":"2020-02-25T07:44:16","Actor":"akunaatrium","Number":"18606","RawContent":null,"Title":"Undocumented attributes - mat-subheader, mat-line, mat-list-icon","State":"open","Body":"I am looking at the example source code of List component on this page: https://material.angular.io/components/list/examples and am a bit confused as to where some of the used attributes come from.\r\n\r\nThe example looks like this:\r\n```\r\n<mat-list>\r\n  <h3 mat-subheader>Folders</h3>\r\n  <mat-list-item *ngFor=\"let folder of folders\">\r\n    <mat-icon mat-list-icon>folder</mat-icon>\r\n    <h4 mat-line>{{folder.name}}</h4>\r\n    <p mat-line> {{folder.updated | date}} </p>\r\n  </mat-list-item>\r\n  <mat-divider></mat-divider>\r\n  <h3 mat-subheader>Notes</h3>\r\n  <mat-list-item *ngFor=\"let note of notes\">\r\n    <mat-icon mat-list-icon>note</mat-icon>\r\n    <h4 mat-line>{{note.name}}</h4>\r\n    <p mat-line> {{note.updated | date}} </p>\r\n  </mat-list-item>\r\n</mat-list>\r\n```\r\n\r\nI can't find documentation about the `mat-subheader` attribute used in the example, as well as `mat-line` and `mat-list-icon`.
