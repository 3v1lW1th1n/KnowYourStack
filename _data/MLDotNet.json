It learns a model to categorize a document into `n` topics, and outputs an n-dimensional topic vector for each document, with scores for the document belonging to each topic.\r\n```\r\nTopic1  Topic2  Topic3\r\n0.6364  0.2727  0.0909\r\n0.5455  0.1818  0.2727\r\n```\r\nThere are two use cases for this:\r\n\r\n1. Use the topic vector as a featurizer for a trainer.\r\n2. Predict which topic a document belongs to directly from the LDA model, for example \"Cat related\", \"Dog related\", \"Tech news\", etc.\r\n\r\n(1) works fine as is, but (2) has usability issues related to interpretibility of the learned topics. The topic vector doesn't actually name the topics so it is not possible to tell what a topic actually is.\r\n\r\nLDA has a parameter `numberOfSummaryTermsPerTopic`, which in theory is supposed to provide a list of most important terms for each topic. These terms would identify what a topic learned by the model actually is. However, there is no way to get this summary from the model currently, as the model parameters are not exposed, and is therefore misleading the user into thinking that this is possible.\r\n\r\nIt used to be accessible in the old PigSty API (#1411) but that has since been removed. It was also present in TLC as a text file in the model.zip, which wasn't a particularly user friendly way anyway https://github.com/dotnet/machinelearning/issues/4322#issuecomment-572333759. This should be made accessible to the user by extracting the parameters from `LdaState` https://github.com/dotnet/machinelearning/issues/1411#issue-374603754.\r\n\r\nMain issue containing the discussion: #4322 \r\nDuplicate issues with the same ask: #1411 #2197 #3092 #4328 #4735 \r\n\r\n## P2: Export Full Model\r\nNew feature request: #3092 \r\n\r\nThis ask is to expose more model parameters than just topic word summary.\r\n\r\n## P2: Seeded LDA\r\nNew feature request: #4143 \r\n\r\nSeed each topic with a list of words, which will make the topic words converge in that direction.

This works great and my notebooks can run most ML.NET demos without any trouble.\r\n\r\nI am now buildingt a C# Jupyter notebook that demonstrates the object detection capabilities of the ML.NET library.
