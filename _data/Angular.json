This can happen if code\r\nwill be generated by tools automatically. e.g. TSC generating decorator helpers, or\r\nrollup creating bundles of multiple files (there will be boilerplate to merge multiple\r\nfiles into a bundle). These bytes do not originate from any source-file and therefore\r\nare \"unmapped\". Read more about 1-variable length segments in the [source-map spec](https://sourcemaps.info/spec.html)\r\n\r\nIn the current state of Terser where unmapped bytes are mapped to\r\nrandom source-files, size tracking tools are not able to determine\r\naccurate payload size contribution numbers of individual source-files,\r\nnor do the broken source-maps help with debugging Angular packages\r\nas some bytes are incorrectly mapping to a wrong file (this is not a\r\nbig deal though as the generated code is not likely to be debugged).\r\n\r\nFor context why we try to fix the terser bug on our side now: A PR\r\nto fix this bug on the terser side has been submitted but it had to\r\nbe reverted due to a bug in the latest `mozilla/source-map` library.\r\nTerser reverted the fix that hit the bug in `mozilla/source-map` as\r\nthey wanted to unblock consumers that use the latest `source-map`\r\npackage.

The problem is that all requests that match what is in the cache end up going to the network no matter what.  \r\n\r\nAfter spending a lot of time debugging the ngsw-worker.js that angular generates, I found that all requests that where being checked by `cache.match` where not found.  The reason for that is the headers of the requests coming from my app were a little different than the request headers stored in cache.  Specifically the `referrer-policy` header is different.  The incoming request has the header set to `Referrer Policy: no-referrer-when-downgrade` but the header for the matching request in cache is `Referrer Policy: unsafe-url`.\r\n\r\nOne way I proved that this was the issue was by using the `cache.match()` options flag `ignoreVary: true` to ignore header differences.  After making that change my app's service worker pulled all in scope assets from cache and didn't go to the network.  Because the `ngsw-worker.js` is generated I don't think modifying it is a valid option.\r\n\r\nI dug deeper to see why the request headers where being mismatched.  What I found was that the request that is being put in to cache `cache.put(req, res)` is accurate, but when you immediately pull that same request from cache the headers are changed.  There is something that happens when executing `cache.put()` that modifies the request headers and I am not sure what.\r\n\r\nIs there anything from an angular service worker configuration that would cause this?  Would it be possible to update the generated service worker to use the `ignoreVary` option when checking for matches in cache?\r\n\r\n## 🔬 Minimal Reproduction\r\n<!--\r\nPlease create and share minimal reproduction of the issue starting with this template: https://stackblitz.com/fork/angular-issue-repro2\r\n-->\r\n<!-- ✍️--> https://stackblitz.com/...\r\n\r\n<!--\r\nIf StackBlitz is not suitable for reproduction of your issue, please create a minimal GitHub repository with the reproduction of the issue.\r\nA good way to make a minimal reproduction is to create a new app via `ng new repro-app` and add the minimum possible code to show the problem. \r\nShare the link to the repo below along with step-by-step instructions to reproduce the problem, as well as expected and actual behavior.\r\n\r\nIssues that don't have enough info and can't be reproduced will be closed.\r\n\r\nYou can read more about issue submission guidelines here: https://github.com/angular/angular/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md#-submitting-an-issue\r\n-->\r\n\r\nTo reproduce this just execute the two statements below in a browser console and compare the request objects.\r\n\r\ncaches.open('exampleTest1').then(cache => {var newreq = new Request(\"https://www.google.com\"); console.log('NEW REQUEST: ', newreq); cache.put(newreq, new Response('hello'))})\r\n\r\ncaches.open('exampleTest1').then(res => res.keys().then(keys => console.log(keys)))\r\n\r\n## 🔥 Exception or Error\r\n<pre><code>\r\n<!-- If the issue is accompanied by an exception or an error, please share it below: -->\r\n<!-- ✍️-->\r\n\r\n</code></pre>\r\n\r\n\r\n## 🌍  Your Environment\r\n\r\n**Angular Version:**\r\n<pre><code>\r\n<!-- run `ng version` and paste output below -->\r\n<!-- ✍️-->\r\n    _                      _                 ____ _     ___\r\n    / \\   _ __   __ _ _   _| | __ _ _ __     / ___| |   |_ _|\r\n   / △ \\ | '_ \\ / _` | | | | |/ _` | '__|   | |   | |    | |\r\n  / ___ \\| | | | (_| | |_| | | (_| | |      | |___| |___ | |\r\n /_/   \\_\\_| |_|\\__, |\\__,_|_|\\__,_|_|       \\____|_____|___|\r\n                |___/\r\n    \r\n\r\nAngular CLI: 8.2.0\r\nNode: 10.15.3\r\nOS: darwin x64\r\nAngular: 8.2.0\r\n... animations, cli, common, compiler, compiler-cli, core, forms\r\n... language-service, platform-browser, platform-browser-dynamic\r\n... router, service-worker, upgrade\r\n\r\nPackage                           Version\r\n-----------------------------------------------------------\r\n@angular-devkit/architect         0.800.0\r\n@angular-devkit/build-angular     0.800.0\r\n@angular-devkit/build-optimizer   0.800.0\r\n@angular-devkit/build-webpack     0.800.0\r\n@angular-devkit/core              8.2.0\r\n@angular-devkit/schematics        8.2.0\r\n@angular/pwa                      0.12.4\r\n@ngtools/webpack                  8.0.0\r\n@schematics/angular               8.2.0\r\n@schematics/update                0.802.0\r\nrxjs                              6.5.2\r\ntypescript                        3.5.3\r\nwebpack                           4.34.0\r\n</code></pre>\r\n\r\n**Anything else relevant?**\r\n<!-- ✍️Is this a browser specific issue?

I'm thinking about an approach similar to the approach Karma uses, where you can use e.g. the [teamcity reporter](https://github.com/karma-runner/karma-teamcity-reporter).\r\n\r\nProblem is that I don't know if this is possible, because I don't know if webpack offers the possibility to do something like this. \r\n\r\n### Other solution\r\nOptionally provide build output in some machine readable format like JSON or XML.\r\n","Url":"https://github.com/angular/angular-cli/issues/15408","RelatedDescription":"Open issue \"Use custom error reporter\" (#15408)"},{"Id":"483776613","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2019-08-22T05:24:16","Actor":"renovate-bot","Number":"15407","RawContent":null,"Title":"build: update stylus to version 0.54.7","State":"open","Body":"This PR contains the following updates:\n\n| Package | Type | Update | Change |\n|---|---|---|---|\n| [stylus](https://togithub.com/stylus/stylus) | dependencies | patch | [`0.54.6` -> `0.54.7`](https://renovatebot.com/diffs/npm/stylus/0.54.6/0.54.7) |\n\n---\n\n### Release Notes\n\n<details>\n<summary>stylus/stylus</summary>\n\n### [`v0.54.7`](https://togithub.com/stylus/stylus/compare/0.54.6...0.54.7)\n\n[Compare Source](https://togithub.com/stylus/stylus/compare/0.54.6...0.54.7)\n\n</details>\n\n---\n\n### Renovate configuration\n\n:date: **Schedule**: \"after 10pm every weekday,before 4am every weekday,every weekend\" in timezone America/Tijuana.\n\n:vertical_traffic_light: **Automerge**: Disabled by config.

The problem is the text behind it when the tooltip is disabled is not selectable.\r\n\r\nWork around I guess would be to have two divs for this text for example one with tooltip one without but this is very annoying to have to do.\r\n\r\n#### Actual Behavior\r\n\r\nWhat behavior did you actually see?\r\nText is not highlightable/selectable.\r\n","Url":"https://github.com/angular/components/issues/16850","RelatedDescription":"Open issue \"Tooltip usability bug when disabling it\" (#16850)"},{"Id":"484268192","IsPullRequest":false,"CreatedAt":"2019-08-22T23:59:49","Actor":"classicmike","Number":"16849","RawContent":null,"Title":"FEATURE REQUEST: Move Material Components' styleUrls to a global stylesheet similar to traditional CSS.","State":"open","Body":"#### Bug, feature request, or proposal:\r\nI would like to propose the moving of all styles declared in Angular Material's Components' styleUrl property to be moved to a global stylesheet that users import manually through many means such as ```style``` tag, ```@import``` etc...\r\n\r\n#### What is the expected behavior?\r\nThe expected behavior is that I do NOT want angular material to load any default styles through the ```styleUrls``` property of the component and rather load it via a global stylesheet. \r\n\r\nThat way if I am prepared to take responsibility on the consequences of not loading any of those default styles I can do it without having to resort to class overriding or other techniques.\r\n\r\n#### What is the current behavior?\r\n\r\nJust so you have a perspective, my colleagues are consuming components such as Angular Material's ```MatFormField``` with ```matInput``` directives mainly for the purposes of using the functionality to do things such as showing validation errors, showing hint text of the number of characters remaining inside of a text field etc. However, ```MatFormField``` component injects the following CSS in its style urls:\r\n\r\nBelow fragment taken from https://github.com/angular/components/blob/master/src/material/form-field/form-field.ts\r\n\r\n```\r\nstyleUrls: [\r\n    'form-field.css',\r\n    'form-field-fill.css',\r\n    'form-field-input.css',\r\n    'form-field-legacy.css',\r\n    'form-field-outline.css',\r\n    'form-field-standard.css',\r\n  ]\r\n```\r\n\r\n#### What are the steps to reproduce?\r\nSimply look at this file and the class ```MatFormField``` in https://github.com/angular/components/blob/master/src/material/form-field/form-field.ts\r\n\r\n#### What is the use-case or motivation for changing an existing behavior?\r\nMy colleagues wish to use Angular Material mainly for the reason it takes care of most of the javascript functionality required without having to write their own code to do the same thing. \r\n\r\nHowever, we have our own CSS framework which has stylings exactly to our organisation's needs and I feel that the need to import Angular Material's CSS that are embedded through a component's ```styleUrls``` property simply adds bloat and maintenance burden we simply don't need.\r\n\r\nJust so you have a perspective, my colleagues are consuming components such as Angular Material's ```MatFormField``` with ```matInput``` directives mainly for the purposes of using the functionality to do things such as showing validation errors, showing hint text of the number of characters remaining inside of a text field etc. However, ```MatFormField``` component injects the following CSS in its style urls:\r\n\r\nBelow fragment taken from https://github.com/angular/components/blob/master/src/material/form-field/form-field.ts\r\n\r\n```\r\nstyleUrls: [\r\n    'form-field.css',\r\n    'form-field-fill.css',\r\n    'form-field-input.css',\r\n    'form-field-legacy.css',\r\n    'form-field-outline.css',\r\n    'form-field-standard.css',\r\n  ]\r\n```\r\nThe big kick in the gut is that because we have our own CSS that can take care of the look and feel of the some of these components but we are forced to firstly cancel out all of the CSS that is used in Angular material first before we can proceed to style our own thing. Furthermore, since we are not intending to use what is provided by Angular Material out of the box in terms of CSS styling, it's better that we might as well not include it all.\r\n\r\nFurthermore, in terms of the form field component, you guys are not using any form of ```ViewEncapsulation``` at all, so apart from loading order of the CSS files, it doesn't make much of a difference to a global stylesheet, so I feel this request is not unreasonable.\r\n\r\nI feel the people in my team are experienced enough in CSS that I feel we can take responsibility for our own actions of what happens there.\r\n\r\nSo basically we want to use your JS functionality but give us the option not to use your CSS and allow us the freedom and responsibility to maintain the look and feel ourselves. :)\r\n\r\n#### Which versions of Angular, Material, OS, TypeScript, browsers are affected?\r\nI'm going to make the assumption of all versions of Angular Material that can be consumed in Angular 2 onwards since this is a conscious code structure decision made by the Angular Material team.

When focus shifts from child element 1 to child element 2, the `blur` event on child element 1 is captured first. The design is that this `blur` event does not result in a `null` value on the subject, because the focus monitor will see that the [event's `relatedTarget`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/FocusEvent/relatedTarget) (the element that's about to take the focus) is also a child of our parent element, [and take no further action](https://github.com/angular/components/blob/2d976a92429ed37a89bfa9ee74b479b48c7ac40d/src/cdk/a11y/focus-monitor/focus-monitor.ts#L375).\r\n> \r\n> However, IE does not set the `relatedTarget` on `focus` or `blur` events, so the focus monitor can't know that focus is not leaving the parent element, and so we get a `null` value on the subject.\r\n\r\nThe solution here is to listen for the `focusin` and `focusout` events instead, where IE _does_ set the `relatedTarget` correctly (along with all other browsers). Other than this, there are some differences between the two sets of events:\r\n\r\n- `focusin` and `focusout` support bubbling, where `focus` and `blur` do not - I don't think this makes any difference for our use case, as we are explicitly using capture mode anyway\r\n- `focusin` and `focusout` fire _after_ their counterparts `focus` and `blur` - it's theoretically possible the some users may be relying on an order of events, but given there's no documentation that spells out when the focus monitor emits in relation to, say, model changes, I don't think it should be considered a breaking change\r\n\r\n(I've not been able to run the full test suite on Windows due to #16632, and linting on Windows is a non-starter because of line breaks, so I'll be testing properly on my Mac later)","Url":"https://github.com/angular/components/pull/16840","RelatedDescription":"Open PR \"fix FocusMonitor issue in IE by switching to focusin and focusout events\" (#16840)"},{"Id":"483647705","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2019-08-21T22:19:23","Actor":"mmalerba","Number":"16839","RawContent":null,"Title":"feat(cdk/testing): allow `preventDefault` on mouse events","State":"closed","Body":"","Url":"https://github.com/angular/components/pull/16839","RelatedDescription":"Closed or merged PR \"feat(cdk/testing): allow `preventDefault` on mouse events\" (#16839)"},{"Id":"483573597","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2019-08-21T22:01:00","Actor":"devversion","Number":"16837","RawContent":null,"Title":"build: create individual bazel targets for dev-app demos","State":"closed","Body":"Creates individual bazel targets for dev-app demos in favor of speeding\r\nup development with Bazel.\r\n\r\nBlocked on #16829 ","Url":"https://github.com/angular/components/pull/16837","RelatedDescription":"Closed or merged PR \"build: create individual bazel targets for dev-app demos\" (#16837)"},{"Id":"483638082","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2019-08-21T20:57:38","Actor":"josephperrott","Number":"16838","RawContent":null,"Title":"fix: update all files/directories owned by DevInfra to DevInfra alias","State":"closed","Body":"","Url":"https://github.com/angular/components/pull/16838","RelatedDescription":"Closed or merged PR \"fix: update all files/directories owned by DevInfra to DevInfra alias\" (#16838)"},{"Id":"482934519","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2019-08-21T20:53:51","Actor":"josephperrott","Number":"16827","RawContent":null,"Title":"cleanup(select): remove runtime checkbox padding calculation workaround","State":"closed","Body":"","Url":"https://github.com/angular/components/pull/16827","RelatedDescription":"Closed or merged PR \"cleanup(select): remove runtime checkbox padding calculation workaround\" (#16827)"},{"Id":"482535150","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2019-08-21T20:53:43","Actor":"kor-k","Number":"16820","RawContent":null,"Title":"refactor(mdc-chips): Make MatChipTextControl publically available.","State":"closed","Body":"Make the MatChipTextControl class available for implementation by other classes, so input fields other than input elements - eg. custom divs - can be used with mat-chip-grid (which currently assumes a matChipInputFor <input> is provided).","Url":"https://github.com/angular/components/pull/16820","RelatedDescription":"Closed or merged PR \"refactor(mdc-chips): Make MatChipTextControl publically available.\" (#16820)"},{"Id":"483030091","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2019-08-21T20:38:20","Actor":"devversion","Number":"16829","RawContent":null,"Title":"build: serve dev-app with bazel","State":"closed","Body":"* Serves the dev-app with Bazel using `ts_devserver` (windows\r\ncompatible since\r\nhttps://github.com/bazelbuild/rules_typescript/commit/4155687a91d84eb550fa52d25f792c002e645edc)\r\n* Serves dev-app with AOT mode 💯 \r\n* ibazel can be used for watch-mode and live-reloading\r\n\r\nCurrently due to limitations within the `ts_devserver` rule, livereloading with ibazel is not\r\nworking.
