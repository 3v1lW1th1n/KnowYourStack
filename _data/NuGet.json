Worst case randomly thrown together in a big folder. One of my clients has about 1.7GB in external dependencies in their TFVC repo. I'd like to get rid of that as part of the migration.\r\n\r\nIdeally I'd move the bulk of these dependencies to nuget packages, remove as many transient ones as possible and purge them prior to moving the client to git.\r\n\r\nThe little-known `T:some-type-in-assembly` query API is helpful, but it doesn't help me find the right version of the package. it may also give me a lot of options to choose from. \r\n\r\nIdeally I'd pass in a fully-qualified-assembly-name, that should narrow down the selection substantially.

Unzip [SomeOther.zip](https://github.com/NuGet/Home/files/4430294/SomeOther.zip)\r\n2. Place SomeOther.config in %APPDATA%\\NuGet.

On uninstall this file would be deleted.\r\n\r\nWe considered two alternatives which I mentioned as workarounds above:\r\n1. Require SDK installers to drop config files in %ProgramFiles(x86)%\\NuGet\\Config instead. However, we've gotten feedback from control vendors that they would like the option of installing without elevation which prevents the installer from being able to write to this directory.\r\n2. Require SDK installers to modify the one %APPDATA%\\NuGet\\NuGet.config file.
