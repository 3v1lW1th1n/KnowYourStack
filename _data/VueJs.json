It appears that it does not respect key names for transitions -- it mangles it to includes its own prefix (`__transition-${this._uid}-` + myKey) , which is subject to change if a prop changes.  This appears to have been on-purpose (it literally checks to make sure it's using the internal prefix).  I consider this a bug, as it causes a full re-render of the transitioned vnode if all I want to do is change the exit transition class.  \r\n\r\nFor example, I might have a \"stack\" of pages that slide to the left to exit when going forward, or to the right to enter if going backwards; otherwise no animation.  So the transition depends on what the user is doing.

I think the reason why @posva wasn't able to reproduce it is he may have used the param as part of the path, which does cause this issue not to happen.  But params aren't always used in the path, sometimes the params are used as props for the component (https://router.vuejs.org/guide/essentials/passing-props.html#boolean-mode). \r\n\r\nI would also like to re-propose the same solution that some others have suggested in the comments of the other issues of adding an option to turn off NavigationDuplicated errors entirely.  It's clear that NavigationDuplicated errors aren't wanted by a large number of Vue-Router users.  If the option to turn off NavigationDuplicated errors isn't enabled by default, adding that option wouldn't be a breaking change, so that can be implemented in the current 3.x versions without waiting for 4.x.\r\n\r\n<!-- generated by vue-issues.

So, the question becomes: how do I pass props to the router-link button? There does not currently seem to be a direct way to do this.\r\n\r\n## Solution 2: Why not just **Wrap** the Button in a router-link?\r\nexample:\r\n```\r\n<router-link tag='div' >\r\n    <ui-button color=\"primary\" />\r\n</router-link>\r\n```\r\nThis has a few drawbacks. When using a button from a library, the button can have margins or may change css-properties such as `align-self: flex-start`. When the button is wrapped, this can obviously cause problems and makes the library not behave as intended: clicking the margin of a button should not activate the button. In addition to that, the default router-link tag is the anchor tag, which means the user must go learn about the `tag` property and change it, lest they want all of their buttons to have underlined text. This is not an ideal programmer experience.\r\n\r\n## Solution 3: Why not use **$router** ?\r\nexample: `<ui-button @click=\"()=>$router.push('about')\" />`\r\n\r\nThis does not behave the same as an href or router-link. For example, router-links can be opened in a new tab by pressing CMD/CTRL   CLICK, however that behavior doesn't happen on an `@click` like the one above. This is generally a tell-tale sign of a poorly coded SPA site and is not an ideal user experience. However, making it an ideal user experience requires a non-ideal developer experience.\r\n\r\n## Solution 4: Why not create a **custom component** wrapper?\r\nexample: `<router-link tag='custom-button'>`\r\n\r\nThis would work, except for when the button needs the page name or other parent-dependent data to be passed as an attribute/property. Even if this did work, the bulkiness of this solution is problematic. Making a component redirect is incredibly basic functionality. Requiring an the creation of a wrapper component, registering it, and then attaching it to the router-link is a disproportional amount of work for such a straightforward goal.\r\n\r\n## Solution 5: Why not use href?\r\nexample: `<ui-button href='page-route' />`\r\n\r\nThis circumvents the process, which makes page-transition animations and other aspects fail.\r\n\r\n## Solution 6: Why not use the **slots API**?\r\n\r\nexample:\r\n```\r\n<router-link to=\"/about\" v-slot=\"{ href, route, navigate}\">\r\n    <ui-button :href=\"href\" @click=\"navigate\" color=\"primary\" style=\"text\" :text=\"route.name\" />\r\n</router-link>\r\n```\r\nThis is now my current solution, and is likely the best solution. However, the documentation describes the slots API as  \"advanced\", \"low-level customization\", that is \"primarily for library authors\".  Requiring devs to dive all the way into the most advanced features just for a button click is not a good experience. The slots API is very extensive, so if this was advertised as the default method of creating router-links then this likely wouldn't be as much of an issue.\r\n\r\n## What is the *final* issue?\r\nThis is a common task, with 5 separate unintuitive ways to poorly accomplish it, an one relatively hidden advanced but good solution. Ideally there would be one obvious standardized ideal way. As a developer, I feel like I am required to become Vue-Router expert just to make a button redirect to a new page. This is very discouraging for anyone trying to adopt the framework. \r\n\r\n#### Reference\r\nThere is a question [here](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/45638239/enclosing-a-router-link-tag-in-a-button-in-vuejs) that provides evidence of many of the challenges people have with this.\r\n\r\n\r\n# What does the proposed API look  like?\r\n### Overview\r\n\r\nThe ideal solution would be to create a universal `v-href` and `v-route` property for all components similar to the way Vue handles `@click` on existing components. \r\n<br>For example `<ui-button v-href='page.location' />`.\r\nThis is consistent with Vue's goal of keeping the API small and intuitively close to the Javascript/HTML counterparts that developers are already familiar with.\r\n\r\n### Context\r\nThis will likely require Vue itself (and not just Vue-Router) to change. This would be designed as a full replacement of `router-link` component, with the intention of eventually deprecating router-link.\r\n\r\n### Details\r\nThe API for the `v-href` property would be identical to the current router-link \"`to`\" property. All additional prop functionality of `router-link` would be handled through an object on the `v-route` property. This would behave identically to how a router-link would behave, if the router-link were given both a `tag` property and (somehow) was able to pass properties/attributes to that tag.\r\n\r\nFurther implementation details will need to be discussed to ensure the intended behavior is fully defined.\r\n\r\n<!-- generated by vue-issues.

However I'd still like to ask to reconsider this change and not reject for duplicated navigations.\r\n\r\nThe main arguments I would put into consideration against treating `NavigationDuplicated` as an error are:\r\n\r\n- Not rejecting is more consistent with how `<a>` tags and `<router-link>` are working, i. e. I'd argue it is the API that is least surprising to users of `vue-router` because it is how browsers usually work.\r\n- A client can already find out if a duplication is happening by looking at the current route and the push target if this functionality is desired. While this might be slightly more complicated for that use-case,  the changed API puts a burden on all clients that don't care about the duplication, which is IMHO the more common case.\r\n- It essentially seems not possible anymore to call `push` without an attached `catch` because otherwise we might get irrelevant error logs, i. e. the API is now always (albeit minimally) more complex.\r\n- Introducing the rejection was effectively a breaking change of the API for a lot of clients.

reproduce\r\nSince version 3.1.0 there is a 'fix' which I consider a regression.  \"Errors thrown inside action subscribers no longer cause the entire action to fail.\"\r\n\r\n1) Create an action subscriber\r\n\r\n2) throw an error in the subscriber\r\n\r\n3) --> action is performed regardless of exception\r\n\r\n\r\n### What is expected?\r\nWhen an error is thrown in an action subscriber, I expect the action to be interrupted and the exception to bubble up to the caller.\r\n\r\n### What is actually happening?\r\nThe exception is quietly swallowed.\r\nAlso seems i cannot catch the exception.\r\n\r\n\r\n---\r\nIm not sure you can revert to the old behaviour since other users might be dependent on this silent swallowing (though I fail to see why anyone would like such behaviour :-) ... fail early and never ignore exceptions.)\r\nIf it cant be reverted, it would be nice to be able to interrupt the action flow by some other mechanism.\r\n\r\nI use this as part of validation/permission framework to prevent user in UI to perform actions shes not allowed to do. Of course this is checked in backend also, but user feedback can be given quicker and easier this way and it does not require implementation in every action - only in the subscriber.\r\n\r\n<!-- generated by vue-issues.
