If further fixes many (but not all) issues flagged by\r\nstatic code analysis.\r\n\r\nFor easier reference, the existing `WmlComparer` class is temporarily retained in the `OpenXmlPowerTools.Previous` namespace. For organizational purposes, the refactored version is stored in the`Comparer` folder, which does however not create a namespace.\r\n\r\nThe objective of this commit is to not create breaking changes. The one exception is the removal of the internal `WmlComparer.Coalesce` method, which was only invoked in one unit test. This is deemed a left-over from previous rewrites and is thus removed. The unit test is commented out for now.\r\n\r\nThis pull request essentially prepares the `WmlComparer` for future enhancements."},{"Id":"8479146581","Type":"IssuesEvent","CreatedAt":"2018-10-25T09:47:40","Actor":"liugt34","Repository":"OfficeDev/Open-Xml-PowerTools","Organization":"OfficeDev","RawContent":null,"RelatedAction":"opened","RelatedUrl":"https://github.com/OfficeDev/Open-Xml-PowerTools/issues/259","RelatedDescription":"Opened issue \"when i convert a docx to html ,the format is wrong\" (#259) at OfficeDev/Open-Xml-PowerTools","RelatedBody":"this is the docx\r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/8056013/47491442-6c0b6d80-d87d-11e8-81df-fa9f8da35a5d.png)\r\n\r\nthis is the html converted\r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/8056013/47491484-7f1e3d80-d87d-11e8-8a81-539d3f51dd41.png)\r\n\r\ni find the css width  is to samll ,only 0.5in\r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/8056013/47491710-fce24900-d87d-11e8-94ff-1fa09a86bfe2.png)\r\n\r\nthis is the docx file\r\n[010111.docx](https://github.com/OfficeDev/Open-Xml-PowerTools/files/2514264/010111.docx)\r\n\r\nso how can i do the right work!\r\n\r\n"}],"ResultType":"GitHubEvent"}},"RunOn":"2018-11-07T05:30:40.7449954Z","RunDurationInMilliseconds":1463}
