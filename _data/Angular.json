The expected behavior is that after opening `<second-component>` the first one should be completely destroyed as far as all subscriptions are unsubscribed and listener dispose function was invoked as well. But actual behavior is that FirstComponent is still in the memory heap. If we switch between first and second component several times - several instances of FirstComponent are hanging in the heap that is memory leak, especially noticeable if component is huge.\r\n\r\nOn the screen below you can see that FirstComponent instance retains in memory because of DebugElement__PRE_R3__(corresponds to `demo-app`) still keeps listeners that added by Renderer2.listen before. And every listener keep reference to callback, and callback keeps reference to FirstComponent.\r\n\r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/6919053/51522811-44578180-1e3b-11e9-9664-b734d16771fa.png)\r\n\r\n\r\n## üî¨ Minimal Reproduction\r\n<!--\r\nPlease create and share minimal reproduction of the issue starting with this template: https://stackblitz.com/fork/angular-issue-repro2\r\n-->\r\nWorking example is available here:\r\nhttps://stackblitz.com/edit/angular-renderer-listen-for-parent\r\n\r\n<!--\r\nIf StackBlitz is not suitable for reproduction of your issue, please create a minimal GitHub repository with the reproduction of the issue.
