I've boiled down the problem into the simplest, smallest set of code that still reproduces the issue itself, so here it is. \r\n\r\nThere seems to be a clash when invoking `.Value` on an `IOptionsSnapshot` object if the objects are targeting different .Net versions. It only reproduces in certain cases, and the error message is extremely strange. \r\n\r\n# The Class Library (netstandard1.3)\r\n\r\nThe set up is as follows. I have a .Net Standard 1.3 class library. It has a reference to `Microsoft.Extensions.Options.ConfigurationExtensions` (1.1.2). For the sake of example, I've boiled down the code to this. Here is the entire content of this class library:\r\n\r\n```csharp\r\nusing Microsoft.Extensions.Configuration;\r\nusing Microsoft.Extensions.DependencyInjection;\r\nusing Microsoft.Extensions.Options;\r\n\r\npublic static class OptionsExtensions\r\n{\r\n\tpublic static void AddSnapshotConfig<T>(this IServiceCollection services, IConfiguration configuration)\r\n\t\twhere T : class, new()\r\n\t{\r\n\t\tservices.Configure<T>(configuration);\r\n\t\tservices.AddScoped(config => config.GetService<IOptionsSnapshot<T>>().Value);\r\n\t}\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nNow, what this does, is configure an `IOptionsSnapshot`, but then actually scope the object inside of snapshot so it's accessible directly from DI without having to ask for the `IOptions` or `IOptionsSnapshot` itself. This has worked just fine in the past, and I've got this set of code in a class library a number of my own projects are using.\r\n\r\n# The Web App\r\n\r\nNow, let's create a NetCore2.0app project in the same solution, with the default API interface. This means we get `program.cs`, `startup.cs` and `controller/ValuesController.cs`, as the template creates it. \r\n\r\nLet's not change `program.cs`, but let's make the `Startup` file look like this: \r\n\r\n```csharp\r\nusing Microsoft.AspNetCore.Builder;\r\nusing Microsoft.AspNetCore.Hosting;\r\nusing Microsoft.Extensions.Configuration;\r\nusing Microsoft.Extensions.DependencyInjection;\r\n\r\npublic class ConfigurationOptions\r\n{\r\n\tpublic string Whatever { get; set; }\r\n}\r\n\r\npublic class SomeScopedService\r\n{\r\n\tpublic SomeScopedService(ConfigurationOptions options) {}\r\n}\r\n\r\npublic class Startup\r\n{\r\n\tpublic Startup(IConfiguration configuration)\r\n\t{\r\n\t\tConfiguration = configuration;\r\n\t}\r\n\r\n\tpublic IConfiguration Configuration { get; }\r\n\r\n\tpublic void ConfigureServices(IServiceCollection services)\r\n\t{\r\n\t\tservices.AddSnapshotConfig<ConfigurationOptions>(Configuration);\r\n\t\tservices.AddScoped<SomeScopedService>();\r\n\t\tservices.AddMvc();\r\n\t}\r\n\r\n\tpublic void Configure(IApplicationBuilder app, IHostingEnvironment env)\r\n\t{\r\n\t\tapp.UseDeveloperExceptionPage();\r\n\t\tapp.UseMvc();\r\n\t}\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nLastly, let's make the default `ValuesController` request this custom `SomeScopedService`.\r\n\r\nHere's a simplified version of that file: \r\n```csharp\r\nusing Microsoft.AspNetCore.Mvc;\r\nusing System.Collections.Generic;\r\n\r\n[Route(\"api/[controller]\")]\r\npublic class ValuesController : Controller\r\n{\r\n\tpublic ValuesController(SomeScopedService service) { }\r\n\r\n\t[HttpGet]\r\n\tpublic IEnumerable<string> Get()\r\n\t{\r\n\t\treturn new string[] { \"Some Text\", \"Other Text\" };\r\n\t}\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nClearly we're not actually doing anything with the `ScomeScopedService` or with the `ConfigurationOptions` but, we're requesting them from DI. \r\n\r\nJust in case it's relevant, the web is only referencing: \r\n```xml\r\n  <ItemGroup>\r\n    <PackageReference Include=\"Microsoft.AspNetCore.All\" Version=\"2.0.0\" />\r\n  </ItemGroup>\r\n```\r\n\r\n# The Result\r\n\r\nWhen we hit run and actually navigate to the `api/values` endpoint, we get the following error message: \r\n\r\n```\r\nMissingMethodException: Method not found: 'System.__Canon Microsoft.Extensions.Options.IOptionsSnapshot`1.get_Value()'.\r\n```\r\n\r\nThe call stack is something like: \r\n```\r\nSystem.MissingMethodException: Method not found: 'System.__Canon Microsoft.Extensions.Options.IOptionsSnapshot`1.get_Value()'.\r\n   at OptionsExtensions.<>c__0`1.<AddSnapshotConfig>b__0_0(IServiceProvider config)\r\n   at Microsoft.Extensions.DependencyInjection.ServiceLookup.CallSiteRuntimeResolver.VisitFactory(FactoryCallSite factoryCallSite, ServiceProvider provider)\r\n   at Microsoft.Extensions.DependencyInjection.ServiceLookup.CallSiteVisitor`2.VisitCallSite(IServiceCallSite callSite, TArgument argument)\r\n   at Microsoft.Extensions.DependencyInjection.ServiceLookup.CallSiteRuntimeResolver.VisitScoped(ScopedCallSite scopedCallSite, ServiceProvider provider)\r\n   at Microsoft.Extensions.DependencyInjection.ServiceLookup.CallSiteVisitor`2.VisitCallSite(IServiceCallSite callSite, TArgument argument)\r\n   at Microsoft.Extensions.DependencyInjection.ServiceLookup.CallSiteRuntimeResolver.VisitConstructor(ConstructorCallSite constructorCallSite, ServiceProvider provider)\r\n   at Microsoft.Extensions.DependencyInjection.ServiceLookup.CallSiteVisitor`2.VisitCallSite(IServiceCallSite callSite, TArgument argument)\r\n   at Microsoft.Extensions.DependencyInjection.ServiceLookup.CallSiteRuntimeResolver.VisitScoped(ScopedCallSite scopedCallSite, ServiceProvider provider)\r\n   at Microsoft.Extensions.DependencyInjection.ServiceLookup.CallSiteVisitor`2.VisitCallSite(IServiceCallSite callSite, TArgument argument)\r\n   at Microsoft.Extensions.DependencyInjection.ServiceProvider.<>c__DisplayClass22_0.<RealizeService>b__0(ServiceProvider provider)\r\n   at Microsoft.Extensions.DependencyInjection.ServiceProvider.GetService(Type serviceType)\r\n   at Microsoft.Extensions.Internal.ActivatorUtilities.GetService(IServiceProvider sp, Type type, Type requiredBy, Boolean isDefaultParameterRequired)\r\n   at lambda_method(Closure , IServiceProvider , Object[] )\r\n```\r\n\r\nWhat's happening, or so it seems - is that, it seems to be running into a bizarre conflict between the Microsoft.Extension.Options from the 1.1.2 in the class library, and the 2.0.0 reference in the Web App. \r\n\r\nWhile this might seem a bit contrived for the sake of this example, this is just a simplified repro - in reality, I have a much more complicated system that's basically doing this - registering some options in some custom way, and I have tons of code using the options in custom services directly. The moment I upgrade any of those projects to .net Core 2.0, the webapps fail to run. \r\n\r\nWhy might this be? I know that the `.Value` was removed and moved up to the IOptions itself, but I think something is going on very strangely here. \r\n\r\n_Copied from original issue: aspnet/Options#228_"},{"Id":"7358544130","Type":"IssuesEvent","CreatedAt":"2018-03-09T22:23:43","Actor":"ajcvickers","Repository":"aspnet/Home","Organization":"aspnet","RawContent":null,"RelatedAction":"closed","RelatedUrl":"https://github.com/aspnet/Home/issues/2386","RelatedDescription":"Closed issue \"1st class support for Request options\" (#2386) at aspnet/Home","RelatedBody":"_From @HaoK on Tuesday, September 12, 2017 2:00:29 PM_\r\n\r\nToday its fairly hard to have request scoped options, and there's no way to avoid using `IHttpContextAccessor` since options doesn't even depend on Http.\r\n\r\nWe could make it easier via something like:\r\n\r\n`context.GetOptions<TOptions>(name)` which would be a new way to get request scoped options which would also support being configured via:\r\n\r\n`services.Configure<TOptions>(options, context => options.Something = context.Items[\"Something\"])`\r\n\r\nUnderneath the covers, there would be something like `IRequestOptions` which exposes: `TOptions Get(string name, HttpContext context)`\r\n\r\n_Copied from original issue: aspnet/Options#232_"}],"ResultType":"GitHubEvent"},"SignalR":{"Events":[],"ResultType":"GitHubEvent"},"Mvc":{"Events":[{"Id":"7360865322","Type":"IssuesEvent","CreatedAt":"2018-03-10T23:10:15","Actor":"JakenVeina","Repository":"aspnet/Mvc","Organization":"aspnet","RawContent":null,"RelatedAction":"opened","RelatedUrl":"https://github.com/aspnet/Mvc/issues/7468","RelatedDescription":"Opened issue \"Consuming the ApplicationModel?\" (#7468) at aspnet/Mvc","RelatedBody":"Is it possible for me to consume the current ApplicationModel, rather than just inject conventions into it?

These images will continue to receive patch update whenever a 1.0.x, 1.1.x, or 2.0.x update ships, however, we will not produce a new version which contains the 2.1 runtime.\r\n\r\n### Why?\r\n \r\nThese images existed to support CI/CD pipelines that run apps on multiple versions for .NET Core in the same container. With each release, these images have grown in size. The 1.0-2.0 image is already about 1GB, and would continue to grow with runtime updates. \r\n \r\nFortunately, recent improvements to .NET Core (such as minor version roll-forward) and Docker (multi-stage builds) have reduced the need to use an image with multiple versions of .NET Core. We have seen usage of these multi-version images declining over time, and today, they are a small percentage of our Docker image usage.\r\n\r\nRather than maintaining a single, large image with all possible .NET Core runtimes, we encourage users to use multi-stage builds. Docker's multi-stage feature allows you to compose a single Dockerfile, but still use multiple .NET Core runtimes. Also, starting in 2.1, .NET Core supports rolling forward the runtime version within the major version, which will further reduce the need to have multiple 2.x runtimes side-by-side.\r\n \r\nFor discussion, use https://github.com/aspnet/aspnet-docker/issues/349"}],"ResultType":"GitHubEvent"},"Twitter":{"ResultType":"TwitterTimeline","Tweets":[{"Id":"972484011556818945","CreatedAt":"2018-03-10T14:47:10+00:00","UserScreenname":"aspnet","Text":"Be sure to check out Jeff's live coding stream this morning to see more about our #ASP.NET Core 2.1 preview release. https://t.co/EtKk0fMOgU","Source":"<a href=\"https://about.twitter.com/products/tweetdeck\" rel=\"nofollow\">TweetDeck</a>","RetweetCount":20,"FavoriteCount":8,"RawContent":null},{"Id":"971084152693866496","CreatedAt":"2018-03-06T18:04:38+00:00","UserScreenname":"aspnet","Text":"We are live at https://t.co/4Ioo9jNSN2 !
