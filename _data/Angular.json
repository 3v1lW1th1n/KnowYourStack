The problem is that all requests that match what is in the cache end up going to the network no matter what.  \r\n\r\nAfter spending a lot of time debugging the ngsw-worker.js that angular generates, I found that all requests that where being checked by `cache.match` where not found.  The reason for that is the headers of the requests coming from my app were a little different than the request headers stored in cache.  Specifically the `referrer-policy` header is different.  The incoming request has the header set to `Referrer Policy: no-referrer-when-downgrade` but the header for the matching request in cache is `Referrer Policy: unsafe-url`.\r\n\r\nOne way I proved that this was the issue was by using the `cache.match()` options flag `ignoreVary: true` to ignore header differences.  After making that change my app's service worker pulled all in scope assets from cache and didn't go to the network.  Because the `ngsw-worker.js` is generated I don't think modifying it is a valid option.\r\n\r\nI dug deeper to see why the request headers where being mismatched.  What I found was that the request that is being put in to cache `cache.put(req, res)` is accurate, but when you immediately pull that same request from cache the headers are changed.  There is something that happens when executing `cache.put()` that modifies the request headers and I am not sure what.\r\n\r\nIs there anything from an angular service worker configuration that would cause this?  Would it be possible to update the generated service worker to use the `ignoreVary` option when checking for matches in cache?\r\n\r\n## üî¨ Minimal Reproduction\r\n<!--\r\nPlease create and share minimal reproduction of the issue starting with this template: https://stackblitz.com/fork/angular-issue-repro2\r\n-->\r\n<!-- ‚úçÔ∏è--> https://stackblitz.com/...\r\n\r\n<!--\r\nIf StackBlitz is not suitable for reproduction of your issue, please create a minimal GitHub repository with the reproduction of the issue.\r\nA good way to make a minimal reproduction is to create a new app via `ng new repro-app` and add the minimum possible code to show the problem. \r\nShare the link to the repo below along with step-by-step instructions to reproduce the problem, as well as expected and actual behavior.\r\n\r\nIssues that don't have enough info and can't be reproduced will be closed.\r\n\r\nYou can read more about issue submission guidelines here: https://github.com/angular/angular/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md#-submitting-an-issue\r\n-->\r\n\r\nTo reproduce this just execute the two statements below in a browser console and compare the request objects.\r\n\r\ncaches.open('exampleTest1').then(cache => {var newreq = new Request(\"https://www.google.com\"); console.log('NEW REQUEST: ', newreq); cache.put(newreq, new Response('hello'))})\r\n\r\ncaches.open('exampleTest1').then(res => res.keys().then(keys => console.log(keys)))\r\n\r\n## üî• Exception or Error\r\n<pre><code>\r\n<!-- If the issue is accompanied by an exception or an error, please share it below: -->\r\n<!-- ‚úçÔ∏è-->\r\n\r\n</code></pre>\r\n\r\n\r\n## üåç  Your Environment\r\n\r\n**Angular Version:**\r\n<pre><code>\r\n<!-- run `ng version` and paste output below -->\r\n<!-- ‚úçÔ∏è-->\r\n    _                      _                 ____ _     ___\r\n    / \\   _ __   __ _ _   _| | __ _ _ __     / ___| |   |_ _|\r\n   / ‚ñ≥ \\ | '_ \\ / _` | | | | |/ _` | '__|   | |   | |    | |\r\n  / ___ \\| | | | (_| | |_| | | (_| | |      | |___| |___ | |\r\n /_/   \\_\\_| |_|\\__, |\\__,_|_|\\__,_|_|       \\____|_____|___|\r\n                |___/\r\n    \r\n\r\nAngular CLI: 8.2.0\r\nNode: 10.15.3\r\nOS: darwin x64\r\nAngular: 8.2.0\r\n... animations, cli, common, compiler, compiler-cli, core, forms\r\n... language-service, platform-browser, platform-browser-dynamic\r\n... router, service-worker, upgrade\r\n\r\nPackage                           Version\r\n-----------------------------------------------------------\r\n@angular-devkit/architect         0.800.0\r\n@angular-devkit/build-angular     0.800.0\r\n@angular-devkit/build-optimizer   0.800.0\r\n@angular-devkit/build-webpack     0.800.0\r\n@angular-devkit/core              8.2.0\r\n@angular-devkit/schematics        8.2.0\r\n@angular/pwa                      0.12.4\r\n@ngtools/webpack                  8.0.0\r\n@schematics/angular               8.2.0\r\n@schematics/update                0.802.0\r\nrxjs                              6.5.2\r\ntypescript                        3.5.3\r\nwebpack                           4.34.0\r\n</code></pre>\r\n\r\n**Anything else relevant?**\r\n<!-- ‚úçÔ∏èIs this a browser specific issue?

In one particular component, the component is using require.ensure(...) to import JS scripts needed for the component.\r\n\r\nExample:\r\n\r\n```\r\nrequire.ensure([], require => {\r\n\tconst TweenLite = require('../../../../../assets/external-js/TweenLite.min');\r\n\tlet confettiCannon = require('../../../../../assets/external-js/confetti');\r\n\tthis.confettiCannon = confettiCannon = new confettiCannon.ConfettiCannon();\r\n\tconfettiCannon.start();\r\n});\r\n```\r\n\r\nTweenLite.min.js is a GSAP plugin used for simple transitions. confetti.js is a custom script that loads a canvas animation. When confettiCannon.start() is run eventually it will try to use the TweenLite plugin - which is resulting in an error because TweenLite is `undefined`.\r\n\r\nWith my previous Angular application this code works fine, and since when running the confetti.js TweenLite is listed as undefined my hunch was that the plugin is not being attached to the window.\r\n\r\nBelow is a sample of the differences between the code that is returned by Webpack from my two applications:\r\n\r\n_Working Application (custom webpack config)_\r\n\r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/36479149/63606218-d2f9d000-c5cf-11e9-954f-f68349402feb.png)\r\n\r\n_Failing Application (using Angular CLI)_\r\n\r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/36479149/63606251-ead15400-c5cf-11e9-8716-5cf39cd59cb9.png)\r\n\r\nThe difference between the two scripts is that the working sample wraps the imported script with a `function(global) { ... }`. I'm guessing that with this Webpack is able to attach the script globally.\r\n\r\nSo my question is, is it possible to dynamically import a JS file and somehow make it available globally?\r\n\r\nI don't know if there's any CLI configuration or Webpack loader that could help with this scenario.\r\n\r\n## üåç Your Environment\r\n<pre><code>\r\n<!-- run `ng version` and paste output below

This can happen when transitioning from the server to the client.\r\n    for (let i = 0; i < previousContainers.length; i++) {\r\n      previousContainers[i].parentNode!.removeChild(previousContainers[i]);\r\n    }\r\n```\r\nI hope I find the time to reproduce this issue in stackblitz in the near future, but the issue is quite easy to mentally comprehend: \r\n\r\nImagine two compoennts compA and compB, and each of them have separate OverlayContainer instances injected to them.\r\n\r\nNow CompA attaches a portal to its OverlayContainer. No container element has been created for his OverlayContainer instance yet, so the _createContainer() method is being called. All \"previous\" containers are being cleared (which isn't a problem yet) and a new one is created. The overlay is being displayed correctly.\r\n\r\nNow CompB attaches a portal to its component overlay. No Container Element has been created for his OverlayContainer instance yet, so the _createContainer() method is being called. All \"previous\" containers are being cleared, **including the container element of the OverlayContainer of compA**. The overlay of comB is being display correctly.\r\n\r\nNow CompA tries to attach another portal to its OverlayContainer. His OverlayContainer still references the container element it has created before.\r\n\r\n`\r\nif (!this._containerElement) {\r\n      this._createContainer();\r\n }\r\n`\r\n\r\n**So, NO new container element is being created.. However, this container element has been detached from the DOM earlier by the OverlayContainer from compB. So now we can attach whatever we want to this container, they won't be displayed in the DOM.** \r\n\r\nTo fix this issue, three solutions should be examined:\r\n\r\n1. If it's true that there always should only be ONE container element, independent of the OverlayContainer instance, then the getContainerElement() method should not check, whether or not a reference exists in the particular instance, but instead perform a dom query, as it's done currently done, when existing container elements are removed\r\n2. If it's true that there should only be ONE container element per OverlayContainer instance, than these containers should have some sort of ID attached to them, so we only remove the containers refering to this instance\r\n3. The proposed fix targets a situation caused by server-side-rendering using angular universal. Maybe there is a different solution to address this issue.\r\n\r\n\r\n#### Reproduction\r\nI hope I can build a stackblitz for this issue soon.

Furthermore, since we are not intending to use what is provided by Angular Material out of the box in terms of CSS styling, it's better that we might as well not include it all.\r\n\r\nFurthermore, in terms of the form field component, you guys are not using any form of ```ViewEncapsulation``` at all, so apart from loading order of the CSS files, it doesn't make much of a difference to a global stylesheet, so I feel this request is not unreasonable.\r\n\r\nI feel the people in my team are experienced enough in CSS that I feel we can take responsibility for our own actions of what happens there.\r\n\r\nSo basically we want to use your JS functionality but give us the option not to use your CSS and allow us the freedom and responsibility to maintain the look and feel ourselves. :)\r\n\r\n#### Which versions of Angular, Material, OS, TypeScript, browsers are affected?\r\nI'm going to make the assumption of all versions of Angular Material that can be consumed in Angular 2 onwards since this is a conscious code structure decision made by the Angular Material team.

When focus shifts from child element 1 to child element 2, the `blur` event on child element 1 is captured first. The design is that this `blur` event does not result in a `null` value on the subject, because the focus monitor will see that the [event's `relatedTarget`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/FocusEvent/relatedTarget) (the element that's about to take the focus) is also a child of our parent element, [and take no further action](https://github.com/angular/components/blob/2d976a92429ed37a89bfa9ee74b479b48c7ac40d/src/cdk/a11y/focus-monitor/focus-monitor.ts#L375).\r\n> \r\n> However, IE does not set the `relatedTarget` on `focus` or `blur` events, so the focus monitor can't know that focus is not leaving the parent element, and so we get a `null` value on the subject.\r\n\r\nThe solution here is to listen for the `focusin` and `focusout` events instead, where IE _does_ set the `relatedTarget` correctly (along with all other browsers). Other than this, there are some differences between the two sets of events:\r\n\r\n- `focusin` and `focusout` support bubbling, where `focus` and `blur` do not - I don't think this makes any difference for our use case, as we are explicitly using capture mode anyway\r\n- `focusin` and `focusout` fire _after_ their counterparts `focus` and `blur` - it's theoretically possible the some users may be relying on an order of events, but given there's no documentation that spells out when the focus monitor emits in relation to, say, model changes, I don't think it should be considered a breaking change\r\n\r\n(I've not been able to run the full test suite on Windows due to #16632, and linting on Windows is a non-starter because of line breaks, so I'll be testing properly on my Mac later)","Url":"https://github.com/angular/components/pull/16840","RelatedDescription":"Open PR \"fix FocusMonitor issue in IE by switching to focusin and focusout events\" (#16840)"},{"Id":"483647705","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2019-08-21T22:19:23","Actor":"mmalerba","Number":"16839","RawContent":null,"Title":"feat(cdk/testing): allow `preventDefault` on mouse events","State":"closed","Body":"","Url":"https://github.com/angular/components/pull/16839","RelatedDescription":"Closed or merged PR \"feat(cdk/testing): allow `preventDefault` on mouse events\" (#16839)"},{"Id":"483573597","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2019-08-21T22:01:00","Actor":"devversion","Number":"16837","RawContent":null,"Title":"build: create individual bazel targets for dev-app demos","State":"closed","Body":"Creates individual bazel targets for dev-app demos in favor of speeding\r\nup development with Bazel.\r\n\r\nBlocked on #16829 ","Url":"https://github.com/angular/components/pull/16837","RelatedDescription":"Closed or merged PR \"build: create individual bazel targets for dev-app demos\" (#16837)"},{"Id":"483638082","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2019-08-21T20:57:38","Actor":"josephperrott","Number":"16838","RawContent":null,"Title":"fix: update all files/directories owned by DevInfra to DevInfra alias","State":"closed","Body":"","Url":"https://github.com/angular/components/pull/16838","RelatedDescription":"Closed or merged PR \"fix: update all files/directories owned by DevInfra to DevInfra alias\" (#16838)"},{"Id":"483563885","IsPullRequest":false,"CreatedAt":"2019-08-21T17:55:22","Actor":"felipefialho","Number":"16836","RawContent":null,"Title":"[Drag and Drop] Animate the move after transfer","State":"open","Body":"#### Feature Description\r\n\r\nI think that a good idea add options to animate the move after transfer an drag element. \r\n\r\nFor example:\r\n\r\n![1_lVErPJgVdZJrwuWJOc5iKg](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/3603793/63455550-5cb86a80-c423-11e9-9daf-42816b0f8ccb.gif)\r\n\r\n#### Use Case\r\n\r\nFor now, the move as direct, because we just remove the element from original array.
