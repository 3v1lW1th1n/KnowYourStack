This will reduce the number of SDKs that are installed on programmer machines.\r\n\r\nFeature bands of the SDK are defined like 3.0.1nn. [Find out more about SDK version numbers](https://docs.microsoft.com/dotnet/core/versions/#versioning-details).\r\n\r\nThis means when .NET Core SDK 3.0.101 becomes available and is installed, .NET Core SDK 3.0.100 will be removed from the machine if it exists. When .NET Core SDK 3.0.200 becomes available and is installed on the same machine, .NET Core SDK versions like 3.0.101 will not be removed but stay side by side with 3.0.200.\r\n\r\nThis approach supports use of `global.json` which will roll forward across patch versions, but not feature bands of the SDK. Thus, upgrading via the SDK installer will not result in errors due to a missing SDK. Feature bands also align with side by side Visual Studio installations for those users that install SDKs for Visual Studio use. For example, Visual Studio 15.9 uses .NET Core SDK 2.2.500 but does not support .NET Core SDK 2.2.600.\r\n\r\nFind out how to [remove other .NET Core SDK versions here.](https://docs.microsoft.com/dotnet/core/versions/remove-runtime-sdk-versions)."},{"Id":"9078417647","Type":"IssuesEvent","CreatedAt":"2019-02-15T22:24:40","Actor":"richlander","Repository":"dotnet/announcements","Organization":"dotnet","RawContent":null,"RelatedAction":"opened","RelatedUrl":"https://github.com/dotnet/announcements/issues/101","RelatedDescription":"Opened issue \"Publishing .NET Core images to Microsoft Container Registry (MCR)\" (#101) at dotnet/announcements","RelatedBody":"# Publishing .NET Core images to Microsoft Container Registry (MCR)\r\n\r\nMicrosoft teams are now publishing container images to the [Microsoft Container Registry](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/blog/microsoft-syndicates-container-catalog/). There are two primary reasons for this change:\r\n\r\n* Syndicate Microsoft-provided container images to multiple registries, like Docker Hub and Red Hat.\r\n* Use Microsoft Azure as a global CDN for delivering Microsoft-provided container images.\r\n\r\nYou will use and see MCR as a storage back-end for Microsoft images. The primary way you learn about Microsoft container images and tags will be through a registry, which for most users will continue to be Docker Hub. Most of the experience you've had browsing for .NET Core container images will continue unchanged with this new model. The Docker Hub URLs you've used for Microsoft repos will continue to work, and forward to updated locations on Docker Hub. Existing Docker Hub will images will be maintained as-is.\r\n\r\n## Discussion\r\nPlease share your thoughts on this change and see what others are saying at:\r\n\r\n* [dotnet-docker #935](https://github.com/dotnet/dotnet-docker/issues/935)\r\n\r\n## Starting with .NET Core nightly repo\r\n\r\nOn the .NET team, we started our [transition to MCR](https://github.com/dotnet/dotnet-docker/issues/745) with the .NET Core \"nightly\" repo. [dotnet-nightly](dockerhub.com/r/microsoft/dotnet-nightly) is now hosted on MCR and syndicated to Docker Hub. We started with the nightly repo in order to discover and fix any challenges we found with this new model before we move our higher-traffic primary container repository.\r\n\r\nWe will start publishing [dotnet](dockerhub.com/r/microsoft/dotnet) to MCR a bit later, in either February or March. This issue will be updated when that happens.\r\n\r\n## Repo Split\r\n\r\nThe [.NET Core repo](https://hub.docker.com/r/microsoft/dotnet) currently includes 4 major categories of tags: \r\n\r\n* `sdk`\r\n* `aspnetcore-runtime`\r\n* `runtime` \r\n* `runtime-deps`\r\n\r\nProviding all of the tags in one place has helped with discoverability but made for a repo with an enormous README that can be challenging to navigate and consume. It is large enough that we exceeded Docker Hub README limits and had to artificially make it smaller.\r\n\r\nGoing forward, we will provide a repo for each of the tag categories listed above. We'll also provide a \"product repo\" that will hierarchicaly group all of our repos together. This will satisfy discoverability needs so that it will be easy to find the tags you want.\r\n\r\nYou can already see this experience with [microsoft-dotnet-core-nightly](https://hub.docker.com/_/microsoft-dotnet-core-nightly). There are now multiple repos for our nightly builds:\r\n\r\n* [.NET Core Nightly product repo](https://hub.docker.com/_/microsoft-dotnet-core-nightly)\r\n* [.NET Core SDK Nightly repo](https://hub.docker.com/_/microsoft-dotnet-core-nightly-sdk/)\r\n* [.NET Core ASP.NET Core Nightly repo](https://hub.docker.com/_/microsoft-dotnet-core-nightly-aspnet/)\r\n* [.NET Core Runtime Nightly repo](https://hub.docker.com/_/microsoft-dotnet-core-nightly-runtime/)\r\n* [.NET Core Runtime-deps Nightly repo](https://hub.docker.com/_/microsoft-dotnet-core-nightly-runtime-deps/)\r\n\r\nThe same split will exist for the non-nightly stable repo (currently hosted at  [microsoft/dotnet](https://hub.docker.com/r/microsoft/dotnet)) when we start publishing it to MCR and syndicating it back to DockerHub.\r\n\r\n## Changes to registry URL\r\n\r\nThe biggest change is that your Dockerfiles need to be updated to point to the MCR registry in order get access to new .NET Core container tags. The same change is required for scripts or human operations that pull images via `docker pull`.\r\n\r\nThe following example shows the registry path, repo and tag for the .NET Core 2.2 \"Nightly\" SDK on MCR:\r\n\r\n```console\r\nmcr.microsoft.com/dotnet/core-nightly/sdk:2.2\r\n```\r\n\r\nAs comparison, the following repo and tag have been used to date for the .NET Core 2.2 \"Nightly\" SDK on Docker Hub:\r\n\r\n```console\r\nmicrosoft/dotnet-nightly:2.2-sdk\r\n```\r\n\r\nThe new repo URL is provided at each of the news repos. For example, the new .NET Core SDK \"nightly\" repo provides a box on the right where you can copy and paste the correct MCR-based repo syntax that you can use for `docker pull` or in `FROM` statements in your Dockerfiles.\r\n\r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/2608468/52811702-95c5eb80-304a-11e9-8de8-e6ea1f4b4d75.png)\r\n\r\n## Servicing existing Docker Hub tags\r\n\r\nWe will continue to service existing non-version-specific or floating tags on Docker Hub while the associated .NET Core version is supported. For example the `microsoft/dotnet:2.1-sdk` tag is a floating tag that will continue to be serviced for the lifetime of .NET Core 2.1. You can continue using floating tags without issue.\r\n\r\nIf you use non-floating tags, like `microsoft/dotnet:2.1.504-sdk-alpine`, then you will need to update your Dockerfile to use a new non-floating tag. No new non-floating tags will be published to `microsoft/dotnet` and `microsoft/dotnet-nightly` after we fully transition to MCR.\r\n\r\n.NET Core 3.0 Preview 3 and later will only be made available on MCR.\r\n\r\n## Microsoft is a Verified Publisher\r\n\r\nUntil now, Microsoft-provided container images were considered \"community images\". As part of this change, we are re-classifying Microsoft as a \"verified publisher\" on Docker Hub. This designation should make it clearer that .NET and other Microsoft-provided images are coming from a verified source. There clearly was that expectation previously, but Docker is now making that clearer in the Docker Hub pages they host for Microsoft.\r\n\r\nWe will provide official vulnerability scanning Microsoft-provided images as a second phase of this transition."},{"Id":"9075495754","Type":"IssuesEvent","CreatedAt":"2019-02-15T14:06:30","Actor":"TaraOverfield","Repository":"dotnet/announcements","Organization":"dotnet","RawContent":null,"RelatedAction":"opened","RelatedUrl":"https://github.com/dotnet/announcements/issues/100","RelatedDescription":"Opened issue \"Advisory on February 2019 Security update for Windows 10 update 1809\" (#100) at dotnet/announcements","RelatedBody":"<span>The </span><a href=\"https://blogs.msdn.microsoft.com/dotnet/2019/02/13/net-framework-february-2019-security-and-quality-rollup/\" rel=\"nofollow\">February 2019 Security and Quality Rollup for Windows 10 update 1809</a><span> was released earlier this week.

This policy is specific to the container images we produce.\r\n\r\n## Plans\r\n\r\nWe're in the process of [fixing issues required to support Alpine 3.9](https://github.com/dotnet/dotnet-docker/issues/921). We expect that these issues will be resolved in February and that we'll be able to provide support for Alpine 3.9 in March.\r\n\r\nWe will produce Alpine 3.9 images for .NET Core 2.1, 2.2 and 3.0. Assuming we publish 3.9 images in March, we'll stop producing and supporting Alpine 3.7 and 3.8 images after June (2019).\r\n\r\n## Using Alpine-based .NET Core images\r\n\r\nWe produce a variety of Alpine-based images. You can either depend on a specific Alpine version, like with `microsoft/dotnet:2.2-sdk-alpine3.8` or opt to use the latest Alpine image we have to offer, like with `microsoft/dotnet:2.2-sdk-alpine`. Either are good choices. It is just a question of whether you want to make a conscious decision to move to later Alpine releases.\r\n\r\n## Support for ARM32?\r\n\r\nWe produce Alpine images for x64 (and ARM64, shortly). The [Alpine 3.9 announcement](https://twitter.com/alpinelinux/status/1090416212822110214) made mention of support for ARM32v7. We would like to enable .NET Core [Alpine-based images on ARM32](https://github.com/gliderlabs/docker-alpine/issues/463#issuecomment-460530395). We are patiently waiting for that to happen. If that's important to you, you should comment on that thread."},{"Id":"9060710562","Type":"IssuesEvent","CreatedAt":"2019-02-13T14:48:22","Actor":"TaraOverfield","Repository":"dotnet/announcements","Organization":"dotnet","RawContent":null,"RelatedAction":"opened","RelatedUrl":"https://github.com/dotnet/announcements/issues/98","RelatedDescription":"Opened issue \"February 2019 .NET Updates\" (#98) at dotnet/announcements","RelatedBody":"# February 2019 .NET Updates\r\nThe following .NET updates were released in February 2019.

which were impossible to pinpoint because of the missing stack trace. After spending some time commenting out code I found that there is an issue with dependency injection, specifically when you do a lot of it.\r\n\r\nOne service had about 500 generic classes injected (think IQueryContext<T> concept), which in turn had 5 other services injected. When doing any API call the class got created, without issues, but when doing a subsequent call it would throw the StackOverflowException. When removing some of the injected services it would throw the StackOverflow exception only after 5-6 API calls, and by removing even more it would stop.\r\n\r\nAfter doing some testing I couldn't reproduce the stack overflow exception but noticed when you inject more than 700 services into a class it will fail in Visual Studio 2017 with an Access Violation. I attached a sample to show this issue.\r\n[TestApp1.zip](https://github.com/dotnet/core/files/2967265/TestApp1.zip)\r\n\r\nNow I understand that this is excessive and I re-wrote some of our app to dynamically load the correct service instead, but is there any official stance on the limitations of dependency injection?\r\n\r\n\n\n_Copied from original issue: dotnet/core#2458_","Url":"https://github.com/dotnet/coreclr/issues/23309","RelatedDescription":"Open issue \"Stack overflow in clrjit!Compiler::fgMorphSmpOp/clrjit!Compiler::fgMorphTree\" (#23309)"},{"Id":"421991105","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2019-03-18T00:06:22","Actor":"dotnet-maestro-bot","Number":"23308","RawContent":null,"Title":"[automated] Merge branch 'master' => 'release/3.0'","State":"open","Body":"I detected changes in the master branch which have not been merged yet to release/3.0.

This discussion is about possible solutions for this scenario in .Net Core 3.\r\n \r\n## Customer requirements\r\n \r\nThe developer wants to:\r\n* Implement a suite of several libraries, that are used by several client apps.\r\n* Deploy one copy of library-suite on client machines in a central location\r\n* Push updates to the library-suite without having to recompile the client apps\r\n* Is happy to change their library-suite/apps to target .net core 3\r\n \r\nIn particular, the customer specifically asked allowing third party frameworks (similar to standard frameworks like `Microsoft.AspNetCore.App`).\r\n\r\n## Solution Options\r\n \r\n### Additional-deps\r\nThis is a simple solution to separate some of the app’s dependencies to a separate (possible shared) location. This option involves:\r\n* App development: Remove references to the library-suite from the apps, instead use a different light-up option such as startup-hook.\r\n* On client machines: Deploy the library-suite to a shared location, and set up `DOTNET_ADDITIONAL_DEPS` when apps are run.\r\n\r\nAdditional-deps have several known limitations, for example, as noted here.\r\n \r\n### Startup Hook\r\nThis option involves dynamically loading the library-suite into apps during application startup. \r\n* This requires setting `DOTNET_STARTUP_HOOKS` to appropriate loader code on client machines at app-startup. The loader code can then use custom logic to load the library-suite from a possible shared/versioned location.\r\n* This may require some coordination with other parties (ex: profiler) that may use the startup-hook (multiple assemblies can be hooked up at startup).\r\n\r\n### Custom AppHost\r\nThe library developer provides a custom host to be used by the app-developers. The custom host will then setup the appropriate library dependencies during app startup, before starting the runtime.\r\n \r\n### Components\r\nThis option is to load the library-suite as a plugin, where:\r\n* The library-suite exposes a minimal version (similar to reference assemblies) which only exposes the public API, and implements stub code to load the implementation assemblies dynamically.\r\n* Apps build with a package-reference to the suite.\r\nAt runtime, the above stub code loads the actual library code (say, using the AssemblyDependencyResolver), from a possibly shared location.\r\n \r\n### Third-party frameworks\r\nIn this option, the library-suite is published as a framework. This naturally achieves the customer requirements because:\r\n* The library-suite is published as a nuget package that contains:\r\n    * Its reference assemblies\r\n    * A target file that can be imported by the apps to include this suite as an additional target framework\r\n* Apps import/reference the above nuget package and ship independent of the library-suite’s implementation\r\n* The implementation assemblies of the library-suite are installed to `dotnet/shared/<library-suite>/<version>` on client machines. (one-copy shared, versioned location).\r\n \r\nThe above approach is straight-forward for developers to use. However, support for third-party frameworks is not yet officially available. \r\n\r\nI tried out a prototype, and was able to load a custom framework from a shared location (with some work-arounds for issues discussed below).\r\n \r\n### Pending work\r\nHere’s the known required work, there will likely be more as we productize this feature:\r\n* Tooling for adding frameworks: It should easy to add a framework to the list of dependent frameworks published in the `runtimeconfig.json` file (ex: add a framework to `RuntimeFramework` item). However, currently doesn’t work in the CLI because the property is overwritten by one of the build tasks. This should be a straightforward issue to fix.\r\n* Mismatched shared framework versions can cause problems: dotnet/core-setup#4947. This is again a bug that should be fixed.\r\n \r\n### Reservations\r\nWhile we agree that supporting third-party frameworks is useful for developers, there are some reservations about making this feature publicly available in .Net Core 3. The concerns are:\r\n* Bugs: We have a controlled environment with known frameworks. Custom frameworks may trigger unforeseen bugs. It is better to let the multiple-frameworks feature bake with existing framework for a release cycle.\r\n* Framework references: There are unresolved issues with supporting custom framework-references (which are not exposed by using third-party frameworks with package-references).\r\n* Install location:  Unanticipated issues with custom code within `dotnet` install location (`dotnet/shared/…`).\r\n* Design limitation: We have previously excluded custom frameworks from .net core 3. We may redesign the issue in .net core 3.1. But exposing the feature now may create a compatibility requirement, and restrict design options. Note that users may themselves figure out and use custom frameworks – but these are not supported by the `dotnet` org.\r\n \r\n## Discussion\r\n \r\nPlease add your thoughts / considerations about:\r\n* Exposing the possibility of third-party frameworks to customers, say as a sample.\r\n* Any other options to solve the customer scenario.\r\n* Similar usage scenarios\r\n","Url":"https://github.com/dotnet/cli/issues/10986","RelatedDescription":"Open issue \"Supporting third party libraries/frameworks \" (#10986)"},{"Id":"421727930","IsPullRequest":false,"CreatedAt":"2019-03-15T22:34:42","Actor":"MichaelSimons","Number":"10985","RawContent":null,"Title":"'Exec format error' when running global tool on ARM32","State":"open","Body":"Installing a global tool on ARM32 doesn't run.

According to documentation - \"Portable\" debugging information ensures that a \"pdb\" file is created. It says **nothing** about the fact that the DLL itself will contain an information about where the DLL was compiled at. Therefore, when this information is inside DLL - you are able to step into the source, given that location and checksum not changed.\r\n\r\nHere is the documentation I was referencing to:\r\nhttps://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/visualstudio/ide/reference/advanced-build-settings-dialog-box-csharp?view=vs-2017\r\n\r\n> * none\r\n> \r\n> Specifies that no debugging information will be generated.\r\n> \r\n> * portable\r\n> \r\n> Produces a .PDB file, a non-platform-specific, portable symbol file that provides other tools, especially debuggers, information about what is in the main executable file and how it was produced. See Portable PDB for more information.\r\n\r\n# General\r\n\r\n## Specs\r\nOS:\r\n\r\nOS Name\tMicrosoft Windows 10 Enterprise\r\nVersion 10.0.16299 Build 16299\r\nVS:\r\n\r\nMicrosoft Visual Studio Professional 2017\r\nVersion 15.9.7\r\nVisualStudio.15.Release/15.9.7+28307.423\r\nMicrosoft .NET Framework\r\nVersion 4.7.02556\r\ndotnet --version\r\n\r\n2.2.104\r\n\r\n## Prerequisites\r\n\r\nCheckout the solution from my repo:\r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/pavlexander/dotnetbugs/tree/master/Bugs/13032019_DllIncludesPdbInformation\r\n\r\n## Steps to reproduce\r\n\r\n1. Open the solution in VisualStudio\r\n2. Build project \"DllWithPortableDebuggingInformation\"\r\n**Note 1**: see the post-build events. The script will copy the DLL into a console app project.\r\n**Note 2**: script will also delete PDB so there is no information anywhere about the source..\r\n**Note 3**: see the project settings. Debugging information set to \"Portable\".\r\n3. For console application, right click on project, \"Add -> Reference\". Browse for DLL that was copied into the root folder of console app project, add a reference to it!\r\nPath: \"\\Bugs\\13032019_DllIncludesPdbInformation\\DllIncludesPdbInformation\\DllWithPortableDebuggingInformation.dll\"\r\n4. Go to \"Program.cs\" of console application and un-comment the line which is marked with a comment. \r\n5. Put a debug point onto the same line that you have uncommented.\r\n6. Start console app in debug mode. On break - step into the code of external library.\r\n\r\n**Expected result:**\r\nStepping into the code is skipped because DLL has no information about source code location.\r\n\r\n**Actual result:**\r\nStepping into the code works, despite the fact that PDB file does not even exists.\r\n\r\n\r\n## Proposed solution\r\n\r\nWe either need information about this behavior to be properly documented, or, if it's a bug, then it needs to be fixed.\r\n\r\n## Additional questions\r\n\r\nPlease take a minute to answer following questions:\r\n\r\n1. How to tell, if PDB information is embedded into an DLL? For example, can I use \"JetBrains dotPeek\" to inspect DLL and see what kind of information it contains about the source? I couldn't find any tutorials on how to do it and how/where this information is stored in DLL. Any hints or links are appreciated.\r\n\r\n2. Is it possible to override the \"default source location\" for the loaded DLLs? For example, if an assembly was compiled at \"C:/myCompiledLibs\", but afterwards I moved the source to \"D:/newLocation\" - how do I make it so, that the Visual Studio would look into this new directory for sources, instead of using this info that is embedded into DLL/PDB?\r\n\r\nAny answers are much appreciated.\n\n","Url":"https://github.com/dotnet/cli/issues/10982","RelatedDescription":"Open issue \"Assembly built with \"Portable\" debugging information - contains source information\" (#10982)"},{"Id":"421593590","IsPullRequest":false,"CreatedAt":"2019-03-15T16:06:51","Actor":"qmfrederik","Number":"10981","RawContent":null,"Title":"Build hangs on low-memory device with many CPU cores","State":"open","Body":"## Steps to reproduce\r\n\r\nI'm compiling a .NET Core solution (~40 projects) on a Raspberry Pi.

These APIs provide support for writing more efficient algorithms that can take advantage of hardware specific functionality.\r\n\r\nWhile the number of APIs exposed may seem daunting, the APIs are hardware specific and were designed such that you must perform the appropriate checks before attempting to use a given API or they will result in a `PlatformNotSupportedException` at runtime. For example, `System.Runtime.Intrinsics.X86.Sse` is a class that exposes the SSE ISA for the x86 and x64 architectures. Before using any of the methods on that class, you must emit an `if (Sse.IsSupported)` check to validate that both the current hardware and the current runtime support this ISA.\r\n\r\nThese API declarations are also part of the existing shared framework code and have a default implementation of returning `false` for the `IsSupported` checks and throwing `PlatformNotSupportedException` from any of the other exposed hardware-specific APIs. This has allowed us to already take a cross-runtime dependency on these intrinsics in places like `SpanHelpers`, `Decimal`, `BitOperations`, `BitArray`, and more.\r\n\r\nGiven the above, I propose that these APIs be included as part of `netstandard2.1` as it will allow general library and application developers to share in the same benefits we have already seen. That is, it will light-up on .NET Core 3.0 and will do nothing on other runtimes. This will avoid the need for them to cross-compile their code in a number of cases.\r\n\r\nFor the runtimes that don't support this functionality yet, they should require somewhere between no and minimal changes. For the most part, they should already be internally compiling these APIs and hitting the `IsSupported=false` paths. So they will ultimately just be exposing these APIs to the end-user and would require no changes. The work that may be required is to ensure that the `Vector64<T>`, `Vector128<T>`, and `Vector256<T>` types have the appropriate ABI dependent type layouts. That is, these types should have the appropriate packing (e.g. `16` for `Vector128<T>` on x86/x64 since it maps to the `__m128` ABI primitive defined by the Windows and System V calling convention specifications).\r\n\r\nExposing this will also allow the various runtimes to have incremental \"light-up\" of these APIs. That is, rather than waiting for the next release to both expose and implement the APIs, they can expose the the APIs as part of `netstandard2.1` and the corresponding version of their runtime (e.g `x.0`). They can then light up individual ISAs and make them available to their users as they see fit (e.g. They could enable just `SSE` in `x.1` and could enable SSE2/SSE3 in `x.2`, etc).\r\n\r\n","Url":"https://github.com/dotnet/standard/issues/1094","RelatedDescription":"Open issue \"Consider the HWIntrinsic APIs for NS2.1\" (#1094)"},{"Id":"416499863","IsPullRequest":false,"CreatedAt":"2019-03-03T18:13:53","Actor":"proof85","Number":"1093","RawContent":null,"Title":"HashCode to standard","State":"closed","Body":"Hi,\r\n\r\nis it possible to add the HashCode-\"Helper\" struct to the .net standard?

However the design of this API is not as flexible as it could be, and for different kinds of counters / metrics, the current `EventCounter` API doesn't work very well for various reasons (specific examples detailed below). \r\n\r\nThis proposal includes 3 new APIs that are variants of the current `EventCounter` class - namely `PollingCounter`, `IncrementingEventCounter`, and `IncrementingPollingCounter`. \r\n\r\n## New API Description\r\n\r\n### EventCounter\r\n\r\nProposing two public surface additions to `EventCounter`:\r\n\r\n- `public string DisplayName { get; set; }`\r\n\r\nThis is a property that will be displayed in the payload for the EventCounter. This is a property a user can set if the user wants a separate field that represents how this counter should be displayed on a viewer, if it is different from the name of this counter. For example, a counter may be instantiated with a name \"request-counter\", and its `DisplayName` property can be set to \"Number of Requests\" which would be a more viewer-friendly name. This is useful when trying to create counters that interact with the CLI, where having spaces in the name might cause trouble or confusion for the CLI parser and the user.\r\n\r\n- `public void AddMetaData(string key, string value)`\r\n\r\nThis API adds a key-value pair of \"MetaData\" to an instance of `EventCounter`. This API exists so that users can add any metadata about their counter that may not be relevant for all `EventCounter` instances. A user can add arbitrary number of metadata to their `EventCounter` instance, and it will be reported as part of the `EventCounter` payload by a comma-separated string. For example, suppose the user wants to categorize his/her counters into different tiers of counters in terms of priority - they can use this API to encode that information into their `EventCounter` instances:\r\n\r\n```\r\n    anImportantCounter.AddmetaData(\"priority\", \"1\");\r\n    notAnImportantCounter.AddMetaData(\"priority\", \"3\");\r\n```\r\n\r\n\r\n### PollingCounter\r\n```\r\nclass PollingCounter {\r\n    PollingCounter(string name, EventSource eventSource Func<float> getMetricFunction);\r\n    string DisplayName;\r\n    void AddMetaData(string key, string value);\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\n`PollingCounter` is a class that will be used for similar kind of metrics to those that can be represented by `EventCounter`, but it takes in a callback function as a parameter to its constructor, which is used to gather metrics instead of the client having to explicitly call `WriteMetric` - this is what you need to do for instances of `EventCounter`. Explicit calls to `WriteMetric` may not be so nice for certain kinds of metrics because some metrics vary over time in a continuous manner, and it is not always clear at what discrete interval the value needs to be polled and written from the user's side. For example, GC heap size varies over time, but user may not know (and should not be) querying the heap size 15 times a second to keep track of this. `PollingCounter` allows user to get reports on the value without needing to explicitly update the value at an arbitrary time interval of user's choice. \r\n\r\nWhen the EventSource that the instance of `PollingCounter` is attached to is enabled, it will then call the callback function per every interval it needs to report the values. \r\n\r\nA user who wants to monitor his/her app's GC heap size can create an instance of `PollingCounter` like this:\r\n\r\n```\r\n    PollingCounter gcHeapCounter = new PollingCounter(\"GC Heap Size\", myEventSource, () => GC.GetTotalMemory(false));\r\n```\r\n\r\nA viewer that displays PollingCounter would be able to display a metric for every interval that it requested the samples to be taken (via the `EventCounterIntervalSec` argument).\r\n\r\n\r\n### IncrementingEventCounter\r\n```\r\nclass IncrementingEventCounter {\r\n    IncrementingEventCounter(string name, EventSource eventSource);\r\n    string DisplayName;\r\n    TimeSpan DisplayRateTimeScale;\r\n    void Increment(float increment = 1);\r\n    void AddMetaData(string key, string value);\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\n`IncrementingEventCounter` is a counter that generates a slightly different metric than `EventCounter`. `EventCounter` reports various statistics per each interval it reports such as min, max, mean, median, and standard deviation. However, for certain values, we might want to capture just the sum of increments over an interval. For example, the number of exceptions thrown is an incrementing value, and we don't want to take an average on the \"# of exceptions\" thrown per interval because it will be meaningless. What we really want is \"how many exceptions were thrown since I last reported that value\", and that is what `IncrementingEventCounter` is for.\r\n\r\nA counter that keeps track of exceptions that happened in a user's app can be implemented as an `IncrementingEventCounter` like this:\r\n\r\n```\r\n...\r\n    IncrementingEventCounter exceptionCounter = new IncrementingEventCounter(\"exception-counter\", myEventSource);\r\n...\r\n\r\npublic void someRoutine()\r\n{\r\n    try\r\n    {\r\n        // some code\r\n    }\r\n    catch (ArgumentException)\r\n    {\r\n    \texceptionCounter.Increment();\r\n    }\r\n}\r\n...\r\n\r\n```\r\n\r\n`IncrementingEventCounter` reports in its payload the total number of increment that happened since it last reported the value. For example, if `EventCounterIntervalSec` was set to 3 seconds, it would display how many increments happened in the past 3 seconds.\r\n\r\n\r\n`IncrementingEventCounter` has a public property called `DisplayRateTimeScale` - this can be set if the user wants to specify that this counter should be aggregated at a particular rate. For example, a simple viewer might want to show this counter (# of exceptions) as # of exceptions per second, or per hour. The viewer needs to know a certain timescale that represents the rate at which it should be displayed.\r\n\r\n\r\n### IncrementingPollingCounter\r\n```\r\nclass IncrementingPollingCounter {\r\n    IncrementingPollingCounter(string name, EventSource eventSource, Func<float> getCountFunction);\r\n    string DisplayName;\r\n    TimeSpan DisplayRateTimeScale;\r\n    void AddMetaData(string key, string value);\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\n`IncrementingPollingCounter` is a similar type of counter to `IncrementingEventCounter` in that it aggregates values over an interval, but like `PollingCounter`, it takes in callback function to update the counter value instead of having the user explicitly call `Increment` on it. This allows the flexibility of `PollingCounter` for a metric whose value may change in a continuous manner.\r\n\r\n## PRs\r\nhttps://github.com/dotnet/coreclr/pull/23077 introduced these APIs as internal only. \r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n\r\n cc @vancem @noahfalk @tommcdon @jorive ","Url":"https://github.com/dotnet/corefx/issues/36129","RelatedDescription":"Open issue \"Evolving EventCounter API\" (#36129)"},{"Id":"422412499","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2019-03-18T20:35:16","Actor":"ahsonkhan","Number":"36127","RawContent":null,"Title":"Disable BuildInvalidSignatureTwice in X509Certificates.Tests on Windows","State":"closed","Body":"To unblock CI: https://github.com/dotnet/corefx/issues/36124\r\n\r\ncc @bartonjs, @stephentoub, @tarekgh ","Url":"https://github.com/dotnet/corefx/pull/36127","RelatedDescription":"Closed or merged PR \"Disable BuildInvalidSignatureTwice in X509Certificates.Tests on Windows\" (#36127)"},{"Id":"422415313","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2019-03-18T20:18:16","Actor":"wfurt","Number":"36128","RawContent":null,"Title":"Add TrailingHeaders support for HTTP/2 ","State":"open","Body":"follow-up on #35337, fixes #34912\r\n\r\nThis adds processing for HeaderFrame after DataFrame.

It is specific to Windows only and uses HttpListener as the server for the WebSocket. I was able to reproduce the problem on .NET Framework as well.\r\n\r\nThe problem was due to the logic in WebSocketHttpListenerDuplexStream where it was always creating a TaskCompletionSource and doing a TrySetException even if the error occured on a synchronous codepath. The ReadAsyncFast (and WriteAsyncFast) methods are always calling a callback to finish the operation and thus always setting an exception into the task. But the task was never awaited because the exception was also rethrown from the ReadAsyncFast method and skips the await.\r\n\r\nThe fix is to change the logic slightly so that ReadAsyncFast won't rethrow the exception. It doesn't need to since the exception is already stored in the task. So, awaiting that task will be fast since it is already completed (faulted with the exception).\r\n\r\nIn addition to the CI tests, I also verified the fix with the original repro from the issue.\r\n\r\nFixes #29005","Url":"https://github.com/dotnet/corefx/pull/36110","RelatedDescription":"Closed or merged PR \"Fix WebSocketHttpListenerDuplexStream error handling\" (#36110)"},{"Id":"421980149","IsPullRequest":false,"CreatedAt":"2019-03-17T22:14:55","Actor":"wli3","Number":"36109","RawContent":null,"Title":"text.json, how to surface meaningful GetString() exception?","State":"open","Body":"The current \"there is a type mismatch exception\" is like the following without extra effort .

Change `string.Concat(object)` to never return null (also a breaking change)\r\n2. Use `o?.ToString() ?? \"\"` instead of `string.Concat(o) ?? \"\"`\r\n3. Change the spec, or accept and live with the deviation\r\n\r\n------------------------------\r\n\r\nIf you define an object with a ToString method which returns null:\r\n\r\n    public class C\r\n    {\r\n        public override string ToString() => null;\r\n    }\r\n\r\nAnd then concatenate that with `null` or \"\":\r\n\r\n    C c = new C();\r\n    c + \"\"\r\n\r\nthen the compiler emits:\r\n\r\n    string.Concat(c)\r\n\r\nHowever, `string.Concat(object)` will return null if the object's\r\nToString method returns null. This contradicts section 7.8.4 of the\r\nSpecification, which says:\r\n\r\n    If ToString returns null, an empty string is substituted.\r\n    ...\r\n    The string concatenation operator never returns a null value\r\n\r\nOn the other hand, if you write:\r\n\r\n    c + \"\" + \"\"\r\n\r\nthen the compiler emits:\r\n\r\n    string.Concat(c) ?? \"\"\r\n\r\nThis is because it reduces `c + \"\"` to `string.Concat(c)` as before, but\r\nwhen it considers the second `+ \"\"`, it sees `<string> + \"\"` and simplifies\r\nthat to `<string> ?? \"\"`. This is unnecessary in this case, but\r\ninadvertently fixes this case.\r\n\r\nThis PR always emits `string.Concat(c) ?? \"\"`. It enhances the logic\r\nwhich extracts the arguments to a call to `string.Concat` so it can unwrap\r\nthe null coalescing operator, and it enhances the `<string> + \"\"` logic\r\nso that it only adds `?? \"\"` if `<string>` is not a call to `string.Concat`\r\n(or `string.Concat(object) ?? \"\"`), since we know that this can never\r\nresult in null.\r\n\r\nThis introduces one more allocation: a single-element ImmutableArray\r\nin some cases.\r\n\r\nIt seems that compiled expressions were never affected by this.

These all simply pass it to `LockFileExtensions.CreateProjectContext`.  In that method, it's used as part of the check to determine if the app is framework dependent:\r\n    ```C#\r\n    bool isFrameworkDependent = (platformLibrary != null || runtimeFrameworks?.Any() == true) &&\r\n        (!isSelfContained || string.IsNullOrEmpty(lockFileTarget.RuntimeIdentifier));\r\n    ```\r\n    Note that for .NET Core 3.0 and higher, the `ResolveFrameworkReferences` should add `RuntimeFramework` items, so the `isFrameworkDependent` calculation should still work.\r\n- In the created `ProjectContext`, the `GetRuntimeLibraries` method excludes assets from the platform library for framework dependent apps.\r\n- The `GenerateRuntimeConfigurationFiles` task also uses the platform library from the `ProjectContext` in order to write the runtimeconfig file, but only if there aren't any `RuntimeFrameworks`.\r\n- The `ResolvePackageAssets` task excludes assets from the platform library in `GetPlatformPackageExclusions`.  (It also excludes assets from libraries matching names of `RuntimeFrameworks`, which I believe we should now remove, as those assets will come from runtime packs and won't be in the assets file anyway now).\r\n- The `_RestoreCrossgen` and `PrepforRestoreForComposeStore` use the platform library name.  These are both part of support for `dotnet store`, which we are [considering dropping](https://github.com/dotnet/sdk/issues/2914), and which will need a lot of work in any case if we want it to work when targeting .NET Core 3","Url":"https://github.com/dotnet/sdk/pull/3019","RelatedDescription":"Closed or merged PR \"Don't set \"platform library\" for .NET Core 3.0 and higher\" (#3019)"},{"Id":"416793797","IsPullRequest":false,"CreatedAt":"2019-03-12T23:01:18","Actor":"SomeAnon42","Number":"3004","RawContent":null,"Title":"ResolvePackageAssets fails when targeting Core 3.0","State":"closed","Body":"```\r\nError\tMSB4018\tThe \"ResolvePackageAssets\" task failed unexpectedly.\r\nSystem.Collections.Generic.KeyNotFoundException: The given key was not present in the dictionary.\r\n   at System.Collections.Generic.Dictionary`2.get_Item(TKey key)\r\n   at Microsoft.NET.Build.Tasks.LockFileExtensions.CollectDependencies(IDictionary`2 libraryLookup, IEnumerable`1 dependencies, HashSet`1 exclusionList) in /_/src/Tasks/Microsoft.NET.Build.Tasks/LockFileExtensions.cs:line 193\r\n   at Microsoft.NET.Build.Tasks.LockFileExtensions.CollectDependencies(IDictionary`2 libraryLookup, IEnumerable`1 dependencies, HashSet`1 exclusionList) in /_/src/Tasks/Microsoft.NET.Build.Tasks/LockFileExtensions.cs:line 180\r\n   at Microsoft.NET.Build.Tasks.LockFileExtensions.GetPlatformExclusionList(LockFileTarget lockFileTarget, LockFileTargetLibrary platformLibrary, IDictionary`2 libraryLookup) in /_/src/Tasks/Microsoft.NET.Build.Tasks/LockFileExtensions.cs:line 153\r\n   at Microsoft.NET.Build.Tasks.ResolvePackageAssets.CacheWriter.GetPlatformPackageExclusions() in /_/src/Tasks/Microsoft.NET.Build.Tasks/ResolvePackageAssets.cs:line 1191\r\n   at Microsoft.NET.Build.Tasks.ResolvePackageAssets.CacheWriter..ctor(ResolvePackageAssets task, Stream stream) in /_/src/Tasks/Microsoft.NET.Build.Tasks/ResolvePackageAssets.cs:line 610\r\n   at Microsoft.NET.Build.Tasks.ResolvePackageAssets.CacheReader.CreateReaderFromDisk(ResolvePackageAssets task, Byte[] settingsHash) in /_/src/Tasks/Microsoft.NET.Build.Tasks/ResolvePackageAssets.cs:line 483\r\n   at Microsoft.NET.Build.Tasks.ResolvePackageAssets.CacheReader..ctor(ResolvePackageAssets task) in /_/src/Tasks/Microsoft.NET.Build.Tasks/ResolvePackageAssets.cs:line 434\r\n   at Microsoft.NET.Build.Tasks.ResolvePackageAssets.ReadItemGroups() in /_/src/Tasks/Microsoft.NET.Build.Tasks/ResolvePackageAssets.cs:line 279\r\n   at Microsoft.NET.Build.Tasks.ResolvePackageAssets.ExecuteCore() in /_/src/Tasks/Microsoft.NET.Build.Tasks/ResolvePackageAssets.cs:line 271\r\n   at Microsoft.NET.Build.Tasks.TaskBase.Execute() in /_/src/Tasks/Common/TaskBase.cs:line 35\r\n   at Microsoft.Build.BackEnd.TaskExecutionHost.Microsoft.Build.BackEnd.ITaskExecutionHost.Execute()\r\n   at Microsoft.Build.BackEnd.TaskBuilder.<ExecuteInstantiatedTask>d__26.MoveNext()\tNitroSharpDbg\tC:\\Program Files\\dotnet\\sdk\\3.0.100-preview4-010582\\Sdks\\Microsoft.NET.Sdk\\targets\\Microsoft.PackageDependencyResolution.targets\t228\t\r\n```\r\n\r\nSteps to reproduce:\r\n1.

So I did it. But when VS 2017 opens solution - it generates `obj`. So I did fix which kinda should work.  But got issues - I followed the path, and got into `C:\\Program Files\\dotnet\\sdk\\2.2.102\\Sdks\\Microsoft.NET.Sdk\\targets\\` folder and into `ProjectAssetsFile`. So here is fix:\r\n```xml\r\n<Project Sdk=\"Microsoft.NET.Sdk\">\r\n  <!-- fixing VS 2017 bug which makes it output directory which is not requested -->\r\n  <PropertyGroup>\r\n    <ProjectAssetsFile>$(MSBuildProjectDirectory)\\.obj\\project.assets.json</ProjectAssetsFile>\r\n  </PropertyGroup>\r\n  <PropertyGroup>\r\n      <PreBuildEvent>\r\n       IF EXIST \"$(MSBuildProjectDirectory)\\.obj\\obj\" (\r\n         rmdir \"$(MSBuildProjectDirectory)\\.obj\\obj\" /s /q\r\n       )\r\n       IF EXIST \"$(MSBuildProjectDirectory)\\obj\" (\r\n         move  \"$(MSBuildProjectDirectory)\\obj\" \"$(MSBuildProjectDirectory)\\.obj\"\r\n       )\r\n      </PreBuildEvent>\r\n      \r\n      <PostBuildEvent>\r\n       IF EXIST \"$(MSBuildProjectDirectory)\\.obj\\obj\" (\r\n         rmdir \"$(MSBuildProjectDirectory)\\.obj\\obj\" /s /q\r\n       )\r\n       IF EXIST \"$(MSBuildProjectDirectory)\\obj\" (\r\n         move  \"$(MSBuildProjectDirectory)\\obj\" \"$(MSBuildProjectDirectory)\\.obj\"\r\n       )\r\n      </PostBuildEvent>      \r\n  </PropertyGroup>\r\n\r\n  <PropertyGroup>\r\n    <TargetFramework>netcoreapp2.2</TargetFramework>\r\n    <LangVersion>latest</LangVersion>\r\n    <IsPackable>false</IsPackable>\r\n  </PropertyGroup>\r\n\r\n  <PropertyGroup Condition=\"'$(Configuration)|$(Platform)'=='Debug|AnyCPU'\">\r\n    <OutputPath>.bin\\Debug\\</OutputPath>\r\n    <BaseIntermediateOutputPath>.obj\\Debug\\</BaseIntermediateOutputPath>\r\n    <IntermediateOutputPath>.obj\\Debug\\</IntermediateOutputPath>\r\n    <BaseOutputPath>.bin\\Debug\\</BaseOutputPath>\r\n    <UseCommonOutputDirectory>true</UseCommonOutputDirectory>\r\n  </PropertyGroup>\r\n  <PropertyGroup Condition=\"'$(Configuration)|$(Platform)'=='Release|AnyCPU'\">\r\n    <OutputPath>.bin\\Release\\</OutputPath>\r\n    <BaseIntermediateOutputPath>.obj\\Release\\</BaseIntermediateOutputPath>\r\n    <IntermediateOutputPath>.obj\\Release\\</IntermediateOutputPath>\r\n    <BaseOutputPath>.bin\\Release\\</BaseOutputPath>\r\n    <UseCommonOutputDirectory>true</UseCommonOutputDirectory>\r\n  </PropertyGroup>\r\n\r\n  <ItemGroup>\r\n    <PackageReference Include=\"Microsoft.NET.Test.Sdk\" Version=\"15.9.0\" />\r\n    <PackageReference Include=\"xunit\" Version=\"$(xUnitVersion)\" />\r\n    <PackageReference Include=\"xunit.runner.visualstudio\" Version=\"$(xUnitVersion)\" />\r\n  </ItemGroup>\r\n  </ItemGroup>  \r\n</Project>\r\n````\r\n\r\n\r\nThere is other workaround. Very weird - depends on order of and some hacky `Import` declarations, but it breaks `xunit` runner and VS Code. Ssee lines with `Microsoft.NET.Sdk`:\r\n```xml\r\n<Project>\r\n  <PropertyGroup>\r\n    <TargetFramework>netstandard2.0</TargetFramework>\r\n    <LangVersion>latest</LangVersion>\r\n  </PropertyGroup>\r\n  <PropertyGroup Condition=\"'$(Configuration)|$(Platform)'=='Debug|AnyCPU'\">\r\n    <OutputPath>.bin\\Debug\\</OutputPath>\r\n    <BaseIntermediateOutputPath>.obj\\Debug\\</BaseIntermediateOutputPath>\r\n    <IntermediateOutputPath>.obj\\Debug\\</IntermediateOutputPath>\r\n  </PropertyGroup>\r\n  <PropertyGroup Condition=\"'$(Configuration)|$(Platform)'=='Release|AnyCPU'\">\r\n    <OutputPath>.bin\\Release\\</OutputPath>\r\n    <BaseIntermediateOutputPath>.obj\\Release\\</BaseIntermediateOutputPath>\r\n    <IntermediateOutputPath>.obj\\Release\\</IntermediateOutputPath>\r\n  </PropertyGroup>\r\n  <Import Project=\"Sdk.props\" Sdk=\"Microsoft.NET.Sdk\" />\r\n  <ItemGroup>\r\n    <None Remove=\".gitignore\" />\r\n\r\n    <None Remove=\"**/*.meta\" />\r\n  </ItemGroup>\r\n\r\n  <ItemGroup>\r\n    <PackageReference Include=\"System.Buffers\" Version=\"4.5.0\" />\r\n    <PackageReference Include=\"System.IO.Pipelines\" Version=\"4.5.3\" />\r\n    <PackageReference Include=\"System.Memory\" Version=\"4.5.1\" />\r\n    <PackageReference Include=\"System.Runtime.CompilerServices.Unsafe\" Version=\"4.5.2\" />\r\n  </ItemGroup>\r\n\r\n  <Import Project=\"Sdk.targets\" Sdk=\"Microsoft.NET.Sdk\" />\r\n</Project>\r\n```\r\nDoes next relates dotnet/project-system#1438? \r\n\r\nI was not able to find solution on SO. \r\n\r\nShould I create separate issue with that with steps:\r\n1.

This will reduce the number of SDKs that are installed on programmer machines.\r\n\r\nFeature bands of the SDK are defined like 3.0.1nn. [Find out more about SDK version numbers](https://docs.microsoft.com/dotnet/core/versions/#versioning-details).\r\n\r\nThis means when .NET Core SDK 3.0.101 becomes available and is installed, .NET Core SDK 3.0.100 will be removed from the machine if it exists. When .NET Core SDK 3.0.200 becomes available and is installed on the same machine, .NET Core SDK versions like 3.0.101 will not be removed but stay side by side with 3.0.200.\r\n\r\nThis approach supports use of `global.json` which will roll forward across patch versions, but not feature bands of the SDK.

There are two primary reasons for this change:\r\n\r\n* Syndicate Microsoft-provided container images to multiple registries, like Docker Hub and Red Hat.\r\n* Use Microsoft Azure as a global CDN for delivering Microsoft-provided container images.\r\n\r\nYou will use and see MCR as a storage back-end for Microsoft images. The primary way you learn about Microsoft container images and tags will be through a registry, which for most users will continue to be Docker Hub. Most of the experience you've had browsing for .NET Core container images will continue unchanged with this new model. The Docker Hub URLs you've used for Microsoft repos will continue to work, and forward to updated locations on Docker Hub. Existing Docker Hub will images will be maintained as-is.\r\n\r\nSee [.NET Core Container Images now Published to Microsoft Container Registry](https://devblogs.microsoft.com/dotnet/net-core-container-images-now-published-to-microsoft-container-registry/) for the most updated information on our use of MCR.\r\n\r\n## Discussion\r\nPlease share your thoughts on this change and see what others are saying at:\r\n\r\n* [dotnet-docker #935](https://github.com/dotnet/dotnet-docker/issues/935)\r\n\r\n## Starting with .NET Core nightly repo\r\n\r\nOn the .NET team, we started our [transition to MCR](https://github.com/dotnet/dotnet-docker/issues/745) with the .NET Core \"nightly\" repo. [dotnet-nightly](dockerhub.com/r/microsoft/dotnet-nightly) is now hosted on MCR and syndicated to Docker Hub. We started with the nightly repo in order to discover and fix any challenges we found with this new model before we move our higher-traffic primary container repository.\r\n\r\nWe will start publishing [dotnet](dockerhub.com/r/microsoft/dotnet) to MCR a bit later, in either February or March. This issue will be updated when that happens.\r\n\r\n## Repo Split\r\n\r\nThe [.NET Core repo](https://hub.docker.com/r/microsoft/dotnet) currently includes 4 major categories of tags: \r\n\r\n* `sdk`\r\n* `aspnetcore-runtime`\r\n* `runtime` \r\n* `runtime-deps`\r\n\r\nProviding all of the tags in one place has helped with discoverability but made for a repo with an enormous README that can be challenging to navigate and consume. It is large enough that we exceeded Docker Hub README limits and had to artificially make it smaller.\r\n\r\nGoing forward, we will provide a repo for each of the tag categories listed above. We'll also provide a \"product repo\" that will hierarchicaly group all of our repos together. This will satisfy discoverability needs so that it will be easy to find the tags you want.\r\n\r\nYou can already see this experience with [microsoft-dotnet-core-nightly](https://hub.docker.com/_/microsoft-dotnet-core-nightly). There are now multiple repos for our nightly builds:\r\n\r\n* [.NET Core Nightly product repo](https://hub.docker.com/_/microsoft-dotnet-core-nightly)\r\n* [.NET Core SDK Nightly repo](https://hub.docker.com/_/microsoft-dotnet-core-nightly-sdk/)\r\n* [.NET Core ASP.NET Core Nightly repo](https://hub.docker.com/_/microsoft-dotnet-core-nightly-aspnet/)\r\n* [.NET Core Runtime Nightly repo](https://hub.docker.com/_/microsoft-dotnet-core-nightly-runtime/)\r\n* [.NET Core Runtime-deps Nightly repo](https://hub.docker.com/_/microsoft-dotnet-core-nightly-runtime-deps/)\r\n\r\nThe same split will exist for the non-nightly stable repo (currently hosted at  [microsoft/dotnet](https://hub.docker.com/r/microsoft/dotnet)) when we start publishing it to MCR and syndicating it back to DockerHub.\r\n\r\n## Changes to registry URL\r\n\r\nThe biggest change is that your Dockerfiles need to be updated to point to the MCR registry in order get access to new .NET Core container tags. The same change is required for scripts or human operations that pull images via `docker pull`.\r\n\r\nThe following example shows the registry path, repo and tag for the .NET Core 2.2 \"Nightly\" SDK on MCR:\r\n\r\n```console\r\nmcr.microsoft.com/dotnet/core-nightly/sdk:2.2\r\n```\r\n\r\nAs comparison, the following repo and tag have been used to date for the .NET Core 2.2 \"Nightly\" SDK on Docker Hub:\r\n\r\n```console\r\nmicrosoft/dotnet-nightly:2.2-sdk\r\n```\r\n\r\nThe new repo URL is provided at each of the news repos. For example, the new .NET Core SDK \"nightly\" repo provides a box on the right where you can copy and paste the correct MCR-based repo syntax that you can use for `docker pull` or in `FROM` statements in your Dockerfiles.\r\n\r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/2608468/52811702-95c5eb80-304a-11e9-8de8-e6ea1f4b4d75.png)\r\n\r\n## Servicing existing Docker Hub tags\r\n\r\nWe will continue to service existing non-version-specific or floating tags on Docker Hub while the associated .NET Core version is supported. For example the `microsoft/dotnet:2.1-sdk` tag is a floating tag that will continue to be serviced for the lifetime of .NET Core 2.1. You can continue using floating tags without issue.\r\n\r\nIf you use non-floating tags, like `microsoft/dotnet:2.1.504-sdk-alpine`, then you will need to update your Dockerfile to use a new non-floating tag. No new non-floating tags will be published to `microsoft/dotnet` and `microsoft/dotnet-nightly` after we fully transition to MCR.\r\n\r\n.NET Core 3.0 Preview 3 and later will only be made available on MCR.\r\n\r\n## Microsoft is a Verified Publisher\r\n\r\nUntil now, Microsoft-provided container images were considered \"community images\". As part of this change, we are re-classifying Microsoft as a \"verified publisher\" on Docker Hub. This designation should make it clearer that .NET and other Microsoft-provided images are coming from a verified source. There clearly was that expectation previously, but Docker is now making that clearer in the Docker Hub pages they host for Microsoft.\r\n\r\nWe will provide official vulnerability scanning Microsoft-provided images as a second phase of this transition.","Url":"https://github.com/dotnet/announcements/issues/101","RelatedDescription":"Open issue \"Publishing .NET Core images to Microsoft Container Registry (MCR)\" (#101)"},{"Id":"410784442","IsPullRequest":false,"CreatedAt":"2019-02-15T14:06:29","Actor":"TaraOverfield","Number":"100","RawContent":null,"Title":"RESOLVED: Advisory on February 2019 Security update for Windows 10 update 1809","State":"open","Body":"<strong><em>Final Update 2/19/19 @1:30 PM (PST)</em></strong><em>: This </em><em>advisory is now resolved with no action needed from Microsoft Customers.

You can either [use Visual Studio’s Solution Explorer](#vs-solution-explorer), or you can review [the `project.assets.json` file](#project-assets-json)).\r\n\r\n##### <a name=\"vs-solution-explorer\"></a>Using Visual Studio Solution Explorer\r\n\r\nTo use Solution Explorer, open the project in Visual Studio, and then press Ctrl+; to activate the search in Solution Explorer. Search for the [vulnerable package](#affected-software) and make a note of the version numbers of any results you find.\r\n\r\nFor example, searching for `Microsoft.AspNetCore.Mvc.Core` in an example project that contains a package that takes a dependency on `Microsoft.AspNetCore.Mvc` shows the following results in Visual Studio 2017:\r\n\r\n![Screenshot of search results in Visual Studio 2017](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/796298/25858816/8ecdc2b4-3491-11e7-9363-746804bb9832.png)\r\n\r\nThe search results appear as a tree. In the previous results, you can see that a reference to `Microsoft.AspNetCore.Mvc.Core` version 1.1.2 is discovered.\r\n\r\nUnder the Dependencies node is a NuGet node. Under the NuGet node is the list of packages you have directly taken a dependency on and their versions.\r\nIn screenshot, the application takes a direct dependency on `Microsoft.AspNetCore.Mvc`. `Microsoft.AspNetCore.Mvc` in turn has leaf nodes that list its dependencies and their versions.\r\nThe `Microsoft.AspNetCore.Mvc` package takes a dependency on a version of `Microsoft.AspNetCore.Mvc.ApiExplorer`, that in turn takes a dependency on a version of `Microsoft.AspNetCore.Mvc.Core`.\r\n\r\n##### <a name=\"project-assets-json\"></a> Manually reviewing project.assets.json\r\n\r\nOpen the *project.assets.json* file from your project’s obj directory in your editor. We suggest you use an editor that understands JSON and allows you to collapse and expand nodes to review this file.\r\nVisual Studio and Visual Studio Code provide JSON friendly editing.\r\n\r\nSearch the *project.assets.json* file for the [vulnerable package](#affected-software), using the format `packagename/` for each of the package names from the preceding table. If you find the assembly name in your search:\r\n\r\n* Examine the line on which they are found, the version number is after the `/`.\r\n* Compare to the [vulnerable versions table](#affected-software).\r\n\r\nFor example, a search result that shows `System.Private.Uri/4.3.0` is a reference to version 4.3.0 of `System.Private.Uri`.\r\n\r\nIf your *project.assets.json* file includes references to the [vulnerable package](#affected-software), then you need to fix the transitive dependencies.\r\n\r\nIf you have not found any reference to any vulnerable packages, this means either\r\n\r\n* None of your direct dependencies depend on any vulnerable packages, or\r\n* You have already fixed the problem by updating the direct dependencies.\r\n\r\n### <a name=\"how-fix\"></a>How do I fix the issue?\r\n\r\n#### Updating the version of Microsoft.NETCore.App\r\n\r\nIf your host version is a 2.1.x host you must install version 2.1.8 or later of the [.NET Core 2.1 runtime](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/download/dotnet-core/2.1), or corresponding [.NET Core 2.1 SDK](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/download/dotnet-core/2.1).\r\n\r\nIf your host version is a 2.2.x you must install version 2.2.2 or later of the [.NET Core 2.2 runtime](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/download/dotnet-core/2.2), or corresponding  [.NET Core 2.2 SDK](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/download/dotnet-core/2.2).\r\n\r\n#### <a name=\"fixing-direct-dependencies\"></a>Fixing direct dependencies\r\n\r\nOpen *projectname.csproj* in your editor. If you're using Visual Studio, right-click the project and choose **Edit projectname.csproj** from the context menu, where projectname is the name of your project. Look for `PackageReference` elements. The following shows an example project file:\r\n\r\n```xml\r\n<Project Sdk=\"Microsoft.NET.Sdk.Web\">\r\n  <PropertyGroup>\r\n    <TargetFramework>netcoreapp2.1</TargetFramework>\r\n  </PropertyGroup>\r\n  <ItemGroup>\r\n    <PackageReference Include=\"System.Private.Uri\" Version=\"4.3.0\" />\r\n  </ItemGroup>\r\n</Project>\r\n```\r\n\r\nThe preceding example has a reference to the [vulnerable package](#affected-software), as seen by the single `PackageReference` element. The name of the package is in the `Include` attribute.\r\nThe package version number is in the `Version` attribute. The previous example shows a single direct dependency on `System.Private.Uri` version 4.3.0\r\n\r\nTo update the version to the secure package, change the version number to the updated package version as listed on the table [previously](#affected-software).\r\nIn this example, update `System.Private.Uri` to the appropriate [fixed package number](#affected-software) for your major version. Save the *csproj* file. The example *csproj* now looks as follows:\r\n\r\n```xml\r\n<Project Sdk=\"Microsoft.NET.Sdk.Web\">\r\n  <PropertyGroup>\r\n    <TargetFramework>netcoreapp2.1</TargetFramework>\r\n  </PropertyGroup>\r\n  <ItemGroup>\r\n    <PackageReference Include=\"System.Private.Uri\" Version=\"4.3.0\" />\r\n  </ItemGroup>\r\n</Project>\r\n```\r\n\r\nIf you're using Visual Studio and you save your updated *csproj* file, Visual Studio will restore the new package version.\r\nYou can see the restore results by opening the **Output** window (Ctrl+Alt+O) and changing the **Show output from** drop-down list to **Package Manager**.\r\n\r\nIf you're not using Visual Studio, open a command line and change to your project directory. Execute the `dotnet restore` command to restore the updated dependencies.\r\n\r\nNow recompile your application. If after recompilation you see a *Dependency conflict warning*, you must update your other direct dependencies to versions that take a dependency on the updated package.\r\n\r\n#### <a name=\"transitive-dependencies\"></a>Fixing transitive dependencies\r\n\r\nIf your transitive dependency review found references to the [vulnerable package](#affected-software), you must add a direct dependency to the updated package to your *csproj* file to override the transitive dependency.\r\n\r\nOpen *projectname.csproj* in your editor. If you're using Visual Studio, right-click the project and choose **Edit projectname.csproj** from the context menu, where projectname is the name of your project.\r\nLook for `PackageReference` nodes, for example:\r\n\r\n```xml\r\n<Project Sdk=\"Microsoft.NET.Sdk.\">\r\n  <PropertyGroup>\r\n    <TargetFramework>net461</TargetFramework>\r\n  </PropertyGroup>\r\n  <ItemGroup>\r\n    <PackageReference Include=\"ThirdParty.NotUpdatedYet\" Version=\"2.0.0\" />\r\n  </ItemGroup>\r\n</Project>\r\n```\r\n\r\nYou must add a direct dependency to the updated version of the [vulnerable package](#affected-software) by adding it to the *csproj* file.\r\nYou do this by adding a new line to the dependencies section, referencing the fixed version.\r\nFor example, if your search showed a transitive reference to a vulnerable `System.ServiceModel.Http` version, you'd add a reference to the [fixed package number](#affected-software).\r\n\r\n```xml\r\n<Project Sdk=\"Microsoft.NET.Sdk.Web\">\r\n  <PropertyGroup>\r\n    <TargetFramework>net461</TargetFramework>\r\n  </PropertyGroup>\r\n  <ItemGroup>\r\n    <PackageReference Include=\"System.Private.Uri\" Version=\"4.3.0\" />\r\n    <PackageReference Include=\"ThirdParty.NotUpdatedYet\" Version=\"2.0.0\" />\r\n  </ItemGroup>\r\n</Project>\r\n```\r\n\r\nAfter you've added the direct dependency reference, save your *csproj* file.\r\n\r\nIf you're using Visual Studio, save your updated *csproj* file and Visual Studio will restore the new package versions.\r\nYou can see the restore results by opening the **Output** window (Ctrl+Alt+O) and changing the **Show output from** drop-down list to **Package Manager**.\r\n\r\nIf you're not using Visual Studio, open a command line and change to your project directory. Execute the `dotnet restore` command to restore the new dependencies.\r\n\r\n##### Rebuilding your application\r\n\r\nFinally, you must rebuild your application, test, and redeploy.\r\n\r\n## Other Information\r\n\r\n### Reporting Security Issues\r\n\r\nIf you have found a potential security issue in .NET Core, please email details to secure@microsoft.com.

If you are not using Microsoft.NetCore.App, you may still be affected if you are referencing the packages listed above.\r\n\r\n##### Direct dependencies\r\n\r\nDirect dependencies are discoverable by examining your `csproj` file. They can be fixed by [editing the project file](#fixing-direct-dependencies) or using NuGet to update the dependency.\r\n\r\n##### Transitive dependencies\r\n\r\nTransitive dependencies occur when you add a package to your project that in turn relies on another package. For example, if Contoso publishes a package `Contoso.Utility` which, in turn, depends on `Contoso.Internals` and you add the `Contoso.Utility` package to your project now your project has a direct dependency on `Contoso.Utility` and, because `Contoso.Utility` depends 'Contoso.Internals', your application gains a transitive dependency on the `Contoso.Internals` package.\r\n\r\nTransitive dependencies are reviewable in two ways:\r\n\r\n* In the Visual Studio Solution Explorer window, which supports searching.\r\n* By examining the `project.assets.json` file contained in the obj directory of your project for `csproj` based projects\r\n\r\nThe `project.assets.json` files are the authoritative list of all packages used by your project, containing both direct and transitive dependencies.\r\n\r\nThere are two ways to view transitive dependencies. You can either [use Visual Studio’s Solution Explorer](#vs-solution-explorer), or you can review [the `project.assets.json` file](#project-assets-json)).\r\n\r\n##### <a name=\"vs-solution-explorer\"></a>Using Visual Studio Solution Explorer\r\n\r\nTo use Solution Explorer, open the project in Visual Studio, and then press Ctrl+; to activate the search in Solution Explorer. Search for the [vulnerable package](#affected-software) and make a note of the version numbers of any results you find.\r\n\r\nFor example, searching for `Microsoft.AspNetCore.Mvc.Core` in an example project that contains a package that takes a dependency on `Microsoft.AspNetCore.Mvc` shows the following results in Visual Studio 2017:\r\n\r\n![Screenshot of search results in Visual Studio 2017](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/796298/25858816/8ecdc2b4-3491-11e7-9363-746804bb9832.png)\r\n\r\nThe search results appear as a tree. In the previous results, you can see that a reference to `Microsoft.AspNetCore.Mvc.Core` version 1.1.2 is discovered.\r\n\r\nUnder the Dependencies node is a NuGet node. Under the NuGet node is the list of packages you have directly taken a dependency on and their versions.\r\nIn screenshot, the application takes a direct dependency on `Microsoft.AspNetCore.Mvc`. `Microsoft.AspNetCore.Mvc` in turn has leaf nodes that list its dependencies and their versions.\r\nThe `Microsoft.AspNetCore.Mvc` package takes a dependency on a version of `Microsoft.AspNetCore.Mvc.ApiExplorer`, that in turn takes a dependency on a version of `Microsoft.AspNetCore.Mvc.Core`.\r\n\r\n##### <a name=\"project-assets-json\"></a> Manually reviewing project.assets.json\r\n\r\nOpen the *project.assets.json* file from your project’s obj directory in your editor. We suggest you use an editor that understands JSON and allows you to collapse and expand nodes to review this file.\r\nVisual Studio and Visual Studio Code provide JSON friendly editing.\r\n\r\nSearch the *project.assets.json* file for the [vulnerable package](#affected-software), using the format `packagename/` for each of the package names from the preceding table. If you find the assembly name in your search:\r\n\r\n* Examine the line on which they are found, the version number is after the `/`.\r\n* Compare to the [vulnerable versions table](#affected-software).\r\n\r\nFor example, a search result that shows `SSystem.Net.Http/4.3.0` is a reference to version 4.3.0 of `System.Net.Http`.\r\n\r\nIf your *project.assets.json* file includes references to the [vulnerable package](#affected-software), then you need to fix the transitive dependencies.\r\n\r\nIf you have not found any reference to any vulnerable packages, this means either\r\n\r\n* None of your direct dependencies depend on any vulnerable packages, or\r\n* You have already fixed the problem by updating the direct dependencies.\r\n\r\n### <a name=\"how-fix\"></a>How do I fix the issue?\r\n\r\n#### Updating the version of Microsoft.NETCore.App\r\n\r\nIf your host version is a 2.1.x host you must install version 2.1.7 or later of the [.NET Core 2.1 runtime](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/download/dotnet-core/2.1), or corresponding [.NET Core 2.1 SDK](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/download/dotnet-core/2.1).\r\n\r\nIf your host version is a 2.2.x you must install version 2.2.1 or later of the [.NET Core 2.2 runtime](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/download/dotnet-core/2.2), or corresponding  [.NET Core 2.2 SDK](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/download/dotnet-core/2.2).\r\n\r\n#### <a name=\"fixing-direct-dependencies\"></a>Fixing direct dependencies\r\n\r\nOpen *projectname.csproj* in your editor. If you're using Visual Studio, right-click the project and choose **Edit projectname.csproj** from the context menu, where projectname is the name of your project. Look for `PackageReference` elements. The following shows an example project file:\r\n\r\n```xml\r\n<Project Sdk=\"Microsoft.NET.Sdk.Web\">\r\n  <PropertyGroup>\r\n    <TargetFramework>netcoreapp2.1</TargetFramework>\r\n  </PropertyGroup>\r\n  <ItemGroup>\r\n    <PackageReference Include=\"System.Net.Http\" Version=\"4.3.0\" />\r\n  </ItemGroup>\r\n</Project>\r\n```\r\n\r\nThe preceding example has a reference to the [vulnerable package](#affected-software), as seen by the single `PackageReference` element. The name of the package is in the `Include` attribute.\r\nThe package version number is in the `Version` attribute. The previous example shows a single direct dependency on `System.Net.Http` version 4.3.0\r\n\r\nTo update the version to the secure package, change the version number to the updated package version as listed on the table [previously](#affected-software).\r\nIn this example, update `System.IO.Pipelines` to the appropriate [fixed package number](#affected-software) for your major version. Save the *csproj* file. The example *csproj* now looks as follows:\r\n\r\n```xml\r\n<Project Sdk=\"Microsoft.NET.Sdk.Web\">\r\n  <PropertyGroup>\r\n    <TargetFramework>netcoreapp2.1</TargetFramework>\r\n  </PropertyGroup>\r\n  <ItemGroup>\r\n    <PackageReference Include=\"System.Net.Http\" Version=\"4.3.5\" />\r\n  </ItemGroup>\r\n</Project>\r\n```\r\n\r\nIf you're using Visual Studio and you save your updated *csproj* file, Visual Studio will restore the new package version.\r\nYou can see the restore results by opening the **Output** window (Ctrl+Alt+O) and changing the **Show output from** drop-down list to **Package Manager**.\r\n\r\nIf you're not using Visual Studio, open a command line and change to your project directory. Execute the `dotnet restore` command to restore the updated dependencies.\r\n\r\nNow recompile your application. If after recompilation you see a *Dependency conflict warning*, you must update your other direct dependencies to versions that take a dependency on the updated package.\r\n\r\n#### <a name=\"transitive-dependencies\"></a>Fixing transitive dependencies\r\n\r\nIf your transitive dependency review found references to the [vulnerable package](#affected-software), you must add a direct dependency to the updated package to your *csproj* file to override the transitive dependency.\r\n\r\nOpen *projectname.csproj* in your editor. If you're using Visual Studio, right-click the project and choose **Edit projectname.csproj** from the context menu, where projectname is the name of your project.\r\nLook for `PackageReference` nodes, for example:\r\n\r\n```xml\r\n<Project Sdk=\"Microsoft.NET.Sdk.\">\r\n  <PropertyGroup>\r\n    <TargetFramework>net461</TargetFramework>\r\n  </PropertyGroup>\r\n  <ItemGroup>\r\n    <PackageReference Include=\"ThirdParty.NotUpdatedYet\" Version=\"2.0.0\" />\r\n  </ItemGroup>\r\n</Project>\r\n```\r\n\r\nYou must add a direct dependency to the updated version of the [vulnerable package](#affected-software) by adding it to the *csproj* file.\r\nYou do this by adding a new line to the dependencies section, referencing the fixed version.\r\nFor example, if your search showed a transitive reference to a vulnerable `System.ServiceModel.Http` version, you'd add a reference to the [fixed package number](#affected-software).\r\n\r\n```xml\r\n<Project Sdk=\"Microsoft.NET.Sdk.Web\">\r\n  <PropertyGroup>\r\n    <TargetFramework>net461</TargetFramework>\r\n  </PropertyGroup>\r\n  <ItemGroup>\r\n    <PackageReference Include=\"System.Net.Http\" Version=\"4.3.5\" />\r\n    <PackageReference Include=\"ThirdParty.NotUpdatedYet\" Version=\"2.0.0\" />\r\n  </ItemGroup>\r\n</Project>\r\n```\r\n\r\nAfter you've added the direct dependency reference, save your *csproj* file.\r\n\r\nIf you're using Visual Studio, save your updated *csproj* file and Visual Studio will restore the new package versions.\r\nYou can see the restore results by opening the **Output** window (Ctrl+Alt+O) and changing the **Show output from** drop-down list to **Package Manager**.\r\n\r\nIf you're not using Visual Studio, open a command line and change to your project directory. Execute the `dotnet restore` command to restore the new dependencies.\r\n\r\n##### Rebuilding your application\r\n\r\nFinally, you must rebuild your application, test, and redeploy.\r\n\r\n## Other Information\r\n\r\n### Reporting Security Issues\r\n\r\nIf you have found a potential security issue in .NET Core, please email details to secure@microsoft.com.

However, .NET hasn't had a (great) built-in way to deal with JSON. Instead we've relied on [Json.NET] which continues to serve the .NET ecosystem well.\r\n\r\n[Json.NET]: https://www.newtonsoft.com/json\r\n\r\nMoving forward, we plan on making some changes to our JSON support:\r\n\r\n* **We need high-performance JSON APIs**. We need a new set of JSON APIs that are highly tuned for performance by using `Span<T>` and allows for processing UTF-8 directly without having to transcode to UTF-16 `string` instances. Both aspects are critical for our web server Kestrel, where throughput is a key requirement.\r\n\r\n* **Remove dependency from ASP.NET Core to Json.NET**. Today, ASP.NET Core has a dependency on Json.NET. While this provides a tight integration between ASP.NET Core and Json.NET, it also means that application developers cannot freely choose which JSON library they are using. This is also problematic for customers of Json.NET as the version is dictated by the underlying platform. However, Json.NET is frequently updated and application developers often want to -- or even have to -- use a specific version. Thus, we want to remove the dependency from ASP.NET Core 3.0 to Json.NET so that customers can choose which version to use, without fearing they might accidentally break the underlying platform. In addition, this makes it also possible to plug-in an entirely different JSON library.\r\n\r\n* **Provide an ASP.NET Core integration package for Json.NET**. Json.NET has basically become the Swiss Army knife of JSON processing in .NET. It provides many options and facilities that allow customers to handle their JSON needs with ease. We don't want to compromise on the Json.NET support customers are getting today, for example, the ability to configure the JSON serialization via the `AddJsonOptions` extension method. Thus, we want to provide the Json.NET integration as a NuGet package that developers can optionally install so they get all the bells and whistles they get from Json.NET today. The other part of this work item is to ensure we have the right extension points so that other parties can provide similar integration packages for their JSON library of choice.\r\n\r\nBelow are more details around this plan.\r\n\r\n## The need for high-performance JSON APIs\r\n\r\nThe requirements for the .NET stack have changed a bit since the arrival of .NET Core. Historically, .NET has valued usability and convenience. With .NET Core, we've added a focus on performance, and we've made significant investments to serve high performance needs. And the [improvements we made][techempower] in the popular TechEmpower benchmark are a testament to that.\r\n\r\n[techempower]: https://www.techempower.com/blog/2016/11/16/framework-benchmarks-round-13/\r\n\r\nWith .NET Core 2.1, we've added a brand new primitive called [Span\\<T>][span-msdn] that allows us to represent native memory and arrays in a uniform way. With this type, we've also added a set of parsing and encoding APIs that are much more memory efficient without having to resort to unsafe code.\r\n\r\n[span-msdn]: https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/magazine/mt814808.aspx\r\n\r\nPart of the work of minimizing allocations is to avoid having to transcode UTF-8 payloads into UTF-16 strings, purely for parsing reasons. Currently, Json.NET is implemented by reading UTF-16. We need the ability to read (and write) JSON documents directly in UTF-8 because most network protocols (including HTTP) use UTF-8.\r\n\r\nDuring .NET Core 2.1 we've learned that updating our existing APIs to leverage `Span<T>` has limits. While we did add a bunch of overloads that accept spans, we also had to produce brand new APIs that are designed around minimizing allocations and dealing with buffers, which we exposed in `System.Buffers` namespaces. And with `System.IO.Pipelines` we've also added a programming model that enables developers to share buffers without having to deal with lifetime issues.\r\n\r\nBased on these experiences we believe in order to support JSON parsing, we'll need to expose a new set of JSON APIs that are specifically geared for high-performance scenarios.\r\n\r\nYou might wonder why we can't just update Json.NET to include support for parsing JSON using `Span<T>`? Well, James Newton-King -- the author of Json.NET -- has the following to say about that:\r\n\r\n> Json.NET was created over 10 years ago, and since then it has added a wide range of features aimed to help developers work with JSON in .NET. In that time Json.NET has also become far and away NuGet's most depended on and downloaded package, and is the go-to library for JSON support in .NET. Unfortunately, Json.NET's wealth of features and popularity works against making major changes to it. Supporting new technologies like `Span<T>` would require fundamental breaking changes to the library and would disrupt existing applications and libraries that depend on it.\r\n>\r\n> Going forward Json.NET will continue to be worked on and invested in, both addressing known issues today and supporting new platforms in the future. Json.NET has always existed alongside other JSON libraries for .NET, and there will be nothing to prevent you using one or more together, depending on whether you need the performance of the new JSON APIs or the large feature set of Json.NET.\r\n\r\n## Move Json.NET integration into a separate NuGet package\r\n\r\nToday, you cannot use ASP.NET Core without Json.NET because it is a dependency of ASP.NET Core itself. Over the years, we've received feedback that the dependency can conflict with other libraries that have their own dependency on a different version of Json.NET. In the past, we've considered addressing this issue by using a private copy of Json.NET in ASP.NET. However, this would create problems when developers want to configure Json.NET (for instance, in order to control how the serializer behaves when formatting JSON objects).\r\n\r\nMoving forward we'd like to:\r\n\r\n1. Replace the internal usage of Json.NET in ASP.NET Core by the new platform-provided JSON APIs.\r\n\r\n2. Factor the public facing usage of Json.NET into an optional integration package that can be acquired from NuGet.\r\n\r\nSo the existing integration between ASP.NET Core and Json.NET will continue to be supported, but will be moving out of the platform and into a separate package. However, since the integration is then designed to sit on top of the platform, it will also allow customers to update Json.NET to later versions.\r\n\r\nFurthermore, customers who need more performance can also choose to use the new JSON APIs, at the expense of the rich feature set that Json.NET offers.\r\n\r\n## Discussion\r\n\r\nFor a discussion, please go to https://github.com/dotnet/corefx/issues/33115.","Url":"https://github.com/dotnet/announcements/issues/90","RelatedDescription":"Open issue \"The future of JSON in .NET Core 3.0\" (#90)"},{"Id":"368440353","IsPullRequest":false,"CreatedAt":"2018-10-09T23:44:06","Actor":"vivmishra","Number":"89","RawContent":null,"Title":"October 2018 .NET Updates","State":"open","Body":"# October 2018 .NET Updates\r\n\r\nThe following .NET updates were released in October 2018.

If you are not using Microsoft.AspNetCore.App or .All, you may still be affected if you are referencing the System.IO.Pipelines package.\r\n\r\n##### Direct dependencies\r\n\r\nDirect dependencies are discoverable by examining your `csproj` file. They can be fixed by [editing the project file](#fixing-direct-dependencies) or using NuGet to update the dependency.\r\n\r\n##### Transitive dependencies\r\n\r\nTransitive dependencies occur when you add a package to your project that in turn relies on another package. For example, if Contoso publishes a package `Contoso.Utility` which, in turn, depends on `Contoso.Internals` and you add the `Contoso.Utility` package to your project now your project has a direct dependency on `Contoso.Utility` and, because `Contoso.Utility` depends 'Contoso.Internals', your application gains a transitive dependency on the `Contoso.Internals` package.\r\n\r\nTransitive dependencies are reviewable in two ways:\r\n\r\n* In the Visual Studio Solution Explorer window, which supports searching.\r\n* By examining the `project.assets.json` file contained in the obj directory of your project for `csproj` based projects\r\n\r\nThe `project.assets.json` files are the authoritative list of all packages used by your project, containing both direct and transitive dependencies.\r\n\r\nThere are two ways to view transitive dependencies. You can either [use Visual Studio’s Solution Explorer](#vs-solution-explorer), or you can review [the `project.assets.json` file](#project-assets-json)).\r\n\r\n##### <a name=\"vs-solution-explorer\"></a>Using Visual Studio Solution Explorer\r\n\r\nTo use Solution Explorer, open the project in Visual Studio, and then press Ctrl+; to activate the search in Solution Explorer. Search for the [vulnerable package](#affected-software) and make a note of the version numbers of any results you find.\r\n\r\nFor example, searching for `Microsoft.AspNetCore.Mvc.Core` in an example project that contains a package that takes a dependency on `Microsoft.AspNetCore.Mvc` shows the following results in Visual Studio 2017:\r\n\r\n![Screenshot of search results in Visual Studio 2017](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/796298/25858816/8ecdc2b4-3491-11e7-9363-746804bb9832.png)\r\n\r\nThe search results appear as a tree. In the previous results, you can see that a reference to `Microsoft.AspNetCore.Mvc.Core` version 1.1.2 is discovered.\r\n\r\nUnder the Dependencies node is a NuGet node. Under the NuGet node is the list of packages you have directly taken a dependency on and their versions.\r\nIn screenshot, the application takes a direct dependency on `Microsoft.AspNetCore.Mvc`. `Microsoft.AspNetCore.Mvc` in turn has leaf nodes that list its dependencies and their versions.\r\nThe `Microsoft.AspNetCore.Mvc` package takes a dependency on a version of `Microsoft.AspNetCore.Mvc.ApiExplorer`, that in turn takes a dependency on a version of `Microsoft.AspNetCore.Mvc.Core`.\r\n\r\n##### <a name=\"project-assets-json\"></a> Manually reviewing project.assets.json\r\n\r\nOpen the *project.assets.json* file from your project’s obj directory in your editor. We suggest you use an editor that understands JSON and allows you to collapse and expand nodes to review this file.\r\nVisual Studio and Visual Studio Code provide JSON friendly editing.\r\n\r\nSearch the *project.assets.json* file for the [vulnerable package](#affected-software), using the format `packagename/` for each of the package names from the preceding table. If you find the assembly name in your search:\r\n\r\n* Examine the line on which they are found, the version number is after the `/`.\r\n* Compare to the [vulnerable versions table](#affected-software).\r\n\r\nFor example, a search result that shows `System.IO.Pipelines/4.5.0` is a reference to version 4.5.0 of `System.IO.Pipelines`.\r\n\r\nIf your *project.assets.json* file includes references to the [vulnerable package](#affected-software), then you need to fix the transitive dependencies.\r\n\r\nIf you have not found any reference to any vulnerable packages, this means either\r\n\r\n* None of your direct dependencies depend on any vulnerable packages, or\r\n* You have already fixed the problem by updating the direct dependencies.\r\n\r\n### <a name=\"how-fix\"></a>How do I fix the issue?\r\n\r\n#### <a name=\"fixing-direct-dependencies\"></a>Fixing direct dependencies\r\n\r\nOpen *projectname.csproj* in your editor. If you're using Visual Studio, right-click the project and choose **Edit projectname.csproj** from the context menu, where projectname is the name of your project. Look for `PackageReference` elements. The following shows an example project file:\r\n\r\n```xml\r\n<Project Sdk=\"Microsoft.NET.Sdk.Web\">\r\n  <PropertyGroup>\r\n    <TargetFramework>netcoreapp2.1</TargetFramework>\r\n  </PropertyGroup>\r\n  <ItemGroup>\r\n    <PackageReference Include=\"System.IO.Pipelines\" Version=\"4.5.0\" />\r\n  </ItemGroup>\r\n</Project>\r\n```\r\n\r\nThe preceding example has a reference to the [vulnerable package](#affected-software), as seen by the single `PackageReference` element. The name of the package is in the `Include` attribute.\r\nThe package version number is in the `Version` attribute. The previous example shows a single direct dependency on `System.IO.Pipelines` version 4.5.0\r\n\r\nTo update the version to the secure package, change the version number to the updated package version as listed on the table [previously](#affected-software).\r\nIn this example, update `System.IO.Pipelines` to the appropriate [fixed package number](#affected-software) for your major version. Save the *csproj* file. The example *csproj* now looks as follows:\r\n\r\n```xml\r\n<Project Sdk=\"Microsoft.NET.Sdk.Web\">\r\n  <PropertyGroup>\r\n    <TargetFramework>netcoreapp2.1</TargetFramework>\r\n  </PropertyGroup>\r\n  <ItemGroup>\r\n    <PackageReference Include=\"System.IO.Pipelines\" Version=\"4.5.1\" />\r\n  </ItemGroup>\r\n</Project>\r\n```\r\n\r\nIf you're using Visual Studio and you save your updated *csproj* file, Visual Studio will restore the new package version.\r\nYou can see the restore results by opening the **Output** window (Ctrl+Alt+O) and changing the **Show output from** drop-down list to **Package Manager**.\r\n\r\nIf you're not using Visual Studio, open a command line and change to your project directory. Execute the `dotnet restore` command to restore the updated dependencies.\r\n\r\nNow recompile your application. If after recompilation you see a *Dependency conflict warning*, you must update your other direct dependencies to versions that take a dependency on the updated package.\r\n\r\n#### <a name=\"transitive-dependencies\"></a>Fixing transitive dependencies\r\n\r\nIf your transitive dependency review found references to the [vulnerable package](#affected-software), you must add a direct dependency to the updated package to your *csproj* file to override the transitive dependency.\r\n\r\nOpen *projectname.csproj* in your editor. If you're using Visual Studio, right-click the project and choose **Edit projectname.csproj** from the context menu, where projectname is the name of your project.\r\nLook for `PackageReference` nodes, for example:\r\n\r\n```xml\r\n<Project Sdk=\"Microsoft.NET.Sdk.\">\r\n  <PropertyGroup>\r\n    <TargetFramework>net461</TargetFramework>\r\n  </PropertyGroup>\r\n  <ItemGroup>\r\n    <PackageReference Include=\"ThirdParty.NotUpdatedYet\" Version=\"2.0.0\" />\r\n  </ItemGroup>\r\n</Project>\r\n```\r\n\r\nYou must add a direct dependency to the updated version of the [vulnerable package](#affected-software) by adding it to the *csproj* file.\r\nYou do this by adding a new line to the dependencies section, referencing the fixed version.\r\nFor example, if your search showed a transitive reference to a vulnerable `System.ServiceModel.Http` version, you'd add a reference to the [fixed package number](#affected-software).\r\n\r\n```xml\r\n<Project Sdk=\"Microsoft.NET.Sdk.Web\">\r\n  <PropertyGroup>\r\n    <TargetFramework>net461</TargetFramework>\r\n  </PropertyGroup>\r\n  <ItemGroup>\r\n    <PackageReference Include=\"System.IO.Pipelines\" Version=\"4.5.1\" />\r\n    <PackageReference Include=\"ThirdParty.NotUpdatedYet\" Version=\"2.0.0\" />\r\n  </ItemGroup>\r\n</Project>\r\n```\r\n\r\nAfter you've added the direct dependency reference, save your *csproj* file.\r\n\r\nIf you're using Visual Studio, save your updated *csproj* file and Visual Studio will restore the new package versions.\r\nYou can see the restore results by opening the **Output** window (Ctrl+Alt+O) and changing the **Show output from** drop-down list to **Package Manager**.\r\n\r\nIf you're not using Visual Studio, open a command line and change to your project directory. Execute the `dotnet restore` command to restore the new dependencies.\r\n\r\n#### Rebuilding your application\r\n\r\nFinally you must rebuild your application, test, and redeploy.\r\n\r\n## Other Information\r\n\r\n### Reporting Security Issues\r\n\r\nIf you have found a potential security issue in .NET Core, please email details to secure@microsoft.com.

These packages are decompressed upon installation of the .NET Core SDK. The packages are not currently included in ARM32 distributions due to the time and space cost to decompress the packages. Instead, they will be added to [.NET Core ARM32 Docker images](https://hub.docker.com/r/microsoft/dotnet/), where these costs can be paid as part of image creation.\r\n\r\nThese NuGet packages include content for two purposes:\r\n\r\n- Reference assemblies for .NET Core, for code compilation.\r\n- Pre-compiled assemblies (compiled with [crossgen](https://github.com/dotnet/coreclr/blob/master/Documentation/building/crossgen.md)) for .NET Core, for use in self-contained applications.\r\n\r\nIn both cases, the presence of these packages avoid the need to access remote NuGet feeds for .NET Core assemblies as part of package restore.\r\n\r\nThis change only affects [.NET Core 2.1 SDK ARM32 Docker images](https://hub.docker.com/r/microsoft/dotnet/). This change will be made in August 2018.\r\n\r\n## Discussion\r\n\r\nPlease share your thoughts on this change and see what others are saying at:\r\n\r\n* [dotnet/dotnet-docker #653](https://github.com/dotnet/dotnet-docker/issues/653)\r\n\r\n## .NET Core SDK NugetFallbackFolder\r\n\r\nThe .NET Core SDK includes a compressed copy of all NuGet package, in LZMA format. It exists at the following version-specific location:\r\n\r\n```\r\nroot@3778032bc43d:/# ls -l /usr/share/dotnet/sdk/2.1.302/*.lzma\r\n-rw-r--r-- 1 1004 sudo 35995936 Jul  2 22:51 /usr/share/dotnet/sdk/2.1.302/nuGetPackagesArchive.lzma\r\n```\r\n\r\nThis file is decompressed to the following location: `/usr/share/dotnet/sdk/NuGetFallbackFolder/`\r\n\r\nA package restore for a .NET Core assembly will restore the assembly from the NuGetFallbackFolder location and copy it to the user NuGet cache. At that point, regular NuGet behavior is used.\r\n\r\n## Impact of this change\r\n\r\nThere should be no functional difference in behavior after this change. .NET SDK commands should complete faster and require fewer package restore network requests.\r\n\r\nThe following examples demonstrates the benefit of this change. The improvement can be observed with package restore. Build times (assuming no restore) are not affected.\r\n\r\n### .NET Core 2.1 SDK image after this change\r\n\r\n> The change has already been made in the `microsoft/dotnet-nightly` repo, as you can see in the example below.

This issue was resolved earlier this year, with the [May 2018 Preview of Quality Rollup](https://blogs.msdn.microsoft.com/dotnet/2018/05/15/net-framework-may-2018-preview-of-quality-rollup/). We recently learned that some applications, including Johnson Controls’ C-CURE 9000 Software, were negatively impacted by this change as this update requires all client and server workstations to be updated simultaneously with the appropriate Microsoft updates. The changes made to .NET Framework 4.7.1 were also integrated into .NET Framework 4.6 and later servicing releases. As a result, this advisory applies to .NET Framework 4.6 and later versions.\r\n\r\nThis advisory is provided so that developers can correctly diagnose this issue and be aware of our guidance. We will continue to update this issue as we have new information to share.\r\n\r\n## Discussion\r\n\r\nPlease share your thoughts on this change and see what others are saying at:\r\n\r\n* [microsoft/dotnet #832](https://github.com/Microsoft/dotnet/issues/832)\r\n\r\n## Guidance\r\n\r\nThis guidance only applies to customers that have experienced this issue.\r\n\r\nWe have released [an update for .NET Framework 4.6](https://blogs.msdn.microsoft.com/dotnet/2018/08/30/net-framework-august-2018-preview-of-quality-rollup/) and later that resolves the issue. **You must deploy the .NET Framework update for this issue to all .NET Framework 4.6+ machines that communicate via serialized objects**. After doing that, cross-machine serialization will work as expected. \r\n \r\nPlease consult your software vendor to understand if this impacts the software you are using.\r\n\r\n## Technical Context\r\n\r\nIn the [May 2018 Preview of Quality Rollup](https://blogs.msdn.microsoft.com/dotnet/2018/05/15/net-framework-may-2018-preview-of-quality-rollup/), we made a change to the internal type CultureAwareComparer to implement ISerializable. We made the change in order to address [issue with serializing/deserializing a CultureAwareComparer](https://github.com/Microsoft/dotnet/blob/master/releases/net471/KnownIssues/521954%20-%20BCL%20CultureAwareComparer%20with%20ignore%20casing%20on%20serialized%20on%20previous%20versions%20of%20.NET%20do%20not%20correctly%20deserialize%20on%20.NET%204.7.1.md).\r\n\r\nThe issue reported was that a type that contains an instance of CultureAwareComparer was not able to correctly serialize and deserialize across different versions of the .NET Framework. There are a few types in .NET Framework that do this, the most commonly impacted one being the Dictionary<TKey, TValue> type.\r\n \r\nThe change to implement the ISerializable interface had unintended side effects when exchanging this type across different machines. We have had a small number of reports from customers who have been affected.\r\n\r\nA common, but not unique way, of exchanging objects across machines is to use WCF in conjunction with a serializer. One of the common serializers being DataContractSerializer. The side-effect of the change prevented data serialized on systems where the type implements ISerializable to correctly deserialize of systems where the type does NOT implement ISerializable. The same is true of the opposite case, that systems where the type does not implement ISerializable will not correctly deserialize data from systems where the type does implement ISerializable.\r\n\r\nWe have an updated fix that we intend to release within the next month that will remove the implementation of the ISerializable interface on the type and use a different internal mechanism for ensuring the cross-version serialization continues to work as expected. This change addresses the break experienced with WCF.\r\n\r\nThe upcoming fix will remove the implementation of the ISerializable interface on the type and use a different mechanism for ensuring the cross-version serialization of that type continues to work. This change addresses the break experienced with WCF.\r\n\r\n## Symptoms\r\n\r\nAn application that is affected by this issue will most likely crash when trying to deserialize an object. It may print or log an error message similar to the following one:\r\n\r\n```\r\nThe formatter threw an exception while trying to deserialize the message: \r\nThere was an error while trying to deserialize parameter . The InnerException message was ''EndElement' 'Comparer' from namespace '' is not expected. Expecting element '_compareInfo'.'.  Please see InnerException for more details.\r\n```\r\n","Url":"https://github.com/dotnet/announcements/issues/81","RelatedDescription":"Open issue \"Advisory serializing/deserializing a CultureAwareComparer with .NET Framework 4.6+\" (#81)"},{"Id":"348162872","IsPullRequest":false,"CreatedAt":"2018-08-07T04:26:40","Actor":"richlander","Number":"79","RawContent":null,"Title":"August 2018 .NET Updates","State":"open","Body":"# August 2018 .NET Updates\r\n\r\nThe following .NET updates were released in August 2018.

To stay supported, move to a [later version of the given operating system](https://github.com/dotnet/core/blob/master/os-lifecycle-policy.md).\r\n\r\n* [Debian 8 -- Jessie](https://lists.debian.org/debian-security-announce/2018/msg00132.html)\r\n* [Ubuntu 17.10 -- Artful Aardvark](https://lists.ubuntu.com/archives/ubuntu-announce/2018-July/000232.html)\r\n\r\nSee [Debian Jessie End of Life -- Impact on .NET Core Docker Images](https://github.com/dotnet/announcements/issues/78)\r\n\r\n## .NET Support Policies\r\n\r\nMicrosoft support policies are defined in the following documents:\r\n\r\n* [Microsoft .NET Support Policy](https://www.microsoft.com/net/support/policy)\r\n* [.NET Core OS Lifecycle Policy](https://github.com/dotnet/core/blob/master/os-lifecycle-policy.md)\r\n\r\n## Previous Updates\r\n\r\n* [July 2018](https://github.com/dotnet/announcements/issues/76)\r\n* [June 2018](https://github.com/dotnet/announcements/issues/75)\r\n* [May 2018](https://github.com/dotnet/announcements/issues/68)","Url":"https://github.com/dotnet/announcements/issues/79","RelatedDescription":"Open issue \"August 2018 .NET Updates\" (#79)"},{"Id":"348161534","IsPullRequest":false,"CreatedAt":"2018-08-07T04:18:01","Actor":"richlander","Number":"78","RawContent":null,"Title":"Debian Jessie End of Life -- Impact on .NET Core Docker Images","State":"open","Body":"# Debian Jessie End of Life -- Impact on .NET Core Docker Images\r\n\r\nDebian Jessie (AKA Debian 8) is now [out of support](https://lists.debian.org/debian-security-announce/2018/msg00132.html). Debian Jessie is no longer a supported operating system for .NET Core. Docker users need to switch to Debian Stretch-based (AKA Debian 9) images to stay in support.\r\n\r\n## Discussion\r\n\r\nPlease share your thoughts on this change and see what others are saying at:\r\n\r\n* [dotnet/dotnet-docker #647](https://github.com/dotnet/dotnet-docker/issues/647)\r\n\r\n## Context\r\n\r\nJessie-based images are currently provided for .NET Core 1.0, 1.1 and 2.0. .NET Core 1.0 and 1.1 expose multi-arch tags, such as `1.0-runtime` and `1.1-sdk`, that support Debian Jessie. When pulled for a Linux Docker daemon (on Linux or Windows), these tags pull Jessie-based images. .NET Core 2.0 supports Jessie, but it is not the default. .NET Core 2.0 multi-arch tags, such as `2.0-runtime` and `2.0-sdk`, pull Debian Stretch-based images, when pulled for a Linux Docker daemon. We made a conscious decision with .NET Core 2.0 to move off of Jessie as the default to avoid this problem, based the Jessie 2018 EOL date. .NET Core 2.1 does not support Jessie, only Stretch.\r\n\r\nWe recently posted about our policy for underlying operating system dependencies with Docker:\r\n\r\n> For each major and minor .NET version, we may take a new major operating system version dependency. As I mentioned earlier, we adopted Debian 9 as the base image for .NET Core 2.0. We stayed with Debian 9 for .NET Core 2.1, since Debian 10 (AKA “Buster”) has not been released. Debian 9 will remain the default base image for .NET Core 2.1 for the life of .NET Core 2.1. **Once we adopt an underlying operating system major version, we will not change it for the life of that given .NET release.**\r\n\r\nSource: https://blogs.msdn.microsoft.com/dotnet/2018/06/18/staying-up-to-date-with-net-container-images/\r\n\r\n## Plan\r\n\r\nWe will continue to re-build .NET Core 1.0 and 1.1 multi-arch tags on top of Jessie for the remaining [supported lifetime of .NET Core 1.0 and 1.1](https://github.com/dotnet/core/blob/master/microsoft-support.md). We will also provide a Stretch-based image for .NET Core 1.1. This tag will look like the following: `1.1-runtime-stretch` or `1.1.9-sdk-stretch`. This is same format that Jessie has used.\r\n\r\nWe will produce Jessie-based images for NET Core 2.0 until October 2018, which is when [.NET Core 2.0 support ends](https://github.com/dotnet/core/blob/master/microsoft-support.md). .NET Core 2.0 multi-arch tags support Debian Stretch, not Jessie, as described above.\r\n\r\nIn summary, .NET Core is no longer supported on Debian Jessie, with Docker or otherwise. We will produce Docker images for Jessie until .NET Core 1.0, 1.1 and 2.0 support ends, respectively, to avoid breaking applications. This aligns with the policy defined above, per [Staying up-to-date with .NET Container Images](https://blogs.msdn.microsoft.com/dotnet/2018/06/18/staying-up-to-date-with-net-container-images/).\r\n\r\n## Affected Repos\r\n\r\n* [microsoft/dotnet](https://hub.docker.com/r/microsoft/dotnet/)\r\n* [microsoft/dotnet-nightly](https://hub.docker.com/r/microsoft/dotnet-nightly/)\r\n* [microsoft/aspnetcore](https://hub.docker.com/r/microsoft/aspnetcore/)\r\n* [microsoft/aspnetcore-build](https://hub.docker.com/r/microsoft/aspnetcore-build/)","Url":"https://github.com/dotnet/announcements/issues/78","RelatedDescription":"Open issue \"Debian Jessie End of Life -- Impact on .NET Core Docker Images\" (#78)"},{"Id":"345028102","IsPullRequest":false,"CreatedAt":"2018-07-26T22:31:32","Actor":"leecow","Number":"77","RawContent":null,"Title":"https://dot.net now using TLS 1.2-only","State":"open","Body":"Earlier today, https://dot.net switched to using TLS 1.2-only.

See Guidance section.~~\r\n\r\n~~Guidance has changed for Windows 7, Windows Server 2008 and Windows Server 2008 R2. See Guidance section.~~\r\n\r\nThe [July 2018 Security and Quality Rollup updates for .NET Framework](https://portal.msrc.microsoft.com/en-US/security-guidance/advisory/CVE-2018-8356) was released earlier this month. We have received multiple customer reports of [applications that fail to start or don't run correctly](https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/help/4345913) after installing the July 2018 update. These reports are specific to applications that initialize a COM component and run with restricted permissions.\r\n\r\nWe have stopped distributing the .NET Framework July 2018 updates on Windows Update and are actively working on fixing and re-shipping this month's updates. If you installed the July 2018 update and have not yet seen any negative behavior, we recommend that you leave your systems as-is but closely monitor them and ensure that you apply upcoming .NET Framework updates.\r\n\r\nAs a team, we regret that this release was shipped with this flaw. This release was tested using our regular and extensive testing process. We discovered while investigating this issue that we have a test hole for the specific combination of COM activation and restricted permissions, including impersonation. We will be mitigating that gap going forward. Again, we are sorry for any inconvenience that this product flaw has caused.\r\n\r\nWe will continue to update this issue and [post](https://blogs.msdn.microsoft.com/dotnet/2018/07/20/advisory-on-july-2018-net-framework-updates/) as we have new information.\r\n\r\n## Discussion\r\nPlease share your thoughts/experience on this advisory and see what others are saying at:\r\n\r\n* [microsoft/dotnet #811](https://github.com/Microsoft/dotnet/issues/811)\r\n\r\n## Guidance\r\n\r\nWe strongly recommend that you install [.NET Framework August 2018 Update](https://blogs.msdn.microsoft.com/dotnet/2018/08/14/august-2018-security-and-quality-rollup/).\r\n\r\n~~We recommend that you install [.NET Framework July 2018 Update](https://blogs.msdn.microsoft.com/dotnet/2018/07/30/net-framework-july-2018-update/) on your systems if you experienced the symptoms described in this advisory. If you did not experience these symptoms, we recommend you wait to update your machines until the next regular update, in August.~~\r\n\r\n~~On Windows 7, Windows Server 2008, and Windows Server 2008 R2, we have found that the combination of [July 2018 Security and Quality Rollup updates for .NET Framework](https://portal.msrc.microsoft.com/en-US/security-guidance/advisory/CVE-2018-8356) and  [.NET Framework July 2018 Update](https://blogs.msdn.microsoft.com/dotnet/2018/07/30/net-framework-july-2018-update/) do not resolve all symptoms. On these Windows versions, if you are experiencing these symptoms after installing this combination of patches, we recommend that you uninstall (only) the Monthly Rollup patch and then install the appropriate Security Only patch listed at [July 2018 Security and Quality Rollup updates for .NET Framework](https://portal.msrc.microsoft.com/en-US/security-guidance/advisory/CVE-2018-8356).~~\r\n\r\n## Technical Context\r\n\r\nThe .NET Framework runtime uses the process token to determine whether the process is being run within an elevated context. These system calls can fail if the required process inspection permissions are not present. This causes an “access denied\" error.\r\n\r\n## Symptoms\r\n\r\nA COM component fails to load because of “access denied,” “class not registered,” or “internal failure occurred for unknown reasons” errors. \r\n\r\nThe most commonly reported failure results in the following error message:\r\n\r\n```console\r\nException type: System.UnauthorizedAccessException\r\nMessage: Access is denied. (Exception from HRESULT: 0x80070005 (E_ACCESSDENIED))\r\n```\r\n\r\n### Sharepoint\r\n\r\nWhen users browse to a SharePoint site they may see the following HTTP 403 message:\r\n\r\n```console\r\n\"The Web Site declined to show this webpage\"\r\n```\r\n\r\nThe SharePoint ULS Logs will contain a message like the following:  \r\n\r\n```console\r\nw3wp.exe (0x1894)         0x0B94  SharePoint Foundation  General 0000       High                UnauthorizedAccessException for the request. 403 Forbidden will be returned.
