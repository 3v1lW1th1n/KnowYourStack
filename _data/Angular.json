When I do \"Add to Home Screen\" on my iPhone, and begin to test the offline functionality, the application will work for up to a few hours, at which point the app will seize to load and simply display a blank page or display, \"Safari cannot open the page because your iPhone is not connected to the internet\".  If I turn off the web server at this point and turn on iPhone networking, then the PWA will display the blank page.  \r\n\r\nAt first I assumed this was a current limitation of using an iPhone with PWAs, however, I tested 2 other (non-angular) PWAs and they work offline permanently on iPhone: [The Cube](https://bsehovac.github.io/the-cube/) and [Dinosaur Game](https://offline-dino-game.firebaseapp.com/)\r\n\r\nI tested this on 2 iPhones running IOS 12.1 and 12.1.1, and they both lost the ability to load the PWA at the exact same time (about an hour).  It seems like some sort of cache time limit gets hit where it then requires a network refresh.\r\n\r\n\r\n## 🔬 Minimal Reproduction\r\n<!--\r\nPlease create and share minimal reproduction of the issue starting with this template: https://stackblitz.com/fork/angular-issue-repro2\r\n-->\r\n```\r\nng new pwatest\r\ncd pwatest\r\nng add @angular/pwa -s\r\nng build --prod\r\nhttp-server dist\\pwatest\r\n```\r\n* verify loading works offline in chrome network tab\r\n* navigate to site through iphone safari browser and \"Add to Home Screen\"\r\n* verify PWA loads from home screen icon\r\n* disable all network connections on iPhone\r\n* wait unknown amount of time for PWA to fail to reload and then not function again until network connection re-established\r\n\r\n> Couldn't figure out how to get stackblitz working with angular service workers\r\n\r\n<!--\r\nIf StackBlitz is not suitable for reproduction of your issue, please create a minimal GitHub repository with the reproduction of the issue.

I am curious what is causing this behaviour. **I admit that in case of the form, both the inputs are represented by the same FormControl because of same ```name```.** But even then, their value should be tied to  `arr[i]` as per ` [ngModel]` and not to `FormControl`. \r\n\r\n\r\nNote : I am aware this isn't recommended way to write this code and both `input `should have different `name`. I am asking this only because I am curious why the code behaves that way. Maybe its a bug?\r\n\r\n## 🔬 Minimal Reproduction\r\n[Stackblitz link](https://stackblitz.com/edit/angular-mctp2s?file=src%2Fapp%2Fapp.component.ts)\r\n","Url":"https://github.com/angular/angular/issues/27692","RelatedDescription":"Closed issue \"Form inputs created with *ngFor ( and thus having same \"name\") are having same value\" (#27692)"},{"Id":"391756346","IsPullRequest":false,"CreatedAt":"2018-12-17T18:54:49","Actor":"pauldraper","Number":"27707","RawContent":null,"Title":"Type check listeners","State":"closed","Body":"# 🚀 feature request\r\n\r\n### Relevant Package\r\n\r\n@angular/core or @angular/compiler\r\n\r\n### Description\r\n\r\nAngular checks that the bound properties exist, whether on the component or the DOM.\r\n\r\nHowever, it does not check whether listened events exit, whether on the component or the DOM.\r\n\r\n### Describe the solution you'd like\r\n\r\nSimilar to properties, maintain a list of allowed events, and cause a compile error if they are unrecognized.\r\n\r\n### Describe alternatives you've considered\r\n\r\nI've considered never making a typo again.","Url":"https://github.com/angular/angular/issues/27707","RelatedDescription":"Closed issue \"Type check listeners\" (#27707)"},{"Id":"391739493","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2018-12-17T18:27:42","Actor":"pkozlowski-opensource","Number":"27705","RawContent":null,"Title":"test(ivy): add more test for content projection with ngIf / ngFor","State":"closed","Body":"This PR adds test to verify runtime behaviour for FW-796","Url":"https://github.com/angular/angular/pull/27705","RelatedDescription":"Closed or merged PR \"test(ivy): add more test for content projection with ngIf / ngFor\" (#27705)"},{"Id":"391830917","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2018-12-17T18:11:28","Actor":"devversion","Number":"27712","RawContent":null,"Title":"build: update gulp-clang-format dependency","State":"open","Body":"Currently running the gulp tasks to format code does not work because the `through2` version (which depends on `readable-stream`) and is used by `gulp-clang-format` is very outdated and seems to cause exceptions like:\r\n\r\n```\r\nError: no writecb in Transform class\r\n    at afterTransform (C:\\Users\\Paul\\projects\\angular\\node_modules\\gulp-clang-format\\node_modules\\readable-stream\\lib\\_stream_transform.js:95:33)\r\n    at TransformState.afterTransform (C:\\Users\\Paul\\projects\\angular\\node_modules\\gulp-clang-format\\node_modules\\readable-stream\\lib\\_stream_transform.js:79:12)\r\n```\r\n\r\nUpdating to the latest version of `gulp-clang-format` that comes with https://github.com/angular/gulp-clang-format/commit/10cbb7f9bf8d31836d702a24bc0a31ca6ffbeb4c, seems to fix this.\r\n\r\n**Note**: This issue seems to depend on the platform because I didn't run into it on MacOS nor Linux.

installed) that is driving me bonkers!\r\n\r\nBasically on a fresh startup of the browser (chrome) the old index.html is being served by the service worker resulting in a defunct mainxxx.js being loaded and due to the IIS rewrite rule I have in play to support deep linking, mainxxx.js returns back with the contents of index.html (side effect of service worker returning wrong index.html in first place)\r\n\r\nWhen I soft or hard refresh the browser tab, the correct index.html is loaded and all is fine... that is, until I close the browser and start again at which point the old index.html is served up again :O\r\n\r\nI am a side-by-side deployment strategy, which basically means that a new folder is created every time ther eis a new deploy and the web hosting is then pointed at this new folder, thus the old files are not available while hosting the new deploy!\r\n\r\nAs you can see from the screenshot below (sorry about the redaction), I have turned off caching via the cache-control header for the index.html page and other service worker related files..\r\n\r\n![devtools](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/2248787/50085429-edcea600-01f1-11e9-9524-039ebf55db12.png)\r\n\r\nThe below is a copy of my ngsw-config.json\r\n`{\r\n  \"index\":

These changes fix the issue by re-using an earlier fix that blocks interactions with the panel while it's animating.\r\n\r\nNote: an alternate approach can be to do something something similar to what we did with the ripples where we block `mouseenter` for a period after the last `touchstart` event.
