To check the currently installed runtimes, open a command prompt and run the `dotnet --info` command. If you have a 2.1 or greater runtime installed, you'll see output like the following;\r\n\r\n```text\r\n.NET Core SDK (reflecting any global.json):\r\n Version:   2.2.100\r\n Commit:    b9f2fa0ca8\r\n\r\nRuntime Environment:\r\n OS Name:     Windows\r\n OS Version:  10.0.17134\r\n OS Platform: Windows\r\n RID:         win10-x64\r\n Base Path:   C:\\Program Files\\dotnet\\sdk\\2.2.100\\\r\n\r\nHost (useful for support):\r\n  Version: 2.2.0\r\n  Commit:  1249f08fed\r\n\r\n.NET Core SDKs installed:\r\n  2.1.5 [C:\\Program Files\\dotnet\\sdk]\r\n  2.1.502 [C:\\Program Files\\dotnet\\sdk]\r\n  2.2.100 [C:\\Program Files\\dotnet\\sdk]\r\n\r\n.NET Core runtimes installed:\r\n  Microsoft.AspNetCore.All 2.1.6 [C:\\Program Files\\dotnet\\shared\\Microsoft.AspNetCore.All]\r\n  Microsoft.AspNetCore.App 2.1.6 [C:\\Program Files\\dotnet\\shared\\Microsoft.AspNetCore.App]\r\n  Microsoft.AspNetCore.All 2.2.0 [C:\\Program Files\\dotnet\\shared\\Microsoft.AspNetCore.All]\r\n  Microsoft.AspNetCore.App 2.2.0 [C:\\Program Files\\dotnet\\shared\\Microsoft.AspNetCore.App]\r\n  Microsoft.NETCore.App 2.1.6 [C:\\Program Files\\dotnet\\shared\\Microsoft.NETCore.App]\r\n  Microsoft.NETCore.App 2.2.0 [C:\\Program Files\\dotnet\\shared\\Microsoft.NETCore.App]\r\n\r\nTo install additional .NET Core runtimes or SDKs:\r\n  https://aka.ms/dotnet-download\r\n```\r\n\r\nIf your host version is 2.1.x and the highest `Microsoft.NETCore.App` runtime version is less than 2.1.7, you're vulnerable to this issue.\r\nIf your host version is 2.2.x and the highest 2.1.x `Microsoft.NETCore.App` runtime version is less than 2.1.7, you're vulnerable to this issue.\r\n\r\nYou will not see SDK versions if you have only installed the runtime.\r\n\r\n#### Applications not using Microsoft.NetCore.App\r\n\r\nThe affected assembly is also available separately as a NuGet package. If you are not using Microsoft.NetCore.App, you may still be affected if you are referencing the packages listed above.\r\n\r\n##### Direct dependencies\r\n\r\nDirect dependencies are discoverable by examining your `csproj` file. They can be fixed by [editing the project file](#fixing-direct-dependencies) or using NuGet to update the dependency.\r\n\r\n##### Transitive dependencies\r\n\r\nTransitive dependencies occur when you add a package to your project that in turn relies on another package. For example, if Contoso publishes a package `Contoso.Utility` which, in turn, depends on `Contoso.Internals` and you add the `Contoso.Utility` package to your project now your project has a direct dependency on `Contoso.Utility` and, because `Contoso.Utility` depends 'Contoso.Internals', your application gains a transitive dependency on the `Contoso.Internals` package.\r\n\r\nTransitive dependencies are reviewable in two ways:\r\n\r\n* In the Visual Studio Solution Explorer window, which supports searching.\r\n* By examining the `project.assets.json` file contained in the obj directory of your project for `csproj` based projects\r\n\r\nThe `project.assets.json` files are the authoritative list of all packages used by your project, containing both direct and transitive dependencies.\r\n\r\nThere are two ways to view transitive dependencies. You can either [use Visual Studio’s Solution Explorer](#vs-solution-explorer), or you can review [the `project.assets.json` file](#project-assets-json)).\r\n\r\n##### <a name=\"vs-solution-explorer\"></a>Using Visual Studio Solution Explorer\r\n\r\nTo use Solution Explorer, open the project in Visual Studio, and then press Ctrl+; to activate the search in Solution Explorer. Search for the [vulnerable package](#affected-software) and make a note of the version numbers of any results you find.\r\n\r\nFor example, searching for `Microsoft.AspNetCore.Mvc.Core` in an example project that contains a package that takes a dependency on `Microsoft.AspNetCore.Mvc` shows the following results in Visual Studio 2017:\r\n\r\n![Screenshot of search results in Visual Studio 2017](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/796298/25858816/8ecdc2b4-3491-11e7-9363-746804bb9832.png)\r\n\r\nThe search results appear as a tree. In the previous results, you can see that a reference to `Microsoft.AspNetCore.Mvc.Core` version 1.1.2 is discovered.\r\n\r\nUnder the Dependencies node is a NuGet node. Under the NuGet node is the list of packages you have directly taken a dependency on and their versions.\r\nIn screenshot, the application takes a direct dependency on `Microsoft.AspNetCore.Mvc`. `Microsoft.AspNetCore.Mvc` in turn has leaf nodes that list its dependencies and their versions.\r\nThe `Microsoft.AspNetCore.Mvc` package takes a dependency on a version of `Microsoft.AspNetCore.Mvc.ApiExplorer`, that in turn takes a dependency on a version of `Microsoft.AspNetCore.Mvc.Core`.\r\n\r\n##### <a name=\"project-assets-json\"></a> Manually reviewing project.assets.json\r\n\r\nOpen the *project.assets.json* file from your project’s obj directory in your editor. We suggest you use an editor that understands JSON and allows you to collapse and expand nodes to review this file.\r\nVisual Studio and Visual Studio Code provide JSON friendly editing.\r\n\r\nSearch the *project.assets.json* file for the [vulnerable package](#affected-software), using the format `packagename/` for each of the package names from the preceding table. If you find the assembly name in your search:\r\n\r\n* Examine the line on which they are found, the version number is after the `/`.\r\n* Compare to the [vulnerable versions table](#affected-software).\r\n\r\nFor example, a search result that shows `SSystem.Net.Http/4.3.0` is a reference to version 4.3.0 of `System.Net.Http`.\r\n\r\nIf your *project.assets.json* file includes references to the [vulnerable package](#affected-software), then you need to fix the transitive dependencies.\r\n\r\nIf you have not found any reference to any vulnerable packages, this means either\r\n\r\n* None of your direct dependencies depend on any vulnerable packages, or\r\n* You have already fixed the problem by updating the direct dependencies.\r\n\r\n### <a name=\"how-fix\"></a>How do I fix the issue?\r\n\r\n#### Updating the version of Microsoft.NETCore.App\r\n\r\nIf your host version is a 2.1.x host you must install version 2.1.7 or later of the [.NET Core 2.1 runtime](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/download/dotnet-core/2.1), or corresponding [.NET Core 2.1 SDK](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/download/dotnet-core/2.1).\r\n\r\nIf your host version is a 2.2.x you must install version 2.2.1 or later of the [.NET Core 2.2 runtime](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/download/dotnet-core/2.2), or corresponding  [.NET Core 2.2 SDK](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/download/dotnet-core/2.2).\r\n\r\n#### <a name=\"fixing-direct-dependencies\"></a>Fixing direct dependencies\r\n\r\nOpen *projectname.csproj* in your editor. If you're using Visual Studio, right-click the project and choose **Edit projectname.csproj** from the context menu, where projectname is the name of your project. Look for `PackageReference` elements. The following shows an example project file:\r\n\r\n```xml\r\n<Project Sdk=\"Microsoft.NET.Sdk.Web\">\r\n  <PropertyGroup>\r\n    <TargetFramework>netcoreapp2.1</TargetFramework>\r\n  </PropertyGroup>\r\n  <ItemGroup>\r\n    <PackageReference Include=\"System.Net.Http\" Version=\"4.3.0\" />\r\n  </ItemGroup>\r\n</Project>\r\n```\r\n\r\nThe preceding example has a reference to the [vulnerable package](#affected-software), as seen by the single `PackageReference` element. The name of the package is in the `Include` attribute.\r\nThe package version number is in the `Version` attribute. The previous example shows a single direct dependency on `System.Net.Http` version 4.3.0\r\n\r\nTo update the version to the secure package, change the version number to the updated package version as listed on the table [previously](#affected-software).\r\nIn this example, update `System.IO.Pipelines` to the appropriate [fixed package number](#affected-software) for your major version. Save the *csproj* file. The example *csproj* now looks as follows:\r\n\r\n```xml\r\n<Project Sdk=\"Microsoft.NET.Sdk.Web\">\r\n  <PropertyGroup>\r\n    <TargetFramework>netcoreapp2.1</TargetFramework>\r\n  </PropertyGroup>\r\n  <ItemGroup>\r\n    <PackageReference Include=\"System.Net.Http\" Version=\"4.3.5\" />\r\n  </ItemGroup>\r\n</Project>\r\n```\r\n\r\nIf you're using Visual Studio and you save your updated *csproj* file, Visual Studio will restore the new package version.\r\nYou can see the restore results by opening the **Output** window (Ctrl+Alt+O) and changing the **Show output from** drop-down list to **Package Manager**.\r\n\r\nIf you're not using Visual Studio, open a command line and change to your project directory. Execute the `dotnet restore` command to restore the updated dependencies.\r\n\r\nNow recompile your application. If after recompilation you see a *Dependency conflict warning*, you must update your other direct dependencies to versions that take a dependency on the updated package.\r\n\r\n#### <a name=\"transitive-dependencies\"></a>Fixing transitive dependencies\r\n\r\nIf your transitive dependency review found references to the [vulnerable package](#affected-software), you must add a direct dependency to the updated package to your *csproj* file to override the transitive dependency.\r\n\r\nOpen *projectname.csproj* in your editor. If you're using Visual Studio, right-click the project and choose **Edit projectname.csproj** from the context menu, where projectname is the name of your project.\r\nLook for `PackageReference` nodes, for example:\r\n\r\n```xml\r\n<Project Sdk=\"Microsoft.NET.Sdk.\">\r\n  <PropertyGroup>\r\n    <TargetFramework>net461</TargetFramework>\r\n  </PropertyGroup>\r\n  <ItemGroup>\r\n    <PackageReference Include=\"ThirdParty.NotUpdatedYet\" Version=\"2.0.0\" />\r\n  </ItemGroup>\r\n</Project>\r\n```\r\n\r\nYou must add a direct dependency to the updated version of the [vulnerable package](#affected-software) by adding it to the *csproj* file.\r\nYou do this by adding a new line to the dependencies section, referencing the fixed version.\r\nFor example, if your search showed a transitive reference to a vulnerable `System.ServiceModel.Http` version, you'd add a reference to the [fixed package number](#affected-software).\r\n\r\n```xml\r\n<Project Sdk=\"Microsoft.NET.Sdk.Web\">\r\n  <PropertyGroup>\r\n    <TargetFramework>net461</TargetFramework>\r\n  </PropertyGroup>\r\n  <ItemGroup>\r\n    <PackageReference Include=\"System.Net.Http\" Version=\"4.3.5\" />\r\n    <PackageReference Include=\"ThirdParty.NotUpdatedYet\" Version=\"2.0.0\" />\r\n  </ItemGroup>\r\n</Project>\r\n```\r\n\r\nAfter you've added the direct dependency reference, save your *csproj* file.\r\n\r\nIf you're using Visual Studio, save your updated *csproj* file and Visual Studio will restore the new package versions.\r\nYou can see the restore results by opening the **Output** window (Ctrl+Alt+O) and changing the **Show output from** drop-down list to **Package Manager**.\r\n\r\nIf you're not using Visual Studio, open a command line and change to your project directory. Execute the `dotnet restore` command to restore the new dependencies.\r\n\r\n##### Rebuilding your application\r\n\r\nFinally, you must rebuild your application, test, and redeploy.\r\n\r\n## Other Information\r\n\r\n### Reporting Security Issues\r\n\r\nIf you have found a potential security issue in .NET Core, please email details to secure@microsoft.com.

It brings over some of the changes that were done for Unix in https://github.com/dotnet/coreclr/pull/12334 such as using a literal pool to hold heap location/geometry information used in the barriers.\r\n\r\nParts of the code have been tweaked in pursuit of performance gains.\r\n\r\n- The cmp+ccmp pair has been replaced with two discrete cmp/branches to detangle it and allow for a faster exit if the lower bound check fails.\r\n- The ephemeral bounds are now being loaded simultaneously with an ldp rather than separately prior to each compare.\r\n- The shift for indexing into the card table has been separated out into its own instruction.\r\n\r\nSampling a write barrier-heavy test after these changes shows a ~7-12% decrease in the time spent in the barrier relative to the current, post-optimization version that's in use on Unix today.\r\n\r\nOnce this is in, I plan to port the deltas over to Unix so that the barriers will be in sync. I left the CLR writewatch and manually managed card bundles stuff alone on Windows for now since it's not enabled yet, but I'll likely experiment with those in the near future and check in the remaining pieces after doing so."},{"Id":"8894268043","Type":"PullRequestEvent","CreatedAt":"2019-01-16T03:14:32","Actor":"dotnet-maestro-bot","Repository":"dotnet/coreclr","Organization":"dotnet","RawContent":null,"RelatedAction":"opened","RelatedUrl":"https://github.com/dotnet/coreclr/pull/22002","RelatedDescription":"Opened

Part of this very large task is to go through the framework and verify that it indeed satisfies the Net Standard specification because I really don't trust anything/anyone. So, I have several questions regarding Net Standard.\r\n\r\n1) According to Microsoft documentation (https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/standard/net-standard), “[t]he .NET Standard is a formal specification of .NET APIs that are intended to be available on all .NET implementations. The motivation behind the .NET Standard is establishing greater uniformity in the .NET ecosystem. ECMA 335 continues to establish uniformity for .NET implementation behavior, but there's no similar spec for the .NET Base Class Libraries (BCL) for .NET library implementations.”\r\n\r\nQ: Exactly where is the “formal specification” of the API? Is it the MD file for a particular version (e.g., https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dotnet/standard/master/docs/versions/netstandard2.0_ref.md)? Is it the collection of C# files with stub implementations (e.g., the files in https://github.com/dotnet/standard/tree/master/src/netstandard/ref)? Or, is it something else?\r\n\r\n2) Assuming that the C# files in https://github.com/dotnet/standard/tree/master/src/netstandard/ref is the formal definition. I wrote a CSPROJ to build an assembly for the current state of the decls. Then, I wrote a program to go through a framework, following reference assemblies to implementation assemblies, and output a sorted list of all types, all methods, all attributes, for public decls. I compared the reference and implementation assemblies for Net Core with the Standard set forth in the C# code. And yes, there are some non-trivial differences, mostly because the standard is evolving.\r\n\r\nThe following are general questions of type equivalence.\r\n\r\nQ: If there's an attribute (\"[...]\") on a type is in Standard, but missing on the type in Core, does Core still satisfy the Standard?\r\n\r\nQ: If a method and/or type exists in Core, but not in Standard, does the implementation still satisfy the Standard? In other words, can an implementation provide \"extra\" and still satisfy Standard?\r\n\r\nThe full list of the type dump for Standard and Core assemblies is here (https://1drv.ms/f/s!Atb3HX_AxX9ZgaxT-m221N6ut285Vw).\r\n\r\n"}],"ResultType":"GitHubEvent"},"CoreFx":{"Events":[{"Id":"8894350738","Type":"PullRequestEvent","CreatedAt":"2019-01-16T03:38:51","Actor":"stephentoub","Repository":"dotnet/corefx","Organization":"dotnet","RawContent":null,"RelatedAction":"merged","RelatedUrl":"https://github.com/dotnet/corefx/pull/34484","RelatedDescription":"Merged pull request \"Expose System.Runtime.Loader.AssemblyDependencyResolver.\" (#34484) at dotnet/corefx","RelatedBody":"Expose the new `System.Runtime.Loader.AssemblyDependencyResolver` type.\r\n\r\nFixes #33165\r\n\r\nDepends on dotnet/coreclr#21896 propagating to corefx.\r\n"},{"Id":"8894350728","Type":"IssuesEvent","CreatedAt":"2019-01-16T03:38:51","Actor":"stephentoub","Repository":"dotnet/corefx","Organization":"dotnet","RawContent":null,"RelatedAction":"closed","RelatedUrl":"https://github.com/dotnet/corefx/issues/33165","RelatedDescription":"Closed issue \"Add API for resolving component dependencies\" (#33165) at dotnet/corefx","RelatedBody":"This is a proposal to add new public API which would expose functionality to help with resolution of managed and unmanaged dependencies of components.\r\n\r\n### Proposed Surface Area\r\n``` C#\r\nnamespace System.Runtime.Loader\r\n{\r\n    public sealed class ComponentDependencyResolver\r\n    {\r\n        public ComponentDependencyResolver(string componentAssemblyPath);\r\n\r\n        public string ResolveAssemblyToPath(AssemblyName assemblyName);\r\n        public string ResolveUnmanagedDllToPath(string unmanagedDllName);\r\n    }\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\n### Functionality\r\nGiven the path to a component assembly (the main `.dll` of a given component, for example the build result of a class library project), the constructor creates a resolver object which can resolve managed and unmanaged dependencies of the component. The constructor would look for the `.deps.json` file next to the main assembly and use it to compute the set of dependencies.\r\n\r\nThe `ResolveAssemblyToPath` and `ResolveUnmanagedDllToPath` methods are then used to resolve references to managed and unmanaged dependencies. These methods take the name of the dependency and return either null if such dependency can't be resolved by the component, or a full path to the file (managed assembly or unmanaged library).\r\n\r\nThe constructor is expected to catch most error cases and report them as exceptions. The `Resolve` methods should in general not throw and instead return null if the dependency can't be resolved.\r\n\r\n### Scenario: Dynamic component loading\r\n\r\nThe proposed API can be used to greatly simplify dynamic loading of components. It provides a powerful building block to use for implementing custom `AssemblyLoadContext` or event handlers for the binding events like `AppDomain.AssemblyResolve` and `AssemblyLoadContext.Resolving`.\r\n\r\nExample of using the new API to load plugins with `AssemblyLoadContext` in isolation:\r\n``` C#\r\nclass PluginLoadContext : AssemblyLoadContext\r\n{\r\n    ComponentDependencyResolver _resolver;\r\n    \r\n    public PluginLoadContext(string pluginPath)\r\n    {\r\n        _resolver = new ComponentDependencyResolver(pluginPath);\r\n    }\r\n\r\n    public override Assembly Load(AssemblyName assemblyName)\r\n    {\r\n        string assemblyPath = _resolver.ResolveAssemblyToPath(assemblyName);\r\n        if (assemblyPath != null)\r\n        {\r\n            return LoadFromAssemblyPath(assemblyPath);\r\n        }\r\n    \r\n        return null;\r\n    }\r\n}\r\n\r\nPluginLoadContext pluginContext = new PluginLoadContext(\"/pathtoplugin/plugin.dll\");\r\nAssembly pluginAssembly = pluginContext.LoadFromAssemblyName(new AssemblyName(\"Plugin\"));\r\n\r\n// ... use the pluginAssembly and reflection to invoke functionality from the plugin.\r\n// Dependencies of the plugin are resolved by the event handler above using the resolver\r\n// to provide the actual resolution from assembly name to file path.\r\n```\r\n\r\n### Scenario: Inspecting IL metadata of components\r\n\r\nUsing the newly proposed `MetadataLoadContext` API (see the [proposal](https://github.com/dotnet/corefx/issues/2800)) to inspect IL metadata of components. This API requires an assembly resolver to resolve dependencies of the component. The proposed `ComponentDependencyResolver` would be used to implement such resolver for components produced by the .NET Core SDK.\r\n\r\nExample of using the new API to implement `MetadataAssemblyResolver`:\r\n``` C#\r\npublic class ComponentMetadataAssemblyResolver : MetadataAssemblyResolver\r\n{\r\n    private ComponentDependencyResolver dependencyResolver;\r\n\r\n    public override Assembly Resolve(MetadataLoadContext context, AssemblyName assemblyName)\r\n    {\r\n        string assemblyPath = dependencyResolver.ResolveAssemblyToPath(assemblyName);\r\n        if (assemblyPath != null)\r\n        {\r\n            return context.LoadFromAssemblyPath(assemblyPath);\r\n        }\r\n\r\n        // Code to load framework dependencies from the running app for example\r\n        // using Assembly.Load and so on.\r\n\r\n        return null;\r\n    }\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\n### Context\r\n\r\n.NET Core SDK (used by VS, VS Code, VS for Mac and so on) describes component dependencies in the build output via the `.deps.json` files ([description](https://github.com/dotnet/cli/blob/master/Documentation/specs/runtime-configuration-file.md)). These files are consumed by the hosting components (`dotnet.exe` or the app's executable) and they're used to compute the list of dependencies needed to run the application. This happens at startup and through this mechanism all static dependencies of the app are resolved.\r\n\r\nCurrently there's no such mechanism for components which are loaded dynamically. Applications can use [`Microsoft.Extensions.DependencyModel`](https://github.com/dotnet/core-setup/tree/master/src/managed/Microsoft.Extensions.DependencyModel) package which provides object model of the `.deps.json` file, but it's relatively complex to use this for dependency resolution. It's also very likely that the behavior of such custom solution would be somewhat different from what the hosting layer does for static dependencies.\r\n\r\n### Open issues\r\n\r\n* **Naming** - The use of `Component` in the class name was chosen to differentiate from `Assembly` as the proposed API will only work on entire components produced by the SDK. Using `Assembly` seems to mean that the API would inspect the assembly itself to determine its dependencies, which is not the purpose of this API. That said it could be either. Also using the term `Resolver` can be seen as somewhat misleading. *Resolve* in the context of assembly binding typically means to find and actually load the dependency. The purpose of this API is to simply find the file, not to load it. So maybe it should be more explicit by using for example `PathResolver`. Candidates then could be `AssemblyDepednencyResolver`, `AssemblyDependencyPathResolver`, `ComponentDependencyPathResolver`.\r\n\r\n### Notes\r\n\r\n* As proposed the resolver would not resolve framework dependencies. For the typical case of dynamically loaded component, resolving framework dependencies would actually just introduce more issues and probably provide unwanted behavior. This is something we would look into in the future, as it's an important scenario for the `MetadataLoadContext`.\r\n* The resolver has no ties to the runtime. This means that the dependencies are resolved to file paths without any consideration to what assemblies are already loaded into the application. This is important for scenarios where full isolation is required. For partial or no isolation scenarios it is expected that the loading of the dependencies will be combined with the appropriate fallback to the default load context.\r\n"},{"Id":"8894263405","Type":"PullRequestEvent","CreatedAt":"2019-01-16T03:13:02","Actor":"dotnet-maestro-bot","Repository":"dotnet/corefx","Organization":"dotnet","RawContent":null,"RelatedAction":"opened","RelatedUrl":"https://github.com/dotnet/corefx/pull/34614","RelatedDescription":"Opened

instructions","State":"open","Body":"Currently, the emitter incorrectly encodes the imm-operand depends on the `addc` paths, which should only work on certain \"scalar instructions\" that operates over reg/mem or imm, e.g., `ADD [mem], reg` vs `ADD [mem], imm` and the opcode needs to be modified for large const operand (e.g., `imm32`). However, SSE/AVX do not need to modify the opcode and the imm-operand is always `imm8`.\r\n\r\nThis PR\r\n1. disables the opcode modification on SSE/AVX instructions, which is not perfect but the better solutions require more refactor on the emitter (e.g., put more info in insDec). This JIT change is in the last commit\r\n2. moves more SSE2 test cases into the template to avoid similar problems being hidden\r\n3. improves Insert test template to involve more codegen situations (e.g., containment on local var, class var, etc.)\r\n\r\nClose https://github.com/dotnet/coreclr/issues/21855 and close https://github.com/dotnet/coreclr/issues/18553\r\n\r\n@CarolEidt @tannergooding PTAL","Url":"https://github.com/dotnet/coreclr/pull/21999","RelatedDescription":"Open PR \" Fix imm-operand encoding for SSE/AVX instructions\" (#21999)"},{"Id":"399563534","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2019-01-15T22:27:25","Actor":"BruceForstall","Number":"21997","RawContent":null,"Title":"Fix two cases of FP-relative immediate offsets possibly not encodable","State":"open","Body":"For ARM32/ARM64, the immediate offsets in addressing modes have\r\nlimited range that varies by instruction.

When it's constructed with options, though, those options are validated, and then it calls into a shared routine that configures based on those options.  A previous set of changes resulted in erroneously doing the ExecutionContext.Capture for the task inside of that shared routine, rather than only doing it for tasks that actually have a delegate to be executed.  The net effect of this is that, while TaskCompletionSources created with the parameterless constructor correctly did not capture ExecutionContext, TaskCompletionSources created with options erroneously did; this doesn't have a functional impact, because that ExecutionContext isn't used for anything, but it can have a performance impact, in particular for memory, if the resulting Task is cached, and if the captured ExecutionContext holds onto some expensive object from an AsyncLocal, such that the cached Task then does so, too.\r\n\r\nThe fix is simply to move the capture from the shared routine that's invoked in two places to instead be done only in the one caller that's for tasks with delegates.\r\n\r\nFixes https://github.com/dotnet/coreclr/issues/21662\r\ncc: @kouvel, @tarekgh, @davidfowl ","Url":"https://github.com/dotnet/coreclr/pull/21981","RelatedDescription":"Closed or merged PR \"Fix TaskCompletionSource to avoid capturing ExecutionContext\" (#21981)"},{"Id":"399005071","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2019-01-14T18:11:38","Actor":"jashook","Number":"21982","RawContent":null,"Title":"Remove tizen jobs as valid pr jobs","State":"closed","Body":"Related to https://github.com/dotnet/coreclr/issues/21422.\r\n\r\nNote that with the corefx job no longer working our armel jobs now will fail.","Url":"https://github.com/dotnet/coreclr/pull/21982","RelatedDescription":"Closed or merged PR \"Remove tizen jobs as valid pr jobs\" (#21982)"},{"Id":"398958100","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2019-01-14T16:06:16","Actor":"filipnavara","Number":"21979","RawContent":null,"Title":"Make ResourceManager use Assembly instead of RuntimeAssembly internally.","State":"open","Body":"This is clean-up to aid moving System.Resources classes into shared CoreLib partition.","Url":"https://github.com/dotnet/coreclr/pull/21979","RelatedDescription":"Open PR \"Make ResourceManager use Assembly instead of RuntimeAssembly internally.\" (#21979)"},{"Id":"398941088","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2019-01-14T15:30:57","Actor":"MichalStrehovsky","Number":"21978","RawContent":null,"Title":"Handle complex constrained calls with default interface methods","State":"open","Body":"This adds handling for the interface dispatch corner case where:\r\n\r\n* We have a constrained callsite to a method on a generic interface in shared code over a valuetype\r\n* The callsite cannot be statically resolved because the result of dispatch depends on the generic context\r\n* At runtime, the dispatch resolves to a default interface method\r\n\r\nThis would require us to have infrastructure to build \"boxing thunks\" - thunks that would box their first argument before dispatching to the default interface method implementation.

Part of this very large task is to go through the framework and verify that it indeed satisfies the Net Standard specification because I really don't trust anything/anyone. So, I have several questions regarding Net Standard.\r\n\r\n1) According to Microsoft documentation (https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/standard/net-standard), “[t]he .NET Standard is a formal specification of .NET APIs that are intended to be available on all .NET implementations. The motivation behind the .NET Standard is establishing greater uniformity in the .NET ecosystem. ECMA 335 continues to establish uniformity for .NET implementation behavior, but there's no similar spec for the .NET Base Class Libraries (BCL) for .NET library implementations.”\r\n\r\nQ: Exactly where is the “formal specification” of the API? Is it the MD file for a particular version (e.g., https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dotnet/standard/master/docs/versions/netstandard2.0_ref.md)? Is it the collection of C# files with stub implementations (e.g., the files in https://github.com/dotnet/standard/tree/master/src/netstandard/ref)? Or, is it something else?\r\n\r\n2) Assuming that the C# files in https://github.com/dotnet/standard/tree/master/src/netstandard/ref is the formal definition. I wrote a CSPROJ to build an assembly for the current state of the decls. Then, I wrote a program to go through a framework, following reference assemblies to implementation assemblies, and output a sorted list of all types, all methods, all attributes, for public decls. I compared the reference and implementation assemblies for Net Core with the Standard set forth in the C# code. And yes, there are some non-trivial differences, mostly because the standard is evolving.\r\n\r\nThe following are general questions of type equivalence.\r\n\r\nQ: If there's an attribute (\"[...]\") on a type is in Standard, but missing on the type in Core, does Core still satisfy the Standard?\r\n\r\nQ: If a method and/or type exists in Core, but not in Standard, does the implementation still satisfy the Standard? In other words, can an implementation provide \"extra\" and still satisfy Standard?\r\n\r\nThe full list of the type dump for Standard and Core assemblies is here (https://1drv.ms/f/s!Atb3HX_AxX9ZgaxT-m221N6ut285Vw).\r\n\r\n","Url":"https://github.com/dotnet/standard/issues/1053","RelatedDescription":"Open issue \"Qs on NET Standard, Formal Specifications, Type Equivalence, etc.\" (#1053)"},{"Id":"393267915","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2019-01-14T18:45:00","Actor":"ViktorHofer","Number":"1040","RawContent":null,"Title":"Remove the manual config system","State":"closed","Body":"Fixes https://github.com/dotnet/standard/issues/1032","Url":"https://github.com/dotnet/standard/pull/1040","RelatedDescription":"Closed or merged PR \"Remove the manual config system\" (#1040)"},{"Id":"392986163","IsPullRequest":false,"CreatedAt":"2019-01-14T18:45:00","Actor":"ViktorHofer","Number":"1032","RawContent":null,"Title":"Remove slim configuration system and stop overloading Configuration","State":"closed","Body":"We should stop overloading the `Configuration` property in favor of the right msbuild properties and remove the `ConfigurationGroup` property to enable native VS support and remove a lot of obsolete stuff.\r\n\r\n```\r\n  <PropertyGroup Condition=\"'$(Configuration)'==''\">\r\n    <ConfigurationGroup Condition=\"'$(ConfigurationGroup)'==''\">Debug</ConfigurationGroup>\r\n    <Configuration>$(ConfigurationGroup)</Configuration>\r\n    <Configuration Condition=\"'$(TargetGroup)'!=''\">$(TargetGroup)_$(Configuration)</Configuration>\r\n    <Configuration Condition=\"'$(OSGroup)'!='' and '$(OSGroup)'!='AnyOS'\">$(OSGroup)_$(Configuration)</Configuration>\r\n  </PropertyGroup>\r\n```\r\n\r\ncc @ericstj @wtgodbe ","Url":"https://github.com/dotnet/standard/issues/1032","RelatedDescription":"Closed issue \"Remove slim configuration system and stop overloading Configuration\" (#1032)"},{"Id":"398564136","IsPullRequest":false,"CreatedAt":"2019-01-12T15:37:14","Actor":"netspiri","Number":"1052","RawContent":null,"Title":"Incorrect dll being copied","State":"open","Body":"I have\r\n\r\n- ProjectA targeting .Net Standard 2.0 making use of nuget library where the dlls for the different frameworks are named differently\r\n- ProjectB targeting .Net Standard 2.0 references ProjectA\r\n- ProjectC targeting .Net Framework 4.7.2 references ProjectB\r\n- ProjectD targeting .Net Framework 4.7.2 and is a Console app referencing ProjectC\r\n\r\nIf I run ProjectD I get the infamous \"Could not load file or assembly\" for Aspose.Email.Core.dll.\r\n\r\nI played around <RestoreProjectStyle>PackageReference</RestoreProjectStyle> in ProjectC and ProjectD but this results in .net framework dll (i.e Aspose.Email.dll) being copied over from the nuget package and not the .net standard dll (Aspose.Email.Core.dll).

So there shouldn't be a difference in behavior.\r\n\r\nMy specific application / script needs to use the RegEx.Matches() call for reasons I won't go into here.\r\n\r\nEssentially, for a pattern like the example below, there are conditional named groups to capture. If none of those conditions match, no group \"title\" should be even assigned.\r\n\r\n<meta itemprop=\"name\" content=\"((?:The Late Show[^\"]+)|(?:Season[^\"]+)|(?<title>[^\"]+))\"/?>\r\n\r\nSample code (.NET):\r\n\r\n```c#\r\n            string input = \"<meta itemprop=\\\"name\\\" content=\\\"Season 4\\\"/>\";\r\n            string pattern = \"<meta itemprop=\\\"name\\\" content=\\\"((?:The Late Show[^\\\"]+)|(?:Season[^\\\"]+)|(?<title>[^\\\"]+))\\\"/?>\";\r\n            MatchCollection matches = Regex.Matches(input, pattern);\r\n```\r\n\r\nSample code (PowerShell):\r\n\r\nFor this case, the input text doesn't match any of the preceding conditions, therefore the \"title\" group is assigned the string between the quotes. This is expected.\r\n\r\n```\r\nPS C:\\Users\\paradox> [RegEx]::Matches('<meta itemprop=\"name\" content=\"12/20/18 (John C.

Reilly, Senator Jeff Flake)\"/>\r\n```\r\n\r\nFor this case, because the inut string matches the second condition, the expectation is that the \"title\" group is not matched (or even assigned). However, \"title\" is assigned as group with an empty string. This seems like a bug to me.\r\n\r\n```\r\nPS C:\\Users\\paradox> [RegEx]::Matches('<meta itemprop=\"name\" content=\"Season 4\"/>', '<meta itemprop=\"name\" content=\"((?:The Late Show[^\"]+)|(?:Season[^\"]+)|(?<title>[^\"]+))\"/?>')\r\n\r\n\r\nGroups   : {0, 1, **title**}\r\nSuccess  : True\r\nName     : 0\r\nCaptures : {0}\r\nIndex    : 0\r\nLength   : 42\r\nValue    : <meta itemprop=\"name\" content=\"Season 4\"/>\r\n```\r\n\r\nFor completeness, note below the discrepancy with PowerShell's -match syntax (and how it works in a more expected fashion). Here's the positive case that is supposed to capture the \"title\" group:\r\n\r\n```\r\nPS C:\\Users\\paradox> '<meta itemprop=\"name\" content=\"12/20/18 (John C. Reilly, Senator Jeff Flake)\"/>' -match '<meta itemprop=\"name\" content=\"((?:The Late Show[^\"]+)|(?:Season[^\"]+)|(?<title>[^\"]+))\"/?>'\r\nTrue\r\nPS C:\\Users\\paradox> $matches\r\n\r\nName                           Value\r\n----                           -----\r\ntitle                          12/20/18 (John C. Reilly, Senator Jeff Flake)\r\n1                              12/20/18 (John C. Reilly, Senator Jeff Flake)\r\n0                              <meta itemprop=\"name\" content=\"12/20/18 (John C. Reilly, Senator Jeff Flake)\"/>\r\n```\r\n\r\nAnd in this case it matches the second condition. In this case, there is no named capture for \"title\" (as expected):\r\n\r\n```\r\nPS C:\\Users\\paradox> '<meta itemprop=\"name\" content=\"Season 4\"/>' -match '<meta itemprop=\"name\" content=\"((?:The Late Show[^\"]+)|(?:Season[^\"]+)|(?<title>[^\"]+))\"/?>'\r\nTrue\r\nPS C:\\Users\\paradox> $matches\r\n\r\nName                           Value\r\n----                           -----\r\n1                              Season 4\r\n0                              <meta itemprop=\"name\" content=\"Season 4\"/>\r\n```\r\n\r\nOS / .NET Versioning (all patches are up to date):\r\n\r\n(note that this also reproduces for a configuration on the fast ring)\r\n\r\n```\r\nPS C:\\Users\\paradox> $psversiontable\r\n\r\nName                           Value\r\n----                           -----\r\nPSVersion                      5.1.17763.134\r\nPSEdition                      Desktop\r\nPSCompatibleVersions           {1.0, 2.0, 3.0, 4.0...}\r\nBuildVersion                   10.0.17763.134\r\nCLRVersion                     4.0.30319.42000\r\nWSManStackVersion              3.0\r\nPSRemotingProtocolVersion      2.3\r\nSerializationVersion           1.1.0.1\r\n```","Url":"https://github.com/dotnet/corefx/issues/34605","RelatedDescription":"Open issue \"RegularExpressions Groups are assigned even when conditionally not supposed to, unlike PowerShell\" (#34605)"},{"Id":"399158906","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2019-01-15T18:20:57","Actor":"wfurt","Number":"34595","RawContent":null,"Title":"skip SetDateTimeMax test on 32b Unix platforms","State":"closed","Body":"fixes #33966 \r\n\r\nOn 32 bit platforms time_t is only 32 bit (signed) and cannot hold time beyond ~ 2038.

This library uses System.Net classes to make Http requests.\r\n\r\nWhen using this library with a .NET Framework console app, everything works fine. However, when moving to dotnetcore2.1 an exception is raised inside FillAsync method of the HttpConnection class. At first I believed that this issue was related to #31423 but, after some analysis, I realized that actually no real response was received from the server (different from what @Jeff-Lewis experienced).\r\n\r\nHere is the Stack Trace for this exception:\r\n\r\n```\r\n\"System.IO.IOException\"\r\nThe server returned an invalid or unrecognized response.\r\n   at System.Net.Http.HttpConnection.FillAsync()\r\n   at System.Net.Http.HttpConnection.ReadNextResponseHeaderLineAsync(Boolean foldedHeadersAllowed)\r\n   at System.Net.Http.HttpConnection.SendAsyncCore(HttpRequestMessage request, CancellationToken cancellationToken)\r\n```\r\n\r\nThe only part of the code that I found inside this method that raises this exception is the below snippet:\r\n\r\n```c#\r\nint bytesRead = await _stream.ReadAsync(new Memory<byte>(_readBuffer, _readLength, _readBuffer.Length - _readLength)).ConfigureAwait(false);\r\n\r\nif (NetEventSource.IsEnabled) Trace($\"Received {bytesRead} bytes.\");\r\nif (bytesRead == 0)\r\n{\r\n  throw new IOException(SR.net_http_invalid_response);\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nWhich indicates that the server is returning no data at all.

This explains the `if (bytesRead == 0)` part. I'm guessing there is something wrong with the header in dotnetcore, or the implementation is not sending the POST after the ACK triggering a timeout in the server, but I cannot really be sure.\r\n\r\nThe HTTP header difference is as follows:\r\n\r\n**.NET Framework**\r\n\r\n```\r\nPOST /wsman HTTP/1.1\r\nContent-Type: application/soap+xml;charset=UTF-8\r\nHost: <ip>:<port>\r\nContent-Length: 959\r\nExpect: 100-continue\r\nConnection: Keep-Alive\r\n\r\n```\r\n\r\n**.NET Core**\r\n\r\n```\r\nPOST /wsman HTTP/1.1\r\nConnection: Keep-Alive\r\nContent-Type: application/soap+xml; charset=UTF-8\r\nContent-Length: 959\r\nHost: <ip>:<port>\r\n\r\n```\r\n\r\nAnd this is the ACK response difference from the server:\r\n\r\n**.NET**\r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/1520189/51181308-fcbc7d00-18b1-11e9-84b7-9d38070c1fdb.png)\r\n\r\n**.NET Core**\r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/1520189/51181335-0cd45c80-18b2-11e9-91bd-f2a5206b33f5.png)\r\n\r\n**Constraints:**\r\n\r\n1.

didn't update node keys","State":"closed","Body":"In a larger refactoring I had commented some code out in NodeKeyValidation.AddProject. This meant that when we did a refactor rename of a CodeElement, we wouldn't end up updating node keys for all the existing CodeElements out there. The expectation is CodeElements are still valid. Uncommenting the code and bringing it back inline with the current design makes everything work again.\r\n\r\nFixes #31735.\r\n\r\n<details><summary>Ask Mode template not completed</summary>\r\n\r\n**Customer scenario**\r\n\r\nChange the name of a control in a Win Forms project. Once you try to save it, you get an error saying your file can't be saved. At this point, all you can do is close the file without saving and try again.\r\n\r\n**Bugs this fixes:** \r\n\r\nGitHub Bug: #31735\r\nFeedback link: https://developercommunity.visualstudio.com/content/problem/400702/cant-save-cs-file-after-changing-the-name-attribut.html\r\n\r\n**Workarounds, if any**\r\n\r\nYou'd have to perform the rename manually in the codebehind of the file. This isn't an obvious workaround (the error the customer gives does not give any hint which operation caused you to get into this state), and is also fairly risky since we normally don't want customers tinkering in the codebehind.\r\n\r\n**Risk**\r\n\r\nLow: this is fixing one particular method which is only used in the rename path for CodeModel elements.\r\n\r\n**Performance impact**\r\n\r\nNone.\r\n\r\n**Is this a regression from a previous update?**\r\n\r\nYes. This was broken in Dev16.0 Preview 1.\r\n\r\n**Root cause analysis:**\r\n\r\nThis was broken as a part of a very large refactoring; some code wasn't fixed up correctly and this slipped through code review. There weren't any unit tests covering this, and any integration tests must have since been disabled. Unit tests have now been written to cover this, which were confirmed to correctly catch the bug before the fix was checked in.\r\n\r\n**How was the bug found?**\r\n\r\nMany customer reports: https://developercommunity.visualstudio.com/content/problem/400702/cant-save-cs-file-after-changing-the-name-attribut.html\r\n\r\n</details>","Url":"https://github.com/dotnet/roslyn/pull/32508","RelatedDescription":"Closed or merged PR \"Fix regression where renaming a CodeElement didn't update node keys\" (#32508)"},{"Id":"399630167","IsPullRequest":false,"CreatedAt":"2019-01-16T03:17:13","Actor":"vsfeedback","Number":"32511","RawContent":null,"Title":"Go To Member not working","State":"open","Body":"When using the Go To Member filter &quot;m&quot; no members are found.\nMembers show up when searching for symbols, or &quot;all&quot; prefixing with the type name.\n\nExamples:\n&quot;m SomeMethod&quot; gives no results.\n&quot;SomeMethod&quot; gives the method, but also a lot of non-relevant results\n&quot;# SomeMethod&quot; gives the method, but also a lot of non-relevant results\n&quot;SomeType.SomeMethod&quot; gives the method, but also a lot of non-relevant results\n\n_This issue has been moved from https://developercommunity.visualstudio.com/content/problem/401830/go-to-member-not-working.html\nVSTS ticketId: 743097_\n_These are the original issue comments:_\n\nLadislav Burkovsky on 12/7/2018, 08:03 AM (39 days ago): same here\nRock Li [MSFT] on 12/11/2018, 08:51 PM (35 days ago): <p>Thanks for taking the time to report this issue to us.

This is due to .NET's heritage of being a dynamic runtime where generating new code at runtime is how you do things.\r\n\r\nThis pull request does two things: adds a document describing the challenges of reflection in an AOT compiled runtime, and **establishes new compilation defaults that improve the reflection experience** (new defaults are documented in the doc that is part of the pull request).\r\n\r\nThe improvement in reflection experience is not free. We are trading size and compilation speed for compatibility. E.g. the size of the ASP.NET WebApi sample we have in our repo goes from 24 MB to 30 MB. The size of the MonoGame sample goes from 6 MB to 9 MB. While the size increase is pretty significant (30-50%), the resulting size of the deployment is still very competitive with the size of a CoreCLR self contained app, or Mono's mkbundle (both of which set a pretty low bar).\r\n\r\nPeople who would like deployment sizes that are more competitive with Go and Rust can **opt into** the optimizations that used to be the default before this pull request (described in the doc and linked from a message the build emits). We are going to add more of these optimizations in the future.\r\n\r\nTo see the effect, I've updated the RD.XML files we have in the samples directory. I expect we'll be able to further minimize the amount of RD.XML needed once I bring back 3ec32cc13497f9d720349032a61da355af1ace3f (that improves reflection experience with generics).","Url":"https://github.com/dotnet/corert/pull/6820","RelatedDescription":"Open PR \"Change reflection defaults\" (#6820)"},{"Id":"398606761","IsPullRequest":false,"CreatedAt":"2019-01-13T00:41:44","Actor":"TFTomSun","Number":"6819","RawContent":null,"Title":"How to compile into one single executable?","State":"open","Body":"The CoreRT is advertised as a possibility to compile any application into one single native executable.

To check the currently installed runtimes, open a command prompt and run the `dotnet --info` command. If you have a 2.1 or greater runtime installed, you'll see output like the following;\r\n\r\n```text\r\n.NET Core SDK (reflecting any global.json):\r\n Version:   2.2.100\r\n Commit:    b9f2fa0ca8\r\n\r\nRuntime Environment:\r\n OS Name:     Windows\r\n OS Version:  10.0.17134\r\n OS Platform: Windows\r\n RID:         win10-x64\r\n Base Path:   C:\\Program Files\\dotnet\\sdk\\2.2.100\\\r\n\r\nHost (useful for support):\r\n  Version: 2.2.0\r\n  Commit:  1249f08fed\r\n\r\n.NET Core SDKs installed:\r\n  2.1.5 [C:\\Program Files\\dotnet\\sdk]\r\n  2.1.502 [C:\\Program Files\\dotnet\\sdk]\r\n  2.2.100 [C:\\Program Files\\dotnet\\sdk]\r\n\r\n.NET Core runtimes installed:\r\n  Microsoft.AspNetCore.All 2.1.6 [C:\\Program Files\\dotnet\\shared\\Microsoft.AspNetCore.All]\r\n  Microsoft.AspNetCore.App 2.1.6 [C:\\Program Files\\dotnet\\shared\\Microsoft.AspNetCore.App]\r\n  Microsoft.AspNetCore.All 2.2.0 [C:\\Program Files\\dotnet\\shared\\Microsoft.AspNetCore.All]\r\n  Microsoft.AspNetCore.App 2.2.0 [C:\\Program Files\\dotnet\\shared\\Microsoft.AspNetCore.App]\r\n  Microsoft.NETCore.App 2.1.6 [C:\\Program Files\\dotnet\\shared\\Microsoft.NETCore.App]\r\n  Microsoft.NETCore.App 2.2.0 [C:\\Program Files\\dotnet\\shared\\Microsoft.NETCore.App]\r\n\r\nTo install additional .NET Core runtimes or SDKs:\r\n  https://aka.ms/dotnet-download\r\n```\r\n\r\nIf your host version is 2.1.x and the highest `Microsoft.NETCore.App` runtime version is less than 2.1.7, you're vulnerable to this issue.\r\nIf your host version is 2.2.x and the highest 2.1.x `Microsoft.NETCore.App` runtime version is less than 2.1.7, you're vulnerable to this issue.\r\n\r\nYou will not see SDK versions if you have only installed the runtime.\r\n\r\n#### Applications not using Microsoft.NetCore.App\r\n\r\nThe affected assembly is also available separately as a NuGet package. If you are not using Microsoft.NetCore.App, you may still be affected if you are referencing the packages listed above.\r\n\r\n##### Direct dependencies\r\n\r\nDirect dependencies are discoverable by examining your `csproj` file. They can be fixed by [editing the project file](#fixing-direct-dependencies) or using NuGet to update the dependency.\r\n\r\n##### Transitive dependencies\r\n\r\nTransitive dependencies occur when you add a package to your project that in turn relies on another package. For example, if Contoso publishes a package `Contoso.Utility` which, in turn, depends on `Contoso.Internals` and you add the `Contoso.Utility` package to your project now your project has a direct dependency on `Contoso.Utility` and, because `Contoso.Utility` depends 'Contoso.Internals', your application gains a transitive dependency on the `Contoso.Internals` package.\r\n\r\nTransitive dependencies are reviewable in two ways:\r\n\r\n* In the Visual Studio Solution Explorer window, which supports searching.\r\n* By examining the `project.assets.json` file contained in the obj directory of your project for `csproj` based projects\r\n\r\nThe `project.assets.json` files are the authoritative list of all packages used by your project, containing both direct and transitive dependencies.\r\n\r\nThere are two ways to view transitive dependencies. You can either [use Visual Studio’s Solution Explorer](#vs-solution-explorer), or you can review [the `project.assets.json` file](#project-assets-json)).\r\n\r\n##### <a name=\"vs-solution-explorer\"></a>Using Visual Studio Solution Explorer\r\n\r\nTo use Solution Explorer, open the project in Visual Studio, and then press Ctrl+; to activate the search in Solution Explorer. Search for the [vulnerable package](#affected-software) and make a note of the version numbers of any results you find.\r\n\r\nFor example, searching for `Microsoft.AspNetCore.Mvc.Core` in an example project that contains a package that takes a dependency on `Microsoft.AspNetCore.Mvc` shows the following results in Visual Studio 2017:\r\n\r\n![Screenshot of search results in Visual Studio 2017](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/796298/25858816/8ecdc2b4-3491-11e7-9363-746804bb9832.png)\r\n\r\nThe search results appear as a tree. In the previous results, you can see that a reference to `Microsoft.AspNetCore.Mvc.Core` version 1.1.2 is discovered.\r\n\r\nUnder the Dependencies node is a NuGet node. Under the NuGet node is the list of packages you have directly taken a dependency on and their versions.\r\nIn screenshot, the application takes a direct dependency on `Microsoft.AspNetCore.Mvc`. `Microsoft.AspNetCore.Mvc` in turn has leaf nodes that list its dependencies and their versions.\r\nThe `Microsoft.AspNetCore.Mvc` package takes a dependency on a version of `Microsoft.AspNetCore.Mvc.ApiExplorer`, that in turn takes a dependency on a version of `Microsoft.AspNetCore.Mvc.Core`.\r\n\r\n##### <a name=\"project-assets-json\"></a> Manually reviewing project.assets.json\r\n\r\nOpen the *project.assets.json* file from your project’s obj directory in your editor. We suggest you use an editor that understands JSON and allows you to collapse and expand nodes to review this file.\r\nVisual Studio and Visual Studio Code provide JSON friendly editing.\r\n\r\nSearch the *project.assets.json* file for the [vulnerable package](#affected-software), using the format `packagename/` for each of the package names from the preceding table. If you find the assembly name in your search:\r\n\r\n* Examine the line on which they are found, the version number is after the `/`.\r\n* Compare to the [vulnerable versions table](#affected-software).\r\n\r\nFor example, a search result that shows `SSystem.Net.Http/4.3.0` is a reference to version 4.3.0 of `System.Net.Http`.\r\n\r\nIf your *project.assets.json* file includes references to the [vulnerable package](#affected-software), then you need to fix the transitive dependencies.\r\n\r\nIf you have not found any reference to any vulnerable packages, this means either\r\n\r\n* None of your direct dependencies depend on any vulnerable packages, or\r\n* You have already fixed the problem by updating the direct dependencies.\r\n\r\n### <a name=\"how-fix\"></a>How do I fix the issue?\r\n\r\n#### Updating the version of Microsoft.NETCore.App\r\n\r\nIf your host version is a 2.1.x host you must install version 2.1.7 or later of the [.NET Core 2.1 runtime](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/download/dotnet-core/2.1), or corresponding [.NET Core 2.1 SDK](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/download/dotnet-core/2.1).\r\n\r\nIf your host version is a 2.2.x you must install version 2.2.1 or later of the [.NET Core 2.2 runtime](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/download/dotnet-core/2.2), or corresponding  [.NET Core 2.2 SDK](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/download/dotnet-core/2.2).\r\n\r\n#### <a name=\"fixing-direct-dependencies\"></a>Fixing direct dependencies\r\n\r\nOpen *projectname.csproj* in your editor. If you're using Visual Studio, right-click the project and choose **Edit projectname.csproj** from the context menu, where projectname is the name of your project. Look for `PackageReference` elements. The following shows an example project file:\r\n\r\n```xml\r\n<Project Sdk=\"Microsoft.NET.Sdk.Web\">\r\n  <PropertyGroup>\r\n    <TargetFramework>netcoreapp2.1</TargetFramework>\r\n  </PropertyGroup>\r\n  <ItemGroup>\r\n    <PackageReference Include=\"System.Net.Http\" Version=\"4.3.0\" />\r\n  </ItemGroup>\r\n</Project>\r\n```\r\n\r\nThe preceding example has a reference to the [vulnerable package](#affected-software), as seen by the single `PackageReference` element. The name of the package is in the `Include` attribute.\r\nThe package version number is in the `Version` attribute. The previous example shows a single direct dependency on `System.Net.Http` version 4.3.0\r\n\r\nTo update the version to the secure package, change the version number to the updated package version as listed on the table [previously](#affected-software).\r\nIn this example, update `System.IO.Pipelines` to the appropriate [fixed package number](#affected-software) for your major version. Save the *csproj* file. The example *csproj* now looks as follows:\r\n\r\n```xml\r\n<Project Sdk=\"Microsoft.NET.Sdk.Web\">\r\n  <PropertyGroup>\r\n    <TargetFramework>netcoreapp2.1</TargetFramework>\r\n  </PropertyGroup>\r\n  <ItemGroup>\r\n    <PackageReference Include=\"System.Net.Http\" Version=\"4.3.5\" />\r\n  </ItemGroup>\r\n</Project>\r\n```\r\n\r\nIf you're using Visual Studio and you save your updated *csproj* file, Visual Studio will restore the new package version.\r\nYou can see the restore results by opening the **Output** window (Ctrl+Alt+O) and changing the **Show output from** drop-down list to **Package Manager**.\r\n\r\nIf you're not using Visual Studio, open a command line and change to your project directory. Execute the `dotnet restore` command to restore the updated dependencies.\r\n\r\nNow recompile your application. If after recompilation you see a *Dependency conflict warning*, you must update your other direct dependencies to versions that take a dependency on the updated package.\r\n\r\n#### <a name=\"transitive-dependencies\"></a>Fixing transitive dependencies\r\n\r\nIf your transitive dependency review found references to the [vulnerable package](#affected-software), you must add a direct dependency to the updated package to your *csproj* file to override the transitive dependency.\r\n\r\nOpen *projectname.csproj* in your editor. If you're using Visual Studio, right-click the project and choose **Edit projectname.csproj** from the context menu, where projectname is the name of your project.\r\nLook for `PackageReference` nodes, for example:\r\n\r\n```xml\r\n<Project Sdk=\"Microsoft.NET.Sdk.\">\r\n  <PropertyGroup>\r\n    <TargetFramework>net461</TargetFramework>\r\n  </PropertyGroup>\r\n  <ItemGroup>\r\n    <PackageReference Include=\"ThirdParty.NotUpdatedYet\" Version=\"2.0.0\" />\r\n  </ItemGroup>\r\n</Project>\r\n```\r\n\r\nYou must add a direct dependency to the updated version of the [vulnerable package](#affected-software) by adding it to the *csproj* file.\r\nYou do this by adding a new line to the dependencies section, referencing the fixed version.\r\nFor example, if your search showed a transitive reference to a vulnerable `System.ServiceModel.Http` version, you'd add a reference to the [fixed package number](#affected-software).\r\n\r\n```xml\r\n<Project Sdk=\"Microsoft.NET.Sdk.Web\">\r\n  <PropertyGroup>\r\n    <TargetFramework>net461</TargetFramework>\r\n  </PropertyGroup>\r\n  <ItemGroup>\r\n    <PackageReference Include=\"System.Net.Http\" Version=\"4.3.5\" />\r\n    <PackageReference Include=\"ThirdParty.NotUpdatedYet\" Version=\"2.0.0\" />\r\n  </ItemGroup>\r\n</Project>\r\n```\r\n\r\nAfter you've added the direct dependency reference, save your *csproj* file.\r\n\r\nIf you're using Visual Studio, save your updated *csproj* file and Visual Studio will restore the new package versions.\r\nYou can see the restore results by opening the **Output** window (Ctrl+Alt+O) and changing the **Show output from** drop-down list to **Package Manager**.\r\n\r\nIf you're not using Visual Studio, open a command line and change to your project directory. Execute the `dotnet restore` command to restore the new dependencies.\r\n\r\n##### Rebuilding your application\r\n\r\nFinally, you must rebuild your application, test, and redeploy.\r\n\r\n## Other Information\r\n\r\n### Reporting Security Issues\r\n\r\nIf you have found a potential security issue in .NET Core, please email details to secure@microsoft.com.

However, .NET hasn't had a (great) built-in way to deal with JSON. Instead we've relied on [Json.NET] which continues to serve the .NET ecosystem well.\r\n\r\n[Json.NET]: https://www.newtonsoft.com/json\r\n\r\nMoving forward, we plan on making some changes to our JSON support:\r\n\r\n* **We need high-performance JSON APIs**. We need a new set of JSON APIs that are highly tuned for performance by using `Span<T>` and allows for processing UTF-8 directly without having to transcode to UTF-16 `string` instances. Both aspects are critical for our web server Kestrel, where throughput is a key requirement.\r\n\r\n* **Remove dependency from ASP.NET Core to Json.NET**. Today, ASP.NET Core has a dependency on Json.NET. While this provides a tight integration between ASP.NET Core and Json.NET, it also means that application developers cannot freely choose which JSON library they are using. This is also problematic for customers of Json.NET as the version is dictated by the underlying platform. However, Json.NET is frequently updated and application developers often want to -- or even have to -- use a specific version. Thus, we want to remove the dependency from ASP.NET Core 3.0 to Json.NET so that customers can choose which version to use, without fearing they might accidentally break the underlying platform. In addition, this makes it also possible to plug-in an entirely different JSON library.\r\n\r\n* **Provide an ASP.NET Core integration package for Json.NET**. Json.NET has basically become the Swiss Army knife of JSON processing in .NET. It provides many options and facilities that allow customers to handle their JSON needs with ease. We don't want to compromise on the Json.NET support customers are getting today, for example, the ability to configure the JSON serialization via the `AddJsonOptions` extension method. Thus, we want to provide the Json.NET integration as a NuGet package that developers can optionally install so they get all the bells and whistles they get from Json.NET today. The other part of this work item is to ensure we have the right extension points so that other parties can provide similar integration packages for their JSON library of choice.\r\n\r\nBelow are more details around this plan.\r\n\r\n## The need for high-performance JSON APIs\r\n\r\nThe requirements for the .NET stack have changed a bit since the arrival of .NET Core. Historically, .NET has valued usability and convenience. With .NET Core, we've added a focus on performance, and we've made significant investments to serve high performance needs. And the [improvements we made][techempower] in the popular TechEmpower benchmark are a testament to that.\r\n\r\n[techempower]: https://www.techempower.com/blog/2016/11/16/framework-benchmarks-round-13/\r\n\r\nWith .NET Core 2.1, we've added a brand new primitive called [Span\\<T>][span-msdn] that allows us to represent native memory and arrays in a uniform way. With this type, we've also added a set of parsing and encoding APIs that are much more memory efficient without having to resort to unsafe code.\r\n\r\n[span-msdn]: https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/magazine/mt814808.aspx\r\n\r\nPart of the work of minimizing allocations is to avoid having to transcode UTF-8 payloads into UTF-16 strings, purely for parsing reasons. Currently, Json.NET is implemented by reading UTF-16. We need the ability to read (and write) JSON documents directly in UTF-8 because most network protocols (including HTTP) use UTF-8.\r\n\r\nDuring .NET Core 2.1 we've learned that updating our existing APIs to leverage `Span<T>` has limits. While we did add a bunch of overloads that accept spans, we also had to produce brand new APIs that are designed around minimizing allocations and dealing with buffers, which we exposed in `System.Buffers` namespaces. And with `System.IO.Pipelines` we've also added a programming model that enables developers to share buffers without having to deal with lifetime issues.\r\n\r\nBased on these experiences we believe in order to support JSON parsing, we'll need to expose a new set of JSON APIs that are specifically geared for high-performance scenarios.\r\n\r\nYou might wonder why we can't just update Json.NET to include support for parsing JSON using `Span<T>`? Well, James Newton-King -- the author of Json.NET -- has the following to say about that:\r\n\r\n> Json.NET was created over 10 years ago, and since then it has added a wide range of features aimed to help developers work with JSON in .NET. In that time Json.NET has also become far and away NuGet's most depended on and downloaded package, and is the go-to library for JSON support in .NET. Unfortunately, Json.NET's wealth of features and popularity works against making major changes to it. Supporting new technologies like `Span<T>` would require fundamental breaking changes to the library and would disrupt existing applications and libraries that depend on it.\r\n>\r\n> Going forward Json.NET will continue to be worked on and invested in, both addressing known issues today and supporting new platforms in the future. Json.NET has always existed alongside other JSON libraries for .NET, and there will be nothing to prevent you using one or more together, depending on whether you need the performance of the new JSON APIs or the large feature set of Json.NET.\r\n\r\n## Move Json.NET integration into a separate NuGet package\r\n\r\nToday, you cannot use ASP.NET Core without Json.NET because it is a dependency of ASP.NET Core itself. Over the years, we've received feedback that the dependency can conflict with other libraries that have their own dependency on a different version of Json.NET. In the past, we've considered addressing this issue by using a private copy of Json.NET in ASP.NET. However, this would create problems when developers want to configure Json.NET (for instance, in order to control how the serializer behaves when formatting JSON objects).\r\n\r\nMoving forward we'd like to:\r\n\r\n1. Replace the internal usage of Json.NET in ASP.NET Core by the new platform-provided JSON APIs.\r\n\r\n2. Factor the public facing usage of Json.NET into an optional integration package that can be acquired from NuGet.\r\n\r\nSo the existing integration between ASP.NET Core and Json.NET will continue to be supported, but will be moving out of the platform and into a separate package. However, since the integration is then designed to sit on top of the platform, it will also allow customers to update Json.NET to later versions.\r\n\r\nFurthermore, customers who need more performance can also choose to use the new JSON APIs, at the expense of the rich feature set that Json.NET offers.\r\n\r\n## Discussion\r\n\r\nFor a discussion, please go to https://github.com/dotnet/corefx/issues/33115.","Url":"https://github.com/dotnet/announcements/issues/90","RelatedDescription":"Open issue \"The future of JSON in .NET Core 3.0\" (#90)"},{"Id":"368440353","IsPullRequest":false,"CreatedAt":"2018-10-09T23:44:06","Actor":"vivmishra","Number":"89","RawContent":null,"Title":"October 2018 .NET Updates","State":"open","Body":"# October 2018 .NET Updates\r\n\r\nThe following .NET updates were released in October 2018.

If you are not using Microsoft.AspNetCore.App or .All, you may still be affected if you are referencing the System.IO.Pipelines package.\r\n\r\n##### Direct dependencies\r\n\r\nDirect dependencies are discoverable by examining your `csproj` file. They can be fixed by [editing the project file](#fixing-direct-dependencies) or using NuGet to update the dependency.\r\n\r\n##### Transitive dependencies\r\n\r\nTransitive dependencies occur when you add a package to your project that in turn relies on another package. For example, if Contoso publishes a package `Contoso.Utility` which, in turn, depends on `Contoso.Internals` and you add the `Contoso.Utility` package to your project now your project has a direct dependency on `Contoso.Utility` and, because `Contoso.Utility` depends 'Contoso.Internals', your application gains a transitive dependency on the `Contoso.Internals` package.\r\n\r\nTransitive dependencies are reviewable in two ways:\r\n\r\n* In the Visual Studio Solution Explorer window, which supports searching.\r\n* By examining the `project.assets.json` file contained in the obj directory of your project for `csproj` based projects\r\n\r\nThe `project.assets.json` files are the authoritative list of all packages used by your project, containing both direct and transitive dependencies.\r\n\r\nThere are two ways to view transitive dependencies. You can either [use Visual Studio’s Solution Explorer](#vs-solution-explorer), or you can review [the `project.assets.json` file](#project-assets-json)).\r\n\r\n##### <a name=\"vs-solution-explorer\"></a>Using Visual Studio Solution Explorer\r\n\r\nTo use Solution Explorer, open the project in Visual Studio, and then press Ctrl+; to activate the search in Solution Explorer. Search for the [vulnerable package](#affected-software) and make a note of the version numbers of any results you find.\r\n\r\nFor example, searching for `Microsoft.AspNetCore.Mvc.Core` in an example project that contains a package that takes a dependency on `Microsoft.AspNetCore.Mvc` shows the following results in Visual Studio 2017:\r\n\r\n![Screenshot of search results in Visual Studio 2017](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/796298/25858816/8ecdc2b4-3491-11e7-9363-746804bb9832.png)\r\n\r\nThe search results appear as a tree. In the previous results, you can see that a reference to `Microsoft.AspNetCore.Mvc.Core` version 1.1.2 is discovered.\r\n\r\nUnder the Dependencies node is a NuGet node. Under the NuGet node is the list of packages you have directly taken a dependency on and their versions.\r\nIn screenshot, the application takes a direct dependency on `Microsoft.AspNetCore.Mvc`. `Microsoft.AspNetCore.Mvc` in turn has leaf nodes that list its dependencies and their versions.\r\nThe `Microsoft.AspNetCore.Mvc` package takes a dependency on a version of `Microsoft.AspNetCore.Mvc.ApiExplorer`, that in turn takes a dependency on a version of `Microsoft.AspNetCore.Mvc.Core`.\r\n\r\n##### <a name=\"project-assets-json\"></a> Manually reviewing project.assets.json\r\n\r\nOpen the *project.assets.json* file from your project’s obj directory in your editor. We suggest you use an editor that understands JSON and allows you to collapse and expand nodes to review this file.\r\nVisual Studio and Visual Studio Code provide JSON friendly editing.\r\n\r\nSearch the *project.assets.json* file for the [vulnerable package](#affected-software), using the format `packagename/` for each of the package names from the preceding table. If you find the assembly name in your search:\r\n\r\n* Examine the line on which they are found, the version number is after the `/`.\r\n* Compare to the [vulnerable versions table](#affected-software).\r\n\r\nFor example, a search result that shows `System.IO.Pipelines/4.5.0` is a reference to version 4.5.0 of `System.IO.Pipelines`.\r\n\r\nIf your *project.assets.json* file includes references to the [vulnerable package](#affected-software), then you need to fix the transitive dependencies.\r\n\r\nIf you have not found any reference to any vulnerable packages, this means either\r\n\r\n* None of your direct dependencies depend on any vulnerable packages, or\r\n* You have already fixed the problem by updating the direct dependencies.\r\n\r\n### <a name=\"how-fix\"></a>How do I fix the issue?\r\n\r\n#### <a name=\"fixing-direct-dependencies\"></a>Fixing direct dependencies\r\n\r\nOpen *projectname.csproj* in your editor. If you're using Visual Studio, right-click the project and choose **Edit projectname.csproj** from the context menu, where projectname is the name of your project. Look for `PackageReference` elements. The following shows an example project file:\r\n\r\n```xml\r\n<Project Sdk=\"Microsoft.NET.Sdk.Web\">\r\n  <PropertyGroup>\r\n    <TargetFramework>netcoreapp2.1</TargetFramework>\r\n  </PropertyGroup>\r\n  <ItemGroup>\r\n    <PackageReference Include=\"System.IO.Pipelines\" Version=\"4.5.0\" />\r\n  </ItemGroup>\r\n</Project>\r\n```\r\n\r\nThe preceding example has a reference to the [vulnerable package](#affected-software), as seen by the single `PackageReference` element. The name of the package is in the `Include` attribute.\r\nThe package version number is in the `Version` attribute. The previous example shows a single direct dependency on `System.IO.Pipelines` version 4.5.0\r\n\r\nTo update the version to the secure package, change the version number to the updated package version as listed on the table [previously](#affected-software).\r\nIn this example, update `System.IO.Pipelines` to the appropriate [fixed package number](#affected-software) for your major version. Save the *csproj* file. The example *csproj* now looks as follows:\r\n\r\n```xml\r\n<Project Sdk=\"Microsoft.NET.Sdk.Web\">\r\n  <PropertyGroup>\r\n    <TargetFramework>netcoreapp2.1</TargetFramework>\r\n  </PropertyGroup>\r\n  <ItemGroup>\r\n    <PackageReference Include=\"System.IO.Pipelines\" Version=\"4.5.1\" />\r\n  </ItemGroup>\r\n</Project>\r\n```\r\n\r\nIf you're using Visual Studio and you save your updated *csproj* file, Visual Studio will restore the new package version.\r\nYou can see the restore results by opening the **Output** window (Ctrl+Alt+O) and changing the **Show output from** drop-down list to **Package Manager**.\r\n\r\nIf you're not using Visual Studio, open a command line and change to your project directory. Execute the `dotnet restore` command to restore the updated dependencies.\r\n\r\nNow recompile your application. If after recompilation you see a *Dependency conflict warning*, you must update your other direct dependencies to versions that take a dependency on the updated package.\r\n\r\n#### <a name=\"transitive-dependencies\"></a>Fixing transitive dependencies\r\n\r\nIf your transitive dependency review found references to the [vulnerable package](#affected-software), you must add a direct dependency to the updated package to your *csproj* file to override the transitive dependency.\r\n\r\nOpen *projectname.csproj* in your editor. If you're using Visual Studio, right-click the project and choose **Edit projectname.csproj** from the context menu, where projectname is the name of your project.\r\nLook for `PackageReference` nodes, for example:\r\n\r\n```xml\r\n<Project Sdk=\"Microsoft.NET.Sdk.\">\r\n  <PropertyGroup>\r\n    <TargetFramework>net461</TargetFramework>\r\n  </PropertyGroup>\r\n  <ItemGroup>\r\n    <PackageReference Include=\"ThirdParty.NotUpdatedYet\" Version=\"2.0.0\" />\r\n  </ItemGroup>\r\n</Project>\r\n```\r\n\r\nYou must add a direct dependency to the updated version of the [vulnerable package](#affected-software) by adding it to the *csproj* file.\r\nYou do this by adding a new line to the dependencies section, referencing the fixed version.\r\nFor example, if your search showed a transitive reference to a vulnerable `System.ServiceModel.Http` version, you'd add a reference to the [fixed package number](#affected-software).\r\n\r\n```xml\r\n<Project Sdk=\"Microsoft.NET.Sdk.Web\">\r\n  <PropertyGroup>\r\n    <TargetFramework>net461</TargetFramework>\r\n  </PropertyGroup>\r\n  <ItemGroup>\r\n    <PackageReference Include=\"System.IO.Pipelines\" Version=\"4.5.1\" />\r\n    <PackageReference Include=\"ThirdParty.NotUpdatedYet\" Version=\"2.0.0\" />\r\n  </ItemGroup>\r\n</Project>\r\n```\r\n\r\nAfter you've added the direct dependency reference, save your *csproj* file.\r\n\r\nIf you're using Visual Studio, save your updated *csproj* file and Visual Studio will restore the new package versions.\r\nYou can see the restore results by opening the **Output** window (Ctrl+Alt+O) and changing the **Show output from** drop-down list to **Package Manager**.\r\n\r\nIf you're not using Visual Studio, open a command line and change to your project directory. Execute the `dotnet restore` command to restore the new dependencies.\r\n\r\n#### Rebuilding your application\r\n\r\nFinally you must rebuild your application, test, and redeploy.\r\n\r\n## Other Information\r\n\r\n### Reporting Security Issues\r\n\r\nIf you have found a potential security issue in .NET Core, please email details to secure@microsoft.com.

These packages are decompressed upon installation of the .NET Core SDK. The packages are not currently included in ARM32 distributions due to the time and space cost to decompress the packages. Instead, they will be added to [.NET Core ARM32 Docker images](https://hub.docker.com/r/microsoft/dotnet/), where these costs can be paid as part of image creation.\r\n\r\nThese NuGet packages include content for two purposes:\r\n\r\n- Reference assemblies for .NET Core, for code compilation.\r\n- Pre-compiled assemblies (compiled with [crossgen](https://github.com/dotnet/coreclr/blob/master/Documentation/building/crossgen.md)) for .NET Core, for use in self-contained applications.\r\n\r\nIn both cases, the presence of these packages avoid the need to access remote NuGet feeds for .NET Core assemblies as part of package restore.\r\n\r\nThis change only affects [.NET Core 2.1 SDK ARM32 Docker images](https://hub.docker.com/r/microsoft/dotnet/). This change will be made in August 2018.\r\n\r\n## Discussion\r\n\r\nPlease share your thoughts on this change and see what others are saying at:\r\n\r\n* [dotnet/dotnet-docker #653](https://github.com/dotnet/dotnet-docker/issues/653)\r\n\r\n## .NET Core SDK NugetFallbackFolder\r\n\r\nThe .NET Core SDK includes a compressed copy of all NuGet package, in LZMA format. It exists at the following version-specific location:\r\n\r\n```\r\nroot@3778032bc43d:/# ls -l /usr/share/dotnet/sdk/2.1.302/*.lzma\r\n-rw-r--r-- 1 1004 sudo 35995936 Jul  2 22:51 /usr/share/dotnet/sdk/2.1.302/nuGetPackagesArchive.lzma\r\n```\r\n\r\nThis file is decompressed to the following location: `/usr/share/dotnet/sdk/NuGetFallbackFolder/`\r\n\r\nA package restore for a .NET Core assembly will restore the assembly from the NuGetFallbackFolder location and copy it to the user NuGet cache. At that point, regular NuGet behavior is used.\r\n\r\n## Impact of this change\r\n\r\nThere should be no functional difference in behavior after this change. .NET SDK commands should complete faster and require fewer package restore network requests.\r\n\r\nThe following examples demonstrates the benefit of this change. The improvement can be observed with package restore. Build times (assuming no restore) are not affected.\r\n\r\n### .NET Core 2.1 SDK image after this change\r\n\r\n> The change has already been made in the `microsoft/dotnet-nightly` repo, as you can see in the example below.

This issue was resolved earlier this year, with the [May 2018 Preview of Quality Rollup](https://blogs.msdn.microsoft.com/dotnet/2018/05/15/net-framework-may-2018-preview-of-quality-rollup/). We recently learned that some applications, including Johnson Controls’ C-CURE 9000 Software, were negatively impacted by this change as this update requires all client and server workstations to be updated simultaneously with the appropriate Microsoft updates. The changes made to .NET Framework 4.7.1 were also integrated into .NET Framework 4.6 and later servicing releases. As a result, this advisory applies to .NET Framework 4.6 and later versions.\r\n\r\nThis advisory is provided so that developers can correctly diagnose this issue and be aware of our guidance. We will continue to update this issue as we have new information to share.\r\n\r\n## Discussion\r\n\r\nPlease share your thoughts on this change and see what others are saying at:\r\n\r\n* [microsoft/dotnet #832](https://github.com/Microsoft/dotnet/issues/832)\r\n\r\n## Guidance\r\n\r\nThis guidance only applies to customers that have experienced this issue.\r\n\r\nWe have released [an update for .NET Framework 4.6](https://blogs.msdn.microsoft.com/dotnet/2018/08/30/net-framework-august-2018-preview-of-quality-rollup/) and later that resolves the issue. **You must deploy the .NET Framework update for this issue to all .NET Framework 4.6+ machines that communicate via serialized objects**. After doing that, cross-machine serialization will work as expected. \r\n \r\nPlease consult your software vendor to understand if this impacts the software you are using.\r\n\r\n## Technical Context\r\n\r\nIn the [May 2018 Preview of Quality Rollup](https://blogs.msdn.microsoft.com/dotnet/2018/05/15/net-framework-may-2018-preview-of-quality-rollup/), we made a change to the internal type CultureAwareComparer to implement ISerializable. We made the change in order to address [issue with serializing/deserializing a CultureAwareComparer](https://github.com/Microsoft/dotnet/blob/master/releases/net471/KnownIssues/521954%20-%20BCL%20CultureAwareComparer%20with%20ignore%20casing%20on%20serialized%20on%20previous%20versions%20of%20.NET%20do%20not%20correctly%20deserialize%20on%20.NET%204.7.1.md).\r\n\r\nThe issue reported was that a type that contains an instance of CultureAwareComparer was not able to correctly serialize and deserialize across different versions of the .NET Framework. There are a few types in .NET Framework that do this, the most commonly impacted one being the Dictionary<TKey, TValue> type.\r\n \r\nThe change to implement the ISerializable interface had unintended side effects when exchanging this type across different machines. We have had a small number of reports from customers who have been affected.\r\n\r\nA common, but not unique way, of exchanging objects across machines is to use WCF in conjunction with a serializer. One of the common serializers being DataContractSerializer. The side-effect of the change prevented data serialized on systems where the type implements ISerializable to correctly deserialize of systems where the type does NOT implement ISerializable. The same is true of the opposite case, that systems where the type does not implement ISerializable will not correctly deserialize data from systems where the type does implement ISerializable.\r\n\r\nWe have an updated fix that we intend to release within the next month that will remove the implementation of the ISerializable interface on the type and use a different internal mechanism for ensuring the cross-version serialization continues to work as expected. This change addresses the break experienced with WCF.\r\n\r\nThe upcoming fix will remove the implementation of the ISerializable interface on the type and use a different mechanism for ensuring the cross-version serialization of that type continues to work. This change addresses the break experienced with WCF.\r\n\r\n## Symptoms\r\n\r\nAn application that is affected by this issue will most likely crash when trying to deserialize an object. It may print or log an error message similar to the following one:\r\n\r\n```\r\nThe formatter threw an exception while trying to deserialize the message: \r\nThere was an error while trying to deserialize parameter . The InnerException message was ''EndElement' 'Comparer' from namespace '' is not expected. Expecting element '_compareInfo'.'.  Please see InnerException for more details.\r\n```\r\n","Url":"https://github.com/dotnet/announcements/issues/81","RelatedDescription":"Open issue \"Advisory serializing/deserializing a CultureAwareComparer with .NET Framework 4.6+\" (#81)"},{"Id":"348162872","IsPullRequest":false,"CreatedAt":"2018-08-07T04:26:40","Actor":"richlander","Number":"79","RawContent":null,"Title":"August 2018 .NET Updates","State":"open","Body":"# August 2018 .NET Updates\r\n\r\nThe following .NET updates were released in August 2018.

Debian Jessie is no longer a supported operating system for .NET Core. Docker users need to switch to Debian Stretch-based (AKA Debian 9) images to stay in support.\r\n\r\n## Discussion\r\n\r\nPlease share your thoughts on this change and see what others are saying at:\r\n\r\n* [dotnet/dotnet-docker #647](https://github.com/dotnet/dotnet-docker/issues/647)\r\n\r\n## Context\r\n\r\nJessie-based images are currently provided for .NET Core 1.0, 1.1 and 2.0. .NET Core 1.0 and 1.1 expose multi-arch tags, such as `1.0-runtime` and `1.1-sdk`, that support Debian Jessie. When pulled for a Linux Docker daemon (on Linux or Windows), these tags pull Jessie-based images. .NET Core 2.0 supports Jessie, but it is not the default. .NET Core 2.0 multi-arch tags, such as `2.0-runtime` and `2.0-sdk`, pull Debian Stretch-based images, when pulled for a Linux Docker daemon. We made a conscious decision with .NET Core 2.0 to move off of Jessie as the default to avoid this problem, based the Jessie 2018 EOL date. .NET Core 2.1 does not support Jessie, only Stretch.\r\n\r\nWe recently posted about our policy for underlying operating system dependencies with Docker:\r\n\r\n> For each major and minor .NET version, we may take a new major operating system version dependency. As I mentioned earlier, we adopted Debian 9 as the base image for .NET Core 2.0. We stayed with Debian 9 for .NET Core 2.1, since Debian 10 (AKA “Buster”) has not been released. Debian 9 will remain the default base image for .NET Core 2.1 for the life of .NET Core 2.1. **Once we adopt an underlying operating system major version, we will not change it for the life of that given .NET release.**\r\n\r\nSource: https://blogs.msdn.microsoft.com/dotnet/2018/06/18/staying-up-to-date-with-net-container-images/\r\n\r\n## Plan\r\n\r\nWe will continue to re-build .NET Core 1.0 and 1.1 multi-arch tags on top of Jessie for the remaining [supported lifetime of .NET Core 1.0 and 1.1](https://github.com/dotnet/core/blob/master/microsoft-support.md). We will also provide a Stretch-based image for .NET Core 1.1. This tag will look like the following: `1.1-runtime-stretch` or `1.1.9-sdk-stretch`. This is same format that Jessie has used.\r\n\r\nWe will produce Jessie-based images for NET Core 2.0 until October 2018, which is when [.NET Core 2.0 support ends](https://github.com/dotnet/core/blob/master/microsoft-support.md). .NET Core 2.0 multi-arch tags support Debian Stretch, not Jessie, as described above.\r\n\r\nIn summary, .NET Core is no longer supported on Debian Jessie, with Docker or otherwise. We will produce Docker images for Jessie until .NET Core 1.0, 1.1 and 2.0 support ends, respectively, to avoid breaking applications. This aligns with the policy defined above, per [Staying up-to-date with .NET Container Images](https://blogs.msdn.microsoft.com/dotnet/2018/06/18/staying-up-to-date-with-net-container-images/).\r\n\r\n## Affected Repos\r\n\r\n* [microsoft/dotnet](https://hub.docker.com/r/microsoft/dotnet/)\r\n* [microsoft/dotnet-nightly](https://hub.docker.com/r/microsoft/dotnet-nightly/)\r\n* [microsoft/aspnetcore](https://hub.docker.com/r/microsoft/aspnetcore/)\r\n* [microsoft/aspnetcore-build](https://hub.docker.com/r/microsoft/aspnetcore-build/)","Url":"https://github.com/dotnet/announcements/issues/78","RelatedDescription":"Open issue \"Debian Jessie End of Life -- Impact on .NET Core Docker Images\" (#78)"},{"Id":"345028102","IsPullRequest":false,"CreatedAt":"2018-07-26T22:31:32","Actor":"leecow","Number":"77","RawContent":null,"Title":"https://dot.net now using TLS 1.2-only","State":"open","Body":"Earlier today, https://dot.net switched to using TLS 1.2-only.

See Guidance section.~~\r\n\r\nThe [July 2018 Security and Quality Rollup updates for .NET Framework](https://portal.msrc.microsoft.com/en-US/security-guidance/advisory/CVE-2018-8356) was released earlier this month. We have received multiple customer reports of [applications that fail to start or don't run correctly](https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/help/4345913) after installing the July 2018 update. These reports are specific to applications that initialize a COM component and run with restricted permissions.\r\n\r\nWe have stopped distributing the .NET Framework July 2018 updates on Windows Update and are actively working on fixing and re-shipping this month's updates. If you installed the July 2018 update and have not yet seen any negative behavior, we recommend that you leave your systems as-is but closely monitor them and ensure that you apply upcoming .NET Framework updates.\r\n\r\nAs a team, we regret that this release was shipped with this flaw. This release was tested using our regular and extensive testing process. We discovered while investigating this issue that we have a test hole for the specific combination of COM activation and restricted permissions, including impersonation. We will be mitigating that gap going forward. Again, we are sorry for any inconvenience that this product flaw has caused.\r\n\r\nWe will continue to update this issue and [post](https://blogs.msdn.microsoft.com/dotnet/2018/07/20/advisory-on-july-2018-net-framework-updates/) as we have new information.\r\n\r\n## Discussion\r\nPlease share your thoughts/experience on this advisory and see what others are saying at:\r\n\r\n* [microsoft/dotnet #811](https://github.com/Microsoft/dotnet/issues/811)\r\n\r\n## Guidance\r\n\r\nWe strongly recommend that you install [.NET Framework August 2018 Update](https://blogs.msdn.microsoft.com/dotnet/2018/08/14/august-2018-security-and-quality-rollup/).\r\n\r\n~~We recommend that you install [.NET Framework July 2018 Update](https://blogs.msdn.microsoft.com/dotnet/2018/07/30/net-framework-july-2018-update/) on your systems if you experienced the symptoms described in this advisory.

You must update your projects using the following instructions to address both types of dependency.\r\n\r\n### <a name=\"project-format\"></a>.NET Core Project formats\r\n\r\n.NET Core has two different project file formats, depending on what software created the project.\r\n\r\n1. `project.json` is the format used in .NET Core 1.0 and Microsoft Visual Studio 2015.\r\n2. `csproj` is the format used in .NET Core 1.1, .NET Core 2.0 and Microsoft Visual Studio 2017.\r\n\r\n#### Direct dependencies\r\n\r\nDirect dependencies are discoverable by examining your `csproj` file or your `project.json` file. They can be fixed by [editing the project file](#direct-dependencies) or using NuGet to update the dependency.\r\n\r\n The `System.Private.ServiceModel` package is not meant to be directly depended on and will not appear in your direct dependency list.\r\n\r\n#### Transitive dependencies\r\n\r\nTransitive dependencies occur when you add a package to your project that in turn relies on another package. For example, if Contoso publishes a package `Contoso.Utility` which, in turn, depends on `Contoso.Internals` and you add the `Contoso.Utility` package to your project now your project has a direct dependency on `Contoso.Utility` and, because `Contoso.Utility` depends 'Contoso.Internals', your application gains a transitive dependency on the `Contoso.Internals` package.\r\n\r\nTransitive dependencies are reviewable in three ways, depending on your [project format](#project-format):\r\n\r\n* In the Visual Studio Solution Explorer window, which supports searching.\r\n* By examining the `project.assets.json` file contained in the obj directory of your project for `csproj` based projects *OR*.\r\n* By examining the `project.lock.json` file contained in the root directory of your project for `project.json` based projects.\r\n\r\nThe `project.assets.json` and `project.lock.json` files are the authoritative list of all packages used by your project, containing both direct and transitive dependencies.\r\n\r\n#### <a name=\"direct-dependencies-vs2017\"></a>Fixing direct dependencies in a csproj based project / Visual Studio 2017\r\n\r\nOpen *projectname.csproj* in your editor. If you're using Visual Studio, right-click the project and choose **Edit projectname.csproj** from the context menu, where projectname is the name of your project. Look for `PackageReference` elements. The following shows an example project file:\r\n\r\n```xml\r\n<Project Sdk=\"Microsoft.NET.Sdk.Web\">\r\n  <PropertyGroup>\r\n    <TargetFramework>netcoreapp2.0</TargetFramework>\r\n  </PropertyGroup>\r\n  <ItemGroup>\r\n    <PackageReference Include=\"System.ServiceModel.Http\" Version=\"4.4.0\" />\r\n  </ItemGroup>\r\n</Project>\r\n```\r\n\r\nThe preceding example has a reference to the [vulnerable package](#affected-software), as seen by the single `PackageReference` element. The name of the package is in the `Include` attribute.\r\nThe package version number is in the `Version` attribute. The previous example shows a single direct dependency on `System.ServiceModel.Http` version 4.4.0.\r\n\r\nTo update the version to the secure package, change the version number to the updated package version as listed on the table [previously](#affected-software).\r\nIn this example, update `System.ServiceModel.Http` to the appropriate [fixed package number](#affected-software) for your major version. Save the *csproj* file. The example *csproj* now looks as follows:\r\n\r\n```xml\r\n<Project Sdk=\"Microsoft.NET.Sdk.Web\">\r\n  <PropertyGroup>\r\n    <TargetFramework>netcoreapp2.0</TargetFramework>\r\n  </PropertyGroup>\r\n  <ItemGroup>\r\n    <PackageReference Include=\"System.ServiceModel.Http\" Version=\"4.4.3\" />\r\n  </ItemGroup>\r\n</Project>\r\n```\r\n\r\nIf you're using Visual Studio and you save your updated *csproj* file, Visual Studio will restore the new package version.\r\nYou can see the restore results by opening the **Output** window (Ctrl+Alt+O) and changing the **Show output from** drop-down list to **Package Manager**.\r\n\r\nIf you're not using Visual Studio, open a command line and change to your project directory. Execute the `dotnet restore` command to restore the updated dependencies.\r\n\r\nNow recompile your application. If after recompilation you see a *Dependency conflict warning*, you must update your other direct dependencies to versions that take a dependency on the updated package.\r\n\r\n#### <a name=\"direct-dependencies-vs2015\"></a> Fixing Direct Dependencies in project.json based project / Visual Studio 2015\r\n\r\nOpen your `project.json` file in your editor. Look for the dependencies section. Below is an example dependencies section:\r\n\r\n``` json\r\n    \"dependencies\": {\r\n      \"Microsoft.NETCore.App\": {\r\n        \"version\": \"1.0.1\",\r\n        \"type\": \"platform\"\r\n      },\r\n     \"Microsoft.AspNetCore.Mvc.Core\": \"1.0.6\",\r\n     \"System.ServiceModel.Http\" : \"4.0.0\"\r\n    }\r\n```\r\n\r\nThis example has three direct dependencies: `Microsoft.NETCore.App`, `Microsoft.AspNetCore.Mvc.Core` and `System.ServiceModel.Http`.\r\n\r\n`Microsoft.NetCore.App` is the platform the application targets, you should ignore this. The other packages expose their version to the right of the package name. In our example, our non-platform packages are version 1.0.1.\r\n\r\nReview your direct dependencies for any instance of the packages and versions listed above. In the example above, there is a direct dependency on a vulnerable package, `System.ServiceModel.Http` version 4.4.0.\r\n\r\nTo update to the fixed package, change the version number to be the appropriate package for your release. In the example, this would be updating `System.ServiceModel.Http` to 4.4.3.\r\n\r\nAfter updating the vulnerable package versions, save your `project.json` file.\r\n\r\nThe dependencies section in our example `project.json` would now look as follows:\r\n\r\n```json\r\n  \"dependencies\": {\r\n    \"Microsoft.NETCore.App\": {\r\n      \"version\": \"1.0.1\",\r\n      \"type\": \"platform\"\r\n    },\r\n    \"Microsoft.AspNetCore.Mvc.Core\": \"1.0.6\",\r\n    \"System.ServiceModel.Http \": \"4.4.3\"\r\n  }\r\n```\r\n\r\nIf you are using Visual Studio and save your updated `project.json` file, Visual Studio will restore the new package version. You can see the restore results by opening the Output Window (Ctrl+Alt+O) and changing the Show output from drop-down list to Package Manager.\r\n\r\nIf you are not using Visual Studio, open a command line and change to your project directory. Execute the `dotnet restore` command to restore your new dependency.\r\n\r\nAfter you have addressed all of your direct dependencies, you must also review your transitive dependencies.\r\n\r\nAfter you've addressed all of your direct dependencies, you must review your transitive dependencies.\r\n\r\n#### Discovering and fixing transitive dependencies\r\n\r\nThere are two ways to view transitive dependencies. You can either [use Visual Studio’s Solution Explorer](#vs-solution-explorer), or you can review [the `project.assets.json` file](#project-assets-json) or the [the `project.lock.json` file](#project-lock-json).\r\n\r\n##### <a name=\"vs-solution-explorer\"></a>Using Visual Studio Solution Explorer\r\n\r\nTo use Solution Explorer, open the project in Visual Studio, and then press Ctrl+; to activate the search in Solution Explorer. Search for the [vulnerable package](#affected-software) and make a note of the version numbers of any results you find.\r\n\r\nFor example, searching for `Microsoft.AspNetCore.Mvc.Core` in an example project that contains a package that takes a dependency on `Microsoft.AspNetCore.Mvc` shows the following results in Visual Studio 2017:\r\n\r\n![Screenshot of search results in Visual Studio 2017](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/796298/25858816/8ecdc2b4-3491-11e7-9363-746804bb9832.png)\r\n\r\nThe search results appear as a tree. In the previous results, you can see that a reference to `Microsoft.AspNetCore.Mvc.Core` version 1.1.2 is discovered.\r\n\r\nUnder the Dependencies node is a NuGet node. Under the NuGet node is the list of packages you have directly taken a dependency on and their versions.\r\nIn screenshot, the application takes a direct dependency on `Microsoft.AspNetCore.Mvc`. `Microsoft.AspNetCore.Mvc` in turn has leaf nodes that list its dependencies and their versions.\r\nThe `Microsoft.AspNetCore.Mvc` package takes a dependency on a version of `Microsoft.AspNetCore.Mvc.ApiExplorer`, that in turn takes a dependency on a version of `Microsoft.AspNetCore.Mvc.Core`.\r\n\r\n##### <a name=\"project-assets-json\"></a> Manually reviewing project.assets.json (csproj/VS2017)\r\n\r\nOpen the *project.assets.json* file from your project’s obj directory in your editor. We suggest you use an editor that understands JSON and allows you to collapse and expand nodes to review this file.\r\nVisual Studio and Visual Studio Code provide JSON friendly editing.\r\n\r\nSearch the *project.assets.json* file for the [vulnerable package](#affected-software), using the format `packagename/` for each of the package names from the preceding table. If you find the assembly name in your search:\r\n\r\n* Examine the line on which they are found, the version number is after the `/`.\r\n* Compare to the [vulnerable versions table](#affected-software).\r\n\r\nFor example, a search result that shows `System.ServiceModel.Http/4.3.0` is a reference to version 4.3.0 of `System.ServiceModel.Http`.\r\n\r\nIf your *project.assets.json* file includes references to the [vulnerable package](#affected-software), then you need to fix the transitive dependencies.\r\n\r\nIf you have not found any reference to any vulnerable packages, this means either\r\n\r\n* None of your direct dependencies depend on any vulnerable packages, or\r\n* You have already fixed the problem by updating the direct dependencies.\r\n\r\nIf your transitive dependency review found references to the [vulnerable package](#affected-software), you must add a direct dependency to the updated package to your *csproj* file to override the transitive dependency.\r\n\r\nOpen *projectname.csproj* in your editor. If you're using Visual Studio, right-click the project and choose **Edit projectname.csproj** from the context menu, where projectname is the name of your project.\r\nLook for `PackageReference` nodes, for example:\r\n\r\n```xml\r\n<Project Sdk=\"Microsoft.NET.Sdk.\">\r\n  <PropertyGroup>\r\n    <TargetFramework>net461</TargetFramework>\r\n  </PropertyGroup>\r\n  <ItemGroup>\r\n    <PackageReference Include=\"ThirdParty.NotUpdatedYet\" Version=\"2.0.0\" />\r\n  </ItemGroup>\r\n</Project>\r\n```\r\n\r\nYou must add a direct dependency to the updated version of the [vulnerable package](#affected-software) by adding it to the *csproj* file.\r\nYou do this by adding a new line to the dependencies section, referencing the fixed version.\r\nFor example, if your search showed a transitive reference to a vulnerable `System.ServiceModel.Http` version, you'd add a reference to the [fixed package number](#affected-software).\r\n\r\n```xml\r\n<Project Sdk=\"Microsoft.NET.Sdk.Web\">\r\n  <PropertyGroup>\r\n    <TargetFramework>net461</TargetFramework>\r\n  </PropertyGroup>\r\n  <ItemGroup>\r\n    <PackageReference Include=\"System.ServiceModel.Http\" Version=\"4.3.2\" />\r\n    <PackageReference Include=\"ThirdParty.NotUpdatedYet\" Version=\"2.0.0\" />\r\n  </ItemGroup>\r\n</Project>\r\n```\r\n\r\nAfter you've added the direct dependency reference, save your *csproj* file.\r\n\r\nIf you're using Visual Studio, save your updated *csproj* file and Visual Studio will restore the new package versions.\r\nYou can see the restore results by opening the **Output** window (Ctrl+Alt+O) and changing the **Show output from** drop-down list to **Package Manager**.\r\n\r\nIf you're not using Visual Studio, open a command line and change to your project directory. Execute the `dotnet restore` command to restore the new dependencies.\r\n\r\n##### <a name=\"project-lock-json\"></a> Manually reviewing project.lock.json (project.json/VS2015)\r\n\r\nOpen the `project.lock.json` file in your editor. We suggest you use an editor that understands json and allows you to collapse and expand nodes to review this file; both Visual Studio and Visual Studio Code provide this functionality.\r\n\r\nIf you are using Visual Studio the `project.lock.json` file is “under” the `project.json` file. Click the right pointing triangle, ▷, to the left of the `project.json` file to expand the solution tree to expose the `project.lock.json` file. The following image shows a project with the `project.json` file expanded to show the `project.lock.json` file.\r\n\r\n![project lock json](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/796298/25858179/f6e01200-348f-11e7-8a77-7176d8dd3f03.png)\r\n\r\nSearch the `project.lock.json` file for the vulnerable packages, using the format `packagename/`, using each of the package names from the table above. If you find any vulnerable assembly name in your search examine the line on which they are found, the version number is after the `/` and compare to the vulnerable versions table above. For example a search result that shows `System.ServiceModel.Http/4.0.1` is a reference to v4.0.1 of `System.ServiceModel.Http`.   If your `project.lock.json` file includes references to any of the package versions shown above then you will need to fix the transitive dependencies.\r\n\r\nIf you have not found any reference to a vulnerable version of `System.ServiceModel.Http` this means none of your direct dependencies depend on any vulnerable packages or you have already fixed the problem by updating the direct dependencies.\r\n\r\nIf your transitive dependency review found references to any of the vulnerable packages you must add a direct dependency to the updated package to your `project.json` file to override the transitive dependency. Open your `project.json` and find the dependencies section. For example:\r\n\r\n``` json\r\n  \"dependencies\": {\r\n    \"Microsoft.NETCore.App\": {\r\n      \"version\": \"1.0.1\",\r\n      \"type\": \"platform\"\r\n    },\r\n    \"Microsoft.AspNetCore.Mvc\": \"1.0.0\"\r\n  }\r\n```\r\n\r\nFor each of the vulnerable packages your search returned you must add a direct dependency to the updated version by adding it to the `project.json` file. You do this by adding a new line to the dependencies section, referring the fixed version. For example, if your search showed a transitive reference to the vulnerable `System.ServiceModel.Http` version 1.0.0 you would add a reference to the appropriate fixed version, 1.0.6. Edit the `project.json` file as follows:\r\n\r\n``` json\r\n  \"dependencies\": {\r\n    \"Microsoft.NETCore.App\": {\r\n      \"version\": \"1.0.1\",\r\n      \"type\": \"platform\"\r\n    },\r\n    \"System.ServiceModel.Http\": \"4.1.2\",\r\n    \"Microsoft.AspNetCore.Mvc\": \"1.0.0\"\r\n  }\r\n```\r\n\r\nAfter you have added direct dependencies to the fixed packages, save your `project.json` file.\r\n\r\nIf you are using Visual Studio save your updated `project.json` file and Visual Studio will restore the new package versions. You can see the restore results by opening the Output Window (Ctrl+Alt+O) and changing the Show output from drop-down list to Package Manager.\r\n\r\nIf you are not using Visual Studio open a command line and change to your project directory. Execute the `dotnet restore` command to restore your new dependencies.\r\n\r\n#### Rebuilding your application\r\n\r\nFinally you must rebuild your application, test, and redeploy.\r\n\r\n## Other Information\r\n\r\n### Reporting Security Issues\r\n\r\nIf you have found a potential security issue in .NET Core, please email details to secure@microsoft.com.

Co-location of images improves image discovery. The .NET Core runtime and SDK images are already co-located. We are adding the ASP.NET Core runtime images to the [microsoft/dotnet](https://hub.docker.com/r/microsoft/dotnet/) repo as a third image type. We are [no longer producing the microsoft/aspnetcore-build image](https://github.com/aspnet/Announcements/issues/298) with .NET Core 2.1.\r\n\r\nThe following three tags are now available at the [microsoft/dotnet](https://hub.docker.com/r/microsoft/dotnet/) repo:\r\n\r\n* `2.1-sdk`\r\n* `2.1-aspnetcore-runtime`\r\n* `2.1-runtime`\r\n\r\n### Environment variables enable new scenarios\r\n\r\nWe added a set of environment variables to .NET Core docker images, for .NET Core 2.1 and later. These environment variables enable more scenarios to work without additional configuration, such as [developing ASP.NET Core applications in a container](https://github.com/dotnet/dotnet-docker/blob/master/samples/aspnetapp/aspnet-docker-dev-in-container.md).\r\n\r\nNew sdk image environment variables ([example](https://github.com/dotnet/dotnet-docker/blob/master/2.1/sdk/bionic/amd64/Dockerfile#L28-L32))\r\n* `ASPNETCORE_URLS=http://+:80`\r\n* `DOTNET_RUNNING_IN_CONTAINER=true`\r\n* `DOTNET_USE_POLLING_FILE_WATCHER=true`\r\n\r\nNew Linux runtime-deps image environment variables ([example](https://github.com/dotnet/dotnet-docker/blob/master/2.1/runtime-deps/alpine3.7/amd64/Dockerfile#L19-L21))\r\n* `ASPNETCORE_URLS=http://+:80`\r\n* `DOTNET_RUNNING_IN_CONTAINER=true`\r\n\r\nNew Windows runtime image environment variables ([example](https://github.com/dotnet/dotnet-docker/blob/master/2.1/runtime/nanoserver-1709/amd64/Dockerfile#L33-L35))\r\n* `ASPNETCORE_URLS=http://+:80`\r\n* `DOTNET_RUNNING_IN_CONTAINER=true`\r\n\r\n### New image variants\r\n\r\nAlpine and ARM32 image variants have been added and are supported as part of the .NET Core 2.1 release. \r\n\r\nFor Alpine, you must [use specific tags to create Alpine-based images](https://github.com/dotnet/dotnet-docker/blob/master/samples/dotnetapp/README.md#build-and-run-the-sample-for-alpine-with-docker), such as `2.1-runtime-alpine`. \r\n\r\nFor ARM32, you can use the regular multi-arch tags, like `2.1-runtime` and `2.1-sdk` if you are building on an ARM32 device. If you are building on another type of machine, you need to use ARM32-specific tags for the runtime images you create, such as `2.1-runtime-bionic-arm32v7` (for Ubuntu 18.04).\r\n\r\n### Related repos\r\n\r\nThe following repos are related to this announcement:\r\n\r\n* [microsoft/aspnetcore](https://hub.docker.com/r/microsoft/aspnetcore/)\r\n* [microsoft/aspnetcore-build](https://hub.docker.com/r/microsoft/aspnetcore-build/)\r\n* [microsoft/dotnet/](https://hub.docker.com/r/microsoft/dotnet/)\r\n","Url":"https://github.com/dotnet/announcements/issues/71","RelatedDescription":"Open issue \".NET Core 2.1 Docker Image Updates\" (#71)"},{"Id":"325815293","IsPullRequest":false,"CreatedAt":"2018-05-23T18:04:46","Actor":"mlacouture","Number":"70","RawContent":null,"Title":"Introducing dotnet-svcutil","State":"open","Body":"# Introducing dotnet-svcutil\r\n\r\nThe Microsoft Windows Communication Foundation (WCF) **dotnet-svcutil** tool is a .NET Core CLI tool that retrieves metadata from a web service on a network location or from a WSDL file, and generates a WCF class containing client proxy methods that you can use to access the web service operations.\r\n\r\nSimilarly to the [Service Model Metadata - svcutil](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/framework/wcf/servicemodel-metadata-utility-tool-svcutil-exe) tool for .NET Framework projects, the **dotnet-svcutil** is a command line tool for generating a web service reference compatible with .NET Core and .NET Standard projects. \r\n\r\nThe **dotnet-svcutil** tool is an alternative option to the [WCF Web Service Reference ](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/core/additional-tools/wcf-web-service-reference-guide)Visual Studio connected service provider which first shipped with Visual Studio 2017 v15.5.

An attacker who successfully exploited this vulnerability could cause a denial of service against a .NET Framework, .NET Core, or .NET native application.\r\n\r\nThe update addresses the vulnerability by correcting how .NET Framework, .NET Core, and .NET native applications handle XML document processing.\r\n\r\nIf your application is an ASP.NET Core application, developers are also advised to update to [ASP.NET Core 2.0.8](https://www.nuget.org/packages/Microsoft.AspNetCore.All/2.0.8).\r\n\r\n## Discussion\r\n\r\nDiscussion for this issue can be found at https://github.com/dotnet/corefx/issues/29578\r\n\r\n### <a name=\"mitigation-factors\"></a>Mitigation factors\r\n\r\n* If an application does not process signed XML, it is not affected by this vulnerability.\r\n* If your application targets .NET Core 1.x or .NET native 1.x, it is not affected as the vulnerable package is not available for these platforms.\r\n\r\n## <a name=\"affected-software\"></a>Affected software\r\n\r\nAny .NET Core, .NET native, or ASP.NET Core based application that uses System.Security.Cryptography.Xml with a version of 4.4.1 or earlier.\r\n\r\nPackage name | Vulnerable versions | Secure versions\r\n------------ | ---------------- | -------------------------\r\nSystem.Security.Cryptography.Xml | ≤4.4.1 |  4.4.2 or later\r\n\r\n## <a name=\"advisory-faq\"></a>Advisory FAQ\r\n### <a name=\"how-affected\"></a>How do I know if I am affected?\r\n\r\n.NET Core has two types of dependencies: direct and transitive. Direct dependencies are dependencies where you specifically add a package to your project, transitive dependencies occur when you add a package to your project that in turn relies on another package.\r\n\r\nFor example, the `Microsoft.AspNetCore.Mvc` package depends on the `Microsoft.AspNetCore.Mvc.Core` package. When you add a dependency on `Microsoft.AspNetCore.Mvc` in your project, you're taking a transitive dependency on `Microsoft.AspNetCore.Mvc.Core`.\r\n\r\nAny application that has a direct or transitive dependency on the [affected package](#affected-software) can be exposed to the vulnerability if it does not meet any of the [mitigation factors](#mitigation-factors).\r\n\r\n### <a name=\"how-fix\"></a>How do I fix the issue?\r\n---\r\n\r\nIf you're targeting ASP.NET Core 2.0 and using the `Microsoft.AspNetCore.All` metapackage:\r\n\r\n* Update its version number to [2.0.8](https://www.nuget.org/packages/Microsoft.AspNetCore.All/2.0.8) to pull in updated packages that update their transitive dependencies to the fixed version of `System.Security.Cryptography.Xml`.\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n.NET Core projects have two types of dependencies: direct and transitive. You must update your projects using the following instructions to address both types of dependency.\r\n\r\n#### Direct dependencies\r\n\r\nDirect dependencies are discoverable by examining your *csproj* file. They can be fixed by [editing the csproj file](#direct-dependencies) or using NuGet to update the dependency.\r\n\r\n#### Transitive dependencies\r\n\r\nTransitive dependencies occur when you add a package to your project that in turn relies on another package. For example, if Contoso publishes a package `Contoso.Utility` which, in turn, depends on `Contoso.Internals` and you add the `Contoso.Utility` package to your project now your project has a direct dependency on `Contoso.Utility` and, because `Contoso.Utility` depends 'Contoso.Internals', your application gains a transitive dependency on the `Contoso.Internals` package.\r\n\r\nTransitive dependencies are reviewable in two ways:\r\n\r\n* In the Visual Studio Solution Explorer window, which supports searching.\r\n* By examining the *project.assets.json* file contained in the obj directory of your project.\r\n\r\nThe *project.assets.json* files are the authoritative list of all packages used by your project, containing both direct and transitive dependencies.\r\n\r\n#### <a name=\"direct-dependencies\"></a>Fixing direct dependencies\r\n\r\nOpen *projectname.csproj* in your editor. If you're using Visual Studio, right-click the project and choose **Edit projectname.csproj** from the context menu, where projectname is the name of your project. Look for `PackageReference` elements. The following shows an example project file:\r\n\r\n```xml\r\n<Project Sdk=\"Microsoft.NET.Sdk\">\r\n  <PropertyGroup>\r\n    <TargetFramework>netcoreapp2.0</TargetFramework>\r\n  </PropertyGroup>\r\n  <ItemGroup>\r\n    <PackageReference Include=\"System.Security.Cryptography.Xml\" Version=\"4.4.1\" />\r\n  </ItemGroup>\r\n</Project>\r\n```\r\n\r\nThe preceding example has a reference to the [vulnerable package](#affected-software), as seen by the single `PackageReference` element. The name of the package is in the `Include` attribute.\r\nThe package version number is in the `Version` attribute. The previous example shows a single direct dependency on `System.Security.Cryptography.Xml` version 4.4.1.\r\n\r\nTo update the version to the secure package, change the version number to the updated package version as listed on the table [previously](#affected-software).\r\nIn this example, update `System.Security.Cryptography.Xml` to a [fixed package number](#affected-software). Save the *csproj* file. The example *csproj* now looks as follows:\r\n\r\n```xml\r\n<Project Sdk=\"Microsoft.NET.Sdk\">\r\n  <PropertyGroup>\r\n    <TargetFramework>netcoreapp2.0</TargetFramework>\r\n  </PropertyGroup>\r\n  <ItemGroup>\r\n    <PackageReference Include=\"System.Security.Cryptography.Xml\" Version=\"4.4.2\" />\r\n  </ItemGroup>\r\n</Project>\r\n```\r\n\r\nIf you're using Visual Studio and you save your updated *csproj* file, Visual Studio will restore the new package version.\r\nYou can see the restore results by opening the **Output** window (Ctrl+Alt+O) and changing the **Show output from** drop-down list to **Package Manager**.\r\n\r\nIf you're not using Visual Studio, open a command line and change to your project directory. Execute the `dotnet restore` command to restore the updated dependencies.\r\n\r\nNow recompile your application. If after recompilation you see a *Dependency conflict warning*, you must update your other direct dependencies to versions that take a dependency on the updated package.\r\n\r\nAfter you've addressed all of your direct dependencies, you must review your transitive dependencies.\r\n\r\n#### Discovering and fixing transitive dependencies\r\n\r\nThere are two ways to view transitive dependencies. You can either [use Visual Studio’s Solution Explorer](#vs-solution-explorer), or you can [review the *project.assets.json* file](#project-assets-json).\r\n\r\n##### <a name=\"vs-solution-explorer\"></a>Using Visual Studio Solution Explorer\r\n\r\nTo use Solution Explorer, open the project in Visual Studio 2017, and then press Ctrl+; to activate the search in Solution Explorer. Search for the [vulnerable package](#affected-software) and make a note of the version numbers of any results you find.\r\n\r\nFor example, searching for `Microsoft.AspNetCore.Mvc.Core` in an example project that contains a package that takes a dependency on `Microsoft.AspNetCore.Mvc` shows the following results in Visual Studio 2017:\r\n\r\n![Screenshot of search results in Visual Studio 2017](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/796298/25858816/8ecdc2b4-3491-11e7-9363-746804bb9832.png)\r\n\r\nThe search results appear as a tree. In the previous results, you can see that a reference to `Microsoft.AspNetCore.Mvc.Core` version 1.1.2 is discovered.\r\n\r\nUnder the Dependencies node is a NuGet node. Under the NuGet node is the list of packages you have directly taken a dependency on and their versions.\r\nIn screenshot, the application takes a direct dependency on `Microsoft.AspNetCore.Mvc`. `Microsoft.AspNetCore.Mvc` in turn has leaf nodes that list its dependencies and their versions.\r\nThe `Microsoft.AspNetCore.Mvc` package takes a dependency on a version of `Microsoft.AspNetCore.Mvc.ApiExplorer`, that in turn takes a dependency on a version of `Microsoft.AspNetCore.Mvc.Core`.\r\n\r\n##### <a name=\"project-assets-json\"></a>Manually reviewing project.assets.json\r\n\r\nOpen the *project.assets.json* file from your project’s obj directory in your editor. We suggest you use an editor that understands JSON and allows you to collapse and expand nodes to review this file.\r\nVisual Studio and Visual Studio Code provide JSON friendly editing.\r\n\r\nSearch the *project.assets.json* file for the [vulnerable package](#affected-software), using the format `packagename/` for each of the package names from the preceding table. If you find the assembly name in your search:\r\n\r\n* Examine the line on which they are found, the version number is after the `/`.\r\n* Compare to the [vulnerable versions table](#affected-software).\r\n\r\nFor example, a search result that shows `System.Security.Cryptography.Xml/4.4.0` is a reference to version 4.4.0 of `System.Security.Cryptography.Xml`.\r\nIf your *project.assets.json* file includes references to the [vulnerable package](#affected-software), then you need to fix the transitive dependencies.\r\n\r\n##### Fixing transitive dependencies\r\n\r\nIf you have not found any reference to any vulnerable packages, this means either\r\n\r\n* None of your direct dependencies depend on any vulnerable packages, or\r\n* You have already fixed the problem by updating the direct dependencies.\r\n\r\nIf your transitive dependency review found references to the [vulnerable package](#affected-software), you must add a direct dependency to the updated package to your *csproj* file to override the transitive dependency.\r\n\r\nOpen *projectname.csproj* in your editor. If you're using Visual Studio, right-click the project and choose **Edit projectname.csproj** from the context menu, where projectname is the name of your project.\r\nLook for `PackageReference` nodes, for example:\r\n\r\n```xml\r\n<Project Sdk=\"Microsoft.NET.Sdk.\">\r\n  <PropertyGroup>\r\n    <TargetFramework>net461</TargetFramework>\r\n  </PropertyGroup>\r\n  <ItemGroup>\r\n    <PackageReference Include=\"ThirdParty.NotUpdatedYet\" Version=\"2.0.0\" />\r\n  </ItemGroup>\r\n</Project>\r\n```\r\n\r\nYou must add a direct dependency to the updated version of the [vulnerable package](#affected-software) by adding it to the *csproj* file.\r\nYou do this by adding a new line to the dependencies section, referencing the fixed version.\r\nFor example, if your search showed a transitive reference to a vulnerable `System.Security.Cryptography.Xml` version, you'd add a reference to the [fixed package number](#affected-software).\r\n\r\n```xml\r\n<Project Sdk=\"Microsoft.NET.Sdk.Web\">\r\n  <PropertyGroup>\r\n    <TargetFramework>net461</TargetFramework>\r\n  </PropertyGroup>\r\n  <ItemGroup>\r\n    <PackageReference Include=\"System.Security.Cryptography.Xml\" Version=\"4.4.2\" />\r\n    <PackageReference Include=\"ThirdParty.NotUpdatedYet\" Version=\"2.0.0\" />\r\n  </ItemGroup>\r\n</Project>\r\n```\r\n\r\nAfter you've added the direct dependency reference, save your *csproj* file.\r\n\r\nIf you're using Visual Studio, save your updated *csproj* file and Visual Studio will restore the new package versions.\r\nYou can see the restore results by opening the **Output** window (Ctrl+Alt+O) and changing the **Show output from** drop-down list to **Package Manager**.\r\n\r\nIf you're not using Visual Studio, open a command line and change to your project directory. Execute the `dotnet restore` command to restore the new dependencies.\r\n\r\n#### Rebuilding your application\r\n\r\nFinally you must rebuild your application, test, and redeploy.\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\nIf you're targeting .NET native for a Universal Windows Platform (UWP) application, you should update your dependencies and republish your application.\r\n\r\nIf you submit an application to the Windows Store with an outdated reference, the store will update the reference automatically, which has the potential for compatibility issues. Thus, we recommend updating your application directly and testing its functionality before resubmitting.\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n## Other Information\r\n\r\n### Reporting Security Issues\r\n\r\nIf you have found a potential security issue in .NET Core, please email details to secure@microsoft.com.
