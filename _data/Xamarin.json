The\r\nchanges are focused only around the very first stage of application startup -\r\nbetween Android invoking our Java startup code (MonoPackageManager) and the end\r\nof our `Runtime.init` (`Java_mono_android_Runtime_init` in the native runtime)\r\nwhich is when the user application is fully initialized and ready to start is\r\nlauncher Activity.\r\n\r\nIn order to achieve the goal, the following changes were made:\r\n\r\n * Java class lookup (\"reflection\").\r\n   We used to call the `FindClass` JNI function as part of the startup at a cost\r\n   of several milliseconds. We now put the class handles (accessed with the\r\n   `.class` Java accessor) in the `Runtime` class and initialize them from the\r\n   static constructor. We then read those fields from within `Runtime.init`,\r\n   which is passed a reference to the Java instance of the Runtime class.\r\n   Additonally, a handful of class field/method lookups were moved out of the\r\n   init code so that the code that doesn't use them doesn't have to pay the tax.\r\n\r\n * Android API level is passed to `Runtime.init` from Java instead of using JNI\r\n   from the native code.\r\n\r\n * Limit logging.\r\n   Previously whenever any of the `log_{info,debug}` functions were called we'd\r\n   spend time preparing all the parameters to pass to the function, sometimes\r\n   involving memory allocation, function calls, etc - only to discard all of\r\n   that work **inside** the `log_*` call because the logging category used in\r\n   that call was disabled. Now we check whether the category is enabled before\r\n   we set out to construct the parameters.\r\n\r\n * Java/JNI type wrappers for string and array of strings.\r\n   This both a convenience/correctness as well as a performance change.\r\n   Introduced are two C++ wrapper classes for the `jstring` and `object array`\r\n   types (specialized for object == jstring) which take care of efficiently\r\n   caching the retrieved strings as well as of correctly deleting local\r\n   references to the obtained objects. Both classes, `jstring_wrapper` and\r\n   `jstring_array_wrapper` are optimized so that they compile into the\r\n   equivalent of the current, hand-written, code. They also take care to make\r\n   the minimum necessary number of calls in order to access the strings, both\r\n   standalone and from arrays, as well as to release the resources.\r\n   The string and array wrappers are passed around as references, thus using the\r\n   minimum amount of memory.\r\n\r\n * Do not preload managed assemblies.\r\n   We used to preload all of the application assemblies in order to find and\r\n   invoke type initializers. This resulted in the list of assemblies being\r\n   processed twice at the great expense of time. We now don't call the type\r\n   initializers at all and the assemblies are loaded on demand.\r\n\r\n * Do not store application environment variables in a file inside the apk.\r\n   The textual file used to be read from the apk(s) early in the process,\r\n   requiring iteration over all the application apk files, opening each of them,\r\n   browsing through the ZIP entries and, finally, reading the file line by line,\r\n   parsing into the name and value parts to create either a\r\n   property (`mono.aot`, `mono.llvm`) or any environment variables requested by\r\n   the application developer (or the XA runtime).\r\n   To speed the process up, this commit replaces the text file with a Java class\r\n   generated during application build which contains an array of `\"name\",\r\n   \"value\"` pairs. The class is passed to `Java_mono_android_Runtime_init` and\r\n   its elements are used to create the requested environment variables. A\r\n   handful of variables is special-cased in that they are not placed in the\r\n   environment but rather to set flags in the `AndroidSystem` class. The\r\n   variables are `mono.aot`, `mono.llvm` and `__XA_DSO_IN_APK`.

I have written the custom view  as (MyView.cs) which is derived from the Loyout < **View**> and  also written renderer (as MyViewRenderer.cs) in UWP platform,  when i add any other view or layout (Like scrollview, stack-layout) as children to my custom view , touch manipulation events are working fine.

I doesn't get any notification from the manipulation events.\r\nI have attached a sample & video in this report.\r\n\r\n**Note**\r\nDon't use pointer , pointer events are working fine.\r\n\r\n### Steps to Reproduce\r\n1.

First go to Mainpage.cs file in PCL and add  **Scrollview**  as a child to my view(MyView) and run the sample, once it get into the view, place a breakpoint inside (MyViewRenderer.cs renderer in UWP )in manipulationDelta, manipulation-completed, manipulation-started event's, Now do the touch interaction in screen , you can see that all manipulation events are triggered and working fine.\r\n4. Now change the child to  **ListView** from MainPage.cs and do the same touch interaction . you would see that manipulation events aren't triggered while touch interaction.\r\n\r\n### Expected Behavior\r\n 1.
