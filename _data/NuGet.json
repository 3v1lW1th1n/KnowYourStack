Looks like it think, that Internal Server Error is bad request and try again to push package, but in reality package was pushed to gallery after first attempt.\r\n\r\nI completly delete this package from my nuget gallery, and try to push againt from **all clients** dicribed in `NuGet product used` section below, and that behavior repeats again and again.\r\n\r\n## NuGet product used\r\nNuget Gallery\r\nnuget-4.1.0.exe\r\nnuget-4.3.0.exe\r\nnuget-4.4.1.exe\r\nnuget-4.5.1.exe\r\nnuget-4.6.2.exe\r\nnuget-4.7.1.exe\r\nnuget-4.8.1.exe\r\nnuget-4.9.2.exe\r\nNuget Publish step in Teamcity ( https://confluence.jetbrains.com/display/TCD10/NuGet+Publish )\r\n\r\n"},{"Id":"8947264766","Type":"IssuesEvent","CreatedAt":"2019-01-24T21:38:51","Actor":"skofman1","Repository":"NuGet/NuGetGallery","Organization":"NuGet","RawContent":null,"RelatedAction":"closed","RelatedUrl":"https://github.com/NuGet/NuGetGallery/issues/6835","RelatedDescription":"Closed issue \"Search returns results in no discernable order\" (#6835) at NuGet/NuGetGallery","RelatedBody":"I cannot figure out the order in which gallery returns search results.
