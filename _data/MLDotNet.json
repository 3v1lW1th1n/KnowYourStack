This is somewhat different than other components, since evaluators are not pipeline components (excepting per-instance evaluators, perhaps), as we see here in the aspirational examples.\r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/dotnet/machinelearning/blob/df499aa9ea1d671e0df1c432622745c295e3e675/test/Microsoft.ML.Tests/Scenarios/Api/AspirationalExamples.cs#L133\r\n\r\nOne interesting part of the work is the introduction of a method of identifying columns. We already have this somewhat in the `.Append` method, where we are given an instance of the shape type, and select columns from it to show what to append. Here the technique looks identical, but we're in this case selecting a single item.\r\n\r\nWhat makes me a little nervous about this approach is that if the operations are extension methods on the column types, I see absolutely no way to prevent someone from calling one of those extension methods inside that \"indexer\" delegate, short of adding more protections in the analyzer. (And, maybe \r\nthis is fine, since the analyzer is clear and really this is probably a mistake a sensible person might plausibly make once.) More generally I talked about this in my remarks on [\"context\" here](https://github.com/dotnet/machinelearning/issues/632#issuecomment-416391466).\r\n\r\nRelated to #632.","Url":"https://github.com/dotnet/machinelearning/issues/868","RelatedDescription":"Open issue \"Statically Piped Evaluators for Binary Classification and Regression\" (#868)"},{"Id":"357778618","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2018-09-08T21:02:27","Actor":"sfilipi","Number":"849","RawContent":null,"Title":"Ap, LinearSVM, OGD as estimators","State":"closed","Body":"Converting AveragePerceptron, LinearSVM and ODG trainers to estimators. \r\n","Url":"https://github.com/dotnet/machinelearning/pull/849","RelatedDescription":"Closed or merged PR \"Ap, LinearSVM, OGD as estimators\" (#849)"},{"Id":"357843267","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2018-09-08T16:10:11","Actor":"sfilipi","Number":"851","RawContent":null,"Title":"For the GitHub issues classification aspirational example, the 'Area' is not needed as input to Predict(), since it is the label.","State":"closed","Body":"Creating a IssueInput class for the github classification pigsty aspirational example, and removing the Area - since it is the label, ad the ID - since it is not used, from the example.
