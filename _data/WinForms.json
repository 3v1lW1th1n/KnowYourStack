The types you mentioned are not added in Core 3.0, we are still finalizing the list of the APIs for Core 3.0, so we'd like to know more about your scenarios. Could you tell us how you are using these types in your app?\r\n\r\nAlso if you haven't done it yet, I would suggest running [Portability Analyzer](https://blogs.msdn.microsoft.com/dotnet/2018/08/08/are-your-windows-forms-and-wpf-applications-ready-for-net-core-3-0/) that will show all APIs in your app that are not yet included in .NET Core 3.0.\n\n---\n\n@jnm2 commented on [Tue Sep 18 2018](https://github.com/dotnet/core-sdk/issues/79#issuecomment-422492997)\n\nHi Olia,\r\n\r\nOur applications depend on DevExpress's End User Report Designer ([docs](https://docs.devexpress.com/XtraReports/10715/create-end-user-reporting-applications/winforms-reporting/end-user-report-designer)). DevExpress built it on top of the System.ComponentModel/IDesignerHost/CodeDOM set of abstractions, very much like the Windows Forms designer itself.\r\n\r\nThis designer ships for our users at runtime (as the name suggests). We've written custom reporting elements that integrate with it. Since DevExpress based the designer heavily on System.Design, our integrations with the report designer are also tied to System.Design. We're hoping that this doesn't keep us from moving to .NET Core.\r\n\r\nIn this report, see especially `DevExpress.XtraReports.v17.2.Extensions.dll` which houses their End User Report Designer: [Portability report for DevExpress dependencies.xlsx](https://github.com/dotnet/core-sdk/files/2393989/Portability.report.for.DevExpress.dependencies.xlsx)\r\n\r\nThat's what DevExpress's code needs. Our code, which merely integrates with DevExpress's report designer, ends up directly using these types:\r\n\r\n<details>\r\n\r\n```\r\nT:System.ComponentModel.Design.CollectionEditor\r\nT:System.ComponentModel.Design.CollectionEditor.CollectionForm\r\nT:System.ComponentModel.Design.ComponentDesigner\r\nT:System.ComponentModel.Design.DesignerActionItem\r\nT:System.ComponentModel.Design.DesignerActionItemCollection\r\nT:System.ComponentModel.Design.DesignerActionList\r\nT:System.ComponentModel.Design.DesignerActionListCollection\r\nT:System.ComponentModel.Design.DesignerActionMethodItem\r\nT:System.ComponentModel.Design.DesignerActionPropertyItem\r\nT:System.ComponentModel.Design.DesignerActionTextItem\r\nT:System.ComponentModel.Design.DesignerActionUIService\r\nT:System.ComponentModel.Design.DesignerActionUIStateChangeEventArgs\r\nT:System.ComponentModel.Design.DesignerActionUIStateChangeEventHandler\r\nT:System.ComponentModel.Design.DesignerActionUIStateChangeType\r\nT:System.ComponentModel.Design.MultilineStringEditor\r\nT:System.ComponentModel.Design.Serialization.CodeDomSerializer\r\nT:System.ComponentModel.Design.Serialization.CodeDomSerializerBase\r\nT:System.ComponentModel.Design.Serialization.DesignerSerializationManager\r\nT:System.Drawing.Design.IToolboxService\r\nT:System.Drawing.Design.ToolboxItem\r\nT:System.Drawing.Design.ToolboxItemCollection\r\nT:System.Windows.Forms.Design.AnchorEditor\r\nT:System.Windows.Forms.Design.Behavior.Behavior\r\nT:System.Windows.Forms.Design.Behavior.BehaviorService\r\nT:System.Windows.Forms.Design.Behavior.ControlBodyGlyph\r\nT:System.Windows.Forms.Design.Behavior.GlyphSelectionType\r\nT:System.Windows.Forms.Design.ControlDesigner\r\nT:System.Windows.Forms.Design.ParentControlDesigner\r\nT:System.Windows.Forms.Design.ScrollableControlDesigner\r\nT:System.Windows.Forms.Design.SelectionRules\r\n```\r\n\r\n</details><br/>\r\n\r\nAnd

The missing API set is nearly identical. In our case they are design-time only and we have a build option to strip them out of release builds, so we are still able to run our application on .NET Core 3 alpha today (with some additional fixes discussed in the CoreFX repository issues).\r\n\r\nI suspect this will come up quite often and it has to be addressed in one way or another. I was hoping that this will eventually come later when the WinForms design-time support is brought in later preview. I'm taking a wait-and-see approach on this one, but wanted to express some support that the scenario is probably common. \n\n---\n\n@OliaG commented on [Tue Sep 18 2018](https://github.com/dotnet/core-sdk/issues/79#issuecomment-422544930)\n\nThank you Filip!\r\n@Tanya-Solyanik\n\n---\n\n@lextm commented on [Thu Dec 06 2018](https://github.com/dotnet/core-sdk/issues/79#issuecomment-444999032)\n\nI think `<Reference Include=\"System.Design\" />` should not work by design.

The existing overload taking `byte[]` does not even allow to specify an offset and length of the array.\r\n\r\nSince the current overloads allow specifying an empty interval and only check whether the parameter (`byte[]` or `Stream` is null), it is also possible to avoid any parameter check since `Span<T>` is a `ref struct` and cannot be null.\r\nThe parameter `Span<byte>` can be empty, as it is for the other overloads.\r\n\r\n## Implementation\r\nThe proposed implementation of the new public API is the following:\r\n```c#\r\npublic virtual void SetAudio(Span<byte> audioBytes)\r\n{\r\n    var stream = new MemoryStream(audioBytes.Length);\r\n    stream.Write(audioBytes);\r\n    stream.Seek(0, SeekOrigin.Begin);\r\n    SetAudio(stream);\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nThe MemoryStream is not disposed as it is not directly consumed from the called methods.

Since the font property is an ambient property, the font size changes propagate to all hosted controls so that they are also affected by the font size changes, and for which the display has already been adapted to the changed pixel density. The trigger for the font adjustment is the method `WmDpiChangedBeforeParent` in the control class. \r\n \r\nSecondly, further DPI-dependent adjustments must be made, and the `RescaleConstantsForDpi` method, which can be overwritten, provides the second approach.\r\n \r\n**Challenges with ToolStrip based Controls**\r\n \r\nAll classes inherited from `ToolStripItem` are not controls, but components, so they are not included in the normal method inheritance chain, or in other words: `RescaleConstantsForDpi` is not invoked for component based classes. `ToolStripDropDown`, which forms the container for an opened pulldown menu/pulldown `ToolBoxButton`, is only instantiated if needed and is not part of the normal control tree of a Forms/Control container. For this reason, this control does not implicitly gets its overridden `RescaleConstantsForDPI` called either.\r\n \r\n**Solution**\r\n \r\nIn order to get the right point in time within the normally excluded control classes when the DPI change (the transition from one monitor to another) occurs, we enable `ToolStrip` itself in a way other controls/components can register at the `ToolStrip` to receive a kind of `Rescale` event. This is done with the new field variable `rescaleConstsCallbackDelegate`. Because `ToolStrip` itself is placed on a form or container, its `RescaleConstantsForDPI` is called accordingly, so it performs the Invoke based on this delegate, triggering all listening components. However, this event must be initially wired for all of the `ToolStripItem`-based components it is hosting, and this is done in `ToolStripItem`'s `SetOwner` method.\r\nThis means that `ToolStrip`, all controls derived from `ToolStrip` and also all components derived from `ToolStripItem` are triggered when the DPI changes and the required size adjustments are due. A problem remains with the `ToolStripDropDown` containers, which host only `ToolStripDropDownItem`-based components, but which again are derived from `ToolStripItem`. The latter enables us to intervene in the rescaling event, determine if the affected `ToolStripItem` \"has\" a `DropDown`, and then make any necessary rescaling here (and in any subordinate) as well. This happens in the `ProcessDropDownItems` method of the `ToolStripDropDownItem` class, which in turn is called by `ToolStrip_RescaleConstants` (and which in turn is triggered by the new delegate in `ToolStrip` and the wiring of `ToolStripItem`).\r\n \r\nCode changes in all remaining classes then serve as far as possible to make the actual size adjustments for the new DPI value.","Url":"https://github.com/dotnet/winforms/issues/215","RelatedDescription":"Open issue \"Port ToolStrip HighDpi improvements from Framework runtime to Core\" (#215)"},{"Id":"389004281","IsPullRequest":false,"CreatedAt":"2018-12-09T09:43:01","Actor":"MohammadHamdyGhanem","Number":"214","RawContent":null,"Title":"Upgrade ReportViewer  Control","State":"open","Body":"1- Allow us to change the default zoom of the ReportViewrer  control programmatically.
