This allow's webpack (for those who want to opt-in to requiring vue-routers's original source files (instead of the flattened esm bundles) and want to remove flow type through a babel-transform, then this will allow webpack to aggressively ignore and treeshake unused exports throughout the module system (if they exist!)\r\n\r\nIn many cases this can yield hidden and surprising build time improvements and size reductions in the case that modules flattened from rollup aren't actually needed when webpack performs a scope analysis. \r\n\r\nThe angular team has adopted this approach for the CLI yielding some strong build time speed for webpack (since unused exports are also not resolved, parsed, etc.). From my assessment of the module graph created, it looks that there are no sideEffects created against existing re-exports throughout the codebase, therefore even if a user did opt in on their own will, and remove flow types, there should be no danger of removing code that is needed and causing breakages. \r\n\r\nOverall, this already will not be a breaking change in any way but just provides extra benefits to those (and for the cli (if realized) when using webpack 4 and `mode: production`).\r\n\r\nHappy to answer any other questions.\r\n~Sean + [webpack team](https://github.com/webpack) ","Url":"https://github.com/vuejs/vue-router/pull/2180","RelatedDescription":"Open PR \"chore(package.json): add sideEffects: false field to package.json\" (#2180)"},{"Id":"318302414","IsPullRequest":false,"CreatedAt":"2018-04-27T07:43:34","Actor":"adityarw","Number":"2179","RawContent":null,"Title":"am unable to use multiple views giving error","State":"closed","Body":"### Version\r\n2.5.2\r\n\r\n### Reproduction link\r\n[https://jsfiddle.net/posva/6du90epg/](https://jsfiddle.net/posva/6du90epg/)\r\n\r\n### Steps to reproduce\r\nam new to vue please help me..\r\n\r\nrouting code :\r\n\r\nimport Vue from 'vue'\r\nimport Router from 'vue-router'\r\nimport HelloWorld from '@/components/HelloWorld'\r\nimport HelloWorlds from '@/components/HelloWorlds'\r\n\r\nVue.use(Router)\r\n\r\nexport default new Router({\r\nroutes: [\r\n{\r\npath: '/',\r\ncomponent: {\r\ndefault: HelloWorld,\r\nb: HelloWorlds\r\n}\r\n},\r\n{\r\npath: 'nav',\r\nname: 'HelloWorlds',\r\ncomponent: HelloWorlds\r\n}\r\n]\r\n})\r\n\r\nVue component\r\n\r\n<script> export default { name: 'App' } </script> <style> #app { font-family: 'Avenir', Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif; -webkit-font-smoothing: antialiased; -moz-osx-font-smoothing: grayscale; text-align: center; color: #2c3e50; margin-top: 60px; } </style>\r\n\r\n### What is expected?\r\ni need to show 2 view one above the other. \r\n\r\n### What is actually happening?\r\ngiving error like this\r\n[Vue warn]: Failed to mount component: template or render function not defined.\r\n\r\nfound in\r\n\r\n---> <Anonymous>\r\n       <App> at src/App.vue\r\n         <Root>\r\n\r\n<!-- generated by vue-issues.

An example of this is using Vue as a frontend for Wordpress, but allowing wordpress to dictate the url structure.\r\n\r\nSo for example\r\n\r\nwould have a route that looks like:\r\n```\r\n{\r\n      name: 'post',\r\n      path: '/:permalink([0-9] [/][0-9] [/][\\\\S] )',\r\n      component: StandardArticle\r\n}\r\n```\r\nand a page would have a route that looks like:\r\n```\r\n{\r\n     name: 'page',\r\n     path: '/:permalink*',\r\n     component: StandardPage\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nThis would mean a post url would look like\r\n/2018/04/some-post\r\nand a page would look like\r\n/some-page\r\n\r\nThe regular expressions work but when you actually try to use them it would look like \r\n/2018%2F04%2Fsome-post\r\nfor the post route, page route would look fine since it does not have a / normally\r\n\r\nI see this is an option in path-to-regex but the option is not forwarded to vue-router.

This allow's webpack (for those who want to opt-in to requiring vuex's original source files (instead of the flattened esm bundles), then this will allow webpack to aggressively ignore and treeshake unused exports throughout the module system. \r\n\r\nIn many cases this can yield hidden and surprising build time improvements and size reductions in the case that modules flattened from rollup aren't actually needed when webpack performs a scope analysis. \r\n\r\nThe angular team has adopted this approach for the CLI yielding some strong build time speed for webpack (since unused exports are also not resolved, parsed, etc.). From my assessment of the module graph created, it looks that there are no sideEffects created against existing re-exports throughout the codebase, therefore even if a user did opt in on their own will, and remove flow types, there should be no danger of removing code that is needed and causing breakages. \r\n\r\nOverall, this already will not be a breaking change in any way but just provides extra benefits to those (and for the cli (if realized) when using webpack 4 and `mode: production`).

In the actions below, I use the library `axios` to make http request, and I return it as a promise:\r\n\r\n```ts\r\n    const actions = {    \r\n      getCurrentSession(context: Context) {\r\n        return axios.get(\"http://localhost:3000/sessions/current\")\r\n          .then((res) => {\r\n            commitSharedFiles(context, res.data.shared_files);\r\n          })\r\n          .catch((e: string) => {\r\n            console.error(e);\r\n          });\r\n      }\r\n    };\r\n    \r\n    // export action\r\n    export const dispatchGetSharedFiles = dispatch(actions.getCurrentSession);\r\n\r\n    // commit\r\n    export const commitSharedFiles = commit(mutations.setSharedFileList);\r\n    \r\n    // mutations to the state tree\r\n    const mutations = {\r\n      setSharedFileList(state: State, sharedFiles: StoreState.DirFile[]) {\r\n        state.sharedFileList = sharedFiles;\r\n      }\r\n    };\r\n```\r\nBecause of the asynchronous nature of the actions, I have to resolve the promise before retrieving the fetched list of files from the store/state tree:\r\n```ts\r\n    // this is called in the mounted() life cycle method:\r\n    Store.dispatchGetSharedFiles(this.$store).then(res => {\r\n                this.sharedFiles = Store.readSharedFilesList(this.$store);\r\n    });\r\n```\r\nThis works, but I think it is very convoluted to resolve the promise and then get the data. Is there a better way to use async actions in Vuex? thanks\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n### What does the proposed API look like?\r\nno idea\r\n\r\n<!-- generated by vue-issues.
