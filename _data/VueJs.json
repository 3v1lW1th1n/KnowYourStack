The current name \"slot-scope\" is rather misleading because \"scope\" is the wrong concept to suggest; particularly given Angular's use of scope.  The true and correct concept is \"props\".    My suggested name change, will render current developer confusions moot.    You will have less explaining (and developer questions) to answer.\r\n\r\nI know a 2nd rename is gross, but it will help make learning Vue easier.\r\n\r\n### What does the proposed API look like?\r\nAdd slot-props (alias) for slot-scope, prefer \"slot-props\" in documentation.   deprecate the spelling \"slot-scope\"\r\n\r\n<!-- generated by vue-issues.
