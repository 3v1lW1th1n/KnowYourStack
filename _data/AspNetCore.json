Direct dependencies are dependencies where you specifically add a package to your project, transitive dependencies occur when you add a package to your project that in turn relies on another package.\r\n\r\nFor example, the `Microsoft.AspNetCore.Mvc` package depends on the `Microsoft.AspNetCore.Mvc.Core` package. When you add a dependency on `Microsoft.AspNetCore.Mvc` in your project, you're taking a transitive dependency on `Microsoft.AspNetCore.Mvc.Core`.\r\n\r\nAny application that has a direct or transitive dependency on the [affected packages](#affected-software) can be exposed to the vulnerability.\r\n\r\n### How do I fix the issue?\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\nIf you're targeting .NET Core 2.x and the `Microsoft.AspNetCore.All` \"metapackage\":\r\n\r\n* Update its version number to 2.0.8 if you have targetted 2.0.x *OR*\r\n* Update its version number to 2.1.0-rc1-final if you have targetted previews of 2.1\r\n\r\nUpdating the metapackage will update the [affected packages](#affected-software)\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n.NET Core projects have two types of dependencies: direct and transitive. You must update your projects using the following instructions to address both types of dependency.\r\n\r\n#### Direct dependencies\r\n\r\nDirect dependencies are discoverable by examining your *csproj* file. They can be fixed by [editing the csproj file](#direct-dependencies) or using NuGet to update the dependency.\r\n\r\n#### Transitive dependencies\r\n\r\nTransitive dependencies occur when you add a package to your project that in turn relies on another package. For example, if Contoso publishes a package `Contoso.Utility` which, in turn, depends on `Contoso.Internals` and you add the `Contoso.Utility` package to your project now your project has a direct dependency on `Contoso.Utility` and, because `Contoso.Utility` depends 'Contoso.Internals', your application gains a transitive dependency on the `Contoso.Internals` package.\r\n\r\nTransitive dependencies are reviewable in two ways:\r\n\r\n* In the Visual Studio Solution Explorer window, which supports searching.\r\n* By examining the *project.assets.json* file contained in the obj directory of your project.\r\n\r\nThe *project.assets.json* files are the authoritative list of all packages used by your project, containing both direct and transitive dependencies.\r\n\r\n#### <a name=\"direct-dependencies\"></a>Fixing direct dependencies\r\n\r\nOpen *projectname.csproj* in your editor. If you're using Visual Studio, right-click the project and choose **Edit projectname.csproj** from the context menu, where projectname is the name of your project. Look for `PackageReference` elements. The following shows an example project file:\r\n\r\n```xml\r\n<Project Sdk=\"Microsoft.NET.Sdk\">\r\n  <PropertyGroup>\r\n    <TargetFramework>netcoreapp2.0</TargetFramework>\r\n  </PropertyGroup>\r\n  <ItemGroup>\r\n    <PackageReference Include=\"Microsoft.AspNetCore.Server.Kestrel.Core\" Version=\"2.0.1\" />\r\n  </ItemGroup>\r\n</Project>\r\n```\r\n\r\nThe preceding example has a reference to a [vulnerable package](#affected-software), as seen by the single `PackageReference` element. The name of the package is in the `Include` attribute.\r\nThe package version number is in the `Version` attribute. The previous example shows a single direct dependency on `Microsoft.AspNetCore.Server.Kestrel.Core` version 2.0.1.\r\n\r\nTo update the version to the secure package, change the version number to the updated package version as listed on the table [previously](#affected-software).\r\nIn this example, update `Microsoft.AspNetCore.Server.Kestrel.Core` to a [fixed package number](#affected-software). Save the *csproj* file. The example *csproj* now looks as follows:\r\n\r\n```xml\r\n<Project Sdk=\"Microsoft.NET.Sdk\">\r\n  <PropertyGroup>\r\n    <TargetFramework>netcoreapp2.0</TargetFramework>\r\n  </PropertyGroup>\r\n  <ItemGroup>\r\n    <PackageReference Include=\"Microsoft.AspNetCore.Server.Kestrel.Core\" Version=\"2.0.3 />\r\n  </ItemGroup>\r\n</Project>\r\n```\r\n\r\nIf you're using Visual Studio and you save your updated *csproj* file, Visual Studio will restore the new package version.\r\nYou can see the restore results by opening the **Output** window (Ctrl+Alt+O) and changing the **Show output from** drop-down list to **Package Manager**.\r\n\r\nIf you're not using Visual Studio, open a command line and change to your project directory. Execute the `dotnet restore` command to restore the updated dependencies.\r\n\r\nNow recompile your application. If after recompilation you see a *Dependency conflict warning*, you must update your other direct dependencies to versions that take a dependency on the updated package.\r\n\r\nAfter you've addressed all of your direct dependencies, you must review your transitive dependencies.\r\n\r\n#### Discovering and fixing transitive dependencies\r\n\r\nThere are two ways to view transitive dependencies. You can either [use Visual Studio’s Solution Explorer](#vs-solution-explorer), or you can [review the *project.assets.json* file](#project-assets-json).\r\n\r\n##### <a name=\"vs-solution-explorer\"></a>Using Visual Studio Solution Explorer\r\n\r\nTo use Solution Explorer, open the project in Visual Studio 2017, and then press Ctrl+; to activate the search in Solution Explorer. Search for each of the [vulnerable packages](#affected-software) and make a note of the version numbers of any results you find.\r\n\r\nFor example, searching for `Microsoft.AspNetCore.Mvc.Core` in an example project that contains a package that takes a dependency on `Microsoft.AspNetCore.Mvc` shows the following results in Visual Studio 2017:\r\n\r\n![Screenshot of search results in Visual Studio 2017](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/796298/25858816/8ecdc2b4-3491-11e7-9363-746804bb9832.png)\r\n\r\nThe search results appear as a tree. In the previous results, you can see that a reference to `Microsoft.AspNetCore.Mvc.Core` version 1.1.2 is discovered.\r\n\r\nUnder the Dependencies node is a NuGet node. Under the NuGet node is the list of packages you have directly taken a dependency on and their versions.\r\nIn screenshot, the application takes a direct dependency on `Microsoft.AspNetCore.Mvc`. `Microsoft.AspNetCore.Mvc` in turn has leaf nodes that list its dependencies and their versions.\r\nThe `Microsoft.AspNetCore.Mvc` package takes a dependency on a version of `Microsoft.AspNetCore.Mvc.ApiExplorer`, that in turn takes a dependency on a version of `Microsoft.AspNetCore.Mvc.Core`.\r\n\r\n##### <a name=\"project-assets-json\"></a>Manually reviewing project.assets.json\r\n\r\nOpen the *project.assets.json* file from your project’s obj directory in your editor. We suggest you use an editor that understands JSON and allows you to collapse and expand nodes to review this file.\r\nVisual Studio and Visual Studio Code provide JSON friendly editing.\r\n\r\nSearch the *project.assets.json* file for the [vulnerable package](#affected-software), using the format `packagename/` for each of the package names from the preceding table. If you find the assembly name in your search:\r\n\r\n* Examine the line on which they are found, the version number is after the `/`.\r\n* Compare to the [vulnerable versions table](#affected-software).\r\n\r\nFor example, a search result that shows `System.Security.Cryptography.Xml/4.4.0` is a reference to version 4.4.0 of `System.Security.Cryptography.Xml`.\r\nIf your *project.assets.json* file includes references to the [vulnerable package](#affected-software), then you need to fix the transitive dependencies.\r\n\r\n##### Fixing transitive dependencies\r\n\r\nIf you have not found any reference to any vulnerable packages, this means either\r\n\r\n* None of your direct dependencies depend on any vulnerable packages, or\r\n* You have already fixed the problem by updating the direct dependencies.\r\n\r\nIf your transitive dependency review found references to the [vulnerable package](#affected-software), you must add a direct dependency to the updated package to your *csproj* file to override the transitive dependency.\r\n\r\nOpen *projectname.csproj* in your editor. If you're using Visual Studio, right-click the project and choose **Edit projectname.csproj** from the context menu, where projectname is the name of your project.\r\nLook for `PackageReference` nodes, for example:\r\n\r\n```xml\r\n<Project Sdk=\"Microsoft.NET.Sdk.\">\r\n  <PropertyGroup>\r\n    <TargetFramework>net461</TargetFramework>\r\n  </PropertyGroup>\r\n  <ItemGroup>\r\n    <PackageReference Include=\"ThirdParty.NotUpdatedYet\" Version=\"2.0.0\" />\r\n  </ItemGroup>\r\n</Project>\r\n```\r\n\r\nYou must add a direct dependency to the updated version of the [vulnerable package](#affected-software) by adding it to the *csproj* file.\r\nYou do this by adding a new line to the dependencies section, referencing the fixed version.\r\nFor example, if your search showed a transitive reference to a vulnerable `Microsoft.AspNetCore.Server.Kestrel.Core` version, you'd add a reference to the [fixed package number](#affected-software).\r\n\r\n```xml\r\n<Project Sdk=\"Microsoft.NET.Sdk.Web\">\r\n  <PropertyGroup>\r\n    <TargetFramework>net461</TargetFramework>\r\n  </PropertyGroup>\r\n  <ItemGroup>\r\n    <PackageReference Include=\"Microsoft.AspNetCore.Server.Kestrel.Core\" Version=\"2.0.3\" />\r\n    <PackageReference Include=\"ThirdParty.NotUpdatedYet\" Version=\"2.0.0\" />\r\n  </ItemGroup>\r\n</Project>\r\n```\r\n\r\nAfter you've added the direct dependency reference, save your *csproj* file.\r\n\r\nIf you're using Visual Studio, save your updated *csproj* file and Visual Studio will restore the new package versions.\r\nYou can see the restore results by opening the **Output** window (Ctrl+Alt+O) and changing the **Show output from** drop-down list to **Package Manager**.\r\n\r\nIf you're not using Visual Studio, open a command line and change to your project directory. Execute the `dotnet restore` command to restore the new dependencies.\r\n\r\n#### Rebuilding your application\r\n\r\nFinally you must rebuild your application, test, and redeploy.\r\n\r\n## Other Information\r\n\r\n### Reporting Security Issues\r\n\r\nIf you have found a potential security issue in .NET Core, please email details to secure@microsoft.com.

We will continue to ship patches and security fixes for the existing aspnetcore images but any new images for 2.1 and higher will be pushed to microsoft/dotnet.\r\n\r\nDockerfiles using `microsoft/aspnetcore:<version>` should change to `microsoft/dotnet:<version>-aspnetcore-runtime`.\r\n\r\nDockerfiles using `microsoft/aspnetcore-build` that do not require Node should just change to `microsoft/dotnet:<version>-sdk`.\r\n\r\nDockerfiles using Node from the `microsoft/aspnetcore-build` image will either need to install Node into their own image or use mult-stage builds as described in the Dockerfile examples at the end of this announcement.\r\n\r\nThe `ASPNETCORE_URLS` env var that allows ASP.NET Core apps to accept traffic from outside the container will be set in all the `dotnet` images, which was a common early stumbling block for people getting started with ASP.NET Core and Docker. PR is [here](https://github.com/dotnet/dotnet-docker/pull/450)\r\n\r\n### Why the merge?\r\n\r\nFor some time we have been seeing people search for and find the `microsoft/dotnet` images and never realise that there are aspnetcore ones. This could be problematic in the past as the dotnet images were not optimised for ASP.NET Core, making things a little harder or slower. But with changes in the way ASP.NET Core works in 2.1 it was going to be much more impactful, in that ASP.NET Core applications were not likely to run on the base dotnet image. Given that we also thought it made more sense to have a single repository for all images, as ASP.NET is just part of .NET, we are taking this opportunity to remove the potential source of confusion and wasted time for our customers.\r\n\r\n### Why no Node?\r\nThere are two main reasons for this:\r\n\r\n  1. Multi-stage build now makes it easier to pull in the Node image for purely build concerns.\r\n  2. The ASP.NET Core templates no longer have a hard dependency on Node.\r\n\r\n\r\nFor discussion and feedback on this decision you can go here: [https://github.com/aspnet/aspnet-docker/issues/403](https://github.com/aspnet/aspnet-docker/issues/403)\r\n\r\n### Dockerfile examples\r\n\r\nIf you need Node then you will need to add it in your own Dockerfile, like this:\r\n\r\n```Dockerfile\r\nFROM microsoft/dotnet:2.1-sdk as build-env\r\nWORKDIR /app\r\n#setup node\r\nENV NODE_VERSION 8.9.4\r\nENV NODE_DOWNLOAD_SHA 21fb4690e349f82d708ae766def01d7fec1b085ce1f5ab30d9bda8ee126ca8fc\r\n\r\nRUN curl -SL \"https://nodejs.org/dist/v${NODE_VERSION}/node-v${NODE_VERSION}-linux-x64.tar.gz\" --output nodejs.tar.gz \\\r\n    && echo \"$NODE_DOWNLOAD_SHA nodejs.tar.gz\" | sha256sum -c - \\\r\n    && tar -xzf \"nodejs.tar.gz\" -C /usr/local --strip-components=1 \\\r\n    && rm nodejs.tar.gz \\\r\n    && ln -s /usr/local/bin/node /usr/local/bin/nodejs\r\n\r\n# copy csproj and restore as distinct layers\r\nCOPY *.csproj ./\r\nRUN dotnet restore\r\n\r\n# copy everything else and build\r\nCOPY . ./\r\nRUN dotnet publish -c Release -o out\r\n\r\n# build runtime image\r\nFROM microsoft/dotnet:2.1-aspnetcore-runtime\r\nWORKDIR /app\r\n#setup node, this is only needed if you use Node both at runtime and build time.

This advisory also provides guidance on what developers can do to update their applications to remove this vulnerability.\r\n\r\nMicrosoft is aware of a security vulnerability in all public versions of ASP.NET Core where an elevation of privilege vulnerability exists when a ASP.NET Core web application fails to validate web requests correctly.\r\n\r\n## Discussion\r\n\r\nDiscussion for this issue can be found at https://github.com/aspnet/Home/issues/2954\r\n\r\n### Mitigation factors\r\n\r\nSites are not vulnerable to this elevation of privilege when:\r\n\r\n* The site is hosted behind a proxy, such as Internet Information Services (IIS), NGINX, or Apache, where:\r\n\r\n  * The proxy validates the host header, and\r\n  * The proxy is configured to listen on fully qualified domain names or\r\n  * The proxy is configured with a wildcard subdomain where the root domain is fully controlled by the site owner.\r\n\r\nFor example, if IIS is configured to respond to requests for `contoso.com` or `*.contoso.com` hosts, the application is protected.\r\n\r\nIf IIS is configured to respond to any request from any host, the application is vulnerable.\r\n\r\nKestrel does not have the capability to validate host headers and is vulnerable if not placed behind a proxy that performs the host header validation.\r\n\r\nApps hosted in Azure Web Apps are not susceptible to this vulnerability.\r\n\r\n## <a name=\"affected-software\"></a>Affected software\r\n\r\nAny ASP.NET Core hosted application which is directly exposed to the internet, or hosted behind a proxy which does not validate or restict host headers to known good values.\r\n\r\nThe vulnerability also affects any ASP.NET Core 2.0 project if it uses the following package versions, which must also be [updated](#app-update), in addition to addressing your proxy configuration :\r\n\r\nPackage name | Vulnerable versions | Secure versions\r\n------------ | ---------------- | -------------------------\r\nMicrosoft.AspNetCore.HttpOverrides | 2.0.0, 2.0.1 |  2.0.2 and later\r\nMicrosoft.AspNetCore.Server.Kestrel.Core | 2.0.0, 2.0.1 |  2.0.2 and later\r\n\r\n*No patches are available for ASP.NET Core 1.0.x or ASP.NET Core 1.1.x. Microsoft requires that you place your 1.x ASP.NET Core application behind a proxy.\r\nYou must address the configuration of your proxy to protect your application. If you're not running ASP.NET Core 1.x behind a proxy, you must either place a proxy in front of your application or upgrade to ASP.NET Core 2.0.\r\nand add the host validating middleware provided at https://github.com/aspnet/BasicMiddleware/blob/release/2.0/samples/HostFilteringSample/.*\r\n\r\n## Advisory FAQ\r\n### How do I know if I am affected?\r\n\r\nReview the server and proxy configuration [instructions](#configuration) below to see if your system is configured correctly, and adjust the configuration if necessary.\r\n\r\n### How do I fix the issue?\r\n\r\nYou must address the [configuration](#configuration) of your server or proxy to protect your application to limit requests to known hosts.\r\n\r\nIf you're not running Kestrel 1.x behind a proxy, you must either place a proxy in front of your application or upgrade to ASP.NET Core 2.0 and follow the 2.0 instructions below.\r\n\r\nASP.NET Core 2.0.x applications must [update your code](#app-update) to fully protect your application.\r\n\r\n#### <a name=\"configuration\"></a> Server and Proxy configuration\r\n\r\nYou must examine your externally facing server or proxy configuration and ensure it requires host headers with fully qualified domain names, or known sub-domains if you are using sub-domain wild cards.\r\n\r\n##### ASP.NET Core applications behind [IIS](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/aspnet/core/host-and-deploy/iis/)\r\n\r\nTo configure IIS to only respond to know hosts:\r\n\r\n* Open IIS Manager.\r\n* Expand the **Sites** node for the machine you want to configure.\r\n* Select the site by clicking on the site.\r\n* In the **Actions** list on the right-hand side of IIS Manager, click **Bindings**.\r\n* Edit any bindings that do not have a host name to specify one. Do not use a `*` wildcard unless it's against a domain under your control. For example, `*.contoso.com` is safe, `*.com` is not.\r\n\r\n##### ASP.NET Core applications running publicly on [Kestrel](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/aspnet/core/fundamentals/servers/kestrel)\r\n\r\nKestrel does not have the capability to validate host headers. It must either be placed behind a proxy that performs the host header validation or the validation must be performed within the application by adding  host filtering middleware provided at https://github.com/aspnet/BasicMiddleware/blob/release/2.0/samples/HostFilteringSample/. You must also [update your dependencies](#app-update) to fully protect your application.\r\n\r\n##### ASP.NET Core applications running on [HTTP.SYS](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/aspnet/core/fundamentals/servers/httpsys)\r\n\r\nTo configure URL prefixes and ports, you can use the `UseUrls` extension method, the `urls` command-line argument, the ASPNETCORE_URLS environment variable, or the `UrlPrefixes` property on [HttpSysOptions](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/api/microsoft.aspnetcore.server.httpsys.httpsysoptions). The following code example uses `UrlPrefixes`.\r\n\r\n```c#\r\npublic static IWebHost BuildWebHost(string[] args) =>\r\n    WebHost.CreateDefaultBuilder(args)\r\n        .UseStartup<Startup>()\r\n        .UseHttpSys(options =>\r\n        {\r\n            // The following options are set to default values.\r\n            options.Authentication.Schemes = AuthenticationSchemes.None;\r\n            options.Authentication.AllowAnonymous = true;\r\n            options.MaxConnections = null;\r\n            options.MaxRequestBodySize = 30000000;\r\n            options.UrlPrefixes.Add(\"http://localhost:5000\");\r\n        })\r\n        .Build();\r\n```\r\n\r\n##### ASP.NET Core applications behind [NGINX](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/aspnet/core/host-and-deploy/linux-nginx)\r\n\r\nTo configure NGINX as a reverse proxy to forward requests to your ASP.NET Core app, replace the contents */etc/nginx/sites-available/default* with the following:\r\n\r\n```NGINX\r\nserver {\r\n    listen        80;\r\n    server_name   example.com *.example.com;\r\n    location / {\r\n        proxy_pass         http://localhost:5000;\r\n        proxy_http_version 1.1;\r\n        proxy_set_header   Upgrade $http_upgrade;\r\n        proxy_set_header   Connection keep-alive;\r\n        proxy_set_header   Host $host;\r\n        proxy_cache_bypass $http_upgrade;\r\n    }\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nNote that with NGINX, when there is no match for `server_name`, NGINX will pick the default server. If no default server has been defined, the first server in the conf file is the default server. Best practice is to add a specific default server which returns a status code of 444 in the conf file. An example default server configuration would be as follows:\r\n\r\n```NGINX\r\nserver {\r\n    listen   80 default_server;\r\n    # listen [::]:80 default_server deferred;\r\n    return   444;\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nWith the preceding configuration file and default server, NGINX accepts public traffic on port 80 with host header `example.com` or `*.example.com`. Requests not matching these hosts won't get forwarded to Kestrel. NGINX forwards the matching requests to Kestrel at `http://localhost:5000`. See [How nginx processes a request](https://nginx.org/docs/http/request_processing.html) for more information.\r\n\r\nOnce the NGINX configuration is established, run `sudo nginx -t` to verify the syntax of the configuration files. If the configuration file test is successful, force NGINX to pick up the changes by running `sudo nginx -s reload`.\r\n\r\n##### ASP.NET Core applications behind [Apache](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/aspnet/core/host-and-deploy/linux-apache)\r\n\r\nConfiguration files for Apache are located within the `/etc/httpd/conf.d/` directory. Any file with the `*.conf*` extension:\r\n\r\n* Is processed in alphabetical order, and\r\n* The module configuration files in `/etc/httpd/conf.modules.d/` are processed. The module configuration files in `/etc/httpd/conf.modules.d/` contain any configuration files necessary to load modules.\r\n\r\n\r\n```\r\n<VirtualHost *:80>\r\n    ProxyPreserveHost On\r\n    ProxyPass / http://127.0.0.1:5000/\r\n    ProxyPassReverse / http://127.0.0.1:5000/\r\n    ServerName www.example.com\r\n    ServerAlias *.example.com\r\n</VirtualHost>\r\n```\r\n\r\nThe `VirtualHost` block can appear multiple times, in one or more files on a server. In the preceding configuration file, Apache accepts public traffic on port 80. The domain `www.example.com` is being served, and the `*.example.com` alias resolves to the same website. See [Name-based virtual host support](https://httpd.apache.org/docs/current/vhosts/name-based.html) for more information. Requests are proxied at the root to port 5000 of the server at 127.0.0.1. For bi-directional communication, `ProxyPass` and `ProxyPassReverse` are required.\r\n\r\nSave the file and test the configuration. If everything passes, the response is `Syntax [OK]`.\r\n\r\n```bash\r\nsudo service httpd configtest\r\n```\r\n\r\nRestart Apache:\r\n\r\n```bash\r\nsudo systemctl restart httpd\r\nsudo systemctl enable httpd\r\n```\r\n\r\n\r\n#### <a name=\"app-update\"></a> ASP.NET Core 2.0 application code updates\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\nIf you're targeting .NET Core 2.x and the `Microsoft.AspNetCore.All` \"metapackage\":\r\n\r\n* Update its version number to 2.0.6 or later.\r\n* Updating will pull in the fixed packages listed above.\r\n\r\nIf you're targeting .NET Framework, update the packages listed above to their safe version or later.\r\n\r\nIf your application is using Kestrel without a proxy or the HttpOverrides functionality (UseForwardedHeaders with ForwardedHost) you must also add the host filtering middleware provided at https://github.com/aspnet/BasicMiddleware/tree/release/2.0/samples/HostFilteringSample/.\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n.NET Core and ASP.NET Core have two types of dependencies: direct and transitive. You must follow the update instructions below to address both types of dependency.\r\n\r\n### Direct dependencies\r\n\r\nDirect dependencies are dependencies where you specifically add a package to your project. For example, if you add the `Microsoft.AspNetCore.Mvc` package to your project then you have taken a direct dependency on `Microsoft.AspNetCore.Mvc`.\r\n\r\nDirect dependencies are discoverable by examining your *csproj* file.\r\n\r\n### Transitive dependencies\r\n\r\nTransitive dependencies occur when you add a package to your project that in turn relies on another package. For example, if you add the `Microsoft.AspNetCore.Mvc` package to your project it depends on the `Microsoft.AspNetCore.Mvc.Core` package (among others). Your project has a direct dependency on `Microsoft.AspNetCore.Mvc` and a transitive dependency on the `Microsoft.AspNetCore.Mvc.Core` package.\r\nTransitive dependencies are reviewable:\r\n\r\n* In the Visual Studio Solution Explorer window, which supports searching.\r\n* By examining the *project.assets.json* file contained in the obj directory of your project.\r\n\r\nThe *project.assets.json* files are the authoritative list of all packages used by your project, containing both direct and transitive dependencies.\r\n\r\n\r\n##### Fixing direct dependencies – Projects targeting .NET Core\r\n\r\nOpen *projectname.csproj* in your editor. If you're using Visual Studio, right-click the project and choose **Edit projectname.csproj** from the content menu, where projectname is the name of your project. Look for `PackageReference` elements. The following shows an example project file:\r\n\r\n```xml\r\n<Project Sdk=\"Microsoft.NET.Sdk.Web\">\r\n  <PropertyGroup>\r\n    <TargetFramework>netcoreapp2.0</TargetFramework>\r\n  </PropertyGroup>\r\n  <ItemGroup>\r\n    <PackageReference Include=\"Microsoft.AspNetCore.All\" Version=\"2.0.5\" />\r\n  </ItemGroup>\r\n  <ItemGroup>\r\n    <DotNetCliToolReference Include=\"Microsoft.VisualStudio.Web.CodeGeneration.Tools\" Version=\"2.0.0\" />\r\n  </ItemGroup>\r\n</Project>\r\n```\r\n\r\nThe preceding example has a reference to the vulnerable metapackage, as seen by the single `PackageReference` element. The name of the package is in the `Include` attribute. The package version number is in the `Version` attribute. The example shows a single direct dependency on `Microsoft.AspNetCore.All` version 2.0.5.\r\n\r\nTo update the version to the secure package, change the version number to a secure package version. In this example, update `Microsoft.AspNetCore.All` to 2.0.6 or later. Save the *csproj* file. The example *csproj* now looks as follows:\r\n\r\n```xml\r\n<Project Sdk=\"Microsoft.NET.Sdk.Web\">\r\n  <PropertyGroup>\r\n    <TargetFramework>netcoreapp2.0</TargetFramework>\r\n  </PropertyGroup>\r\n  <ItemGroup>\r\n    <PackageReference Include=\"Microsoft.AspNetCore.All\" Version=\"2.0.6\" />\r\n  </ItemGroup>\r\n  <ItemGroup>\r\n    <DotNetCliToolReference Include=\"Microsoft.VisualStudio.Web.CodeGeneration.Tools\" Version=\"2.0.0\" />\r\n  </ItemGroup>\r\n</Project>\r\n```\r\n\r\nIf you're using Visual Studio and save your updated *csproj* file, Visual Studio will restore the new package version. You can see the restore results by opening the **Output** window (Ctrl+Alt+O) and changing the **Show output from** drop-down list to **Package Manager**.\r\n\r\nIf you're not using Visual Studio, open a command line and change to your project directory. Execute the `dotnet restore` command to restore the updated dependencies.\r\n\r\n##### Fixing direct dependencies – Projects targeting .NET Framework\r\n\r\nOpen *projectname.csproj* in your editor. If you're using Visual Studio, right-click the project and choose **Edit projectname.csproj** from the content menu, where projectname is the name of your project. Look for `PackageReference` nodes. The following shows an example project file:\r\n\r\n```xml\r\n<Project Sdk=\"Microsoft.NET.Sdk.Web\">\r\n  <PropertyGroup>\r\n    <TargetFramework>net461</TargetFramework>\r\n  </PropertyGroup>\r\n  <ItemGroup>\r\n    <PackageReference Include=\"Microsoft.AspNetCore.HttpOverrides\" Version=\"2.0.1\" />\r\n  </ItemGroup>\r\n  <ItemGroup>\r\n    <DotNetCliToolReference Include=\"Microsoft.VisualStudio.Web.CodeGeneration.Tools\" Version=\"2.0.0\" />\r\n  </ItemGroup>\r\n</Project>\r\n```\r\n\r\nThe example has a reference to a single package, as seen by the `PackageReference` element. The name of the package is in the `Include` attribute. The package version number is in the `Version` attribute. The example shows a direct dependency on one of the vulnerable packages from the table above, `Microsoft.AspNetCore.HttpOverrides` version 2.0.1.\r\n\r\nTo update to the secure package, change the version number to the updated package version. In the example, this would be updating `Microsoft.AspNetCore.HttpOverrides` to 2.0.2 and later. Save the *csproj* file. The updated and secure *csproj* look as follows:\r\n\r\n``` XML\r\n<Project Sdk=\"Microsoft.NET.Sdk.Web\">\r\n  <PropertyGroup>\r\n    <TargetFramework>net461</TargetFramework>\r\n  </PropertyGroup>\r\n  <ItemGroup>\r\n    <PackageReference Include=\"Microsoft.AspNetCore.HttpOverrides\" Version=\"2.0.2\" />\r\n  </ItemGroup>\r\n  <ItemGroup>\r\n    <DotNetCliToolReference Include=\"Microsoft.VisualStudio.Web.CodeGeneration.Tools\" Version=\"2.0.0\" />\r\n  </ItemGroup>\r\n</Project>\r\n```\r\n\r\nIf you're using Visual Studio and save your updated *csproj* file, Visual Studio will restore the new package version. You can see the restore results by opening the **Output** window (Ctrl+Alt+O) and changing the **Show output from** drop-down list to **Package Manager**.\r\n\r\nIf you're not using Visual Studio, open a command line and change to your project directory. Execute the `dotnet restore` command to restore the new dependency version.\r\n\r\n##### After updating your direct dependencies\r\n\r\nRecompile your application.\r\n\r\nIf after recompilation you see a *Dependency conflict warning*, you must update your other direct dependencies to a compatible version. \r\n\r\nFor example if your project refers directly to `Microsoft.AspNetCore.Mvc.Cors` with a version number of `2.0.0`, when you update your `Microsoft.AspNetCore.Mvc` package to 2.0.1, compilation will throw:\r\n\r\n`NU1012      Dependency conflict. Microsoft.AspNetCore.Mvc 2.0.1 expected Microsoft.AspNetCore.Mvc.Cors >= 2.0.1 but received 2.0.0`\r\n\r\nTo fix this, edit the version for the expected package to be the version expected by updating your *project.json* in the same way that you used to update the vulnerable package versions.\r\n\r\nAfter you've addressed all of your direct dependencies, you must review your transitive dependencies.\r\n\r\n###### Reviewing transitive dependencies\r\n\r\nThere are two ways to view transitive dependencies. You can either use Visual Studio’s Solution Explorer, or you can review the *project.assets.json* file.\r\n\r\n###### Using Visual Studio Solution Explorer\r\n\r\nTo use Solution Explorer, open the project in Visual Studio 2017, and then press Ctrl+; to activate the search in Solution Explorer. Search for each of the vulnerable package names above and make a note of the version numbers of any results you find.\r\n\r\nFor example, searching for `Microsoft.AspNetCore.Mvc.Core` in an example project that contains a package that takes a dependency on `Microsoft.AspNetCore.Mvc` shows the following results in Visual Studio 2017:\r\n\r\n![vs2017](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/796298/25858816/8ecdc2b4-3491-11e7-9363-746804bb9832.png)\r\n\r\nThe search results appear as a tree. In these results, you can see a reference to `Microsoft.AspNetCore.Mvc.Core` version 1.1.2 is discovered.\r\n\r\nUnder the Dependencies node is a NuGet node. Under the NuGet node is the list of packages you have directly taken a dependency on and their versions. In this example, the application takes a direct dependency on `Microsoft.AspNetCore.Mvc`. `Microsoft.AspNetCore.Mvc` in turn has leaf nodes that list its dependencies and their versions. In the example, the `Microsoft.AspNetCore.Mvc` package takes a dependency on a version of `Microsoft.AspNetCore.Mvc.ApiExplorer`, that in turn takes a dependency on a vulnerable version of `Microsoft.AspNetCore.Mvc.Core`.\r\n\r\n###### Manually reviewing project.assets.json (VS2017)\r\n\r\nOpen the *project.assets.json* file from your project’s obj directory in your editor. We suggest you use an editor that understands JSON and allows you to collapse and expand nodes to review this file. Visual Studio and Visual Studio Code provide JSON friendly editing.\r\n\r\nSearch the *project.assets.json* file for each of the vulnerable packages, using the format `packagename/` for each of the package names from the preceding table. If you find the assembly name in your search:\r\n\r\n* Examine the line on which they are found, the version number is after the `/`.\r\n* Compare to the vulnerable versions table above.\r\n\r\nFor example, a search result that shows `Microsoft.AspNetCore.Mvc.Cors/1.1.0` is a reference to v1.1.0 of `Microsoft.AspNetCore.Mvc.Cors`.   If your *project.assets.json* file includes references to any of the vulnerable packages shown above, then you need to fix the transitive dependencies.\r\n\r\n###### Overriding transitive dependencies\r\n\r\nIf you have not found any reference to any vulnerable packages this means:\r\n\r\n* None of your direct dependencies depend on any vulnerable packages, or\r\n* You have already fixed the problem by updating the direct dependencies.\r\n\r\nIf your transitive dependency review found references to any of the vulnerable packages you must add a direct dependency to the updated package to your *csproj* file to override the transitive dependency.\r\n\r\nOpen *projectname.csproj* in your editor. If you're using Visual Studio, right-click the project and choose **Edit projectname.csproj** from the content menu, where projectname is the name of your project. Look for `PackageReference` nodes, for example:\r\n\r\n```xml\r\n<Project Sdk=\"Microsoft.NET.Sdk.Web\">\r\n  <PropertyGroup>\r\n    <TargetFramework>net461</TargetFramework>\r\n  </PropertyGroup>\r\n  <ItemGroup>\r\n    <PackageReference Include=\"ThirdParty.NotUpdatedYet\" Version=\"2.0.0\" />\r\n  </ItemGroup>\r\n  <ItemGroup>\r\n    <DotNetCliToolReference Include=\"Microsoft.VisualStudio.Web.CodeGeneration.Tools\" Version=\"2.0.0\" />\r\n  </ItemGroup>\r\n</Project>\r\n```\r\n\r\nFor each of the vulnerable packages your search returned, you must add a direct dependency to the updated version by adding it to the *csproj* file.\r\nYou do this by adding a new line to the dependencies section, referring the fixed version.\r\nFor example, if your search showed a transitive reference to the vulnerable `Microsoft.AspNetCore.HttpOverrides` version 2.0.0 you would add a reference to the fixed version, that is, 2.0.2 or later.\r\n\r\n```xml\r\n<Project Sdk=\"Microsoft.NET.Sdk.Web\">\r\n  <PropertyGroup>\r\n    <TargetFramework>net461</TargetFramework>\r\n  </PropertyGroup>\r\n  <ItemGroup>\r\n    <PackageReference Include=\"Microsoft.AspNetCore.HttpOverride\" Version=\"2.0.2\" />\r\n    <PackageReference Include=\"ThirdParty.NotUpdatedYet\" Version=\"2.0.0\" />\r\n  </ItemGroup>\r\n  <ItemGroup>\r\n    <DotNetCliToolReference Include=\"Microsoft.VisualStudio.Web.CodeGeneration.Tools\" Version=\"2.0.0\" />\r\n  </ItemGroup>\r\n</Project>\r\n```\r\n\r\nAfter you have added the direct dependency reference, save your *csproj* file.\r\n\r\nIf you're using Visual Studio, save your updated *csproj* file and Visual Studio will restore the new package versions.\r\nYou can see the restore results by opening the **Output** window (Ctrl+Alt+O) and changing the **Show output from** drop-down list to **Package Manager**.\r\n\r\nIf you're not using Visual Studio, open a command line and change to your project directory. Execute the `dotnet restore` command to restore the new dependencies.\r\n\r\n###### Rebuilding your application\r\n\r\nRebuild your application.

These images will continue to receive patch update whenever a 1.0.x, 1.1.x, or 2.0.x update ships, however, we will not produce a new version which contains the 2.1 runtime.\r\n\r\n### Why?\r\n \r\nThese images existed to support CI/CD pipelines that run apps on multiple versions for .NET Core in the same container. With each release, these images have grown in size. The 1.0-2.0 image is already about 1GB, and would continue to grow with runtime updates. \r\n \r\nFortunately, recent improvements to .NET Core (such as minor version roll-forward) and Docker (multi-stage builds) have reduced the need to use an image with multiple versions of .NET Core. We have seen usage of these multi-version images declining over time, and today, they are a small percentage of our Docker image usage.\r\n\r\nRather than maintaining a single, large image with all possible .NET Core runtimes, we encourage users to use multi-stage builds. Docker's multi-stage feature allows you to compose a single Dockerfile, but still use multiple .NET Core runtimes. Also, starting in 2.1, .NET Core supports rolling forward the runtime version within the major version, which will further reduce the need to have multiple 2.x runtimes side-by-side.\r\n \r\nFor discussion, use https://github.com/aspnet/aspnet-docker/issues/349","Url":"https://github.com/aspnet/Announcements/issues/292","RelatedDescription":"Open issue \"Deprecating the `microsoft/aspnetcore-build:1.0-2.0` Docker image\" (#292)"},{"Id":"301939059","IsPullRequest":false,"CreatedAt":"2018-03-02T23:33:38","Actor":"blowdart","Number":"291","RawContent":null,"Title":"Statement on ASP.NET susceptibility to the recent DuoLabs SAML vulnerability announcement.","State":"open","Body":"This week saw an announcement of vulnerabilities in  SAML parsing libraries by [DUO Labs](https://duo.com/blog/duo-finds-saml-vulnerabilities-affecting-multiple-implementations).

This advisory also provides guidance on what developers can do to update their applications correctly.\r\n\r\nMicrosoft is aware of a security vulnerability in some public versions of ASP.NET Core where Cross-Origin Resource Sharing (CORS) can be bypassed, leading to information disclosure.\r\n\r\n## Discussion\r\n\r\nPlease use https://github.com/aspnet/Mvc/issues/7054 for discussion of this advisory.\r\n\r\n### Mitigation Factors\r\nASP.NET Core applications using version 2.0.0 or higher are not vulnerable.\r\n\r\n## Affected Software\r\nThe vulnerabilities affect any Microsoft ASP.NET Core project if it uses the following affected package versions.\r\n\r\nPackage name | Package versions | Fixed package versions\r\n---------------- | ------------------- | -------------------------\r\nMicrosoft.AspNetCore.Mvc.Core | 1.0.0, 1.0.1, 1.0.2, 1.0.3, 1.0.4, 1.0.5<br />1.1.0, 1.1.1, 1.1.2 ,1.1.3, 1.1.4 |  1.0.6<br />1.1.6\r\nMicrosoft.AspNetCore.Mvc.Cors | 1.0.0, 1.0.1, 1.0.2, 1.0.3, 1.0.4, 1.0.5<br />1.1.0, 1.1.1, 1.1.2 ,1.1.3, 1.1.4 |  1.0.6<br />1.1.6\r\n\r\n## Advisory FAQ\r\n### How do I know if I am affected? \r\n\r\n.NET Core and ASP.NET Core have two types of dependencies: direct and transitive. If your project has a direct or transitive dependency on any of the packages and versions listed above, you are affected.\r\nNote: As part of patching ASP.NET Core MVC we update every Microsoft.AspNetCore.Mvc.* package. If, for example, you have a dependency on `Microsoft.AspNetCore.Mvc` you should update to the appropriate version first (1.0.x should be updated to 1.0.6, 1.1.x should be updated to 1.1.6), and it will also update any other vulnerable ` Microsoft.AspNetCore.Mvc` dependency.\r\n\r\n### NET Core Project formats\r\n.NET Core has two different project file formats, depending on what software created the project. \r\n\r\n1. `project.json` is the format used in .NET Core 1.0 and Microsoft Visual Studio 2015.\r\n2. `csproj` is the format used in .NET Core 1.1 and Microsoft Visual Studio 2017.  \r\n\t\r\nYou must ensure you follow the correct update instructions for your project type.\r\n\r\n### Direct Dependencies\r\nDirect dependencies are dependencies where you specifically add a package to your project. For example, if you add the `Microsoft.AspNetCore.Mvc` package to your project then you have taken a direct dependency on` Microsoft.AspNetCore.Mvc`.\r\n\r\nDirect dependencies are discoverable by reviewing your `project.json` or `csproj` file.\r\n\r\n### Transitive Dependencies\r\nTransitive dependencies occur when you add a package to your project that in turn relies on another package. For example, if you add the `Microsoft.AspNetCore.Mvc` package to your project it depends on the `Microsoft.AspNetCore.Mvc.Core` package (among others). Your project has a direct dependency on `Microsoft.AspNetCore.Mvc` and a transitive dependency on the `Microsoft.AspNetCore.Mvc.Core` package.\r\nTransitive dependencies are reviewable in the Visual Studio Solution Explorer window, which supports searching, or by reviewing the `project.lock.json` file contained in the root directory of your project for `project.json` projects or the `project.assets.json` file contained in the obj directory of your project for `csproj` projects. These files are the authoritative list of all packages used by your project, containing both direct and transitive dependencies.\r\n\r\n## How do I fix my affected application?\r\nYou will need to fix both direct dependencies and review and fix any transitive dependencies. The affected packages and versions in the previous “Affected Software” section include each vulnerable package, the vulnerable versions, and the patched versions\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n**Note**: If you are using ASP.NET Core MVC in your projects you should first update the `Microsoft.AspNetCore.Mvc` version to the fixed version in the table above. If you are currently using version 1.0.0, 1.0.1, 1.0.2, 1.0.3, 1.0.4 or 1.0.5  you should update your package version to 1.0.6. If you are using version 1.1.0, 1.1.1, 1.1.2, 1.1.3 or 1.1.4 you should update your package version to 1.1.6. This will update every MVC package to the fixed versions.\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n### Fixing Direct Dependencies – project.json/VS2015\r\nOpen your `project.json` file in your editor. Look for the dependencies section. Below is an example dependencies section:\r\n\r\n``` json\r\n    \"dependencies\": {\r\n      \"Microsoft.NETCore.App\": {\r\n        \"version\": \"1.0.1\",\r\n        \"type\": \"platform\"\r\n      },\r\n     \"Microsoft.AspNetCore.Server.Kestrel\": \"1.0.1\",\r\n     \"Microsoft.AspNetCore.Mvc.Core \": \"1.0.1\",\r\n    }\r\n```\r\nThis example has three direct dependencies: `Microsoft.NETCore.App`, `Microsoft.AspNetCore.Server.Kestrel` and `Microsoft.AspNetCore.Mvc.Core`. \r\n\r\n`Microsoft.NetCore.App` is the platform the application targets, you should ignore this. The other packages expose their version to the right of the package name. In our example, our non-platform packages are version 1.0.1.\r\n\r\nReview your direct dependencies for any instance of the packages and versions listed above. In the example above, there is a direct dependency on the vulnerable package, `Microsoft.AspNetCore.Mvc.Core` version 1.0.1.\r\n\r\nTo update to the fixed package, change the version number to be the appropriate package for your release. In the example, this would be updating `Microsoft.AspNetCore.Mvc.Core` to 1.0.6.\r\n\r\nAfter updating the vulnerable package versions, save your `project.json` file.\r\n\r\nThe dependencies section in our example `project.json` would now look as follows:\r\n\r\n```json\r\n  \"dependencies\": {\r\n    \"Microsoft.NETCore.App\": {\r\n      \"version\": \"1.0.1\",\r\n      \"type\": \"platform\"\r\n    },\r\n    \"Microsoft.AspNetCore.Server.Kestrel\": \"1.0.1\",\r\n    \"Microsoft.AspNetCore.Mvc.Core\": \"1.0.6\",     \r\n  }\r\n```\r\n\r\nIf you are using Visual Studio and save your updated `project.json` file, Visual Studio will restore the new package version. You can see the restore results by opening the Output Window (Ctrl+Alt+O) and changing the Show output from drop-down list to Package Manager.\r\n\r\nIf you are not using Visual Studio, open a command line and change to your project directory. Execute the `dotnet restore` command to restore your new dependency.\r\n\r\nAfter you have addressed all of your direct dependencies, you must also review your transitive dependencies.\r\n\r\n### Fixing Direct Dependencies – csproj/VS2017\r\nOpen your `projectname.csproj` file in your editor, or right click the project in Visual Studio 2017 and choose `Edit projectname.csproj` from the content menu, where projectname is the name of your project. Look for `PackageReference` nodes. The following shows an example project file:\r\n\r\n``` XML\r\n<Project Sdk=\"Microsoft.NET.Sdk.Web\">\r\n  <PropertyGroup>\r\n    <TargetFramework>netcoreapp1.1</TargetFramework>\r\n  </PropertyGroup>\r\n  <PropertyGroup>\r\n    <PackageTargetFallback>$(PackageTargetFallback);portable-net45+win8+wp8+wpa81;</PackageTargetFallback>\r\n  </PropertyGroup>\r\n  <ItemGroup>\r\n    <PackageReference Include=\"Microsoft.AspNetCore.Mvc.Core\" Version=\"1.1.3\" />\r\n  </ItemGroup>\r\n  <ItemGroup>\r\n    <DotNetCliToolReference Include=\"Microsoft.VisualStudio.Web.CodeGeneration.Tools\" Version=\"1.0.0 \" />\r\n  </ItemGroup>\r\n</Project>\r\n```\r\n\r\nThe example has a single direct dependency, as seen by the `PackageReference` element. The name of the package is in the Include attribute, and the package version number is in the Version attribute that is exposed to the right of the package name. The example shows a single package `Microsoft.AspNetCore.Mvc.Core` version 1.1.6.\r\n\r\nReview your `PackageReference` elements for any instance of the packages and versions listed above. In the example above, there is a direct dependency on the vulnerable package, `Microsoft.AspNetCore.Mvc.Core` version 1.1.3.\r\n\r\nTo update to the fixed package, change the version number to the appropriate package for your release. In the example, this would be updating `Microsoft.AspNetCore.Mvc.Cors` to 1.1.6.\r\n\r\nAfter updating the vulnerable package version, save your `csproj` file. The example `csproj` would now look as follows:\r\n\r\n``` XML\r\n<Project Sdk=\"Microsoft.NET.Sdk.Web\">\r\n  <PropertyGroup>\r\n    <TargetFramework>netcoreapp1.1</TargetFramework>\r\n  </PropertyGroup>\r\n  <PropertyGroup>\r\n    <PackageTargetFallback>$(PackageTargetFallback);portable-net45+win8+wp8+wpa81;</PackageTargetFallback>\r\n  </PropertyGroup>\r\n  <ItemGroup>\r\n    <PackageReference Include=\"Microsoft.AspNetCore.Mvc.Core\" Version=\"1.1.6\" />\r\n  </ItemGroup>\r\n  <ItemGroup>\r\n    <DotNetCliToolReference Include=\"Microsoft.VisualStudio.Web.CodeGeneration.Tools\" Version=\"1.0.0 \" />\r\n  </ItemGroup>\r\n</Project>\r\n```\r\n\r\nIf you are using Visual Studio and save your updated `csproj` file, Visual Studio will restore the new package version. You can see the restore results by opening the Output Window (Ctrl+Alt+O) and changing the Show output from drop-down list to Package Manager.\r\n\r\nIf you are not using Visual Studio open a command line and change to your project directory. Execute the `dotnet restore` command to restore your new dependency.\r\n\r\n### After updating your direct dependencies\r\n\r\nRecompile your application.\r\n\r\nIf after recompilation you see a Dependency conflict warning, you must update your other direct dependencies to the appropriate version. \r\n\r\nFor example if your project refers to `Microsoft.AspNetCore.Mvc.Cors` with a version number of 1.0.1 when you update your `Microsoft.AspNetCore.Mvc` package to 1.0.6, compilation will throw:\r\n\r\n`NU1012      Dependency conflict. Microsoft.AspNetCore.Mvc.Core 1.0.6 expected Microsoft.AspNetCore.Mvc.Cors >= 1.0.6 but received 1.0.1`\r\n\r\nTo fix this, edit the version for the expected package to be the version expected by updating your `csproj` or `project.json` in the same way that you used to update the vulnerable package versions.\r\n\r\nAfter you have addressed all of your direct dependencies, you must also review your transitive dependencies.\r\n\r\n### Reviewing Transitive Dependencies \r\n\r\nThere are two ways to view transitive dependencies. You can either use Visual Studio’s Solution Explorer, or you can review your `project.lock.json` (project.json/VS2015) or `project.assets.json` (csproj/VS2017) file.\r\n\r\n#### Using Visual Studio Solution Explorer (VS2015)\r\nIf you want to use Visual Studio 2015, open your project in Visual Studio 2015 and then press Ctrl+; to activate the search in Solution Explorer. Search for each of the vulnerable package names and make a note of the version numbers of any results you find.\r\n\r\nFor example, searching for `Microsoft.AspNetCore.Mvc.Core` in an example project that contains a reference to `Microsoft.AspNetCore.Mvc` shows the following results in Visual Studio 2015.\r\n\r\n![vs2015](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/796298/25858059/a1ae6624-348f-11e7-9ce9-ff2d25a3fc5b.png)\r\n\r\nThe search results appear as a tree. In these results, you can see we have found references to `Microsoft.AspNetCore.Mvc`, version 1.0.1, ` vulnerable version. \r\n\r\nThe first entry under the References heading refers to the target framework your application is using. This will be `.NETCoreApp`, `.NETStandard` or `.NET-Framework-vX.Y.Z` (where X.Y.Z is an actual version number) depending on how you configured your application. Under your target framework will be the list of packages you have directly taken a dependency on. In this example, the application takes a dependency on `Microsoft.AspNetCore.Mvc`. `Microsoft.AspNetCore.Mvc` in turn has leaf nodes that list its dependencies and their versions. In this case the `Microsoft.AspNetCore.Mvc` package takes a dependency on a vulnerable version of `Microsoft.AspNetCore.Mvc.Core` and numerous other packages.\r\n\r\n#### Manually reviewing project.lock.json (project.json/VS2015)\r\nOpen the `project.lock.json` file in your editor. We suggest you use an editor that understands json and allows you to collapse and expand nodes to review this file; both Visual Studio and Visual Studio Code provide this functionality.\r\n\r\nIf you are using Visual Studio the `project.lock.json` file is “under” the `project.json` file. Click the right pointing triangle, ▷, to the left of the `project.json` file to expand the solution tree to expose the `project.lock.json` file. The following image shows a project with the `project.json` file expanded to show the `project.lock.json` file.\r\n\r\n![project lock json](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/796298/25858179/f6e01200-348f-11e7-8a77-7176d8dd3f03.png)\r\n\r\nSearch the `project.lock.json` file for the vulnerable packages, using the format `packagename/`, using each of the package names from the table above. If you find any vulnerable assembly name in your search examine the line on which they are found, the version number is after the `/` and compare to the vulnerable versions table above. For example a search result that shows `Microsoft.AspNetCore.Mvc.Cors/1.0.1` is a reference to v1.0.1 of `Microsoft.AspNetCore.Mvc.Cors`.   If your `project.lock.json` file includes references to any of the package versions shown above then you will need to fix the transitive dependencies. \r\n\r\n#### Fixing transitive dependencies (project.json/VS2015)\r\n\r\nIf you have not found any reference to a vulnerable version of  `Microsoft.AspNetCore.Mvc.Cors` this means none of your direct dependencies depend on any vulnerable packages or you have already fixed the problem by updating the direct dependencies.\r\n\r\nIf your transitive dependency review found references to any of the vulnerable packages you must add a direct dependency to the updated package to your `project.json` file to override the transitive dependency. Open your `project.json` and find the dependencies section. For example:\r\n\r\n``` json\r\n  \"dependencies\": {\r\n    \"Microsoft.NETCore.App\": {\r\n      \"version\": \"1.0.1\",\r\n      \"type\": \"platform\"\r\n    },\r\n    \"Microsoft.AspNetCore.Server.Kestrel\": \"1.1.0\",\r\n    \"Microsoft.AspNetCore.Mvc\": \"1.0.0\"\r\n  }\r\n```\r\n\r\nFor each of the vulnerable packages your search returned you must add a direct dependency to the updated version by adding it to the `project.json` file. You do this by adding a new line to the dependencies section, referring the fixed version. For example, if your search showed a transitive reference to the vulnerable `Microsoft.AspNetCore.Mvc.Cors` version 1.0.0 you would add a reference to the appropriate fixed version, 1.0.6. Edit the `project.json` file as follows:\r\n\r\n``` json\r\n  \"dependencies\": {\r\n    \"Microsoft.NETCore.App\": {\r\n      \"version\": \"1.0.1\",\r\n      \"type\": \"platform\"\r\n    },\r\n    \"Microsoft.AspNetCore.Mvc.Cors\": \"1.0.6\",\r\n    \"Microsoft.AspNetCore.Server.Kestrel\": \"1.1.0\",\r\n    \"Microsoft.AspNetCore.Mvc\": \"1.0.0\"\r\n  }\r\n```\r\n\r\nAfter you have added direct dependencies to the fixed packages, save your `project.json` file.\r\n\r\nIf you are using Visual Studio save your updated `project.json` file and Visual Studio will restore the new package versions. You can see the restore results by opening the Output Window (Ctrl+Alt+O) and changing the Show output from drop-down list to Package Manager.\r\n\r\nIf you are not using Visual Studio open a command line and change to your project directory. Execute the `dotnet restore` command to restore your new dependencies.\r\n\r\n#### Using Visual Studio Solution Explorer (VS2017)\r\n\r\nIf you want to use Solution Explorer, open your project in Visual Studio 2017, and then press Ctrl+; to activate the search in Solution Explorer. Search for each of the vulnerable package names and make a note of the version numbers of any results you find.\r\n\r\nFor example, searching for `Microsoft.AspNetCore.Mvc.Core` in an example project that contains a package that takes a dependency on `Microsoft.AspNetCore.Mvc` shows the following results in Visual Studio 2017.\r\n\r\n![vs2017](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/796298/25858816/8ecdc2b4-3491-11e7-9363-746804bb9832.png)\r\n\r\nThe search results appear as a tree. In these results, you can see we have found references to `Microsoft.AspNetCore.Mvc.Core` version 1.1.2.\r\n\r\nUnder the Dependencies node will be a NuGet node. Under the NuGet node will be the list of packages you have directly taken a dependency on and their versions. In this example, the application takes a direct dependency on `Microsoft.AspNetCore.Mvc`. `Microsoft.AspNetCore.Mvc` in turn has leaf nodes that list its dependencies and their versions. In the example the `Microsoft.AspNetCore.Mvc` package takes a dependency on a version of `Microsoft.AspNetCore.Mvc.ApiExplorer` which in turn takes a dependency on a vulnerable version of `Microsoft.AspNetCore.Mvc.Core`.\r\n\r\n#### Manually reviewing project.assets.json (VS2017)\r\n\r\nOpen the `project.assets.json` file from your project’s obj directory in your editor. We suggest you use an editor that understands json and allows you to collapse and expand nodes to review this file; both Visual Studio and Visual Studio Code provide this functionality.\r\n\r\nSearch the `project.assets.json` file for each of the vulnerable packages, using the format `packagename/` using the package name from the table above. If you find the assembly name in your search examine the line on which they are found, the version number is after the `/` and compare to the vulnerable versions table above. For example a search result that shows `Microsoft.AspNetCore.Mvc.Cors/1.1.0` is a reference to v1.1.0 of `Microsoft.AspNetCore.Mvc.Cors`.   If your `project.assets.json` file includes references to any of the vulnerable packages shown above then you will need to fix the transitive dependencies.\r\n\r\nIf you have not found any reference to any vulnerable packages this means none of your direct dependencies depend on any vulnerable packages or you have already fixed the problem by updating the direct dependencies.\r\n\r\nIf your transitive dependency review found references to any of the vulnerable packages you must add a direct dependency to the updated package to your `csproj` file to override the transitive dependency. Open your `projectname.csproj` file in your editor, or right click on the project in Visual Studio 2017 and choose Edit `projectname.csproj` from the content menu, where `projectname` is the name of your project. Look for `PackageReference` nodes, for example:\r\n\r\n``` xml\r\n<Project Sdk=\"Microsoft.NET.Sdk.Web\">\r\n  <PropertyGroup>\r\n    <TargetFramework>netcoreapp1.1</TargetFramework>\r\n  </PropertyGroup>\r\n  <PropertyGroup>\r\n    <PackageTargetFallback>$(PackageTargetFallback);portable-net45+win8+wp8+wpa81;</PackageTargetFallback>\r\n  </PropertyGroup>\r\n  <ItemGroup>\r\n    <PackageReference Include=\"Microsoft.AspNetCore\" Version=\"1.1.1\" />\r\n    <PackageReference Include=\"Microsoft.AspNetCore.Mvc\" Version=\"1.1.3\" />\r\n  </ItemGroup>\r\n  <ItemGroup>\r\n    <DotNetCliToolReference Include=\"Microsoft.VisualStudio.Web.CodeGeneration.Tools\" Version=\"1.0.0\" />\r\n  </ItemGroup>\r\n</Project>\r\n```\r\n\r\nFor each of the vulnerable packages your search returned you must add a direct dependency to the updated version by adding it to the `csproj` file. You do this by adding a new line to the dependencies section, referring the fixed version. For example, if your search showed a transitive reference to the vulnerable `Microsoft.AspNetCore.Mvc.Cors`, version 1.1.4 you would add a reference to the appropriate fixed version, 1.1.6.\r\n\r\n``` xml\r\n<Project Sdk=\"Microsoft.NET.Sdk.Web\">\r\n  <PropertyGroup>\r\n    <TargetFramework>netcoreapp1.1</TargetFramework>\r\n  </PropertyGroup>\r\n  <PropertyGroup>\r\n    <PackageTargetFallback>$(PackageTargetFallback);portable-net45+win8+wp8+wpa81;</PackageTargetFallback>\r\n  </PropertyGroup>\r\n  <ItemGroup>\r\n    <PackageReference Include=\"Microsoft.AspNetCore.Mvc.Cors\" Version=\"1.1.6\" />\r\n    <PackageReference Include=\"Microsoft.AspNetCore\" Version=\"1.1.1\" />\r\n    <PackageReference Include=\"Microsoft.AspNetCore.Mvc\" Version=\"1.1.3\" />\r\n  </ItemGroup>\r\n  <ItemGroup>\r\n    <DotNetCliToolReference Include=\"Microsoft.VisualStudio.Web.CodeGeneration.Tools\" Version=\"1.0.0\" />\r\n  </ItemGroup>\r\n```\r\n\r\nAfter you have added the direct dependency reference, save your `csproj` file.\r\n\r\nIf you are using Visual Studio, save your updated `csproj` file and Visual Studio will restore the new package versions. You can see the restore results by opening the Output Window (Ctrl+Alt+O) and changing the Show output from drop-down list to Package Manager.\r\n\r\nIf you are not using Visual Studio, open a command line and change to your project directory. Execute the `dotnet restore` command to restore your new dependencies.\r\n\r\n### Rebuilding your application\r\nFinally rebuild your application, test as you would do normally and redeploy using your favored deployment mechanism.\r\n\r\n## Other Information\r\n### Reporting Security Issues\r\n\r\nIf you have found a potential security issue in .NET Core, please email details to secure@microsoft.com.

This advisory also provides guidance on what developers can do to update their applications correctly.\r\n\r\nMicrosoft is aware of a security vulnerability in all public versions of ASP.NET Core where the application is hosted through Windows Http,Sys where a malformed request can lead to a Denial Of Service.\r\n\r\n## Dicussion\r\n\r\nDiscussion for this issue can be found at https://github.com/aspnet/HttpSysServer/issues/416\r\n\r\n### Mitigation Factors\r\nASP.NET Core applications hosted using Kestrel as their web server are not affected. By default ASP.NET Core Web applications are hosted with Kestrel. Developers must make specific decisions to switch to using HTTP.SYS and as this hosting option is only available on Windows this advisory does not affect Linux or macOS.\r\n\r\n## Affected Software\r\nThe vulnerabilities affect any Microsoft ASP.NET Core project if it uses the following affected package versions.\r\n\r\nPackage name | Package versions | Fixed package versions\r\n---------------- | ------------------- | -------------------------\r\nMicrosoft.AspNetCore.Server.WebListener<br /> Microsoft.Net.Http.Server | 1.0.0, 1.0.1, 1.0.2, 1.0.3, 1.0.4, 1.0.5<br />1.1.0, 1.1.1, 1.1.2 ,1.1.3 | 1.0.6<br />1.1.4\r\nMicrosoft.AspNetCore.Server.HttpSys | 2.0.0, 2.0.1 |  2.0.2\r\n\r\n## Advisory FAQ\r\n### How do I know if I am affected? \r\n\r\n.NET Core and ASP.NET Core have two types of dependencies: direct and transitive. If your project has a direct or transitive dependency on any of the packages and versions listed above, you are affected.\r\n\r\n### NET Core Project formats\r\n.NET Core has two different project file formats, depending on what software created the project. \r\n\r\n1. `project.json` is the format used in .NET Core 1.0 and Microsoft Visual Studio 2015.\r\n2. `csproj` is the format used in .NET Core 1.1, .NET Core 2.0 and Microsoft Visual Studio 2017.  \r\n\t\r\nYou must ensure you follow the correct update instructions for your project type.\r\n\r\n### Direct Dependencies\r\nDirect dependencies are dependencies where you specifically add a package to your project. For example, if you add the `Microsoft.AspNetCore.Mvc` package to your project then you have taken a direct dependency on` Microsoft.AspNetCore.Mvc`.\r\n\r\nDirect dependencies are discoverable by reviewing your `project.json` or `csproj` file.\r\n\r\n### Transitive Dependencies\r\nTransitive dependencies occur when you add a package to your project that in turn relies on another package. For example, if you add the `Microsoft.AspNetCore.Mvc` package to your project it depends on the `Microsoft.AspNetCore.Mvc.Core` package (among others). Your project has a direct dependency on `Microsoft.AspNetCore.Mvc` and a transitive dependency on the `Microsoft.AspNetCore.Mvc.Core` package.\r\nTransitive dependencies are reviewable in the Visual Studio Solution Explorer window, which supports searching, or by reviewing the `project.lock.json` file contained in the root directory of your project for `project.json` projects or the `project.assets.json` file contained in the obj directory of your project for `csproj` projects. These files are the authoritative list of all packages used by your project, containing both direct and transitive dependencies.\r\n\r\n## How do I fix my affected application?\r\nYou will need to fix both direct dependencies and review and fix any transitive dependencies. The affected packages and versions in the previous “Affected Software” section include each vulnerable package, the vulnerable versions, and the patched versions\r\n\r\n\r\n### Fixing Direct Dependencies – project.json/VS2015\r\nOpen your `project.json` file in your editor. Look for the dependencies section. Below is an example dependencies section:\r\n\r\n``` json\r\n    \"dependencies\": {\r\n      \"Microsoft.NETCore.App\": {\r\n        \"version\": \"1.0.1\",\r\n        \"type\": \"platform\"\r\n      },\r\n     \"Microsoft.AspNetCore.Server.WebListener\": \"1.0.1\",\r\n     \"Microsoft.AspNetCore.Mvc.Core \": \"1.0.6\",\r\n    }\r\n```\r\nThis example has three direct dependencies: `Microsoft.NETCore.App`, `Microsoft.AspNetCore.Server.WebListener` and `Microsoft.AspNetCore.Mvc.Core`. \r\n\r\n`Microsoft.NetCore.App` is the platform the application targets, you should ignore this. The other packages expose their version to the right of the package name. In our example, our non-platform packages are version 1.0.1.\r\n\r\nReview your direct dependencies for any instance of the packages and versions listed above. In the example above, there is a direct dependency on the vulnerable package, `Microsoft.AspNetCore.Server.WebListener` version 1.0.1.\r\n\r\nTo update to the fixed package, change the version number to be the appropriate package for your release. In the example, this would be updating `Microsoft.AspNetCore.Server.WebListener` to 1.0.6.\r\n\r\nAfter updating the vulnerable package versions, save your `project.json` file.\r\n\r\nThe dependencies section in our example `project.json` would now look as follows:\r\n\r\n```json\r\n  \"dependencies\": {\r\n    \"Microsoft.NETCore.App\": {\r\n      \"version\": \"1.0.1\",\r\n      \"type\": \"platform\"\r\n    },\r\n    \"Microsoft.AspNetCore.Server.WebListener\": \"1.0.6\",\r\n    \"Microsoft.AspNetCore.Mvc.Core\": \"1.0.6\",     \r\n  }\r\n```\r\n\r\nIf you are using Visual Studio and save your updated `project.json` file, Visual Studio will restore the new package version. You can see the restore results by opening the Output Window (Ctrl+Alt+O) and changing the Show output from drop-down list to Package Manager.\r\n\r\nIf you are not using Visual Studio, open a command line and change to your project directory. Execute the `dotnet restore` command to restore your new dependency.\r\n\r\nAfter you have addressed all of your direct dependencies, you must also review your transitive dependencies.\r\n\r\n### Fixing Direct Dependencies – csproj/VS2017\r\nOpen your `projectname.csproj` file in your editor, or right click the project in Visual Studio 2017 and choose `Edit projectname.csproj` from the content menu, where projectname is the name of your project. Look for `PackageReference` nodes. The following shows an example project file:\r\n\r\n``` XML\r\n<Project Sdk=\"Microsoft.NET.Sdk.Web\">\r\n  <PropertyGroup>\r\n    <TargetFramework>netcoreapp1.1</TargetFramework>\r\n  </PropertyGroup>\r\n  <PropertyGroup>\r\n    <PackageTargetFallback>$(PackageTargetFallback);portable-net45+win8+wp8+wpa81;</PackageTargetFallback>\r\n  </PropertyGroup>\r\n  <ItemGroup>\r\n    <PackageReference Include=\"Microsoft.Net.Http.Server\" Version=\"1.1.1\" />\r\n    <PackageReference Include=\"Microsoft.AspNetCore.Mvc.Core\" Version=\"1.1.3\" />\r\n  </ItemGroup>\r\n  <ItemGroup>\r\n    <DotNetCliToolReference Include=\"Microsoft.VisualStudio.Web.CodeGeneration.Tools\" Version=\"1.0.0 \" />\r\n  </ItemGroup>\r\n</Project>\r\n```\r\n\r\nThe example has a two direct dependencies, as seen by the two `PackageReference` elements. The name of the package is in the Include attribute, and the package version number is in the Version attribute that is exposed to the right of the package name.\r\n\r\nReview your `PackageReference` elements for any instance of the packages and versions listed above. The example shows a direct reference to the vulnerable package `Microsoft.Net.Http.Server` version 1.1.1.\r\n\r\nTo update to the fixed package, change the version number to the appropriate package for your release. In the example, this would be updating `Microsoft.Net.Http.Server` to 1.1.4.\r\n\r\nAfter updating the vulnerable package version, save your `csproj` file. The example `csproj` would now look as follows:\r\n\r\n``` XML\r\n<Project Sdk=\"Microsoft.NET.Sdk.Web\">\r\n  <PropertyGroup>\r\n    <TargetFramework>netcoreapp1.1</TargetFramework>\r\n  </PropertyGroup>\r\n  <PropertyGroup>\r\n    <PackageTargetFallback>$(PackageTargetFallback);portable-net45+win8+wp8+wpa81;</PackageTargetFallback>\r\n  </PropertyGroup>\r\n  <ItemGroup>\r\n    <PackageReference Include=\"Microsoft.Net.Http.Server\" Version=\"1.1.4\" />\r\n    <PackageReference Include=\"Microsoft.AspNetCore.Mvc.Core\" Version=\"1.1.3\" />\r\n  </ItemGroup>\r\n  <ItemGroup>\r\n    <DotNetCliToolReference Include=\"Microsoft.VisualStudio.Web.CodeGeneration.Tools\" Version=\"1.0.0 \" />\r\n  </ItemGroup>\r\n</Project>\r\n```\r\n\r\nIf you are using Visual Studio and save your updated `csproj` file, Visual Studio will restore the new package version. You can see the restore results by opening the Output Window (Ctrl+Alt+O) and changing the Show output from drop-down list to Package Manager.\r\n\r\nIf you are not using Visual Studio open a command line and change to your project directory. Execute the `dotnet restore` command to restore your new dependency.\r\n\r\n### After updating your direct dependencies\r\n\r\nRecompile your application.\r\n\r\nIf after recompilation you see a Dependency conflict warning, you must update your other direct dependencies to the appropriate version. \r\n\r\nFor example if your project refers to `Microsoft.AspNetCore.Mvc.Cors` with a version number of 1.0.1 when you update your `Microsoft.AspNetCore.Mvc` package to 1.0.6, compilation will throw:\r\n\r\n`NU1012      Dependency conflict. Microsoft.AspNetCore.Mvc.Core 1.0.6 expected Microsoft.AspNetCore.Mvc.Cors >= 1.0.6 but received 1.0.1`\r\n\r\nTo fix this, edit the version for the expected package to be the version expected by updating your `csproj` or `project.json` in the same way that you used to update the vulnerable package versions.\r\n\r\nAfter you have addressed all of your direct dependencies, you must also review your transitive dependencies.\r\n\r\n### Reviewing Transitive Dependencies \r\n\r\nThere are two ways to view transitive dependencies. You can either use Visual Studio’s Solution Explorer, or you can review your `project.lock.json` (project.json/VS2015) or `project.assets.json` (csproj/VS2017) file.\r\n\r\n#### Using Visual Studio Solution Explorer (VS2015)\r\nIf you want to use Visual Studio 2015, open your project in Visual Studio 2015 and then press Ctrl+; to activate the search in Solution Explorer. Search for each of the vulnerable package names and make a note of the version numbers of any results you find.\r\n\r\nFor example, searching for `Microsoft.AspNetCore.Mvc.Core` in an example project that contains a reference to `Microsoft.AspNetCore.Mvc` shows the following results in Visual Studio 2015.\r\n\r\n![vs2015](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/796298/25858059/a1ae6624-348f-11e7-9ce9-ff2d25a3fc5b.png)\r\n\r\nThe search results appear as a tree. In these results, you can see we have found references to `Microsoft.AspNetCore.Mvc`, version 1.0.1, ` vulnerable version. \r\n\r\nThe first entry under the References heading refers to the target framework your application is using. This will be `.NETCoreApp`, `.NETStandard` or `.NET-Framework-vX.Y.Z` (where X.Y.Z is an actual version number) depending on how you configured your application. Under your target framework will be the list of packages you have directly taken a dependency on. In this example, the application takes a dependency on `Microsoft.AspNetCore.Mvc`. `Microsoft.AspNetCore.Mvc` in turn has leaf nodes that list its dependencies and their versions. In this case the `Microsoft.AspNetCore.Mvc` package takes a dependency on a vulnerable version of `Microsoft.AspNetCore.Mvc.Core` and numerous other packages.\r\n\r\n#### Manually reviewing project.lock.json (project.json/VS2015)\r\nOpen the `project.lock.json` file in your editor. We suggest you use an editor that understands json and allows you to collapse and expand nodes to review this file; both Visual Studio and Visual Studio Code provide this functionality.\r\n\r\nIf you are using Visual Studio the `project.lock.json` file is “under” the `project.json` file. Click the right pointing triangle, ▷, to the left of the `project.json` file to expand the solution tree to expose the `project.lock.json` file. The following image shows a project with the `project.json` file expanded to show the `project.lock.json` file.\r\n\r\n![project lock json](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/796298/25858179/f6e01200-348f-11e7-8a77-7176d8dd3f03.png)\r\n\r\nSearch the `project.lock.json` file for the vulnerable packages, using the format `packagename/`, using each of the package names from the table above. If you find any vulnerable assembly name in your search examine the line on which they are found, the version number is after the `/` and compare to the vulnerable versions table above. For example a search result that shows `Microsoft.AspNetCore.Mvc.Cors/1.0.1` is a reference to v1.0.1 of `Microsoft.AspNetCore.Mvc.Cors`.   If your `project.lock.json` file includes references to any of the package versions shown above then you will need to fix the transitive dependencies. \r\n\r\n#### Fixing transitive dependencies (project.json/VS2015)\r\n\r\nIf you have not found any reference to a vulnerable version of  `Microsoft.AspNetCore.Mvc.Cors` this means none of your direct dependencies depend on any vulnerable packages or you have already fixed the problem by updating the direct dependencies.\r\n\r\nIf your transitive dependency review found references to any of the vulnerable packages you must add a direct dependency to the updated package to your `project.json` file to override the transitive dependency. Open your `project.json` and find the dependencies section. For example:\r\n\r\n``` json\r\n  \"dependencies\": {\r\n    \"Microsoft.NETCore.App\": {\r\n      \"version\": \"1.0.1\",\r\n      \"type\": \"platform\"\r\n    },\r\n    \"Microsoft.AspNetCore.Mvc\": \"1.0.0\"\r\n  }\r\n```\r\n\r\nFor each of the vulnerable packages your search returned you must add a direct dependency to the updated version by adding it to the `project.json` file. You do this by adding a new line to the dependencies section, referring the fixed version. For example, if your search showed a transitive reference to the vulnerable `Microsoft.AspNetCore.Server.WebListener` version 1.0.0 you would add a reference to the appropriate fixed version, 1.0.6. Edit the `project.json` file as follows:\r\n\r\n``` json\r\n  \"dependencies\": {\r\n    \"Microsoft.NETCore.App\": {\r\n      \"version\": \"1.0.1\",\r\n      \"type\": \"platform\"\r\n    },\r\n    \"Microsoft.AspNetCore.Server.WebListener\": \"1.0.6\",\r\n    \"Microsoft.AspNetCore.Mvc\": \"1.0.0\"\r\n  }\r\n```\r\n\r\nAfter you have added direct dependencies to the fixed packages, save your `project.json` file.\r\n\r\nIf you are using Visual Studio save your updated `project.json` file and Visual Studio will restore the new package versions. You can see the restore results by opening the Output Window (Ctrl+Alt+O) and changing the Show output from drop-down list to Package Manager.\r\n\r\nIf you are not using Visual Studio open a command line and change to your project directory. Execute the `dotnet restore` command to restore your new dependencies.\r\n\r\n#### Using Visual Studio Solution Explorer (VS2017)\r\n\r\nIf you want to use Solution Explorer, open your project in Visual Studio 2017, and then press Ctrl+; to activate the search in Solution Explorer. Search for each of the vulnerable package names and make a note of the version numbers of any results you find.\r\n\r\nFor example, searching for `Microsoft.AspNetCore.Mvc.Core` in an example project that contains a package that takes a dependency on `Microsoft.AspNetCore.Mvc` shows the following results in Visual Studio 2017.\r\n\r\n![vs2017](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/796298/25858816/8ecdc2b4-3491-11e7-9363-746804bb9832.png)\r\n\r\nThe search results appear as a tree. In these results, you can see we have found references to `Microsoft.AspNetCore.Mvc.Core` version 1.1.2.\r\n\r\nUnder the Dependencies node will be a NuGet node. Under the NuGet node will be the list of packages you have directly taken a dependency on and their versions. In this example, the application takes a direct dependency on `Microsoft.AspNetCore.Mvc`. `Microsoft.AspNetCore.Mvc` in turn has leaf nodes that list its dependencies and their versions. In the example the `Microsoft.AspNetCore.Mvc` package takes a dependency on a version of `Microsoft.AspNetCore.Mvc.ApiExplorer` which in turn takes a dependency on a vulnerable version of `Microsoft.AspNetCore.Mvc.Core`.\r\n\r\n#### Manually reviewing project.assets.json (VS2017)\r\n\r\nOpen the `project.assets.json` file from your project’s obj directory in your editor. We suggest you use an editor that understands json and allows you to collapse and expand nodes to review this file; both Visual Studio and Visual Studio Code provide this functionality.\r\n\r\nSearch the `project.assets.json` file for each of the vulnerable packages, using the format `packagename/` using the package name from the table above. If you find the assembly name in your search examine the line on which they are found, the version number is after the `/` and compare to the vulnerable versions table above. For example a search result that shows `Microsoft.AspNetCore.Mvc.Cors/1.1.0` is a reference to v1.1.0 of `Microsoft.AspNetCore.Mvc.Cors`.   If your `project.assets.json` file includes references to any of the vulnerable packages shown above then you will need to fix the transitive dependencies.\r\n\r\nIf you have not found any reference to any vulnerable packages this means none of your direct dependencies depend on any vulnerable packages or you have already fixed the problem by updating the direct dependencies.\r\n\r\nIf your transitive dependency review found references to any of the vulnerable packages you must add a direct dependency to the updated package to your `csproj` file to override the transitive dependency. Open your `projectname.csproj` file in your editor, or right click on the project in Visual Studio 2017 and choose Edit `projectname.csproj` from the content menu, where `projectname` is the name of your project. Look for `PackageReference` nodes, for example:\r\n\r\n``` xml\r\n<Project Sdk=\"Microsoft.NET.Sdk.Web\">\r\n  <PropertyGroup>\r\n    <TargetFramework>netcoreapp1.1</TargetFramework>\r\n  </PropertyGroup>\r\n  <PropertyGroup>\r\n    <PackageTargetFallback>$(PackageTargetFallback);portable-net45+win8+wp8+wpa81;</PackageTargetFallback>\r\n  </PropertyGroup>\r\n  <ItemGroup>\r\n    <PackageReference Include=\"Microsoft.AspNetCore\" Version=\"1.1.1\" />\r\n    <PackageReference Include=\"Microsoft.AspNetCore.Mvc\" Version=\"1.1.3\" />\r\n  </ItemGroup>\r\n  <ItemGroup>\r\n    <DotNetCliToolReference Include=\"Microsoft.VisualStudio.Web.CodeGeneration.Tools\" Version=\"1.0.0\" />\r\n  </ItemGroup>\r\n</Project>\r\n```\r\n\r\nFor each of the vulnerable packages your search returned you must add a direct dependency to the updated version by adding it to the `csproj` file. You do this by adding a new line to the dependencies section, referring the fixed version. For example, if your search showed a transitive reference to the vulnerable `Microsoft.AspNetCore.Server.WebListener` version 1.1.0 you would add a reference to the appropriate fixed version 1.1.4.\r\n\r\n``` xml\r\n<Project Sdk=\"Microsoft.NET.Sdk.Web\">\r\n  <PropertyGroup>\r\n    <TargetFramework>netcoreapp1.1</TargetFramework>\r\n  </PropertyGroup>\r\n  <PropertyGroup>\r\n    <PackageTargetFallback>$(PackageTargetFallback);portable-net45+win8+wp8+wpa81;</PackageTargetFallback>\r\n  </PropertyGroup>\r\n  <ItemGroup>\r\n    <PackageReference Include=\"Microsoft.AspNetCore.Server.WebListener\" Version=\"1.1.4\" />\r\n    <PackageReference Include=\"Microsoft.AspNetCore\" Version=\"1.1.1\" />\r\n    <PackageReference Include=\"Microsoft.AspNetCore.Mvc\" Version=\"1.1.3\" />\r\n  </ItemGroup>\r\n  <ItemGroup>\r\n    <DotNetCliToolReference Include=\"Microsoft.VisualStudio.Web.CodeGeneration.Tools\" Version=\"1.0.0\" />\r\n  </ItemGroup>\r\n```\r\n\r\nAfter you have added the direct dependency reference, save your `csproj` file.\r\n\r\nIf you are using Visual Studio, save your updated `csproj` file and Visual Studio will restore the new package versions. You can see the restore results by opening the Output Window (Ctrl+Alt+O) and changing the Show output from drop-down list to Package Manager.\r\n\r\nIf you are not using Visual Studio, open a command line and change to your project directory. Execute the `dotnet restore` command to restore your new dependencies.\r\n\r\n### Rebuilding your application\r\nFinally rebuild your application, test as you would do normally and redeploy using your favored deployment mechanism.\r\n\r\n## Other Information\r\n### Reporting Security Issues\r\n\r\nIf you have found a potential security issue in .NET Core, please email details to secure@microsoft.com.

This advisory also provides guidance on what developers can do to update their applications correctly.\r\n\r\nMicrosoft is aware of a security vulnerability some public versions of ASP.NET Core where an Open Redirect exists, leading to Elevation Of Privilege.\r\n\r\n## Discussion\r\n\r\nPlease use https://github.com/aspnet/Mvc/issues/7053 for discussion of this advisory.\r\n\r\n### Mitigation Factors\r\nASP.NET Core applications using version 1.0.x or 1.1.x are not affected.\r\n\r\n## Affected Software\r\nThe vulnerabilities affect any Microsoft .NET Core project if it uses the following affected package versions.\r\n\r\nPackage name | Package versions | Fixed package versions\r\n---------------- | ------------------- | -------------------------\r\nMicrosoft.AspNetCore.All | 2.0.0 |  2.0.3\r\nMicrosoft.AspNetCore.Mvc.Core | 2.0.0 |  2.0.1\r\n\r\n## Advisory FAQ\r\n### How do I know if I am affected? \r\n\r\n.NET Core and ASP.NET Core have two types of dependencies: direct and transitive. If your project has a direct or transitive dependency on any of the packages and versions listed above, you are affected.\r\n\r\n### Direct Dependencies\r\nDirect dependencies are dependencies where you specifically add a package to your project. For example, if you add the `Microsoft.AspNetCore.Mvc` package to your project then you have taken a direct dependency on` Microsoft.AspNetCore.Mvc`.\r\n\r\nDirect dependencies are discoverable by reviewing your `csproj` file.\r\n\r\n### Transitive Dependencies\r\nTransitive dependencies occur when you add a package to your project that in turn relies on another package. For example, if you add the `Microsoft.AspNetCore.Mvc` package to your project it depends on the `Microsoft.AspNetCore.Mvc.Core` package (among others). Your project has a direct dependency on `Microsoft.AspNetCore.Mvc` and a transitive dependency on the `Microsoft.AspNetCore.Mvc.Core` package.\r\nTransitive dependencies are reviewable in the Visual Studio Solution Explorer window, which supports searching, or by reviewing the `project.lock.json` file contained in the root directory of your project for `project.json` projects or the `project.assets.json` file contained in the obj directory of your project for `csproj` projects. These files are the authoritative list of all packages used by your project, containing both direct and transitive dependencies.\r\n\r\n## How do I fix my affected application?\r\nYou will need to fix both direct dependencies and review and fix any transitive dependencies. The affected packages and versions in the previous “Affected Software” section include each vulnerable package, the vulnerable versions, and the patched versions\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\nIf you are targeting .NET Core a \"meta-package\" is used, `Microsoft.AspNetCore.All`. You should begin by updating its version number to 2.0.3, this will pull in the fixed `Microsoft.AspNetCore.Mvc.Core` package.\r\n\r\nIf you are targeting .NET Framework you should first update the `Microsoft.AspNetCore` version to the version number to 2.0.1, then adjust the version number for any other packages beginning with `Microsoft.AspNetCore.` to 2.0.3.\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n### Fixing Direct Dependencies – Projects targeting .NET Core\r\nOpen your `projectname.csproj` file in your editor, or right click the project in Visual Studio 2017 and choose `Edit projectname.csproj` from the content menu, where projectname is the name of your project. Look for `PackageReference` nodes. The following shows an example project file:\r\n\r\n``` XML\r\n<Project Sdk=\"Microsoft.NET.Sdk.Web\">\r\n  <PropertyGroup>\r\n    <TargetFramework>netcoreapp2.0</TargetFramework>\r\n  </PropertyGroup>\r\n  <ItemGroup>\r\n    <PackageReference Include=\"Microsoft.AspNetCore.All\" Version=\"2.0.0\" />\r\n  </ItemGroup>\r\n  <ItemGroup>\r\n    <DotNetCliToolReference Include=\"Microsoft.VisualStudio.Web.CodeGeneration.Tools\" Version=\"2.0.0\" />\r\n  </ItemGroup>\r\n</Project>\r\n```\r\n\r\nThe example has has a reference to the vulnerable metapackage, as seen by the single `PackageReference` elements. The name of the package is in the Include attribute, and the package version number is in the Version attribute that is exposed to the right of the package name. The example shows a single direct dependency on `Microsoft.AspNetCore.All` version 2.0.0.\r\n\r\nTo update to the fixed package, change the version number to the updated package version. In the example, this would be updating `Microsoft.AspNetCore.All` to 2.0.3.\r\n\r\nAfter updating the vulnerable package version, save your `csproj` file. The example `csproj` would now look as follows:\r\n\r\n``` XML\r\n<Project Sdk=\"Microsoft.NET.Sdk.Web\">\r\n  <PropertyGroup>\r\n    <TargetFramework>netcoreapp2.0</TargetFramework>\r\n  </PropertyGroup>\r\n  <ItemGroup>\r\n    <PackageReference Include=\"Microsoft.AspNetCore.All\" Version=\"2.0.3\" />\r\n  </ItemGroup>\r\n  <ItemGroup>\r\n    <DotNetCliToolReference Include=\"Microsoft.VisualStudio.Web.CodeGeneration.Tools\" Version=\"2.0.0\" />\r\n  </ItemGroup>\r\n</Project>\r\n```\r\n\r\nIf you are using Visual Studio and save your updated `csproj` file, Visual Studio will restore the new package version. You can see the restore results by opening the Output Window (Ctrl+Alt+O) and changing the Show output from drop-down list to Package Manager.\r\n\r\nIf you are not using Visual Studio open a command line and change to your project directory. Execute the `dotnet restore` command to restore your new dependency.\r\n\r\n### Fixing Direct Dependencies – Projects targeting .NET Framework\r\nOpen your `projectname.csproj` file in your editor, or right click the project in Visual Studio 2017 and choose `Edit projectname.csproj` from the content menu, where projectname is the name of your project. Look for `PackageReference` nodes. The following shows an example project file:\r\n\r\n``` XML\r\n<Project Sdk=\"Microsoft.NET.Sdk.Web\">\r\n  <PropertyGroup>\r\n    <TargetFramework>net461</TargetFramework>\r\n  </PropertyGroup>\r\n  <ItemGroup>\r\n    <PackageReference Include=\"Microsoft.AspNetCore.Mvc.Core\" Version=\"2.0.0\" />\r\n  </ItemGroup>\r\n  <ItemGroup>\r\n    <DotNetCliToolReference Include=\"Microsoft.VisualStudio.Web.CodeGeneration.Tools\" Version=\"2.0.0\" />\r\n  </ItemGroup>\r\n</Project>\r\n```\r\n\r\nThe example has has a reference a single packages, as seen by the `PackageReference` element. The name of the package is in the Include attribute, and the package version number is in the Version attribute that is exposed to the right of the package name. The example shows a direct dependency on one of the vulnerable packages from the table above, `Microsoft.AspNetCore.Core` version 2.0.0.\r\n\r\nTo update to the fixed package, change the version number to the updated package version. In the example, this would be updating `Microsoft.AspNetCore.Core` to 2.0.1.\r\n\r\nAfter updating the vulnerable package version, save your `csproj` file. The example `csproj` would now look as follows:\r\n\r\n``` XML\r\n<Project Sdk=\"Microsoft.NET.Sdk.Web\">\r\n  <PropertyGroup>\r\n    <TargetFramework>net461</TargetFramework>\r\n  </PropertyGroup>\r\n  <ItemGroup>\r\n    <PackageReference Include=\"Microsoft.AspNetCore.Mvc.Core\" Version=\"2.0.1\" />\r\n  </ItemGroup>\r\n  <ItemGroup>\r\n    <DotNetCliToolReference Include=\"Microsoft.VisualStudio.Web.CodeGeneration.Tools\" Version=\"2.0.0\" />\r\n  </ItemGroup>\r\n</Project>\r\n```\r\nIf you are using Visual Studio and save your updated `csproj` file, Visual Studio will restore the new package version. You can see the restore results by opening the Output Window (Ctrl+Alt+O) and changing the Show output from drop-down list to Package Manager.\r\n\r\nIf you are not using Visual Studio open a command line and change to your project directory. Execute the `dotnet restore` command to restore your new dependency.\r\n\r\n### After updating your direct dependencies\r\n\r\nRecompile your application.\r\n\r\nIf after recompilation you see a Dependency conflict warning, you must update your other direct dependencies to the appropriate version. \r\n\r\nFor example if your project refers a direct reference to `Microsoft.AspNetCore.Mvc.Cors` with a version number of 2.0.0 when you update your `Microsoft.AspNetCore.Mvc` package to 2.0.1, compilation will throw:\r\n\r\n`NU1012      Dependency conflict. Microsoft.AspNetCore.Mvc 2.0.1 expected Microsoft.AspNetCore.Mvc.Cors >= 2.0.1 but received 2.0.0`\r\n\r\nTo fix this, edit the version for the expected package to be the version expected by updating your `project.json` in the same way that you used to update the vulnerable package versions.\r\n\r\nAfter you have addressed all of your direct dependencies, you must also review your transitive dependencies.\r\n\r\n### Reviewing Transitive Dependencies \r\n\r\nThere are two ways to view transitive dependencies. You can either use Visual Studio’s Solution Explorer, or you can review your `project.assets.json` file.\r\n\r\n#### Using Visual Studio Solution Explorer (VS2017)\r\n\r\nIf you want to use Solution Explorer, open your project in Visual Studio 2017, and then press Ctrl+; to activate the search in Solution Explorer. Search for each of the vulnerable package names and make a note of the version numbers of any results you find.\r\n\r\nFor example, searching for `Microsoft.AspNetCore.Mvc.Core` in an example project that contains a package that takes a dependency on `Microsoft.AspNetCore.Mvc` shows the following results in Visual Studio 2017.\r\n\r\n![vs2017](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/796298/25858816/8ecdc2b4-3491-11e7-9363-746804bb9832.png)\r\n\r\nThe search results appear as a tree. In these results, you can see we have found references to `Microsoft.AspNetCore.Mvc.Core` version 1.1.2.\r\n\r\nUnder the Dependencies node will be a NuGet node. Under the NuGet node will be the list of packages you have directly taken a dependency on and their versions. In this example, the application takes a direct dependency on `Microsoft.AspNetCore.Mvc`. `Microsoft.AspNetCore.Mvc` in turn has leaf nodes that list its dependencies and their versions. In the example the `Microsoft.AspNetCore.Mvc` package takes a dependency on a version of `Microsoft.AspNetCore.Mvc.ApiExplorer` which in turn takes a dependency on a vulnerable version of `Microsoft.AspNetCore.Mvc.Core`.\r\n\r\n#### Manually reviewing project.assets.json (VS2017)\r\n\r\nOpen the `project.assets.json` file from your project’s obj directory in your editor. We suggest you use an editor that understands json and allows you to collapse and expand nodes to review this file; both Visual Studio and Visual Studio Code provide this functionality.\r\n\r\nSearch the `project.assets.json` file for each of the vulnerable packages, using the format `packagename/` for each of the package names from the table above. If you find the assembly name in your search examine the line on which they are found, the version number is after the `/` and compare to the vulnerable versions table above. For example a search result that shows `Microsoft.AspNetCore.Mvc.Cors/1.1.0` is a reference to v1.1.0 of `Microsoft.AspNetCore.Mvc.Cors`.   If your `project.assets.json` file includes references to any of the vulnerable packages shown above then you will need to fix the transitive dependencies.\r\n\r\nIf you have not found any reference to any vulnerable packages this means none of your direct dependencies depend on any vulnerable packages or you have already fixed the problem by updating the direct dependencies.\r\n\r\nIf your transitive dependency review found references to any of the vulnerable packages you must add a direct dependency to the updated package to your `csproj` file to override the transitive dependency. Open your `projectname.csproj` file in your editor, or right click on the project in Visual Studio 2017 and choose Edit `projectname.csproj` from the content menu, where `projectname` is the name of your project. Look for `PackageReference` nodes, for example:\r\n\r\n``` xml\r\n<Project Sdk=\"Microsoft.NET.Sdk.Web\">\r\n  <PropertyGroup>\r\n    <TargetFramework>net461</TargetFramework>\r\n  </PropertyGroup>\r\n  <ItemGroup>\r\n    <PackageReference Include=\"ThirdParty.NotUpdatedYet\" Version=\"2.0.0\" />\r\n  </ItemGroup>\r\n  <ItemGroup>\r\n    <DotNetCliToolReference Include=\"Microsoft.VisualStudio.Web.CodeGeneration.Tools\" Version=\"2.0.0\" />\r\n  </ItemGroup>\r\n</Project>\r\n```\r\n\r\nFor each of the vulnerable packages your search returned you must add a direct dependency to the updated version by adding it to the `csproj` file. You do this by adding a new line to the dependencies section, referring the fixed version. For example, if your search showed a transitive reference to the vulnerable `Microsoft.AspNetCore.Mvc.Core` version 2.0.0 you would add a reference to the fixed version, 2.0.1.\r\n\r\n``` xml\r\n<Project Sdk=\"Microsoft.NET.Sdk.Web\">\r\n  <PropertyGroup>\r\n    <TargetFramework>net461</TargetFramework>\r\n  </PropertyGroup>\r\n  <ItemGroup>\r\n    <PackageReference Include=\"Microsoft.AspNetCore.Mvc.Core\" Version=\"2.0.1\" />\r\n    <PackageReference Include=\"ThirdParty.NotUpdatedYet\" Version=\"2.0.0\" />\r\n  </ItemGroup>\r\n  <ItemGroup>\r\n    <DotNetCliToolReference Include=\"Microsoft.VisualStudio.Web.CodeGeneration.Tools\" Version=\"2.0.0\" />\r\n  </ItemGroup>\r\n</Project>\r\n```\r\n\r\nAfter you have added the direct dependency reference, save your `csproj` file.\r\n\r\nIf you are using Visual Studio, save your updated `csproj` file and Visual Studio will restore the new package versions. You can see the restore results by opening the Output Window (Ctrl+Alt+O) and changing the Show output from drop-down list to Package Manager.\r\n\r\nIf you are not using Visual Studio, open a command line and change to your project directory. Execute the `dotnet restore` command to restore your new dependencies.\r\n\r\n### Rebuilding your application\r\nFinally rebuild your application, test as you would do normally and redeploy using your favored deployment mechanism.\r\n\r\n## Other Information\r\n### Reporting Security Issues\r\n\r\nIf you have found a potential security issue in .NET Core, please email details to secure@microsoft.com.

(Typically your Program class) If you don't have this method ```WebApplicationTestFixture<TStartup>``` won't be able to initialize your app in the same way it is done on a normal run. You can configure the WebHostBuilder yourself by overriding CreateWebHostBuilder on ```WebApplicationTestFixture<TStartup>```.\r\n\r\n### The test infrastructure needs to know the content root of the application under test\r\nTo set the content root for your app, ```WebApplicationTestFixture<TStartup>``` first locate your solution file ```(.sln)``` and then make a guess about where project might be. The Content Root of the application is defined by convention as ```<<SolutionFolder>>/<<ProjectAssemblyName>>```. For example, based on the folder structure defined below, the content root of the application is defined as ```c:\\work\\MyApp```. This is important because if not set correctly to the root folder of your application under test all views and static files will not be found.\r\n\r\n```\r\nc:/work/\r\n    MyApp.sln\r\n    MyApp/MyApp.csproj\r\n    MyApp.FunctionalTests/MyApp.FunctionalTests.csproj\r\n```\r\n\r\nThe process for determining the folder to use as the content root when running the tests is the following:\r\n* ```WebApplicationTestFixture<TStartup>``` starts on the bin folder of the test project, in the example above ```c:/work/MyApp.FunctionalTests/MyApp.FunctionalTests/bin/<<Configuration>>/<<Framework>>```\r\n* It navigates to the parent folder until it finds a ```.sln``` file.\r\n* It appends ```<<AssemblyName>>``` to the folder in which it found the ```.sln``` file and set that as the content root.\r\n\r\nIf you happen to be using a different convention for the layout of your projects, you can inherit from WebApplicationTestFixture and pass in the relative path from your solution to the application under test when calling the constructor. For example ```\"/src/MyApp\"```\r\n\r\n```csharp\r\npublic class MyAppTestFixture<TStartup> : WebApplicationTestFixture<TStartup> where TStartup : class\r\n{\r\n    public MyAppTestFixture(string solutionRelativePath)\r\n        : base(\"/src/MyApp\") { }\r\n}\r\n```","Url":"https://github.com/aspnet/Announcements/issues/275","RelatedDescription":"Open issue \"Improved end to end testing support for MVC applications\" (#275)"}],"ResultType":"GitHubIssue"},"Twitter":{"ResultType":"TwitterTimeline","Tweets":[{"Id":"1005426223554662400","CreatedAt":"2018-06-09T12:27:46+00:00","UserScreenname":"aspnet","Text":"Tune in today at 10a ET / 7a PT / 14:00 UTC / 8p IST and learn about global tools along with Jeff. https://t.co/J9tTYva6s6","Source":"<a href=\"https://about.twitter.com/products/tweetdeck\" rel=\"nofollow\">TweetDeck</a>","RetweetCount":10,"FavoriteCount":3,"RawContent":null},{"Id":"1004839694465548288","CreatedAt":"2018-06-07T21:37:06+00:00","UserScreenname":"aspnet","Text":"Blazor 0.4.0 experimental release now available https://t.co/bmpsCos7xn","Source":"<a href=\"https://about.twitter.com/products/tweetdeck\" rel=\"nofollow\">TweetDeck</a>","RetweetCount":202,"FavoriteCount":122,"RawContent":null},{"Id":"1004123317446381568","CreatedAt":"2018-06-05T22:10:29+00:00","UserScreenname":"aspnet","Text":"The #ASPNET Community Standup is live now at https://t.co/4Ioo9jNSN2","Source":"<a href=\"https://about.twitter.com/products/tweetdeck\" rel=\"nofollow\">TweetDeck</a>","RetweetCount":14,"FavoriteCount":6,"RawContent":null},{"Id":"1003773072996909056","CreatedAt":"2018-06-04T22:58:44+00:00","UserScreenname":"aspnet","Text":"Join us for the weekly #ASPNET Community Standup Tuesday at 3:00 PM Pacific / 23:00 GMT at https://t.co/4Ioo9jNSN2 https://t.co/56UGvtmJC0","Source":"<a href=\"https://about.twitter.com/products/tweetdeck\" rel=\"nofollow\">TweetDeck</a>","RetweetCount":15,"FavoriteCount":5,"RawContent":null},{"Id":"1001877838369382400","CreatedAt":"2018-05-30T17:27:45+00:00","UserScreenname":"aspnet","Text":"Our latest release is now available.
