This is a feasible and good implementation for reduction of TCP requests as for HTTP 1.x with the HTTP pipeline closed (pipeline for HTTP 1.x is not a good practice as well due to its head-of-line blocking). However, as HTTP/2 becomes available and popular, the large bundled file will be a bottleneck of your product. Therefore, for lower latency of TCP requests in the HTTP/2 scenario, I think a more utility building approach is on demand.\r\n\r\n### What does the proposed API look like?\r\nSorry that I'm not a professional in front-end development (I major in Internet and front-end development is my hobby), thus I could only provide my assumption and suggestion. Here I propose two possibly practical means. \r\nFirst, instead of a bundled file, you could divide the file into several smaller files and set the HTTP head with a sequence number for each of them to guarantee the correct order since the transportation of files with HTTP/2 is actually an \"out-of-order outcome\" structure. Besides, a gzip compression method is also recommended to diminish your bundled file. This way has some shortcomings that the server will be requested to decompress (this is viable) and reorganize (I am not sure whether there is some workable way) the divided files.\r\nSecond, instead of bundling the files, why not have a try just letting the static resources be (of course compression is always necessary)? I think with HTTP/2 and HTTP pipeline now usable things may totally change that bundling itself will become a worse practice.\r\n\r\n<!-- generated by vue-issues.

Use Jest for unit testing.\r\n- Create a `mounted()` lifecycle hook in the HelloWorld.vue component.\r\n- Within `mounted()`, directly manipulate the `msg` prop to cause Vue to generate an error.\r\n- Run the default `example.spec.js` test using `npm run test:unit`.\r\n\r\n### What is expected?\r\nThe test should fail due to the error generated when directly manipulating the `msg` prop.\r\n\r\n### What is actually happening?\r\nVue catches the error and uses `console.error` to display it.  Because `console.error` does not fail Jest tests, the test pass despite the error thrown.\r\n\r\n![bug](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/8070528/48666488-99b49280-ea88-11e8-8fa8-b6d54d3a5136.jpg)\r\n\r\n---\r\nThe underlying problem is that Vue is trying to determine whether it is appropriate to catch and `console.error` an error or allow the error to remain uncaught based on if Vue believes it is in a browser. Unfortunately, because Jest emulates the browser environment, error handling does not function as intended and tests will succeed inappropriately.\r\n\r\nA fix for this would be to also check whether Vue is in a Node environment before catching the error.  This would allow Jest tests to operate as intended, and maintain the behavior of error handling in the browser.\r\n\r\nAnother fix would be to re-throw the error if `process.env.NODE_ENV === \"test\"`.\r\n\r\n<!-- generated by vue-issues.

My issue is that I often have the same method names in each module - ie: `actions: { update() { ... } }`.\r\n\r\nIf I were to map them, I either have to explicitly use the full namespace to describe the alias ie: `this['user/update']() && this['status/update]()`, otherwise one of them will be superseded at runtime.\r\n\r\nBy allowing the module alias feature to be declared within an array,  then multiple methods can be duly created that share the same method names yet be written explicitly unique as when needed within a component, because currently using the map helper only allows for one alias at a time.\r\nUltimately it will allow this: \r\n```\r\nthis.addTodo()\r\nthis.removeTodo()\r\nthis.addUser()\r\nthis.removeUser()\r\n// from the following declaration\r\nmethods: {\r\n    ...mapMutations('todos', [{ addTodo: 'add' }, { removeTodo: 'destroy' }],\r\n    ...mapMutations('users', [{ addUser: 'add' }, { removeUser: 'destroy' }]\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\n### What does the proposed API look like?\r\n```\r\n// currently only this works\r\nmethods: {\r\n    ...mapActions('todos', { addTodo: 'increment' }) // map `this.addTodo()` to `this.$store.commit('increment')`\r\n}\r\n// proposed feature :\r\nmethods: {\r\n    ...mapActions('todos', [{ addTodo: 'increment' }]) // wrap within array so that multiple module methods can be aliased cleanly\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\n<!-- generated by vue-issues.
