In a recent PR of mine, I throw, and this generated a lot of discussion which I'm formalizing here. \r\n\r\nThrowing from the PMUI stack causes our telemetry to document the exception, but our UI continues to operate in an unintended state.\r\n\r\nExample: \r\nI added [ThrowOnError in this commit](https://github.com/NuGet/NuGet.Client/blob/f3581c38ef62b2e4f4a6e299a712c64562147e73/src/NuGet.Clients/NuGet.VisualStudio.Common/WindowFrameHelper.cs#L30).\r\nThe user doesn't see the error message from this exception. In this case, the Window will not open, but it can be re-opened if the user attempts to open it again, but it'll have the original bug my PR was addressing because the SetProperty API failed silently.\r\n\r\nThe balance should be between keeping the UI working as much as possible, while not silencing errors from APIs we rely on. \r\n\r\nUnderstanding our telemetry strategy for discovering failures like this is another good point.\r\n\r\n**Inspired by Discussion from PR Comment:** https://github.com/NuGet/NuGet.Client/pull/3317#discussion_r398864866"}],"ResultType":"GitHubEvent"},"Announcements":{"Events":[{"Id":"11608975127","Type":"IssuesEvent","CreatedAt":"2020-02-25T23:07:38","Actor":"karann-msft","Repository":"NuGet/Announcements","Organization":"NuGet","RawContent":null,"RelatedAction":"opened","RelatedUrl":"https://github.com/NuGet/Announcements/issues/42","RelatedDescription":"Opened issue \"Deprecating TLS 1.0 and 1.1 on NuGet.org – Stage 1\" (#42) at NuGet/Announcements","RelatedBody":"## NuGet.org will temporarily remove support for TLS 1.0/1.1 on February 26, 2020\r\n\r\nWe plan to temporarily remove support for TLS 1.0/1.1 across 3 time slots in a 24 hour period, for 4 hours each, to ensure overlap with normal working hours across the globe.
