However in static typed land, what matters more is what the *result* of that training will be, and in mean-var it is always an affine normalizer, and in CDF (whether log-CDF or not) it is a CDF normalizer. For `onFit` to have a sensible signature I must therefore split it up according to that criteria.\r\n\r\nAlso even though it is not quite efficient now, I feel like exposing the \"guts\" of things might be aided longterm by shifting what we can to use `ImmutableArray<>`.

Write the result\r\n\r\nThis generally results in more performant code, depending on the exact algorithm and number of remaining elements\r\n\r\n-  On handling unpadded parts in AVX intrinsics:\r\n\r\nFor some algorithms (like `Sum`), it is possible to ‚Äúdouble-compute‚Äù a few elements in the beginning and end to have better overall performance. See the following pseudo-code:\r\n```\r\nif addr not aligned\r\n              tmp = unaligned load from addr\r\n              tmp &= mask which zero's elements after the first aligned address\r\n              result = tmp\r\n              move addr forward to the first aligned address \r\n\r\nwhile addr is aligned and remaining bits >= 128\r\n              result += aligned load\r\n              addr += 128-bits\r\n\r\nif any remaining\r\n              addr = endAddr - 128\r\n              tmp = unaligned load from addr\r\n              tmp &= mask which zero's elements already processed\r\n              result += tmp\r\n\r\nSum the elements in result (using \"horizontal add\" or \"shuffle and add\")\r\n```\r\n\r\nSo, your overall algorithm will probably look like:\r\n```\r\nif (Avx.IsSupported && (Length >= AvxLimit))\r\n{\r\n    // Process 256-bits, we have a limit since 256-bit \r\n    // AVX instructions can cause a downclock in the CPU\r\n    // Algorithm would be similar to the SSE pseudo-code\r\n}\r\nelse if (Sse.IsSupported && (Length >= SseLimit))\r\n{\r\n    // Pseudo-code algorithm given above\r\n\r\n    // 128-bit instructions operate at full frequency\r\n    // and don't downclock the CPU, we can only use\r\n    // them for more than 128-bits so we don't AV\r\n}\r\nelse\r\n{\r\n    // Software Implementation\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nIf you can‚Äôt ‚Äúdouble-compute‚Äù for some reason, then you generally do the ‚Äúsoftware‚Äù processing for the beginning (to become aligned) and end (to catch stray elements).\r\n‚Ä¢\t`AvxLimit` is generally a number that takes into account the ‚Äúdownclocking‚Äù that can occur for heavy 256-bit instruction usage\r\n‚Ä¢\t`SseLimit` is generally 128-bits for algorithms where you can ‚Äúdouble-compute‚Äù and some profiled number for other algorithms\r\n\r\n\r\ncc: @tannergooding since he suggested this approach.\r\n","Url":"https://github.com/dotnet/machinelearning/issues/836","RelatedDescription":"Open issue \"CpuMath Enhancement: Double-compute input elements in hardware intrinsics\" (#836)"},{"Id":"357035453","IsPullRequest":false,"CreatedAt":"2018-09-05T01:49:59","Actor":"briancylui","Number":"835","RawContent":null,"Title":"CpuMath Enhancement: Make bound checking of loops in hardware intrinsics more efficient","State":"open","Body":"Style changes needed to solve part of https://github.com/dotnet/machinelearning/issues/823\r\n\r\n## Details\r\n-  In `src\\Microsoft.ML.CpuMath\\SseIntrinsics.cs` and `src\\Microsoft.ML.CpuMath\\AvxIntrinsics.cs`, changing `while (pDstCurrent + 4 <= pDstEnd)` for the loop bound checking into `while (pDstCurrent <= pDstEnd - 4)` to save an instruction (ref: https://github.com/dotnet/machinelearning/pull/668#issuecomment-412121893)\r\n- It may probably be a CoreCLR issue","Url":"https://github.com/dotnet/machinelearning/issues/835","RelatedDescription":"Open issue \"CpuMath Enhancement: Make bound checking of loops in hardware intrinsics more efficient\" (#835)"},{"Id":"357035024","IsPullRequest":false,"CreatedAt":"2018-09-05T01:47:27","Actor":"briancylui","Number":"834","RawContent":null,"Title":"CpuMath Enhancement: Add unit tests for software fallbacks of hardware intrinsics","State":"open","Body":"Style changes needed to solve part of https://github.com/dotnet/machinelearning/issues/823\r\n\r\n## Details\r\n-  Add unit tests for software fallback implementations, particularly for `MatTimesSrc`.\r\n\r\nReference:\r\n- The software fallback implementations are in `src\\Microsoft.ML.CpuMath\\CpuMathUtils.netcoreapp.cs`, encapsulated in the following switching paradigm:\r\n``` log\r\nif (Avx.IsSupported)\r\n{\r\n    // AvxIntrinsics\r\n}\r\nelse if (Sse.IsSupported)\r\n{\r\n    // SseIntrinsics\r\n}\r\nelse\r\n{\r\n    // Software fallback\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\n- Unit tests are implemented in `test\\Microsoft.ML.CpuMath.UnitTests.netcoreapp/UnitTests.cs`\r\n- To turn on the software fallback implementation in unit tests, you may have to turn off the environment variable `COMPlus_FeatureSimd`.\r\n","Url":"https://github.com/dotnet/machinelearning/issues/834","RelatedDescription":"Open issue \"CpuMath Enhancement: Add unit tests for software fallbacks of hardware intrinsics\" (#834)"},{"Id":"357034000","IsPullRequest":false,"CreatedAt":"2018-09-05T01:41:19","Actor":"briancylui","Number":"833","RawContent":null,"Title":"CpuMath Enhancement: Optimize codegen of inlining in hardware intrinsics APIs","State":"open","Body":"Style changes needed to solve part of https://github.com/dotnet/machinelearning/issues/823\r\n\r\n## Details\r\n-  (from Intel partners) In the original code of `src\\Microsoft.ML.CpuMath\\SseIntrinsics.cs`, even though `VectorSum` is inlined, the codegen is not optimized due to register spill and reload.
