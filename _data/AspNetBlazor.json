Let me try and explain what I'm trying to do. \r\n\r\n**In the Vue world**\r\nTypically I would have the following components: \r\n\r\n- **App** (the main component page with a ```router-view```)\r\n- - **List** (a component with a list of items and a  ```router-view```)\r\n- - - **Create** (a component with the create details on)\r\n\r\nThis means I could deep link into the create page i.e.\r\n\r\n- root.com/items (The list of items)\r\n- root.com/items/create (This list of items with the create dialog visible)\r\n\r\nNavigating between the two pages would simply show / hide the create section\r\n\r\ne.g. **root.com/items**\r\n```\r\n-------------------------\r\n| Item A | Create | Edit | \r\n| Item B | Create | Edit | \r\n| Item B | Create | Edit | \r\n-------------------------\r\n```\r\ne.g. **root.com/items/create**\r\n```\r\n-------------------------\r\n|                        |\r\n| Name:     ======       |\r\n| Type:      ======      |\r\n|                        |\r\n| Item A | Create | Edit | \r\n| Item B | Create | Edit | \r\n| Item B | Create | Edit | \r\n-------------------------\r\n```\r\n\r\n**In the Blazor world**\r\n\r\nI tried the same in Blazor. The only way to achieve the nested routing was to have the following: \r\n\r\n- MainLayout (inherits from BlazorLayoutComponent)\r\n- - List Page (Has a page directive with the url \"/\" and inherits from BlazorLayoutComponent)\r\n- - - Create Page (Has a page directive with the url \"/create\")\r\n\r\nI have a link on each page linking between them i.e. ```list``` -> ```new``` and ```new``` -> ```list```. \r\n\r\n**The bug**\r\n\r\nWhen I go from the ```list``` page to the ```new``` page, the control shows and everything is fine, however when I navigate back, the UI does not update. The URL does update, just not the UI.\r\n\r\nIs this type of nested routing supported in Blazor? Is it a future consideration? The multi-level child routing in Vue is pretty cool and would be good to see some of this in Blazor ðŸ˜„ \r\n\r\nThanks and shout if it's not clear. \r\nG\r\n","Url":"https://github.com/aspnet/Blazor/issues/1145","RelatedDescription":"Open issue \"Redirecting between pages (parent> child) but UI is not updating\" (#1145)"},{"Id":"341998941","IsPullRequest":false,"CreatedAt":"2018-07-17T16:47:16","Actor":"Stuart88","Number":"1144","RawContent":null,"Title":"Blank page when running preview app","State":"closed","Body":"Downloaded the latest Blazor Language Services from [here](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=aspnet.blazor) and have gone through the official guide for getting things going.\r\n\r\nThe example app, upon starting a new asp.net blazor project, just shows 'Loading...' in the top left corner, then eventually ends with a white screen.\r\n\r\nThis happens in Firefox and IE, both on the latest versions.\r\n\r\nHelp!\r\n\r\nCheers.","Url":"https://github.com/aspnet/Blazor/issues/1144","RelatedDescription":"Closed issue \"Blank page when running preview app\" (#1144)"},{"Id":"341813701","IsPullRequest":false,"CreatedAt":"2018-07-17T14:52:07","Actor":"Daendel","Number":"1143","RawContent":null,"Title":"Cannot call a method without parameters from JavaScript to C#","State":"closed","Body":"When I try to call a method without parameters:\r\n\r\n```\r\nvar method = Blazor.platform.findMethod(\"TransactionTypeCreator.Client\",\r\n                \"TransactionTypeCreator.Client.Services\",\r\n                \"AppState\",\r\n                \"UploadInput\");\r\n\r\nBlazor.platform.callMethod(method, null, null);\r\n```\r\n\r\nI get an error in MonoPlatform.ts (line 51): \r\n`if (args.length > 4) {     <- Uncaught TypeError: Cannot read property 'length' of null`\r\n\r\nWhy do I need to pass parameters?","Url":"https://github.com/aspnet/Blazor/issues/1143","RelatedDescription":"Closed issue \"Cannot call a method without parameters from JavaScript to C#\" (#1143)"},{"Id":"341798341","IsPullRequest":false,"CreatedAt":"2018-07-17T07:30:52","Actor":"MarekPokornyOva","Number":"1142","RawContent":null,"Title":"Idea: Startup argument","State":"open","Body":"Hi,\r\nI was experimenting with hosting Blazor (version 0.4) on a page - to integrate with a CMS single pages (server side driven routing) instead on SPA as is supposed Blazor setup.\r\n\r\n**Changes:**\r\nblazor.js\r\n```\r\n\tline 344: var allScriptElems, thisScriptElem, ..., ex_1, bootArgs;\r\n\tline 366: bootArgs = thisScriptElem.getAttribute('args');\r\n\tline 378: Environment_1.platform.callEntryPoint(entryPointAssemblyName, entryPointMethod, [Environment_1.platform.toDotNetString(bootArgs)]);\r\n\r\n```\r\nProgram.cs (in client project)\r\n```\r\nstatic void MainWithArgs(string args)\r\n{\r\n\tvar serviceProvider = new BrowserServiceProvider(services =>\r\n\t{\r\n\t\t// Add any custom services here\r\n\t});\r\n\r\n\tstring[] args2 = ParseArgs(args);\r\n\tnew BrowserRenderer(serviceProvider).AddComponent(Type.GetType(args2[0]), args2[1]);\r\n}\r\n\r\n```\r\nUsage example in MVC razor view (server side project):\r\n`<script src=\"_framework/blazor.js\" main=\"MvcSite01.Client.dll\" entrypoint=\"MvcSite01.Client.Program::MainWithArgs\" args='/component:\"MvcSite01.Client.Pages.@(Model.ClientScript), MvcSite01.Client\" /element:\"app\"' references=\"MvcSite01.Shared.dll,Microsoft.AspNetCore.Blazor.Browser.dll,Microsoft.AspNetCore.Blazor.dll,Microsoft.Extensions.DependencyInjection.Abstractions.dll,Microsoft.Extensions.DependencyInjection.dll,mscorlib.dll,netstandard.dll,System.Core.dll,System.dll,System.Net.Http.dll\" linker-enabled=\"true\"></script>\r\n`\r\n\r\nThe startup argument was useful to drive inserted component during the experiment but it can be used any way a developer like, of course.","Url":"https://github.com/aspnet/Blazor/issues/1142","RelatedDescription":"Open issue \"Idea: Startup argument\" (#1142)"},{"Id":"341735673","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2018-07-17T05:43:30","Actor":"WaiChungK","Number":"1141","RawContent":null,"Title":"Update README.md","State":"closed","Body":"Hello, this is my first time contributing to an open source project.

This strategies are different but I think this one is interesting not only for my project.\r\n\r\nI am using **canvas** and manipulating it via js interop, it means I do heavy operations with interop, many calls, passing parameters, maintain large code etc.\r\n\r\nLet's imagine I have **30 js registered function** (draw line, rect, arc etc) and mixing them (as will be required from projects logic) and let's say I **100 times** call, pass parameters, receive results from/to js. And it is repeating on every redraw (one second or less interval for smooth clock)!\r\n\r\nThis 30 js functions are like underlying level to access html5 canvas, it can be also referenced nuget package.\r\n\r\nAll this actions: call, passing params, return results have **time cost** and **probably is one reason for slow performance**.\r\n\r\nSo this question popups logically - can we reduce calls amount? For example collect all js functions and **call one time all this commands**.\r\n\r\nI think it is possible, because js allows us (with many ways) to **evalute code** (execute string containing js script).\r\n\r\nSo I can use string builder, collect all necessary js logic and call it one time. Please note that in most case **I don't need results from js**, if I need only to pass in another js function.\r\n\r\nAs I mentioned there is **many ways** to execute dynamic js scripts, first option is **evil()** function but I don't want now to go in details with way is better.\r\nI did **small research** and there can be found optimal way to do this (technique not matters for now).\r\nThere are security, debuging, preformance issues but let's forget about them for now.\r\n\r\nI try to **model theoretical structure** to improve js interop, it to become more dynamic and interoperable. Because as it seems we can't escape from js for next months/years and we need to find ways to use it in efficient way.\r\n\r\nWe can make parallel to **sql queries**, where we can build any query and then server will execute it.\r\n\r\nOk, I think it sounds good, less js functions, less calls, more flexibility and custom approach.\r\nNo one denies me to do it myself, maybe not perfectly but to try :)\r\n\r\n**Why I open this issue?**\r\n First I want to hear what people think about this;\r\n Second I think this improvement  (if it has sense) not should do all developers separately, we can say that someone will implement it and share as nuget package, but I think it's better to do blazor itself because we expect **more competentive people** in blazor team, **built-in feature** will be better and community always can contribute any improvement.\r\n\r\nI will be happy if you think about this and measure does it have perspective or not, is this no sense or **real way for some improvement**.\r\n\r\nHope text is understandable, for now it is **only theoretical** but if there will be interes or I will do it myself I will share my code and results about performance.\r\n\r\nThank you, **waiting for your activity** :)\r\n\r\nI know there are many open issues and many things to think and to do, but IMHO this issue can be useful too.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n","Url":"https://github.com/aspnet/Blazor/issues/1134","RelatedDescription":"Closed issue \"Improve js interop with dynamic content execution\" (#1134)"},{"Id":"341280865","IsPullRequest":false,"CreatedAt":"2018-07-16T13:02:43","Actor":"danroth27","Number":"1136","RawContent":null,"Title":"Minify blazor.server.js","State":"closed","Body":"","Url":"https://github.com/aspnet/Blazor/issues/1136","RelatedDescription":"Closed issue \"Minify blazor.server.js\" (#1136)"},{"Id":"341484363","IsPullRequest":false,"CreatedAt":"2018-07-16T12:10:43","Actor":"uwbwsvd","Number":"1137","RawContent":null,"Title":"empty sreen","State":"closed","Body":"At first I'm not very familiar with all these things but interested.\r\nI tried this:\r\nhttps://blazor.net/docs/get-started.html\r\nAt Point 4 the browser opened: Loading ...
