Open Console\r\n2. Click \"Foo\"\r\n3. Console reads \"Async loading component\" and we see \"Hello Foo\"\r\n4. Click \"Bar\"\r\n5. We still still see \"Hello Foo\", but not console output\r\n\r\nThe steps can be reproduced by clicking \"Bar\" first with similar results\r\n\r\n### What is expected?\r\nI should see \"Hello Bar\" and another console output reading \"Async loading component\"\r\n\r\n### What is actually happening?\r\nThe first async component that gets loaded gets loaded all the time for that route going forward. \r\n\r\nThe component function is only called one time\r\n\r\n<!-- generated by vue-issues.
