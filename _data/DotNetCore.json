This advisory also provides guidance on what developers can do to update their applications to remove this vulnerability.\r\n\r\nMicrosoft is aware of a security feature bypass vulnerability that exists when .NET Core when HTTP authentication information is inadvertently exposed in an outbound request that encounters an HTTP redirect. An attacker who successfully exploited this vulnerability could use the information to further compromise the web application.\r\n\r\nThe update addresses the vulnerability by correcting how .NET Core applications handles HTTP redirects.\r\n\r\nSystem administrators running .NET Core 1.0 or .NET Core 1.1 applications must update their .NET Core runtimes to versions 1.0.13 and 1.1.10 then restart their applications. If installed applications target .NET Core 2.0, the applications must be migrated to 2.1 or newer and redeployed.\r\n\r\nDevelopers must update their .NET Core SDK to versions 1.1.11 and migrate any [.NET Core 2.0](https://docs.microsoft.com/dotnet/core/migration/20-21) or [ASP.NET Core 2.0](https://docs.microsoft.com/aspnet/core/migration/20_21?view=aspnetcore-2.1) applications to 2.1 then redeploy.\r\n\r\n## Discussion\r\n\r\nDiscussion for this issue can be found at <https://github.com/dotnet/corefx/> **TBD**\r\n\r\n### <a name=\"mitigation-factors\"></a>Mitigation factors\r\n\r\nNone\r\n\r\n## <a name=\"affected-software\"></a>Affected software\r\n\r\nAny .NET Core application that runs on a .NET Core 1.0.x runtime with a version number of 1.0.12 or lower, or a .NET Core application that runs on a .NET Core 1.1.x runtime with a version number of 1.1.9 or lower, or a .NET Core application that runs on a .NET Core 2.0.x runtime.\r\n\r\nAdditionally package authors should check their dependencies to ensure they aren't depending on a vulnerable version of the following package:\r\n\r\n<a name=\"package-list\"></a>Package name | Vulnerable versions | Secure versions\r\n------------ | ---------------- | -------------------------\r\nSystem.Net.Http| 2.0.20126.16343, 2.0.20505, 2.0.20710, 4.0.0, 4.1.0, 4.1.1, 4.1.2, 4.3.0, 4.3.1, 4.3.2, 4.3.3 |  4.3.4 or later\r\n\r\n## <a name=\"advisory-faq\"></a>Advisory FAQ\r\n\r\n### <a name=\"how-affected\"></a>How do I know if I am affected?\r\n\r\nAny .NET Core application that runs on a .NET Core 1.0.x runtime with a version number of 1.0.12 or lower, or a .NET Core application that runs on a .NET Core 1.1.x runtime with a version number of 1.1.9 or lower, or a .NET Core application that runs on a .NET Core 2.0.x runtime.\r\n\r\nTo check the currently installed runtimes and SDKs with version 2.1 or later of .NET Core, open a command prompt and run the `dotnet --info` command. You should see an output similar to the following:\r\n\r\n```\r\n.NET Core SDK (reflecting any global.json):\r\n Version:   2.1.403\r\n Commit:    04e15494b6\r\n\r\nRuntime Environment:\r\n OS Name:     Windows\r\n OS Version:  10.0.17763\r\n OS Platform: Windows\r\n RID:         win10-x64\r\n Base Path:   C:\\Program Files\\dotnet\\sdk\\2.1.403\\\r\n\r\nHost (useful for support):\r\n  Version: 2.1.5\r\n  Commit:  290303f510\r\n\r\n.NET Core SDKs installed:\r\n  1.0.4 [C:\\Program Files\\dotnet\\sdk]\r\n  1.1.10 [C:\\Program Files\\dotnet\\sdk]\r\n  2.0.3 [C:\\Program Files\\dotnet\\sdk]\r\n  2.1.4 [C:\\Program Files\\dotnet\\sdk]\r\n\r\n.NET Core runtimes installed:\r\n  Microsoft.AspNetCore.All 2.1.4 [C:\\Program Files\\dotnet\\shared\\Microsoft.AspNetCore.All]\r\n  Microsoft.AspNetCore.App 2.1.4 [C:\\Program Files\\dotnet\\shared\\Microsoft.AspNetCore.App]\r\n  Microsoft.NETCore.App 1.0.12 [C:\\Program Files\\dotnet\\shared\\Microsoft.NETCore.App]\r\n  Microsoft.NETCore.App 1.1.9 [C:\\Program Files\\dotnet\\shared\\Microsoft.NETCore.App]\r\n  Microsoft.NETCore.App 2.0.9 [C:\\Program Files\\dotnet\\shared\\Microsoft.NETCore.App]\r\n  Microsoft.NETCore.App 2.1.5 [C:\\Program Files\\dotnet\\shared\\Microsoft.NETCore.App]\r\n\r\nTo install additional .NET Core runtimes or SDKs:\r\n  https://aka.ms/dotnet-download\r\n```\r\n\r\nIf you don't see a runtime entry for 1.0.13 or 1.1.10, any .NET Core 1.x applications run on that computer are vulnerable.\r\n\r\nIf you don't have a 2.1 version of the runtime or SDK installed, you can produce the complete list of runtimes by performing a directory listing in the install root directories. The default root directories are listed in the following table:\r\n\r\n| Operating System | Location |\r\n|------------------|----------|\r\n| Windows | `C:\\Program Files\\dotnet\\shared\\Microsoft.NETCore.App\\` |\r\n| macOS | `/usr/local/share/dotnet/shared/Microsoft.NETCore.App/` |\r\n| Supported Linux platforms | `/usr/share/dotnet/shared/Microsoft.NETCore.App/` |\r\n\r\nEach runtime version is installed in its own directory, where the directory name is the version number. If you don't have a directory for 1.0.13, 1.1.10 then any application targeting versions 1.0 or 1.1 are vulnerable.\r\n\r\nAdditionally, if you've deployed [self-contained applications](https://docs.microsoft.com/dotnet/core/deploying/#self-contained-deployments-scd) targeting any of the impacted versions, these applications are also vulnerable and must be recompiled and redeployed.\r\n\r\n### <a name=\"fix-runtime\">How do I fix the vulnerability?\r\n\r\nSystem administrators are advised to update their .NET Core runtimes to versions 1.0.13, 1.1.10 and install the latest 2.1 runtime, ensuring that any 2.0 applications are migrated to 2.1 as soon as possible.\r\n\r\n Developers are advised to update their .NET Core SDK to versions 1.1.11 and migrate any [.NET Core](https://docs.microsoft.com/dotnet/core/migration/20-21) or [ASP.NET Core 2.0](https://docs.microsoft.com/aspnet/core/migration/20_21?view=aspnetcore-2.1) applications to 2.1 and redeploy.\r\n\r\n## Other Information\r\n\r\n### Reporting Security Issues\r\n\r\nIf you have found a potential security issue in .NET Core, please email details to secure@microsoft.com. Reports may qualify for the .NET Core Bug Bounty. Details of the .NET Core Bug Bounty including terms and conditions are at [https://aka.ms/corebounty](https://aka.ms/corebounty).\r\n\r\n### Support\r\n\r\nYou can ask questions about this issue on GitHub in the .NET Core or ASP.NET Core organizations.

This includes an updated .NET 4.8 runtime as well as the .NET 4.8 Developer Pack (a a single package that bundles the .NET Framework 4.8 runtime, the .NET 4.8 Targeting Pack, and the .NET Framework 4.8 SDK). \r\n\r\nPlease help us ensure this is a high quality and compatible release by trying out this build and exploring the new features. \r\n\r\n**Next steps:**\r\nTo explore the new features, download the [.NET 4.8 Developer Pack build 3646](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkId=2018486).  Instead, if you want to try just the .NET 4.8 runtime, you can download either of these:\r\n•\t[.NET 4.8 Web Installer](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkId=2018525) - requires an internet connection during installation \r\n•\t[.NET 4.8 Offline installer](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkId=2018531) - can be downloaded and installed later in a disconnected state\r\n\r\nPlease provide your feedback by [reporting an issue at the .NET Framework Early Access GitHub repository](https://github.com/Microsoft/dotnet-framework-early-access/issues/new).\r\n\r\n**Note**: this release is still under development, you can expect to see more features and fixes in future preview builds. Also, a reminder that this build is not supported for production use.\r\n\r\nThis preview build 3646 includes improvements/fixes in the following areas:\r\n•\t**[Runtime]** JIT and NGEN improvements\r\n•\t**[Windows Forms]** Accessibility enhancements\r\n•\t**[WPF]** SelectionTextBrush Property\r\n•\t**[BCL]** Updated ZLib\r\n\r\nYou can see the complete list of improvements in this build [here](https://github.com/Microsoft/dotnet-framework-early-access/blob/master/release-notes/NET48/build-3646/changes.md).\r\n\r\n.NET Framework build 3646 is also included in the next update for Windows 10.
