Presently, I think this can be achieved by Manual Asset Injection (https://ssr.vuejs.org/guide/build-config.html#client-config) but if the only thing a user wants to control is which bundle gets injected in a multi-compiler Webpack setup, then this creates A LOT of extra work for them as they try to duplicate all the things that vue-server-renderer would do for them by default.\r\n\r\nMy specific use case is that I'm generating a JS bundle for each language that we want our application to support using i18n-webpack-plugin. When using vue-server-renderer, the last language bundle generated is automatically injected. This feature would allow me to instead add logic to `createContext` that looks at a request's locale header, generates a filter function based on that header, and uses that filter function to assure that a matching (or a default) bundle is injected in the returned page.\r\n\r\n### What does the proposed API look like?\r\nAdding this variable to the `renderScripts` method:\r\n```js\r\nconst jsFilter = context.jsFilter || (({ file }) => isJS(file))\r\n```\r\nAnd passing `jsFilter` to the filter calls in that method instead of the default, `({ file }) => isJS(file)`.\r\n\r\n<!-- generated by vue-issues.
