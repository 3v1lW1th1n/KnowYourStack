The problem is these inputs may not be ready at the component instantiate time. To guard this scenario, the component author usually needs to provide some default values to these inputs, so the null/undefined inputs field won't break your component. But not every input type has an obvious default. For example, an object input will require to write a long object literal or your need to add a bunch of safe operator ?. in your template. A function as an input is another example.\r\n\r\n### Describe the solution you'd like\r\n<!-- ✍️--> If you have a solution in mind, please describe it.\r\nIf we can have a decorator, say @Required and use it like:\r\n`export class SomeComponent {\r\n  @Required @Input requiredProperty;\r\n}`\r\n\r\nand usage of the component:\r\n`<some-component [requiredProperty]=\"asyncData\"></some-component>`\r\nwill be equivalent to\r\n`<some-component *ngIf=\"requiredProperty\" [requiredProperty]=\"asyncData\"></some-component>`\r\n\r\nI believe there are many benefits if we have this capability:\r\n\r\n- It specifies a clear contract what component author expects component users to provide.\r\n- Component author no longer needs to worry the inputs are in inconsistent state while waiting they arrive.\r\n- It relieve the component users the burdens to write those *ngIf check. Image if a component has 4 or more required inputs.\r\n- The component users may even get a compiler warning/error when they forget to bind some required inputs.\r\n\r\nAm I too naive?

`@angular-devkit/schematics` as a dependency in a custom CLI. I observed that when a `NodePackageInstallTask` is used within a `NodeWorkflow` where the root directory has not been provided, the working directory in `new NodePackageInstallTask(\"/path/to/directory\")` is not resolved correctly and ends up with a `ENOENT` error.\r\n\r\nIt seems to be related to the `NodeWorkflow` class: \r\n- In the constructor, [the `root` parameter is optional](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli/blob/master/packages/angular_devkit/schematics/tools/workflow/node-workflow.ts#L25) \r\n- then there is [this fallback](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli/blob/master/packages/angular_devkit/schematics/tools/workflow/node-workflow.ts#L45) returning undefined.\r\n- the node package executor fallbacks on [`process.cwd()`](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli/blob/master/packages/angular_devkit/schematics/tasks/node-package/executor.ts#L60) as root directory which is [then prepended to the working directory](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli/blob/master/packages/angular_devkit/schematics/tasks/node-package/executor.ts#L78).\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n## 🔬 Minimal Reproduction\r\n```\r\nimport { NodeJsSyncHost } from '@angular-devkit/core/node';\r\nimport { NodeWorkflow } from '@angular-devkit/schematics/tools';\r\n\r\n\r\nconst fsHost = new virtualFs.ScopedHost(new NodeJsSyncHost());\r\nconst workflow = new NodeWorkflow(fsHost, { dryRun:false });\r\n\r\n// schematics\r\nfunction schematics(){\r\n  return (host: Tree, context: SchematicContext) => {\r\n    const projectPath= \"/home/path/to/project\"\r\n    const templateSource = apply(url(templatePath), [move(projectPath)]);\r\n    context.addTask(new NodePackageInstallTask(projectPath));\r\n    return chain([branchAndMerge(mergeWith(templateSource))])(host, context);\r\n  }\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\n## 🔥 Exception or Error\r\n<pre><code>\r\nevents.js:167\r\n      throw er; // Unhandled 'error' event\r\n      ^\r\n\r\nError: spawn /bin/sh ENOENT\r\n    at Process.ChildProcess._handle.onexit (internal/child_process.js:229:19)\r\n    at onErrorNT (internal/child_process.js:406:16)\r\n    at process._tickCallback (internal/process/next_tick.js:63:19)\r\n    at Function.Module.runMain (internal/modules/cjs/loader.js:745:11)\r\n    at startup (internal/bootstrap/node.js:236:19)\r\n    at bootstrapNodeJSCore (internal/bootstrap/node.js:560:3)\r\nEmitted 'error' event at:\r\n    at Process.ChildProcess._handle.onexit (internal/child_process.js:235:12)\r\n    at onErrorNT (internal/child_process.js:406:16)\r\n    [... lines matching original stack trace ...]\r\n    at bootstrapNodeJSCore (internal/bootstrap/node.js:560:3)\r\n</code></pre>\r\n\r\n\r\n## 🌍 Your Environment\r\n<pre><code>\r\n \"@angular-devkit/core\": \"^7.3.0-rc.0\",\r\n \"@angular-devkit/schematics\": \"^7.3.0-rc.0\",\r\n  node: 10.6.0\r\n</code></pre>\r\n","Url":"https://github.com/angular/angular-cli/issues/13526","RelatedDescription":"Open issue \"NodePackageInstallTask does not resolve absolute paths\" (#13526)"},{"Id":"402749920","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2019-01-26T05:41:21","Actor":"cexbrayat","Number":"13514","RawContent":null,"Title":"docs: remove non existing format command","State":"closed","Body":"This dc page has been mentionning clang format for a long time but this is not available out of the box.","Url":"https://github.com/angular/angular-cli/pull/13514","RelatedDescription":"Closed or merged PR \"docs: remove non existing format command\" (#13514)"},{"Id":"403027069","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2019-01-26T05:20:32","Actor":"renovate-bot","Number":"13520","RawContent":null,"Title":"build: update pacote to version 9.4.1","State":"closed","Body":"This PR contains the following updates:\n\n| Package | Type | Update | Change | References |\n|---|---|---|---|---|\n| pacote | dependencies | patch | `9.4.0` -> `9.4.1` | [source](https://togithub.com/zkat/pacote) |\n\n---\n\n### Release Notes\n\n<details>\n<summary>zkat/pacote</summary>\n\n### [`v9.4.1`](https://togithub.com/zkat/pacote/blob/master/CHANGELOG.md#&#8203;941httpsgithubcomzkatpacotecomparev940v941-2019-01-24)\n\n[Compare Source](https://togithub.com/zkat/pacote/compare/v9.4.0...v9.4.1)\n\n##### Bug Fixes\n\n-   **directory, finalize-manifest:** strip byte order marker from JSON ([723ad63](https://togithub.com/zkat/pacote/commit/723ad63))\n\n</details>\n\n---\n\n### Renovate configuration\n\n:date: **Schedule**: \"after 10pm every weekday,before 4am every weekday,every weekend\" in timezone America/Tijuana.\n\n:vertical_traffic_light: **Automerge**: Disabled by config.

I traced the bug and narrowed it down to the following function:\r\n\r\n```\r\n  init(): Promise<boolean> {\r\n        return new Promise<boolean>((resolve, reject) => {\r\n            this._sessionService.getCurrentLoginInformations().toPromise().then((result: GetCurrentLoginInformationsOutput) => {\r\n                this._application = result.application;\r\n                this._user = result.user;\r\n                this._tenant = result.tenant;\r\n                resolve(true);\r\n            }, (err) => {\r\n                reject(err);\r\n            });\r\n        });\r\n    }\r\n```\r\nThe issue is that in IE nothing is getting populated for neither of the result variable properties. but again all is good when running it in Chrome! \r\nDo I need to refactor the above code some how to make it digestible for IE?\r\n\r\nNote: In the error below the 'version' is a property for the 'application' property of the 'GetCurrentLoginInformationsOutput'\r\n\r\nNot quite sure if it relevants but I also get the following prompt in IE console:\r\n\r\n> Could not locate webpack:///(webpack)-dev-server/client* specified in source map \r\n\r\n## 🔥 Exception or Error\r\n<pre><code>\r\n<!-- If the issue is accompanied by an exception or an error, please share it below: -->\r\n[object Error]: {description: \"Uncaught (in promise): TypeError: Unable to get property 'version' of undefined or null reference TypeError: Unable to get property 'version' of undefined or null reference at AccountComponent (eval code:31:9) at createClass (eval code:12653:13) at createDirectiveInstance (eval code:12496:5) at createViewNodes (eval code:13954:21) at createRootView (eval code:13843:5) at callWithDebugContext (eval code:15268:9) at debugCreateRootView (eval code:14551:5) at ComponentFactory_.prototype.create (eval code:11448:9) at ComponentFactoryBoundToModule.prototype.create (eval code:4235:9) at ViewContainerRef_.prototype.createComponent (eval code:11645:9)\", message: \"Uncaught (in promise): TypeError: Unable to get property 'version' of undefined or null reference TypeError: Unable to get property 'version' of undefined or null reference at AccountComponent (eval code:31:9) at createClass (eval code:12653:13) at createDirectiveInstance (eval code:12496:5) at createViewNodes (eval code:13954:21) at createRootView (eval code:13843:5) at callWithDebugContext (eval code:15268:9) at debugCreateRootView (eval code:14551:5) at ComponentFactory_.prototype.create (eval code:11448:9) at ComponentFactoryBoundToModule.prototype.create (eval code:4235:9) at ViewContainerRef_.prototype.createComponent (eval code:11645:9)\", promise: Object, rejection: Object, stack: \"Error: Uncaught (in promise): TypeError: Unable to get property 'version' of undefined or null reference TypeError: Unable to get property 'version' of undefined or null reference at AccountComponent (eval code:31:9) at createClass (eval code:12653:13) at createDirectiveInstance (eval code:12496:5) at createViewNodes (eval code:13954:21) at createRootView (eval code:13843:5) at callWithDebugContext (eval code:15268:9) at debugCreateRootView (eval code:14551:5) at ComponentFactory_.prototype.create (eval code:11448:9) at ComponentFactoryBoundToModule.prototype.create (eval code:4235:9) at ViewContainerRef_.prototype.createComponent (eval code:11645:9) at resolvePromise (eval code:824:25) at resolvePromise (eval code:795:17) at Anonymous function (eval code:873:17) at ZoneDelegate.prototype.invokeTask (eval code:423:13) at onInvokeTask (eval code:4952:17) at ZoneDelegate.prototype.invokeTask (eval code:423:13) at Zone.prototype.runTask (eval code:192:21) at drainMicroTaskQueue (eval code:602:25) at ZoneTask.invokeTask (eval code:503:21) at invokeTask (eval code:1540:9)\"...}\r\n\r\ndescription: \"Uncaught (in promise): TypeError: Unable to get property 'version' of undefined or null reference TypeError: Unable to get property 'version' of undefined or null reference at AccountComponent (eval code:31:9) at createClass (eval code:12653:13) at createDirectiveInstance (eval code:12496:5) at createViewNodes (eval code:13954:21) at createRootView (eval code:13843:5) at callWithDebugContext (eval code:15268:9) at debugCreateRootView (eval code:14551:5) at ComponentFactory_.prototype.create (eval code:11448:9) at ComponentFactoryBoundToModule.prototype.create (eval code:4235:9) at ViewContainerRef_.prototype.createComponent (eval code:11645:9)\"\r\nmessage: \"Uncaught (in promise): TypeError: Unable to get property 'version' of undefined or null reference TypeError: Unable to get property 'version' of undefined or null reference at AccountComponent (eval code:31:9) at createClass (eval code:12653:13) at createDirectiveInstance (eval code:12496:5) at createViewNodes (eval code:13954:21) at createRootView (eval code:13843:5) at callWithDebugContext (eval code:15268:9) at debugCreateRootView (eval code:14551:5) at ComponentFactory_.prototype.create (eval code:11448:9) at ComponentFactoryBoundToModule.prototype.create (eval code:4235:9) at ViewContainerRef_.prototype.createComponent (eval code:11645:9)\"\r\n\r\n\r\n</code></pre>\r\n\r\n\r\n## 🌍 Your Environment\r\n<pre><code>\r\n<!-- run `ng version` and paste output below -->\r\n<!-- ✍️-->\r\n\r\n</code></pre>\r\n\r\n**Anything else relevant?**\r\n<!-- ✍️Is this a browser specific issue?
