It seems that with Bazel 1.0.0 setting `--incompatible_list_based_execution_strategy_selection=false` no longer works around the issue with npm_package that it did when it was added. The error that was originally observed has returned after updating to Bazel 1.0.0:\r\n\r\n```\r\nERROR: /home/circleci/ng/packages/angular_devkit/build_optimizer/BUILD:66:1: Assembling npm package packages/angular_devkit/build_optimizer/npm_package failed: No usable spawn strategy found for spawn with mnemonic Action.

You need to manually enable it to prove that you understand the limits of polyfill.\n\nIn previous versions you can enable Grid polyfill by `grid: 'autoplace'` option or by `/* autoprefixer grid: autoplace */` control comment. But in some cases, developers were not able to use both methods. For instance, during [work with Material UI’ CSS-in-JS in Create React App](https://togithub.com/postcss/autoprefixer/issues/1257).\n\nNow Autoprefixer supports environment variable to enable CSS Grid polyfill:\n\n```sh\nAUTOPREFIXER_GRID=autoplace npm build\n```\n\n#### Performance Improvements\n\n[@&#8203;Knagis](https://togithub.com/Knagis) [found](https://togithub.com/postcss/autoprefixer/issues/1256) that Browserslist takes 70% of the Autoprefixer time.\n\n![Autoprefixer 9.6.5 profiling](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/19343/67489064-e0a10400-f6ab-11e9-895b-1507608e2446.png)\n\nWe did a lot of improvements in Browserslist and now Autoprefixer should work much faster.\n\n![67417985-a283e180-f5d2-11e9-879a-e364c9acccf1](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/19343/67489142-01695980-f6ac-11e9-96a2-c2cc169b6767.png)\n\n#### Other\n\n-   Fix [`Cannot read property 'grid' of undefined`](https://togithub.com/postcss/autoprefixer/issues/1244) error\n\n</details>\n\n---\n\n### Renovate configuration\n\n:date: **Schedule**: \"after 10pm every weekday,before 4am every weekday,every weekend\" in timezone America/Tijuana.\n\n:vertical_traffic_light: **Automerge**: Disabled by config.

g c test1\r\n```\r\n\r\nAdd route config in `src/app/app-routing.module.ts` just like below:\r\n\r\n```ts\r\nconst route1 = { path: 'test1', component: Test1Component };\r\nconst routes: Routes = [\r\n  route1\r\n];\r\n```\r\n\r\nThen I creating an lazy-loaded module named `test`.\r\n\r\n```sh\r\nng g module test --route test --module app\r\n```\r\n\r\nThen the route config will turn into this. And this is wrong.\r\n\r\n```ts\r\nconst route1 = { path: 'test1', component: Test1Component };\r\nconst routes: Routes = [,\r\n  { path: 'test', loadChildren: () => import('./test/test.module').then(m => m.TestModule) }\r\n  route1\r\n];\r\n```\r\n\r\n## 🔥 Exception or Error\r\n<pre><code>\r\nERROR in Cannot read property 'loadChildren' of undefined\r\n</code></pre>\r\n\r\n\r\n## 🌍 Your Environment\r\n<pre><code>\r\nAngular CLI: 8.3.13\r\nNode: 10.16.3\r\nOS: win32 x64\r\nAngular: 8.2.11\r\n... animations, common, compiler, compiler-cli, core, forms\r\n... language-service, platform-browser, platform-browser-dynamic\r\n... router\r\n\r\nPackage                           Version\r\n-----------------------------------------------------------\r\n@angular-devkit/architect         0.803.13\r\n@angular-devkit/build-angular     0.803.13\r\n@angular-devkit/build-optimizer   0.803.13\r\n@angular-devkit/build-webpack     0.803.13\r\n@angular-devkit/core              8.3.13\r\n@angular-devkit/schematics        8.3.13\r\n@angular/cli                      8.3.13\r\n@ngtools/webpack                  8.3.13\r\n@schematics/angular               8.3.13\r\n@schematics/update                0.803.13\r\nrxjs                              6.4.0\r\ntypescript                        3.5.3\r\nwebpack                           4.39.2\r\n</code></pre>\r\n\r\n**Anything else relevant?**\r\n","Url":"https://github.com/angular/angular-cli/issues/15923","RelatedDescription":"Open issue \"ng generate module produce wrong code for specific code pattern\" (#15923)"},{"Id":"510785956","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2019-10-22T20:27:09","Actor":"alan-agius4","Number":"15914","RawContent":null,"Title":"refactor(@schematics/angular): remove deprecated `spec` and `styleext` options","State":"closed","Body":"\r\nBREAKING CHANGE:\r\n\r\nDeprecated `styleext` and `spec` options have been removed.
