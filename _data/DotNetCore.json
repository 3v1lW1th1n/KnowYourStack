This advisory also provides guidance on what developers can do to update their applications correctly.\r\n\r\nMicrosoft is aware of a security vulnerability in the public version of .NET Core where a malformed string request could cause an application to crash and lead to a denial of service.\r\n\r\nSystem administrators are advised to update their .NET Core runtimes to versions 1.0.7 and 1.1.4. Developers are advised to update their .NET Core SDK to version 1.1.4.\r\n\r\n### Discussion\r\n\r\nUse https://github.com/dotnet/corefx/issues/24703 for discussion of this advisory.\r\n\r\n### Mitigation Factors\r\n\r\n.NET Core 2.0 is not affected by this issue.\r\n\r\n### Advisory FAQ\r\n#### How do I know if I am affected?\r\n\r\nAny application running against .NET Core 1.0.6 or lower versions, or 1.1.2 or lower versions is affected. The latest version of the .NET core runtime you have installed in your computer can be listed by running `dotnet --info`. Running that command produces an output similar to the following:\r\n\r\n```\r\n.NET Command Line Tools (2.0.2)\r\n\r\nProduct Information:\r\n Version:            2.0.2\r\n Commit SHA-1 hash:  a04b4bf512\r\n\r\nRuntime Environment:\r\n OS Name:     Windows\r\n OS Version:  10.0.16299\r\n OS Platform: Windows\r\n RID:         win10-x64\r\n Base Path:   C:\\Program Files\\dotnet\\sdk\\2.0.2\\\r\n\r\nMicrosoft .NET Core Shared Framework Host\r\n\r\n  Version  : 2.0.0\r\n  Build    : e8b8861ac7faf042c87a5c2f9f2d04c98b69f28d\r\n```\r\n\r\nAs this command only displays the latest version of the runtime installed (or the version set in the *global.json* file), it may hide the fact that you have a vulnerable runtime. A complete list of runtimes can be discovered by performing a directory listing in the install root directories. The default root directories are listed in the following table:\r\n\r\n| Operating System | Location          |\r\n|------------------|-------------------|\r\n| Windows          | C:\\Program Files\\dotnet\\shared\\Microsoft.NETCore.App\\ |\r\n| macOS            | /usr/local/share/dotnet/shared/Microsoft.NETCore.App/ |\r\n| [Supported Linux platforms](https://docs.microsoft.com/dotnet/core/linux-prerequisites#supported-linux-versions) | /usr/share/dotnet/shared/Microsoft.NETCore.App/ |\r\n\r\nEach runtime version is installed in its own directory, where the directory name is the version number. If you don't have a directory for 1.0.7 and 1.1.4, then any applications targeting 1.0 or 1.1 of .NET Core are vulnerable.\r\n\r\nAlso, even if you have a directory for 1.0.7 and 1.1.4 present in your system, if you've deployed [self-contained applications](https://docs.microsoft.com/dotnet/core/deploying/#self-contained-deployments-scd) targeting the impacted versions, these applications are also vulnerable.\r\n\r\n#### How do I fix my affected application?\r\nApplications can be fixed by installing the latest .NET Core runtimes or SDKs. Typically, application servers only have runtime packages installed and developer machines have the SDKs installed. Installers for the runtimes can be downloaded from the [Runtime and SDK download archive](https://github.com/dotnet/core/blob/master/release-notes/download-archive.md). .NET Core 1.1.4 SDK installs both versions 1.0.7 and 1.1.4 of the .NET Core runtime.\r\n\r\nIf you've built a [self-contained application](https://docs.microsoft.com/dotnet/core/deploying/#self-contained-deployments-scd), you must install the new runtime and SDK, recompile your application and redeploy.\r\n\r\n#### What if the update breaks my application?\r\nAn application can be pinned to a previous version of the runtime by editing the [*application.runtime.config*](https://github.com/dotnet/cli/blob/ede74b6be1406ba0c086b6d5fc1a5d4eacff1f01/Documentation/specs/runtime-configuration-file.md#appnameruntimeconfigjson) file for that application. Set the framework version to the desired version and the `rollForward` property to `false`. These settings should be treated as a temporary measure and the application updated to work with the patched versions of the framework.\r\n\r\nSince the *application.runtime.config* file is an optional file, you may need to create one for each application and add it alongside the executable."},{"Id":"6725652001","Type":"IssuesEvent","CreatedAt":"2017-10-17T06:48:14","Actor":"richlander","Repository":"dotnet/announcements","Organization":"dotnet","RawContent":null,"RelatedAction":"opened","RelatedUrl":"https://github.com/dotnet/announcements/issues/33","RelatedDescription":"Opened issue \".NET Framework Docker Performance Issue Resolved\" (#33) at dotnet/announcements","RelatedBody":"# .NET Framework Docker Performance Issue Resolved\r\n\r\nMultiple people have [reported](https://github.com/Microsoft/dotnet-framework-docker/issues/25) that [.NET Framework performance in Docker images is poor](https://github.com/moby/moby/issues/33096). In the cases reported, performance was an order of magnitude slower than expected.\r\n\r\nThis issue has now been resolved for [microsoft/dotnet-framework](https://hub.docker.com/r/microsoft/dotnet-framework/) images. It was due to incorrectly generated NGEN images. They are now correctly generated and expected performance has been restored.\r\n\r\n## Discussion \r\n\r\nPlease share your thoughts on this change and see what others are saying at:\r\n\r\n* [dotnet-framework-docker #29](https://github.com/Microsoft/dotnet-framework-docker/pull/29)\r\n\r\n## Details\r\n\r\n* [dotnet-framework-docker #27](https://github.com/Microsoft/dotnet-framework-docker/pull/27)\r\n\r\nThe .NET Framework uses [NGEN](https://docs.microsoft.com/dotnet/framework/tools/ngen-exe-native-image-generator) as a primary mechanism for startup performance. .NET Framework assemblies are compiled to native code with the NGEN tool as part of the .NET Framework setup process. The benefit of these files is that they can be loaded and executed without any additional significant extra work required by the Common Language Runtime (CLR). The lack of  additional work means that performance is very good.\r\n\r\nNGEN image generation interacts with a Windows subsystem that is not correctly supported in Windows containers. NGEN images are generated in Windows containers, but they are not valid. Fortunately, the CLR can still run in the presence of invalid images, but code execution is much slower.\r\n\r\nWe are in the process of fixing Windows containers so that NGEN will work correctly. In the interim, we have updated the [dotnet-framework/](https://hub.docker.com/r/microsoft/dotnet-framework/) images to correctly generate NGEN images. The [microsoft/windowsservercore/](https://hub.docker.com/r/microsoft/windowsservercore/) images still have the performance problem that was initially reported. We are working on updating Windows containers so that NGEN works as expected. You are recommended to use the [dotnet-framework/](https://hub.docker.com/r/microsoft/dotnet-framework/) base image if you can, so that you can get better performance.\r\n\r\nOne of the developers that reported the performance issue shared basic performance results. The first two rows are the before state. The last row is the dotnet-framework image after the fix. The improvement is quite significant.\r\n\r\n> Runing `powershell -command (measure-command { powershell -command exit }).TotalSeconds` in various images on our CI server produced this table of timings:\r\n \r\n| time (s) | image |\r\n|----------|--------|\r\n|10.7212372| microsoft/windowsservercore |\r\n|8.3278793  | microsoft/dotnet-framework:4.7|\r\n|0.6426073  | microsoft/dotnet-framework:4.7 (after fix)|\r\n"},{"Id":"6645912196","Type":"IssuesEvent","CreatedAt":"2017-09-27T19:47:08","Actor":"terrajobst","Repository":"dotnet/announcements","Organization":"dotnet","RawContent":null,"RelatedAction":"opened","RelatedUrl":"https://github.com/dotnet/announcements/issues/32","RelatedDescription":"Opened issue \".NET Framework 4.7.1 provides built-in support for .NET Standard 2.0\" (#32) at dotnet/announcements","RelatedBody":"## Summary\r\n\r\n.NET Framework 4.7.1 will have built-in support for .NET Standard 2.0.

In fact, .NET Framework 4.6.1 was shipped before .NET Standard 2.0 was even designed.

This renders Windows Error Reporting largely useless, as well as causing problems for other diagnostic scenarios that would like to use minidumps.\r\n\r\nThe root cause of the problem is .Net Core doesn't have access to the same extensibility mechanism in MiniDumpWriteDump that the desktop and .Net Native CLR implementations use. The current extensibility mechanism provided by the OS requires registering a dll in HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\\SOFTWARE\\Microsoft\\Windows NT\\CurrentVersion\\MiniDumpAuxiliaryDlls. That registry location requires admin privileges and can't be set when .Net Core installation is limited to xcopy only.\r\n\r\nProposed solution:\r\nWe have coordinated with the Windows OS team to design an additional extensibility mechanism to MiniDumpWriteDump. In lieu of admin privileges and registry edits, this one uses authenticode signature verification to ensure security and reads the PE resources in loaded modules for discovery. Specifically MiniDumpWriteDump will scan each module in the dump process looking for any resources with name=DUMP_HELPER, type=RT_RCDATA, lang=neutral. The resource contains the UTF8 encoded, null terminated name of a minidump auxilliary provider dll that is located in the same directory as the binary with the resource in it. After discovery and signature verification, MiniDumpWriteDump uses the minidump auxilliary provider no differently than if it had been loaded using the pre-existing registry technique.\r\n"},{"Id":"6742022574","Type":"IssuesEvent","CreatedAt":"2017-10-20T05:09:20","Actor":"noahfalk","Repository":"dotnet/coreclr","Organization":"dotnet","RawContent":null,"RelatedAction":"closed","RelatedUrl":"https://github.com/dotnet/coreclr/issues/12613","RelatedDescription":"Closed issue \"Tiered jitting: Functional and stress testing\" (#12613) at dotnet/coreclr","RelatedBody":"Once we have some diagnostics in place (#12612) it should be reasonable to use those diagnostics to check if tiered jitting is versioning the code the way we expect it to.

We need to:\r\n- Confirm that the debugger areas that PR changed are working properly\r\n- Disable tiered jitting when requested to do debuggable code-gen. This ensures that native-IL mapping stays at high quality, inlining doesn't occur, and there is no intersection between EnC and tiered jitting.\r\n- Fix race conditions that could otherwise occur when new code versions are created while breakpoints/tracing is active in the previous code version. A canonical scenario is likely to be:\r\n1. Developer is stopped in the debugger in the Foo function which is about to call Bar\r\n2. Developer issues a step-in which binds a breakpoint at the entrypoint of Bar jitted code version 1.\r\n3. Debugger resumes execution of all threads, planning to stop again once the current thread reaches the Bar jitted version 1 breakpoint.\r\n4. On a seperate thread the background optimized compilation of Bar completes, jitted code version 2. This new code version is published. \r\n5. The original call from from Foo to Bar executes the updated stubs and winds up invoking the code for Bar jitted code version 2. This version didn't have a breakpoint in it thus the debugger doesn't stop. \r\n\r\nA correct implementation would need to replicate some of the breakpoints from version 1 to version 2 prior to the new version being published. Breakpoints that are tracked in the runtime by IL offset are probably correctly applied already, but those that are tracked by native offset aren't. Breakpoints used for stepping as above are one example of that class.\r\n\r\nNote: Despite excluding debuggable code-gen from getting tiered, the debugger/ICorDebug API is not restricted to only operate on debuggable code.

issue \"Analyzer or warning for NullReferenceException in 'await Foo?.Bar()'\" (#22784) at dotnet/roslyn","RelatedBody":"**Version Used**: \r\nVisual Studio 15.3.5 + C# 7.0\r\n\r\n**Steps to Reproduce**:\r\n\r\n1. Write some code similar to `await this.quickInfoBroker.GetSession(this.textView)?.DismissAsync(CancellationToken.None)`. Note the use of the `?.` operator.\r\n2. Call in such a way that GetSession() returns null.\r\n\r\n**Expected Behavior**:\r\nBased purely on appearance, it’d be reasonable to assume that the code, once compiled, would be roughly equivalent to this, in keeping with the behavior of `?.` in synchronous scenarios.\r\n\r\n            var task = null;\r\n            var session = this.quickInfoBroker.GetSession(this.textView);\r\n\r\n            if (session != null)\r\n            {\r\n                task = session.DismissAsync(CancellationToken.None);\r\n                task.GetAwaiter().OnCompletion(() => ...);\r\n            }\r\n\r\n**Actual Behavior**:\r\nIn reality, the code is seemingly compiled more like the following:\r\n\r\n            var task = null;\r\n            var session = this.quickInfoBroker.GetSession(this.textView);\r\n\r\n            if (session != null)\r\n            {\r\n                task = session.DismissAsync(CancellationToken.None);\r\n            }\r\n\r\n           task.GetAwaiter().OnCompletion(() => ...);\r\n\r\nThough the behavior isn't really incorrect *per se*, as *await* is not specified to perform a null check, it's not immediately apparent what's happening on this line of code because the syntactic sugar of await obscures what's actually happening. Now that the async/await pattern is part of the language, it's probably a breaking change to add a null check as part of the code but the following seem like they would have little chance of being disruptive and would remove this stumbling block for developers:\r\n\r\n1. [Most Disruptive]: Generate a null check for each task that is being awaited before calling GetAwaiter() if and only if the expression being awaited can resolve to null due to the presence of a `?.` operator. In other words, if a developer writes `var foo = await foo?.BarAsync()` there is seemingly no reason why they would want to crash with a NRE instead of evaluating to null. The semantics of `?.` in synchronous code make this case seem counterintuitive and easy to miss.\r\n\r\n2. [Mildly Disruptive]: Generate a compiler warning or error that can be ignored whenever the conditions from 1. are met. This is still a breaking change for anyone with WarnAsError enabled, but it seems reasonable and overall less disruptive and accomplishes the end goal.\r\n\r\n3. [Non Disruptive]: Add a Roslyn analyzer to Visual Studio that can detect this condition and give users a warning/suggestion to fix it in the IDE."},{"Id":"6741455720","Type":"PullRequestEvent","CreatedAt":"2017-10-20T00:54:43","Actor":"ivanbasov","Repository":"dotnet/roslyn","Organization":"dotnet","RawContent":null,"RelatedAction":"opened","RelatedUrl":"https://github.com/dotnet/roslyn/pull/22783","RelatedDescription":"Opened pull request \"[EE] Unify all classes of CSharpExpressionCompiler Dev15.6\" (#22783) at dotnet/roslyn","RelatedBody":"This is a copy of https://github.com/dotnet/roslyn/pull/22681 against post-dev15.5-constib which was already signed.
