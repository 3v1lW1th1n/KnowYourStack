This advisory also provides guidance on what developers can do to update their applications to remove this vulnerability.\r\n\r\nMicrosoft is aware of a denial of service vulnerability that exists when .NET Framework and .NET Core improperly process XML documents. An attacker who successfully exploited this vulnerability could cause a denial of service against a .NET Framework, .NET Core, or .NET native application.\r\n\r\nThe update addresses the vulnerability by correcting how .NET Framework, .NET Core, and .NET native applications handle XML document processing.\r\n\r\nIf your application is an ASP.NET Core application, developers are also advised to update to ASP.NET Core 2.0.8.\r\n\r\n## Discussion\r\n\r\nDiscussion for this issue can be found at https://github.com/dotnet/Home/ **TBD**\r\n\r\n### <a name=\"mitigation-factors\"></a>Mitigation factors\r\n\r\n* If an application does not process signed XML, it is not affected by this vulnerability.\r\n* If your application targets .NET Core 1.x or .NET native 1.x, it is not affected as the vulnerable package is not available for these platforms.\r\n\r\n## <a name=\"affected-software\"></a>Affected software\r\n\r\nAny .NET Core, .NET native, or ASP.NET Core based application that uses System.Security.Cryptography.Xml with a version of 4.4.1 or earlier.\r\n\r\nPackage name | Vulnerable versions | Secure versions\r\n------------ | ---------------- | -------------------------\r\nSystem.Security.Cryptography.Xml | ≤4.4.1 |  4.4.2 or later\r\n\r\n## <a name=\"advisory-faq\"></a>Advisory FAQ\r\n### <a name=\"how-affected\"></a>How do I know if I am affected?\r\n\r\n.NET Core has two types of dependencies: direct and transitive. Direct dependencies are dependencies where you specifically add a package to your project, transitive dependencies occur when you add a package to your project that in turn relies on another package.\r\n\r\nFor example, the `Microsoft.AspNetCore.Mvc` package depends on the `Microsoft.AspNetCore.Mvc.Core` package. When you add a dependency on `Microsoft.AspNetCore.Mvc` in your project, you're taking a transitive dependency on `Microsoft.AspNetCore.Mvc.Core`.\r\n\r\nAny application that has a direct or transitive dependency on the [affected package](#affected-software) can be exposed to the vulnerability if it does not meet any of the [mitigation factors](#mitigation-factors).\r\n\r\n### <a name=\"how-fix\"></a>How do I fix the issue?\r\n---\r\n\r\nIf you're targeting ASP.NET Core 2.0 and using the `Microsoft.AspNetCore.All` metapackage:\r\n\r\n* Update its version number to 2.0.8 to pull in updated packages that update their transitive dependencies to the fixed version of `System.Security.Cryptography.Xml`.\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n.NET Core projects have two types of dependencies: direct and transitive. You must update your projects using the following instructions to address both types of dependency.\r\n\r\n#### Direct dependencies\r\n\r\nDirect dependencies are discoverable by examining your *csproj* file. They can be fixed by [editing the csproj file](#direct-dependencies) or using NuGet to update the dependency.\r\n\r\n#### Transitive dependencies\r\n\r\nTransitive dependencies occur when you add a package to your project that in turn relies on another package. For example, if Contoso publishes a package `Contoso.Utility` which, in turn, depends on `Contoso.Internals` and you add the `Contoso.Utility` package to your project now your project has a direct dependency on `Contoso.Utility` and, because `Contoso.Utility` depends 'Contoso.Internals', your application gains a transitive dependency on the `Contoso.Internals` package.\r\n\r\nTransitive dependencies are reviewable in two ways:\r\n\r\n* In the Visual Studio Solution Explorer window, which supports searching.\r\n* By examining the *project.assets.json* file contained in the obj directory of your project.\r\n\r\nThe *project.assets.json* files are the authoritative list of all packages used by your project, containing both direct and transitive dependencies.\r\n\r\n#### <a name=\"direct-dependencies\"></a>Fixing direct dependencies\r\n\r\nOpen *projectname.csproj* in your editor. If you're using Visual Studio, right-click the project and choose **Edit projectname.csproj** from the context menu, where projectname is the name of your project. Look for `PackageReference` elements. The following shows an example project file:\r\n\r\n```xml\r\n<Project Sdk=\"Microsoft.NET.Sdk\">\r\n  <PropertyGroup>\r\n    <TargetFramework>netcoreapp2.0</TargetFramework>\r\n  </PropertyGroup>\r\n  <ItemGroup>\r\n    <PackageReference Include=\"System.Security.Cryptography.Xml\" Version=\"4.4.1\" />\r\n  </ItemGroup>\r\n</Project>\r\n```\r\n\r\nThe preceding example has a reference to the [vulnerable package](#affected-software), as seen by the single `PackageReference` element. The name of the package is in the `Include` attribute.\r\nThe package version number is in the `Version` attribute. The previous example shows a single direct dependency on `System.Security.Cryptography.Xml` version 4.4.1.\r\n\r\nTo update the version to the secure package, change the version number to the updated package version as listed on the table [previously](#affected-software).\r\nIn this example, update `System.Security.Cryptography.Xml` to a [fixed package number](#affected-software). Save the *csproj* file. The example *csproj* now looks as follows:\r\n\r\n```xml\r\n<Project Sdk=\"Microsoft.NET.Sdk\">\r\n  <PropertyGroup>\r\n    <TargetFramework>netcoreapp2.0</TargetFramework>\r\n  </PropertyGroup>\r\n  <ItemGroup>\r\n    <PackageReference Include=\"System.Security.Cryptography.Xml\" Version=\"4.4.2\" />\r\n  </ItemGroup>\r\n</Project>\r\n```\r\n\r\nIf you're using Visual Studio and you save your updated *csproj* file, Visual Studio will restore the new package version.\r\nYou can see the restore results by opening the **Output** window (Ctrl+Alt+O) and changing the **Show output from** drop-down list to **Package Manager**.\r\n\r\nIf you're not using Visual Studio, open a command line and change to your project directory. Execute the `dotnet restore` command to restore the updated dependencies.\r\n\r\nNow recompile your application. If after recompilation you see a *Dependency conflict warning*, you must update your other direct dependencies to versions that take a dependency on the updated package.\r\n\r\nAfter you've addressed all of your direct dependencies, you must review your transitive dependencies.\r\n\r\n#### Discovering and fixing transitive dependencies\r\n\r\nThere are two ways to view transitive dependencies. You can either [use Visual Studio’s Solution Explorer](#vs-solution-explorer), or you can [review the *project.assets.json* file](#project-assets-json).\r\n\r\n##### <a name=\"vs-solution-explorer\"></a>Using Visual Studio Solution Explorer\r\n\r\nTo use Solution Explorer, open the project in Visual Studio 2017, and then press Ctrl+; to activate the search in Solution Explorer. Search for the [vulnerable package](#affected-software) and make a note of the version numbers of any results you find.\r\n\r\nFor example, searching for `Microsoft.AspNetCore.Mvc.Core` in an example project that contains a package that takes a dependency on `Microsoft.AspNetCore.Mvc` shows the following results in Visual Studio 2017:\r\n\r\n![Screenshot of search results in Visual Studio 2017](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/796298/25858816/8ecdc2b4-3491-11e7-9363-746804bb9832.png)\r\n\r\nThe search results appear as a tree. In the previous results, you can see that a reference to `Microsoft.AspNetCore.Mvc.Core` version 1.1.2 is discovered.\r\n\r\nUnder the Dependencies node is a NuGet node. Under the NuGet node is the list of packages you have directly taken a dependency on and their versions.\r\nIn screenshot, the application takes a direct dependency on `Microsoft.AspNetCore.Mvc`. `Microsoft.AspNetCore.Mvc` in turn has leaf nodes that list its dependencies and their versions.\r\nThe `Microsoft.AspNetCore.Mvc` package takes a dependency on a version of `Microsoft.AspNetCore.Mvc.ApiExplorer`, that in turn takes a dependency on a version of `Microsoft.AspNetCore.Mvc.Core`.\r\n\r\n##### <a name=\"project-assets-json\"></a>Manually reviewing project.assets.json\r\n\r\nOpen the *project.assets.json* file from your project’s obj directory in your editor. We suggest you use an editor that understands JSON and allows you to collapse and expand nodes to review this file.\r\nVisual Studio and Visual Studio Code provide JSON friendly editing.\r\n\r\nSearch the *project.assets.json* file for the [vulnerable package](#affected-software), using the format `packagename/` for each of the package names from the preceding table. If you find the assembly name in your search:\r\n\r\n* Examine the line on which they are found, the version number is after the `/`.\r\n* Compare to the [vulnerable versions table](#affected-software).\r\n\r\nFor example, a search result that shows `System.Security.Cryptography.Xml/4.4.0` is a reference to version 4.4.0 of `System.Security.Cryptography.Xml`.\r\nIf your *project.assets.json* file includes references to the [vulnerable package](#affected-software), then you need to fix the transitive dependencies.\r\n\r\n##### Fixing transitive dependencies\r\n\r\nIf you have not found any reference to any vulnerable packages, this means either\r\n\r\n* None of your direct dependencies depend on any vulnerable packages, or\r\n* You have already fixed the problem by updating the direct dependencies.\r\n\r\nIf your transitive dependency review found references to the [vulnerable package](#affected-software), you must add a direct dependency to the updated package to your *csproj* file to override the transitive dependency.\r\n\r\nOpen *projectname.csproj* in your editor. If you're using Visual Studio, right-click the project and choose **Edit projectname.csproj** from the context menu, where projectname is the name of your project.\r\nLook for `PackageReference` nodes, for example:\r\n\r\n```xml\r\n<Project Sdk=\"Microsoft.NET.Sdk.\">\r\n  <PropertyGroup>\r\n    <TargetFramework>net461</TargetFramework>\r\n  </PropertyGroup>\r\n  <ItemGroup>\r\n    <PackageReference Include=\"ThirdParty.NotUpdatedYet\" Version=\"2.0.0\" />\r\n  </ItemGroup>\r\n</Project>\r\n```\r\n\r\nYou must add a direct dependency to the updated version of the [vulnerable package](#affected-software) by adding it to the *csproj* file.\r\nYou do this by adding a new line to the dependencies section, referencing the fixed version.\r\nFor example, if your search showed a transitive reference to a vulnerable `System.Security.Cryptography.Xml` version, you'd add a reference to the [fixed package number](#affected-software).\r\n\r\n```xml\r\n<Project Sdk=\"Microsoft.NET.Sdk.Web\">\r\n  <PropertyGroup>\r\n    <TargetFramework>net461</TargetFramework>\r\n  </PropertyGroup>\r\n  <ItemGroup>\r\n    <PackageReference Include=\"System.Security.Cryptography.Xml\" Version=\"4.4.2\" />\r\n    <PackageReference Include=\"ThirdParty.NotUpdatedYet\" Version=\"2.0.0\" />\r\n  </ItemGroup>\r\n</Project>\r\n```\r\n\r\nAfter you've added the direct dependency reference, save your *csproj* file.\r\n\r\nIf you're using Visual Studio, save your updated *csproj* file and Visual Studio will restore the new package versions.\r\nYou can see the restore results by opening the **Output** window (Ctrl+Alt+O) and changing the **Show output from** drop-down list to **Package Manager**.\r\n\r\nIf you're not using Visual Studio, open a command line and change to your project directory. Execute the `dotnet restore` command to restore the new dependencies.\r\n\r\n#### Rebuilding your application\r\n\r\nFinally you must rebuild your application, test, and redeploy.\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\nIf you're targeting .NET native for a Universal Windows Platform (UWP) application, you should update your dependencies and republish your application.\r\n\r\nIf you submit an application to the Windows Store with an outdated reference, the store will update the reference automatically, which has the potential for compatibility issues. Thus, we recommend updating your application directly and testing its functionality before resubmitting.\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n## Other Information\r\n\r\n### Reporting Security Issues\r\n\r\nIf you have found a potential security issue in .NET Core, please email details to secure@microsoft.com.

However, some operations mark segments as being frozen, which then prevents subsequent enqueues into those segments; this is necessary for enumeration, but Count also caused this.  Ideally Count isn't used on hot paths, but if it is, this can end up in degenerate situations where, for example, if Count is called after every enqueue, we'll end up creating a new segment for every enqueued item, which is incredibly inefficient both for the enqueues and for Count, which is O(N) in the number of segments.\r\n\r\nIt turns out, though, that we were overly cautious in implementing Count, and we don't actually need it to freeze the segments.  Instead, when there are more than two segments (the case where we previously froze), we can take the cross-segment lock, which is the same lock that's held any time we update the head and tail segment pointers.  Once that lock is held, we know that the internal segments won't change, because code can only enqueue/dequeue from the head and tail segments, so any segment that's not head and tail while the lock is held is effectively immutable.  That means that we can simply walk those segments and add up their counts, safe in knowing they won't change while we're enumerating.\r\n\r\nFixes https://github.com/dotnet/corefx/issues/29759\r\ncc: @kouvel, @benaadams, @tarekgh "},{"Id":"7698607912","Type":"PullRequestEvent","CreatedAt":"2018-05-19T00:50:37","Actor":"helloguo","Repository":"dotnet/coreclr","Organization":"dotnet","RawContent":null,"RelatedAction":"opened","RelatedUrl":"https://github.com/dotnet/coreclr/pull/18059","RelatedDescription":"Opened pull request \"Fix issue18039: Add SSE2 intrinsic MoveScalar for type long and ulong\" (#18059) at dotnet/coreclr","RelatedBody":"Fix https://github.com/dotnet/coreclr/issues/18039"},{"Id":"7698568414","Type":"PullRequestEvent","CreatedAt":"2018-05-19T00:25:26","Actor":"4creators","Repository":"dotnet/coreclr","Organization":"dotnet","RawContent":null,"RelatedAction":"opened","RelatedUrl":"https://github.com/dotnet/coreclr/pull/18058","RelatedDescription":"Opened pull request \"Fix codegen for HW intrinsic Sse2.ConvertToInt32WithTruncation  \" (#18058) at dotnet/coreclr","RelatedBody":"Fixes #18041"}],"ResultType":"GitHubEvent"},"CLI":{"Events":[],"ResultType":"GitHubEvent"},"Standard":{"Events":[{"Id":"7698401253","Type":"PullRequestEvent","CreatedAt":"2018-05-18T23:05:06","Actor":"mairaw","Repository":"dotnet/standard","Organization":"dotnet","RawContent":null,"RelatedAction":"opened","RelatedUrl":"https://github.com/dotnet/standard/pull/741","RelatedDescription":"Opened pull request \"update link\" (#741) at dotnet/standard","RelatedBody":"Since I'm removing the 1.0 tooling info from the doc with this PR (https://github.com/dotnet/docs/pull/5476), I'm updating the link here too."},{"Id":"7696965353","Type":"IssuesEvent","CreatedAt":"2018-05-18T17:01:52","Actor":"rubenc57","Repository":"dotnet/standard","Organization":"dotnet","RawContent":null,"RelatedAction":"opened","RelatedUrl":"https://github.com/dotnet/standard/issues/740","RelatedDescription":"Opened issue \"After installing NetStandard.Library 2.0.3 I receive a missing file error.\" (#740) at dotnet/standard","RelatedBody":"\r\nError:\r\n\r\n\"This project references NuGet package(s) that are missing on this computer.

Code:\r\n```c#\r\n            var request = new HttpRequestMessage\r\n            {\r\n                RequestUri = new Uri(_url),\r\n                Method = HttpMethod.Post,\r\n                Headers ={\r\n                    {HttpRequestHeader.Authorization.ToString(),_auth},\r\n                    {HttpRequestHeader.ContentType.ToString(),\"application/json\"}\r\n                },\r\n                Content = new StringContent(messageData)\r\n            };\r\n            using (var handler = new HttpClientHandler\r\n            {\r\n                ServerCertificateCustomValidationCallback = (message, cert, chain, errors) => true,\r\n                UseProxy = false\r\n            })\r\n            {\r\n                using (var httpClient = new HttpClient(handler)\r\n                {\r\n                    BaseAddress = new Uri(_url)\r\n                })\r\n                {\r\n                    Console.WriteLine(\"start sending...\");\r\n                    var response =  await httpClient.SendAsync(request); //This is where the problem occurs!!!\r\n                    Console.WriteLine($\"Sending done: StatusCode: {response?.StatusCode}\");\r\n                }\r\n            } \r\n```\r\n\r\n## Expected behavior\r\nThe code should just send data to the rest endpoint.\r\n\r\n## Actual behavior\r\nIt sends messages for a while (like 100) to the endpoint and dies with the error Segmentation fault (core dumped). This cannot be catched.\r\n\r\n## Additional information (e.g. issue happens only occasionally)\r\nOn raspberry pi 3 with the docker base-image microsoft/dotnet:2.0-runtime-stretch-arm32v7.\r\nI changed the baseimage and it works, so it's pretty save, that this issue is due to this one. Unfortunately I don't have any idea why.\r\n\r\n## Output of `docker version`\r\n```\r\nClient:\r\n Version:       18.03.0-ce\r\n API version:   1.37\r\n Go version:    go1.9.4\r\n Git commit:    0520e24\r\n Built: Wed Mar 21 23:18:23 2018\r\n OS/Arch:       linux/arm\r\n Experimental:  false\r\n Orchestrator:  swarm\r\n\r\nServer:\r\n Engine:\r\n  Version:      18.03.0-ce\r\n  API version:  1.37 (minimum version 1.12)\r\n  Go version:   go1.9.4\r\n  Git commit:   0520e24\r\n  Built:        Wed Mar 21 23:14:29 2018\r\n  OS/Arch:      linux/arm\r\n  Experimental: false\r\n\r\n```\r\n\r\n## Output of `docker info`\r\n\r\n```\r\nContainers: 2\r\n Running: 0\r\n Paused: 0\r\n Stopped: 2\r\nImages: 3\r\nServer Version: 18.03.0-ce\r\nStorage Driver: overlay2\r\n Backing Filesystem: extfs\r\n Supports d_type: true\r\n Native Overlay Diff: false\r\nLogging Driver: json-file\r\nCgroup Driver: cgroupfs\r\nPlugins:\r\n Volume: local\r\n Network: bridge host macvlan null overlay\r\n Log: awslogs fluentd gcplogs gelf journald json-file logentries splunk syslog\r\nSwarm: inactive\r\nRuntimes: runc\r\nDefault Runtime: runc\r\nInit Binary: docker-init\r\ncontainerd version: cfd04396dc68220d1cecbe686a6cc3aa5ce3667c\r\nrunc version: 4fc53a81fb7c994640722ac585fa9ca548971871\r\ninit version: 949e6fa\r\nSecurity Options:\r\n apparmor\r\n seccomp\r\n  Profile: default\r\nKernel Version: 4.4.0-1009-raspi2\r\nOperating System: Ubuntu 16.04 LTS\r\nOSType: linux\r\nArchitecture: armv7l\r\nCPUs: 4\r\nTotal Memory: 920.1MiB\r\nName: \r\nID: UUUL:DQMQ:S7ES:WMO6:QEWB:E7UW:FQEO:QG3S:AZO7:NBK4:B2OT:D7SI\r\nDocker Root Dir: /var/lib/docker\r\nDebug Mode (client): false\r\nDebug Mode (server): false\r\nRegistry: https://index.docker.io/v1/\r\nLabels:\r\nExperimental: false\r\nInsecure Registries:\r\n \r\n 127.0.0.0/8\r\nLive Restore Enabled: false\r\n\r\n```\r\n\r\n[EDIT] Add C# syntax highlighting by @karelz"}],"ResultType":"GitHubEvent"},"Roslyn":{"Events":[{"Id":"7698915841","Type":"PullRequestEvent","CreatedAt":"2018-05-19T05:15:21","Actor":"jcouv","Repository":"dotnet/roslyn","Organization":"dotnet","RawContent":null,"RelatedAction":"opened","RelatedUrl":"https://github.com/dotnet/roslyn/pull/26988","RelatedDescription":"Opened pull request \"Dummy change\" (#26988) at dotnet/roslyn","RelatedBody":"To refresh the async-streams branch, I had to push the merge commit directly because of unicorns.
