This advisory also provides guidance on what developers can do to update their applications correctly.\r\n\r\nMicrosoft is aware of a Denial of Service vulnerability in all public versions of .NET core due to improper processing of XML documents. An attacker who successfully exploited this vulnerability could cause a denial of service against a .NET application. A remote unauthenticated attacker could exploit this vulnerability by issuing specially crafted requests to a .NET Core application.\r\n\r\nThe update addresses the vulnerability by correcting how .NET core handles XML document processing.\r\n\r\nSystem administrators are advised to update their .NET Core runtimes to versions 1.0.9, 1.1.6 and 2.0.5. Developers are advised to update their .NET Core SDK to version 2.1.4 or 1.1.7. These runtime and SDK versions will also address CVE-2018-0786,  https://github.com/dotnet/announcements/issues/51\r\n\r\n### Discussion\r\n\r\nPlease use **** TODO: FILL IN ISSUE LINK *** for discussion of this advisory.\r\n\r\n## Affected Software\r\nThe vulnerability affects any Microsoft .NET Core project if it uses any of affected runtime versions listed below\r\n\r\n Runtime Version | Fixed runtime version\r\n----------------| -------------------------\r\n1.0.0, 1.0.1, 1.0.2, 1.0.3, 1.0.4, 1.0.5, 1.0.7, 1.0.8 | 1.0.9\r\n1.1.0, 1.1.1, 1.1.2, 1.1.4, 1.1.5 | 1.1.6\r\n2.0.0, 2.0.3, 2.0.4 |  2.0.5\r\n\r\n### Advisory FAQ\r\n#### How do I know if I am affected?\r\n\r\nTo check the runtimes installed on a computer you must view the contents of the runtime folder. By default these are\r\n\r\n| Operating System          | Location          |\r\n|---------------------------|-------------------|\r\n| Windows | C:\\Program Files\\dotnet\\shared\\Microsoft.NETCore.App\\ |\r\n| macOS | /usr/local/share/dotnet/shared/Microsoft.NETCore.App/    |\r\n| Supported Linux platforms | /usr/share/dotnet/shared/Microsoft.NETCore.App/   |\r\n\r\nEach runtime version is installed in its own directory, where the directory name is the version number. If you do not have a directory for 1.0.9, 1.1.6 or 2.0.2 then any applications targeting .NET Core will be vulnerable. Downloads for all supported platforms can be acquired from https://www.microsoft.com/net/download/\r\n\r\n#### How do I fix my affected application?\r\nApplications can be fixed by installing the latest runtimes or SDKs. Typically application servers only install a runtime package, developer machines install SDKs. Installers can be downloaded from the [Runtime and SDK download archive](https://github.com/dotnet/core/blob/master/release-notes/download-archive.md). Runtime version 1.1.6 will also install runtime version 1.0.9.\r\n\r\nIf you have built a [self-contained application](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/core/deploying/#self-contained-deployments-scd) you must install the new runtime and SDK, recompile your application and redeploy.\r\n\r\n## Other Information\r\n### Reporting Security Issues\r\n\r\nIf you have found a potential security issue in .NET Core, please email details to secure@microsoft.com. Reports may qualify for the .NET Core Bug Bounty. Details of the .NET Core Bug Bounty including Terms and Conditions are at [https://aka.ms/corebounty](https://aka.ms/corebounty).\r\n\r\n### Support\r\nYou can ask questions about this issue on GitHub in the .NET Core or ASP.NET Core organizations. These are located at https://github.com/dotnet/ and https://github.com/aspnet/. The Announcements repo for each product (https://github.com/dotnet/Announcements and https://github.com/aspnet/Announcements) will contain this bulletin as an issue and will include a link to a discussion issue where you can ask questions.\r\n\r\n### What if the update breaks my application?\r\nAn application can be pinned to a previous version of the runtime by editing the [application.runtime.config](https://github.com/dotnet/cli/blob/ede74b6be1406ba0c086b6d5fc1a5d4eacff1f01/Documentation/specs/runtime-configuration-file.md#appnameruntimeconfigjson) file for that application and editing the framework version and setting `rollForward` to `false`. This should be treated as a temporary measure and the application updated to work with the patched versions of the framework.\r\n\r\nNote that this file is optional, you may need to create it for each application alongside the executable.\r\n\r\n### External Links\r\n\r\n[CVE-2018-0764](https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2018-0764)\r\n\r\n### Revisions\r\n\r\nV1.0 (Jan 9, 2018): Advisory published.\r\n\r\n_Version 1.0_\r\n_Last Updated 2018-01-09_\r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  "}],"ResultType":"GitHubEvent"},"CoreCLR":{"Events":[{"Id":"7258249520","Type":"PullRequestEvent","CreatedAt":"2018-02-17T04:27:07","Actor":"briansull","Repository":"dotnet/coreclr","Organization":"dotnet","RawContent":null,"RelatedAction":"merged","RelatedUrl":"https://github.com/dotnet/coreclr/pull/16413","RelatedDescription":"Merged pull request \"Fix for assert(sideEffList) in clr\\src\\jit\\optcse.cpp, Line: 2151\" (#16413) at dotnet/coreclr","RelatedBody":"Added new tree walker helper optHasCSEdefWithSideeffect to determine up front if we have\r\na nested CSE def with side effects.
