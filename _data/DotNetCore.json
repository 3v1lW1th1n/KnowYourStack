This advisory also provides guidance on what developers can do to update their applications correctly.\r\n\r\nMicrosoft is aware of a security vulnerability in the public version of .NET Core where a malformed string request could cause an application to crash and lead to a denial of service.\r\n\r\nSystem administrators are advised to update their .NET Core runtimes to versions 1.0.7 and 1.1.4. Developers are advised to update their .NET Core SDK to version 1.1.4.\r\n\r\n### Discussion\r\n\r\nUse https://github.com/dotnet/corefx/issues/24703 for discussion of this advisory.\r\n\r\n### Mitigation Factors\r\n\r\n.NET Core 2.0 is not affected by this issue.\r\n\r\n### Advisory FAQ\r\n#### How do I know if I am affected?\r\n\r\nAny application running against .NET Core 1.0.6 or lower versions, or 1.1.2 or lower versions is affected. The latest version of the .NET core runtime you have installed in your computer can be listed by running `dotnet --info`. Running that command produces an output similar to the following:\r\n\r\n```\r\n.NET Command Line Tools (2.0.2)\r\n\r\nProduct Information:\r\n Version:            2.0.2\r\n Commit SHA-1 hash:  a04b4bf512\r\n\r\nRuntime Environment:\r\n OS Name:     Windows\r\n OS Version:  10.0.16299\r\n OS Platform: Windows\r\n RID:         win10-x64\r\n Base Path:   C:\\Program Files\\dotnet\\sdk\\2.0.2\\\r\n\r\nMicrosoft .NET Core Shared Framework Host\r\n\r\n  Version  : 2.0.0\r\n  Build    : e8b8861ac7faf042c87a5c2f9f2d04c98b69f28d\r\n```\r\n\r\nAs this command only displays the latest version of the runtime installed (or the version set in the *global.json* file), it may hide the fact that you have a vulnerable runtime. A complete list of runtimes can be discovered by performing a directory listing in the install root directories. The default root directories are listed in the following table:\r\n\r\n| Operating System | Location          |\r\n|------------------|-------------------|\r\n| Windows          | C:\\Program Files\\dotnet\\shared\\Microsoft.NETCore.App\\ |\r\n| macOS            | /usr/local/share/dotnet/shared/Microsoft.NETCore.App/ |\r\n| [Supported Linux platforms](https://docs.microsoft.com/dotnet/core/linux-prerequisites#supported-linux-versions) | /usr/share/dotnet/shared/Microsoft.NETCore.App/ |\r\n\r\nEach runtime version is installed in its own directory, where the directory name is the version number. If you don't have a directory for 1.0.7 and 1.1.4, then any applications targeting 1.0 or 1.1 of .NET Core are vulnerable.\r\n\r\nAlso, even if you have a directory for 1.0.7 and 1.1.4 present in your system, if you've deployed [self-contained applications](https://docs.microsoft.com/dotnet/core/deploying/#self-contained-deployments-scd) targeting the impacted versions, these applications are also vulnerable.\r\n\r\n#### How do I fix my affected application?\r\nApplications can be fixed by installing the latest .NET Core runtimes or SDKs. Typically, application servers only have runtime packages installed and developer machines have the SDKs installed. Installers for the runtimes can be downloaded from the [Runtime and SDK download archive](https://github.com/dotnet/core/blob/master/release-notes/download-archive.md). .NET Core 1.1.4 SDK installs both versions 1.0.7 and 1.1.4 of the .NET Core runtime.\r\n\r\nIf you've built a [self-contained application](https://docs.microsoft.com/dotnet/core/deploying/#self-contained-deployments-scd), you must install the new runtime and SDK, recompile your application and redeploy.\r\n\r\n#### What if the update breaks my application?\r\nAn application can be pinned to a previous version of the runtime by editing the [*application.runtime.config*](https://github.com/dotnet/cli/blob/ede74b6be1406ba0c086b6d5fc1a5d4eacff1f01/Documentation/specs/runtime-configuration-file.md#appnameruntimeconfigjson) file for that application. Set the framework version to the desired version and the `rollForward` property to `false`. These settings should be treated as a temporary measure and the application updated to work with the patched versions of the framework.\r\n\r\nSince the *application.runtime.config* file is an optional file, you may need to create one for each application and add it alongside the executable."},{"Id":"6725652001","Type":"IssuesEvent","CreatedAt":"2017-10-17T06:48:14","Actor":"richlander","Repository":"dotnet/announcements","Organization":"dotnet","RawContent":null,"RelatedAction":"opened","RelatedUrl":"https://github.com/dotnet/announcements/issues/33","RelatedDescription":"Opened issue \".NET Framework Docker Performance Issue Resolved\" (#33) at dotnet/announcements","RelatedBody":"# .NET Framework Docker Performance Issue Resolved\r\n\r\nMultiple people have [reported](https://github.com/Microsoft/dotnet-framework-docker/issues/25) that [.NET Framework performance in Docker images is poor](https://github.com/moby/moby/issues/33096). In the cases reported, performance was an order of magnitude slower than expected.\r\n\r\nThis issue has now been resolved for [microsoft/dotnet-framework](https://hub.docker.com/r/microsoft/dotnet-framework/) images. It was due to incorrectly generated NGEN images. They are now correctly generated and expected performance has been restored.\r\n\r\n## Discussion \r\n\r\nPlease share your thoughts on this change and see what others are saying at:\r\n\r\n* [dotnet-framework-docker #29](https://github.com/Microsoft/dotnet-framework-docker/pull/29)\r\n\r\n## Details\r\n\r\n* [dotnet-framework-docker #27](https://github.com/Microsoft/dotnet-framework-docker/pull/27)\r\n\r\nThe .NET Framework uses [NGEN](https://docs.microsoft.com/dotnet/framework/tools/ngen-exe-native-image-generator) as a primary mechanism for startup performance. .NET Framework assemblies are compiled to native code with the NGEN tool as part of the .NET Framework setup process. The benefit of these files is that they can be loaded and executed without any additional significant extra work required by the Common Language Runtime (CLR). The lack of  additional work means that performance is very good.\r\n\r\nNGEN image generation interacts with a Windows subsystem that is not correctly supported in Windows containers. NGEN images are generated in Windows containers, but they are not valid. Fortunately, the CLR can still run in the presence of invalid images, but code execution is much slower.\r\n\r\nWe are in the process of fixing Windows containers so that NGEN will work correctly. In the interim, we have updated the [dotnet-framework/](https://hub.docker.com/r/microsoft/dotnet-framework/) images to correctly generate NGEN images. The [microsoft/windowsservercore/](https://hub.docker.com/r/microsoft/windowsservercore/) images still have the performance problem that was initially reported. We are working on updating Windows containers so that NGEN works as expected. You are recommended to use the [dotnet-framework/](https://hub.docker.com/r/microsoft/dotnet-framework/) base image if you can, so that you can get better performance.\r\n\r\nOne of the developers that reported the performance issue shared basic performance results. The first two rows are the before state. The last row is the dotnet-framework image after the fix. The improvement is quite significant.\r\n\r\n> Runing `powershell -command (measure-command { powershell -command exit }).TotalSeconds` in various images on our CI server produced this table of timings:\r\n \r\n| time (s) | image |\r\n|----------|--------|\r\n|10.7212372| microsoft/windowsservercore |\r\n|8.3278793  | microsoft/dotnet-framework:4.7|\r\n|0.6426073  | microsoft/dotnet-framework:4.7 (after fix)|\r\n"},{"Id":"6645912196","Type":"IssuesEvent","CreatedAt":"2017-09-27T19:47:08","Actor":"terrajobst","Repository":"dotnet/announcements","Organization":"dotnet","RawContent":null,"RelatedAction":"opened","RelatedUrl":"https://github.com/dotnet/announcements/issues/32","RelatedDescription":"Opened issue \".NET Framework 4.7.1 provides built-in support for .NET Standard 2.0\" (#32) at dotnet/announcements","RelatedBody":"## Summary\r\n\r\n.NET Framework 4.7.1 will have built-in support for .NET Standard 2.0.

In fact, .NET Framework 4.6.1 was shipped before .NET Standard 2.0 was even designed. That's why building an application targeting .NET Framework 4.6.1 (as well as 4.6.2 and 4.7) will have to deploy additional files.\r\n\r\n* If you use **Visual Studio 2017 15.3** or higher, these files are automatically copied to the application's output folder.\r\n\r\n* If you use **Visual Studio 2015 and [use NuGet 3.6][nuget36]**, we'll prompt you to install a [support package][vs2015support] which will handle copying the files to the output directory.\r\n\r\nStarting with .NET Framework 4.7.1 these files no longer have to be deployed with the application -- they are built right into the .NET Framework itself.\r\n\r\n.NET Framework 4.7.1 also adds[about 200 missing APIs][missingapis] that were part of .NET Standard 2.0 but not actually implemented by .NET Framework 4.6.1, 4.6.2 or 4.7.\r\n\r\nThis also removes the need for [binding redirects][netfx-issues] when using .NET Standard libraries on .NET Framework because the CLR automatically unifies version numbers of assemblies that are part of the platform.\r\n\r\nLearn more [by reading the .NET Standard FAQ](http://aka.ms/netstandardfaq).\r\n\r\n## Discussion\r\n\r\nDiscussion\r\n\r\nFor a discussion, please go to dotnet/standard#514.\r\n\r\n[ns20post]: https://blogs.msdn.microsoft.com/dotnet/2017/08/14/announcing-net-standard-2-0/\r\n[nstable]: https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/standard/net-standard\r\n[nuget36]: https://dist.nuget.org/visualstudio-2015-vsix/v3.6.0/NuGet.Tools.vsix\r\n[vs2015support]: https://aka.ms/netstandard-build-support-netfx\r\n[missingapis]: https://github.com/dotnet/standard/blob/master/netstandard/src/ApiCompatBaseline.net461.txt\r\n[netfx-issues]: https://github.com/dotnet/standard/issues/481\r\n[video]: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u67Eu_IgEMs\r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/dotnet/standard/issues/514"}],"ResultType":"GitHubEvent"},"CoreCLR":{"Events":[{"Id":"6807765002","Type":"IssuesEvent","CreatedAt":"2017-11-03T21:18:34","Actor":"BruceForstall","Repository":"dotnet/coreclr","Organization":"dotnet","RawContent":null,"RelatedAction":"opened","RelatedUrl":"https://github.com/dotnet/coreclr/issues/14856","RelatedDescription":"Opened issue \"[RyuJIT/arm32][GCStress=C] Failures in GCStress run\" (#14856) at dotnet/coreclr","RelatedBody":"ARM GCStress=C test run in CI:\r\n\r\nhttps://ci.dot.net/job/dotnet_coreclr/job/master/job/jitstress/job/arm_cross_checked_windows_nt_gcstress0xc_prtest/2/consoleText\r\n\r\n6995 failures, 6731 with `!CREATE_CHECK_STRING(!\"Detected use of a corrupted OBJECTREF.

However, it does some extra work which we don't need when just trying to find the info for an IP which was causing it to be much slower than it needs to be.\r\n\r\nThis change adds a new routine to get the `unw_proc_info_t`. This is used in the case where we are just trying to find the MethodInfo for a PC. Before, we were unnecessarily allocating stack space for a full-on REGDISPLAY which was all zeroes except for the IP portion, and then (after cursor initialization) copying the zeroed registers to the unwind cursor which didn't serve any purpose since all we wanted was the proc info.\r\n\r\nI've been measuring the performance using a simple allocation benchmark to which I added 100 threads that are just waiting (but will still get scanned during GCs). The total duration to run the benchmark goes down about 16% with just this one change. The gains are obviously smaller with fewer threads, but still very significant. Profiling data revealed that the extra work removed by this change accounted for roughly a quarter of what was being done by the `GcScanRootsWorker`, so we get a sizeable perf gain there.\r\n\r\nThis is only the first change I'm making in this area.
