Notably the shift to having a declarative language like XAML which uses data binding on attributes like 'ItemSource' or 'Visibility' instead of allowing code to reside inside those templates. It promotes the separation of business logic from residing within the template and makes it more readable for programmers/designers. In the field, I've observed that pure web designers on teams are often discouraged or restricted from committing changes to templates that have languages injected into them which makes them more dependent on developers to make cosmetic changes. Personally, I don't enjoy having two languages in the same file (even in vuejs or angular) and wish it followed the XAML/XAML.cs style. On the other hand, I understand the convenience of having them within the same file, but I do not agree with mixing the languages (one of the main reasons I don't prefer react).\r\n\r\nI understand that Blazor uses the Razor templating engine and we are currently restricted to what it offers. IMO, since Razor templates only work on the server, I would relate them to server-side frameworks like jinja2 or Django templates. These frameworks address a different use case of back-end engineers optionally sending parts of HTML to the client and doesn't tool for SPAs. I understand the convience of using it as the engine but I do not think its practices migrate well to a client UI framework.\r\n\r\nSince there seems to be a strong tension to have a story for migrating Razor users and templates to Blazor, I would suggest investing in a layer of abstraction where other template engines may be exchanged from the one out of the box. I'd personally invest a large quantity of development time to make sure that a pure attribute option become available.","Url":"https://github.com/aspnet/Blazor/issues/1739","RelatedDescription":"Open issue \"HTML-only templates or plugin-based templating engine\" (#1739)"},{"Id":"386145166","IsPullRequest":false,"CreatedAt":"2018-11-30T11:16:02","Actor":"SamVogelskamp","Number":"1738","RawContent":null,"Title":"[Suggestion] Add ability to rename Context in component itself","State":"open","Body":"An attribute along the lines of\r\n\r\n```\r\n[Context=\"Item\"]\r\n@SomeRenderFragment(someVariable)\r\n```\r\n\r\nwould make the page using the component way cleaner in my opinion.","Url":"https://github.com/aspnet/Blazor/issues/1738","RelatedDescription":"Open issue \"[Suggestion] Add ability to rename Context in component itself\" (#1738)"},{"Id":"385953455","IsPullRequest":false,"CreatedAt":"2018-11-29T22:25:11","Actor":"rodolfograve","Number":"1737","RawContent":null,"Title":"Component does not update DOM on a specific scenario","State":"open","Body":"With the following component I'm trying to apply a transformation to the value in the input.

All it contains is just a basic div. For example:\r\n`Field.cshtml` in _MyComponents_\r\n```\r\n@inherits Base.BaseField\r\n<div class=\"@ClassMapper.Class\">\r\n    @ChildContent\r\n</div>\r\n```\r\nEverything good so far, it renders, and it's all good.\r\n\r\nBUT, here is the problem, if I want to extend the Field component in another components library, let's say that this time I want it to contain a `Label`. I cannot do that. If I wan't custom logic in this new library then I must create a new `Field.cshtml` and write everything, than I have to delete `Field` from by base _MyComponents_ library because it will mess with the new component.\r\n\r\nThis is an implementation of `Field.cshtml` in _MyComponents.Bootstrap_ library:\r\n```\r\n@inherits BootstrapBase.BaseBootstrapField\r\n<div class=\"@ClassMapper.Class\">\r\n    @if ( Label != null )\r\n    {\r\n        <FieldLabel>@Label</FieldLabel>\r\n    }\r\n    @ChildContent\r\n</div>\r\n```\r\nIt would be great If for example I could just inherit Field automatically, maybe if both libraries share the same component names that they would combine.\r\n\r\nI propose two way how to do it. Maybe :)\r\n\r\nFirst, here is the main `Field.cshtml` in _MyComponents_\r\n```\r\n@inherits Base.BaseField\r\n<div class=\"@ClassMapper.Class\">\r\n    @ChildContent\r\n</div>\r\n```\r\n\r\n**Suggestion 1**: do it automatically based on the component name\r\n`Field.cshtml` in _MyComponents.Bootstrap_\r\n```\r\n@if ( Label != null )\r\n{\r\n    <FieldLabel>@Label</FieldLabel>\r\n}\r\n@ChildContent\r\n```\r\n\r\n**Suggestion 2**: explicitly say that it is inherited from `Field.cshtml` in _MyComponents.Bootstrap_\r\n```\r\n@inherits MyComponents.Field\r\n@if ( Label != null )\r\n{\r\n    <FieldLabel>@Label</FieldLabel>\r\n}\r\n@ChildContent\r\n```\r\n\r\n**Expected result:**\r\n```\r\n<div class=\"field\">\r\n    <label class=\"label\">Hello label</label>\r\n    Hello field\r\n</div>\r\n```","Url":"https://github.com/aspnet/Blazor/issues/1736","RelatedDescription":"Open issue \"[Suggestion] Better components inheritance\" (#1736)"},{"Id":"385701516","IsPullRequest":false,"CreatedAt":"2018-11-29T11:57:29","Actor":"montyclt","Number":"1735","RawContent":null,"Title":"Don't build if used any of not supported API","State":"open","Body":"The Blazor FAQs says:\r\n\r\n> Yes, the .NET runtime used for Blazor supports .NET Standard 2.0.
