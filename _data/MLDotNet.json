It was a \"restricted\" row cursor that allowed inspection but not movement. Nearly all of our transforms perform their data transformations through this mechanism, which is fine.\r\n\r\n2. It was a convenient way to store what amounted to a property bag that had the benefit of using the `IDataView` type system and familiar APIs.\r\n\r\nThe trouble was, that for scenario 2 it would have been incredibly awkward to have `IRow` be disposable. But for scenario 1 we absolutely required it. So we did awkward things like this:\r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/dotnet/machinelearning/blob/521acad830408b43175821575f5f774629aeafe7/src/Microsoft.ML.Core/Data/ISchemaBindableMapper.cs#L116\r\n\r\n\"Here's a `Row`, and by the way, when you're done, if this thing is non-null, you should treat it as disposable.\" Kind of silly. But this was able to be done, because these `Row` objects were \"driving\" `RowCursor` implementations, and those were disposable, so we were able to hide this complexity from people. But, since `Row` must be a public type in our API (just as `RowCursor` must be), we must change it.\r\n\r\nWe have now actually resolved scenario 2 by inventing a new type of container, called `Metadata`, that operates *kind of* like a `Row`, but isn't quite one. And this leaves us free now, I think, to make `Row` disposable.\r\n\r\n* Anything that is still a `Row` that should become a `Metadata` should start being a `Metadata`. (This includes anything that currently yields `Row`s that are understood by convention to be immovable and where all columns are active... that is, simple property bags.)\r\n\r\n* Much of the disposer logic currently on `RowCursor` can be moved to `Row`.\r\n\r\n* Implement [dispose pattern](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/standard/design-guidelines/dispose-pattern) on `Row`.\r\n\r\nThis issue is an explication of a minor subpoint of #1532 .","Url":"https://github.com/dotnet/machinelearning/issues/1824","RelatedDescription":"Open issue \"Make Row Disposable\" (#1824)"},{"Id":"387138214","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2018-12-04T21:08:40","Actor":"TomFinley","Number":"1814","RawContent":null,"Title":"Cleanup of IRowCursor and related interfaces.
