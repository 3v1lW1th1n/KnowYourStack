I was under the impression that public types get their type forwards automatically generated and manual entries only are required for internal types referenced by name.\r\n\r\nThis breaks [ControlBindingsCollection](https://github.com/dotnet/winforms/blob/master/src/System.Windows.Forms/src/System/Windows/Forms/ControlBindingsCollection.cs#L15) which has an EditorAttribute referencing UITypeEditor itself. Technically this attribute is pretty much a no-op, its only effect is that a non-null editor is returned from TypeDescriptor.GetEditor but the editor itself has all methods no-op.\r\n\r\nEither case I think the type forward for UITypeEditor should be put in place anyways, not just for attributes referencing by string but for general compatibility, since its a public type.\r\n\r\n**Actual behavior:**\r\nUITypeEditor does not type forward even though its a public type\r\n\r\n**Expected behavior:**\r\nUITypeEditor should type forward from System.Drawing.Design facade to System.Windows.Forms.Design.
