In the rest of Angular (i.e. using DI) the\r\n`LOCALE_ID` token has a provider that also calls setLocaleId() to\r\nensure that ivy has the same value.\r\n\r\nThis commit defines `getDocument()` and `setDocument() `top-level\r\nfunctions for ivy.

This is because the `async` pipe emits `null` if the underlying observable has not emitted yet. Therefore using the `async` pipe with an input that does not accept `null` will result in a compilation error.\r\n\r\n@devversion has done a [more detailed write-up](https://hackmd.io/pg7MuPv3RVeeNjMGrwYoTQ) of this issue. I'm including a summary of the possible solutions here, but please refer to the write-up for more details.\r\n\r\n### Describe the solution you'd like\r\nThe ideal solution would be to make `async` pipe not emit until the underlying observable emits, however this would likely be a fairly breaking change. It would probably need to be done in a phased manner, while introducing something like `asyncEager` that maintains the old behavior to make migration easier.\r\n\r\n### Describe alternatives you've considered\r\n1. An option that would split the responsibility for fixing between framework and libraries is to introduce something like `@RequiredInput(fallbackValue)` that automatically replaces `null` with `fallbackValue`. Libraries could then update their inputs to use `@RequiredInput` when `null` is not expected.\r\n\r\n2. Another option that would place the responsibility on libraries is to ask them to just handle `null` and allow it to be passed in the template even if its not part of the input's official type (using `static ngAcceptInputType_*`)\r\n\r\n3. Finally, a third alternative is to just pass the responsibility down to the app developer to fill in a default: `[someInput]=\"(value$ | async) || defaultValue\"`","Url":"https://github.com/angular/angular/issues/33704","RelatedDescription":"Open issue \"Decide how to reconcile `async` pipe with strict template type checking\" (#33704)"},{"Id":"520283718","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2019-11-08T23:38:48","Actor":"kara","Number":"33703","RawContent":null,"Title":"docs: add AOT mode default to version 9 upgrade doc","State":"closed","Body":"","Url":"https://github.com/angular/angular/pull/33703","RelatedDescription":"Closed or merged PR \"docs: add AOT mode default to version 9 upgrade doc\" (#33703)"},{"Id":"520278378","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2019-11-08T23:14:44","Actor":"mhevery","Number":"33702","RawContent":null,"Title":"Transplant views refactor","State":"open","Body":"Based on https://github.com/angular/angular/pull/33644 (please ignore during review)\r\n\r\n## PR Checklist\r\nPlease check if your PR fulfills the following requirements:\r\n\r\n- [X] The commit message follows our guidelines: https://github.com/angular/angular/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md#commit\r\n- [X] Tests for the changes have been added (for bug fixes / features)\r\n- [X] Docs have been added / updated (for bug fixes / features)\r\n\r\n\r\n## PR Type\r\nWhat kind of change does this PR introduce?\r\n\r\n<!-- Please check the one that applies to this PR using \"x\". -->\r\n\r\n- [X] Bugfix/Performance\r\n- [ ] Feature\r\n- [ ] Code style update (formatting, local variables)\r\n- [ ] Refactoring (no functional changes, no api changes)\r\n- [ ] Build related changes\r\n- [ ] CI related changes\r\n- [ ] Documentation content changes\r\n- [ ] angular.io application / infrastructure changes\r\n- [ ] Other...

I eventually stumbled into the solution in a non-official Angular article by Tero Parviainen (@teropa) [SVG AND CANVAS GRAPHICS IN ANGULAR 2](https://teropa.info/blog/2016/12/12/graphics-in-angular-2.html).  I had seen the article in other Google search results, but I ignored it because I'm using Angular 8 and I was told a lot had changed in Angular since version 2.\r\n\r\nThe answer turns out to be: `<svg:text>`.  I assumed Angular 8 supports SVG and HTML equally, since this was heavily advertised. While you can have .SVG files as templates, they won’t work unless the markup is either enclosed within an `<svg>` tag or they are explicitly decorated with the `svg:` namespace. Why can’t the compiler infer the schema from the “.svg” suffix? Another gotcha is that you can’t bind to SVG parameters because they're not universally supported by all browsers. Consequently, you will need to add the “attr:” to hint the compiler that it’s an attribute, not a parameter. \r\n\r\nAngular is supposed to be a framework to abstract these nasty details from the developer to increase productivity by reducing complexity. If you have to spend hours figuring out a leaky abstraction as in the aforementioned svg issue, then what’s the point of Angular? It’s just another layer of fecal matter upon layers of fecal matter that eventually petrifies under its own weight into matter too hard to comprehend.\r\n\r\nShame upon the Angular development team!

creating a library-only project","State":"open","Body":"\r\n# 🚀 feature request\r\n\r\n### Relevant Package\r\n@angular/cli\r\n\r\n### Description\r\nThe documentation around library creation[ suggests](https://angular.io/guide/creating-libraries#use-typescript-path-mapping-for-peer-dependencies) listing all @angular/* dependencies as peer dependencies. \r\n\r\n#### Problem\r\nBut, the user has to do this manually.\r\n\r\n#### Solution\r\n\r\nI suggest that if you are creating a library only project via the ng commands, Angular should do this for the user automatically in the tsconfig.json along with a code comment describing why and pointing them to the relevant documentation.\r\n\r\nHere's an example creating a library this way as described in [Angular Workspace: No Application for You!](https://blog.angularindepth.com/angular-workspace-no-application-for-you-4b451afcc2ba)\r\n\r\nng new foo-lib --create-application=false\r\ncd foo-lib\r\nng generate library foo-lib --prefix=foo\r\n\r\n\r\n### Describe alternatives you've considered\r\n\r\n- Have the ng build command for a library inform the user that they should really set the @angular packages as peer dependencies and point them to the relevant documentation.\r\n- Have users search StackOverflow when they run into a problem and are scratching their heads about a mismatched dependency.\r\n\r\n","Url":"https://github.com/angular/angular-cli/issues/16124","RelatedDescription":"Open issue \"Preset @angular/* peer dependencies when creating a library-only project\"

I would like to propose a small enhancement for copying items from list to list. Currently copying works great, but after item is dragged to another list, initial list removes it from itself and bind it to root element (body tag in my case). But way that I see more logical is to add boolean @Input (let's name it cdkDropListCopyMode) to drop list directive to make it possible to choose conditionally whether you want to move items and leave default behavior or to copy items and avoid removing item from initial list.\r\n\r\n#### Use Case\r\n\r\nIn my project I have list of items (initial list) and sublist constructor (destination list). Initial list is fluid, and if one item from this list is removed, items after this item seek to fill free place one by one, and after you release item it appears in initial list again, and this flickering looks odd.\r\n\r\nP.S. I saw your comment in source code that you move the element out at the end of the body and make it hidden, because keeping it in place will throw off the consumer's `:last-child` selectors, but I believe that it shouldn't be a problem as well. Also I've been tracking #13100 until it was automatically closed, but this behavior is still not fixed. If you need help with it, just let me know.\r\n","Url":"https://github.com/angular/components/issues/17638","RelatedDescription":"Open issue \"CDK drag and drop: add ability to drag item in copy mode without changing initial list\" (#17638)"},{"Id":"519176326","IsPullRequest":false,"CreatedAt":"2019-11-07T10:27:26","Actor":"vdjhards","Number":"17637","RawContent":null,"Title":"Directionality service to monitor dynamic changes to the 'dir' attribute at the top-level.","State":"open","Body":"Use StackBlitz to reproduce your issue: https://stackblitz.com/edit/flexlayoutgap-with-rtl-with-wrong-direction\r\n\r\n**Steps to reproduce:**\r\n1) First Inspect the TopbarLeft div and see that it gives the margin-right 5px as it is mention in fxLayoutGap=\"5px\" in parent div\r\n\r\n2) Now Click On 'Toggle Direction' Button (you can see that its direction has been changed to RTL)\r\n\r\n\r\n**Expected Behavior**\r\n\r\nWhat behavior were you expecting to see?\r\n\r\nAs per the FlexLayout documentation if i use RTL on body tag then my direction will change to rtl and the fxLayoutGap=\"5px\" will render to margin-left:5px to its child div.\r\n\r\n\r\n**Actual Behavior**\r\n\r\nWhat behavior did you actually see?\r\n\r\nI am not getting the desired result.
