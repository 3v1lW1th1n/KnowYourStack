Instead of a dictionary of types that it applies to, this adds an overload to OpenXmlElement to handle any strict translation needed by the attributes. This way, the type itself can opt into any strict translation that it requires.\r\n\r\nFixes #480"},{"Id":"7635081007","Type":"IssuesEvent","CreatedAt":"2018-05-07T00:45:34","Actor":"tomjebo","Repository":"OfficeDev/Open-XML-SDK","Organization":"OfficeDev","RawContent":null,"RelatedAction":"closed","RelatedUrl":"https://github.com/OfficeDev/Open-XML-SDK/issues/480","RelatedDescription":"Closed issue \"static method AttributeTranslator.DicOfTranslators is not thread safe\" (#480) at OfficeDev/Open-XML-SDK","RelatedBody":"![default](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/991922/38667774-f6e171e8-3e4a-11e8-929a-48dfa5398f2d.png)\r\nWhen loading excel files from different threads this method can be executed at same time.
