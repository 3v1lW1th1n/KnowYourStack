I've looked at every example I can find for anomaly detection and they all follow the pattern of having some dataset that the anomaly detector examines to see what anomalies it can find within that data set.\r\n\r\nMy needs are different than that. I want to provide the anomaly detector a set of data that has no anomalies. This dataset should be used to train and create a model for comparison against a second data sets to see what anomalies it detects in this second data set. \r\n\r\nThus far, my attempts have ended up with an anomaly detector that finds \"anomalies\" in my first data set, which is not valid in my scenario. The first data set should be considered all valid (non-anomaly) values, no matter what seemingly spikes or change points may exist within it. The second data set should be examined for spikes or change points through the lens of was seen in the first data set.\r\n\r\nCan this be done?
