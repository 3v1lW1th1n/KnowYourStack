Service is prepended in the hungarian-like system I like, but it also has to be appended to comply with angular convention.\r\n3 - it doesn't seem possible to programmatically or humanly know whether a folder under app refers to a component, service, module...by looking at the folder name when generating a non-flat entity.\r\n\r\n### Describe the solution you'd like\r\n<!-- ✍️--> If you have a solution in mind, please describe it.\r\n1 - An option to have the files generated with flipped naming like component.x.ts and service.y.ts\r\n2 - A different option to allow type to be added to the folder name without redundancy.

For example, we have Shop part and Settings part in our app. I think it would be nice to compile components in shop part in some child zone of angular zone like `shop`. Settings part would be compiled in `settings` zone. Also, it would be nice to allow create hierarchy of zones. Like shop/cart or shop/sales or settings/profile, settings/subscription, settings/cards etc. Also, you can have shared reusable component which is used in settings and in shop modules. It would be compiled in settings/list and shop/list zones.\r\n\r\nWhat are profits:\r\n- easily debug how your application works (for example you have shared service with business logic or logger service and you can understand context in methods of such services).\r\n- track contexts of API requests (for example in our app we have tons of requests and we can implement some monitoring on server side. we use such feature in AngularJS part of our application).\r\n\r\n### Describe the solution you'd like\r\n<!-- ✍️--> If you have a solution in mind, please describe it.\r\n\r\nExample:\r\n\r\n```\r\n@Component({\r\n  selector: `app-shop-container`,\r\n  template: `\r\n    <app-profile-data></app-profile-data>\r\n    <app-shop-cart></app-shop-cart>\r\n    <app-shop-sales></app-shop-sales>\r\n    <app-shop-goods></app-shop-goods>\r\n  `,\r\n  zone: `shop`\r\n})\r\nexport class ShopCart {\r\n}\r\n\r\n@Component({\r\n  selector: `app-shop-cart`,\r\n  template: `\r\n    <div></div>\r\n  `,\r\n  zone: `cart`\r\n})\r\nexport class ShopCart {\r\n  ngAfterViewInit() {\r\n    fetchCart(); // this would be in zone shop/cart\r\n  }\r\n}\r\n\r\n@Component({\r\n  selector: `app-shop-goods`,\r\n  template: `\r\n    <div></div>\r\n  `\r\n})\r\nexport class ShopGoods {\r\n  ngAfterViewInit() {\r\n    fetchGoods(); // this would be in zone shop (since we don't have zone property in decorator\r\n  }\r\n}\r\n\r\n\r\n@Component({\r\n  selector: `app-settings-container`,\r\n  template: `\r\n    <app-profile-data></app-profile-data>\r\n    <app-profile-edit></app-profile-edit>\r\n  `\r\n  zone: `settings`\r\n})\r\nexport class ShopGoods {\r\n  ngAfterViewInit() {\r\n    fetchSomething(); // this would be in zone settings\r\n  }\r\n}\r\n\r\n@Component({\r\n  selector: `app-profile-data`,\r\n  template: `\r\n    <app-profile-data></app-profile-data>\r\n    <app-profile-edit></app-profile-edit>\r\n  `\r\n  zone: `profile-data`\r\n})\r\nexport class ShopGoods {\r\n  ngAfterViewInit() {\r\n    fetchProfile(); // this would be in zone settings/profile-data or shop/profile-data (it depends on place where component is rendered: in shop module, or in settings module\r\n  }\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nAll of these zones are children of `angular` zone, so they would not affect change detection, rendering and others.\r\n\r\nI think it could be made by improvement of Component/Directive decorators. `zone` properties should be added there. This properties should somehow be stored in views which are created when application compiles. For example, in `view.zone` property. And final point that ngfactories of views/components (if I remember correctly it is about `view.def.updateDirectives`) should be called in `view.zone` zone. If zone was not passed to Component/Directive decorator, then zone from parent view would be in created view.\r\n\r\nIf anybody will use something like `NgZone.isInAngularZone` method in such zones he will get same result as now, since all of created zones are children of `angular` zone.\r\n\r\n### Describe alternatives you've considered\r\n<!-- ✍️--> Have you considered any alternative solutions or workarounds?\r\n\r\nOur team tried some ways. I will describe one of them, which was the closest.\r\n\r\nWe tried to create our own decorator like Component which will call constructor and patch methods of the component. Patched methods are same methods, but with `zone.run` wrapper. Such decorator was able to accept `zoneName` property. This way does not work, since we got exception on AOT build.\r\n\r\nAny way, this way is not what we need there. If I remember correctly, there was not any problem with calling `cdr.detectChanges` manually. Zones were correct in child components. But if component was created after calling `appRef.tick`, then zone was not correct (`angular` zone). It happened because some other part of application triggered `tick` and `changeDetection` from root.\r\n\r\nTrying to run `appRef.tick` in some specific zone is not correct, since change detection in whole application would be performed in some specific zone.\r\n\r\nSeems to me, correct way to solve the problem is running ngfactories of components in needed zones.

There in, I use the replace feature to replace different manifest and index files depending on the configuration I choose when I build/serve the project.\r\n\r\nI would like to add a version field to the manifest and index meta tags. But I don't like having to change all 8 files every time I update the version number.\r\n\r\n### Describe the solution you'd like\r\n<!-- ✍️--> If you have a solution in mind, please describe it.\r\n\r\nIdeally I would like the ability to tell CLI to insert a version number which would be set in one location into each specified file, somehow, so I don't have to do it manually.\r\n\r\nAlong with the different configurations and file replacement properties in the angular.json file... perhaps add the ability to do string find/replace on specified files from a given source.\r\n\r\n### Describe alternatives you've considered\r\n<!-- ✍️--> Have you considered any alternative solutions or workarounds?\r\nThe only alternative I have seen would be to use php or some other back end scripting language to compile the html and manifest files. But since this is fairly basic variable insertions adding in the overhead of a backend script compiler seemed a bit overkill. Especially since the variable insertion does not need to be dynamic after the build/serve command is run.","Url":"https://github.com/angular/angular-cli/issues/15347","RelatedDescription":"Open issue \"Add ability to compile/generate asset files\" (#15347)"},{"Id":"480541771","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2019-08-15T16:55:13","Actor":"simjes","Number":"15330","RawContent":null,"Title":"refactor(@angular-devkit/schematics): remove optimize from host-tree","State":"closed","Body":"Remove unused optimize method marked for removal in version 7.0","Url":"https://github.com/angular/angular-cli/pull/15330","RelatedDescription":"Closed or merged PR \"refactor(@angular-devkit/schematics): remove optimize from host-tree\" (#15330)"},{"Id":"481241601","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2019-08-15T16:54:48","Actor":"alan-agius4","Number":"15346","RawContent":null,"Title":"build: update angular packages to version 9","State":"open","Body":"","Url":"https://github.com/angular/angular-cli/pull/15346","RelatedDescription":"Open PR \"build: update angular packages to version 9\" (#15346)"},{"Id":"480998405","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2019-08-15T16:54:29","Actor":"renovate-bot","Number":"15338","RawContent":null,"Title":"build: update @bazel/buildifier to version ^0.28.0","State":"closed","Body":"This PR contains the following updates:\n\n| Package | Type | Update | Change |\n|---|---|---|---|\n| [@bazel/buildifier](https://togithub.com/bazelbuild/rules_nodejs) | devDependencies | minor | [`^0.26.0` -> `^0.28.0`](https://renovatebot.com/diffs/npm/@bazel%2fbuildifier/0.26.0/0.28.0) |\n| [@bazel/jasmine](https://togithub.com/bazelbuild/rules_nodejs) | devDependencies | minor | [`0.35.0` -> `0.36.0`](https://renovatebot.com/diffs/npm/@bazel%2fjasmine/0.35.0/0.36.0) |\n| [@bazel/karma](https://togithub.com/bazelbuild/rules_nodejs) | devDependencies | minor | [`0.35.0` -> `0.36.0`](https://renovatebot.com/diffs/npm/@bazel%2fkarma/0.35.0/0.36.0) |\n| [@bazel/typescript](https://togithub.com/bazelbuild/rules_nodejs) | devDependencies | minor | [`0.35.0` -> `0.36.0`](https://renovatebot.com/diffs/npm/@bazel%2ftypescript/0.35.0/0.36.0) |\n| [build_bazel_rules_nodejs](https://togithub.com/bazelbuild/rules_nodejs) | http_archive | minor | [`0.35.0` -> `0.36.0`](https://renovatebot.com/diffs/npm/bazelbuild%2frules_nodejs/0.35.0/0.36.0) |\n\n---\n\n### Release Notes\n\n<details>\n<summary>bazelbuild/rules_nodejs</summary>\n\n### [`v0.28.0`](https://togithub.com/bazelbuild/rules_nodejs/releases/0.28.0)\n\n[Compare Source](https://togithub.com/bazelbuild/rules_nodejs/compare/0.26.0...0.28.0)\n\n### BREAKING CHANGES\n\n-   `npm_package` now throws for any files in `srcs` which do not reside in the same package as the target.

Especially with the differences in the width of the previews.\r\n\r\n#### Reproduction\r\n\r\nhttps://stackblitz.com/edit/angular-suzb2h\r\n\r\n#### Environment\r\n\r\n- Angular: latest \r\n- CDK/Material: latest\r\n- Browser(s): All\r\n- Operating System (e.g. Windows, macOS, Ubuntu): All\r\n","Url":"https://github.com/angular/components/issues/16769","RelatedDescription":"Open issue \"Drag&Drop Drop List Dynamic Preview\" (#16769)"},{"Id":"480332838","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2019-08-13T19:40:03","Actor":"andrewseguin","Number":"16766","RawContent":null,"Title":"feat(material-experimental/mdc-button): support disabled FAB","State":"open","Body":"","Url":"https://github.com/angular/components/pull/16766","RelatedDescription":"Open PR \"feat(material-experimental/mdc-button): support disabled FAB\" (#16766)"},{"Id":"480265125","IsPullRequest":false,"CreatedAt":"2019-08-13T17:24:40","Actor":"Dileep-raja","Number":"16765","RawContent":null,"Title":"Angular Material unit testing search filter data?","State":"closed","Body":"applyFilter(filterValue: string) {\r\n    console.log(\"filter data\"+filterValue)\r\n    this.dataSource.filter = filterValue.trim().toLocaleLowerCase();\r\n    if (this.paginator) {\r\n      this.dataSource.paginator.firstPage();\r\n    }\r\n  }\r\n\r\nAny help how to write unit test for this function?","Url":"https://github.com/angular/components/issues/16765","RelatedDescription":"Closed issue \"Angular Material unit testing search filter data?\" (#16765)"},{"Id":"480224813","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2019-08-13T17:19:47","Actor":"devversion","Number":"16763","RawContent":null,"Title":"build: update to angular v8.2.2","State":"closed","Body":"* Updates to Angular v8.2.2\r\n* Updates the bazel tooling to the latest version (as discussed in https://github.com/angular/components/pull/16678)","Url":"https://github.com/angular/components/pull/16763","RelatedDescription":"Closed or merged PR \"build: update to angular v8.2.2\" (#16763)"},{"Id":"480230484","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2019-08-13T17:18:18","Actor":"devversion","Number":"16764","RawContent":null,"Title":"build: fix bazel not available if cache could not be restored","State":"closed","Body":"Currently the `setup_bazel_binary` script always runs before\r\nthe node modules are installed.
