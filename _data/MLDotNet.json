That way it'll be re-used by any thread or Http request in the ASP.NET Core app. See this code as an example: https://github.com/dotnet/machinelearning-samples/blob/master/samples/csharp/end-to-end-apps/Regression-SalesForecast/src/eShopDashboard/Startup.cs#L53\r\n\r\n**Main issue with the Prediction Function:**\r\nThe Prediction function is also \"expensive\" as it takes significant milliseconds when creating the prediction-function object from the model-object with the `model.MakePredictionFunction()` method. \r\nIdeally, because it is \"expensive\", it should be re-used across executions in the same app. But since it is not thread-safe, the current options in an ASP.NET Core web app are the following:\r\n\r\n**- OPTION 1:** Register the PredictionFunction object as **Scoped** (`AddScoped()`) for its DI/IoC object lifetime, as in this code:\r\nhttps://github.com/dotnet/machinelearning-samples/blob/master/samples/csharp/end-to-end-apps/Regression-SalesForecast/src/eShopDashboard/Startup.cs#L61\r\n\r\nBut, the problem with this approach is that in many of the cases you don't get much benefit unless within the same Http request you make multiple calls to the .Predict() method. The point is that since the Scope lifetime is only re-used within a single Http request, for most of the Http requests it'll need to call the model.MakePredictionFunction() method.\r\n\r\nThe only way to share an object across Http requests in .NET Core DI/IoC is with singleton, but that requires the object to be thread-safe.\r\n\r\nThe possible service/object lifetimes in .NET Core IoC/DI are:\r\n- Singleton (shared across all threads)\r\n- Transient (per object call/new)\r\n- Scoped (Per Http request of object scope)\r\n\r\nSee the available object lifetimes here:\r\nhttps://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/aspnet/core/fundamentals/dependency-injection?view=aspnetcore-2.1#service-lifetimes\r\nhttps://blogs.msdn.microsoft.com/cesardelatorre/2017/01/26/comparing-asp-net-core-ioc-service-life-times-and-autofac-ioc-instance-scopes/ (Autofac does support Thread Scope, though..)\r\n\r\n**- OPTION 2:** Register the PredictionFunction object as **Singleton** (`AddSingleton()`) for its DI/IoC object lifetime, as in this code (Commented line):\r\nhttps://github.com/dotnet/machinelearning-samples/blob/master/samples/csharp/end-to-end-apps/Regression-SalesForecast/src/eShopDashboard/Startup.cs#L60\r\n\r\n**Benefits:** If you register the prediction-function object as Singleton for its ASP.NET Core DI/IoC object lifetime, since it is Singleton, any new Http request (except the first Http request since the app started) will just use the prediction function by calling the `Predict()` method. Therefore the performance of a single Http request would be significantly better. \r\n\r\n**Problem:** However, the issue with this approach is that since the prediction function is not thread-safe, you need to use mechanisms like a critical section to lock the prediction function object to be used by a single thread when executing the `Predict()` method, like in this code (Commented line):\r\nhttps://github.com/dotnet/machinelearning-samples/blob/master/samples/csharp/end-to-end-apps/Regression-SalesForecast/src/eShopDashboard/Controllers/CountrySalesForecastController.cs#L57 \r\n\r\nThe issue with this approach is that since you are limiting the use of \"Predict()\" to a single thread, that will be a bottleneck when scaling. In the cases when you could have many concurrent Http requests and many of them trying to run the Predict() method, the scalability won't be as good as it could be because we're limiting that code execution to a single thread able to run the Predict() method. \r\n\r\nBasically, with this approach you might significantly limiting the scalability of the app (in regards the model execution/scoring) across threads when having many Http requests.\r\n\r\n**Workarounds:** Currently, use any of the two mentioned methods, being aware of the handicaps from each:\r\n- PredictionFunction as Scoped object\r\n- Predictionfunction as Singleton but using critical section when running \"Predict()\"\r\n\r\n**Long term solutions:**\r\nI see two possible solutions:\r\n\r\n1. Create an object pooling of \"prediction function objects\". That way, most Http requests won't need to call the \"expensive\" `.CreatePredictionFunction()` method while it would be scalable since many threads could be using the multiple objects available in the object pooling.\r\n\r\n2. Make the prediction Function thread-safe. If the prediction-function was thread-safe while scalable enough, it could be simply registered as Singleton in the DI/IoC system in ASP.NET Core without needing to use a critical section or comparable approaches.\r\n\r\nIs there any other possible approach available?\r\n\r\nOnce these scenarios are further discussed in this thread or in our API reviews, I'll document the current possible approaches when consuming/running an ML.NET morel in an ASP.NET Core web app or Web API service.\r\n\r\nRelated issues:\r\nhttps://github.com/dotnet/machinelearning/issues/421 ","Url":"https://github.com/dotnet/machinelearning/issues/1718","RelatedDescription":"Open issue \"Need PredictionFunction to provide object-pooling or to be thread-safe\" (#1718)"},{"Id":"384069162","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2018-11-25T11:10:45","Actor":"jignparm","Number":"1717","RawContent":null,"Title":"Update to use OnnxRuntime library instead of Sonoma","State":"open","Body":"Fixes #1272.\r\nFixes #1228.\r\nFixes #1514\r\n\r\nReplaces the Microsoft.ML.Scoring library with the new Microsoft.ML.OnnxRuntime library.\r\n\r\nUpgraded runtime to Onnx 1.3, with isNan operator.\r\n\r\nDescriptive error messages instead of SEH exception.\r\n\r\nXML documentation for important classes and methods.\r\n\r\nAdds a full end-to-end example for users to start with.\r\n\r\n","Url":"https://github.com/dotnet/machinelearning/pull/1717","RelatedDescription":"Open PR \"Update to use OnnxRuntime library instead of Sonoma\" (#1717)"},{"Id":"383669020","IsPullRequest":false,"CreatedAt":"2018-11-22T22:55:28","Actor":"abgoswam","Number":"1715","RawContent":null,"Title":"Microsoft.ML.Samples does not have a TensorFlowTransform example","State":"open","Body":"Creating an issue to make the following updates to the TF Transform:\r\n\r\n- add mlcontext extension\r\n- add example to Microsoft.ML.Samples","Url":"https://github.com/dotnet/machinelearning/issues/1715","RelatedDescription":"Open issue \"Microsoft.ML.Samples does not have a TensorFlowTransform example\" (#1715)"},{"Id":"383667772","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2018-11-22T22:43:33","Actor":"abgoswam","Number":"1714","RawContent":null,"Title":"TensorFlowTransform unit tests should not use Legacy API","State":"open","Body":"TensorFlowTransform unit tests should not use Legacy API\r\n\r\nThis PR has the following changes:\r\n- Updated couple of TensorFlow tests to use new API. \r\n- Fix bug in ImagePixelExtractingEstimator.\r\n- Deleted redundant tests using Legacy API.\r\n\r\nCreated a separate issue #1715  to (1)  add mlcontext extension for TFTransform (2)  add TFTransform example to Microsoft.ML.Samples","Url":"https://github.com/dotnet/machinelearning/pull/1714","RelatedDescription":"Open PR \"TensorFlowTransform unit tests should not use Legacy API\" (#1714)"},{"Id":"383529757","IsPullRequest":false,"CreatedAt":"2018-11-22T13:11:20","Actor":"Vijay27anand","Number":"1713","RawContent":null,"Title":"How to use Feature selection ","State":"open","Body":"I want to use FeatureSelectorByMutualInformation feature selection, can you please provide me a sample code snippet how to use it with a dataset,  i could not able find in the samples provided.
