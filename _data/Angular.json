Bazel, determines the version to use for these locally built packages based on the latest tag for a commit on the current branch. (This works as expected during the release, because the packages are built on the correct branch with up-to-date tags.)\r\n\r\nDuring local development, however, this often leads to generating older versions than what the current `@angular/cli` version is compatible with, if the user has not fetched the latest tags from `angular/angular` or the branch has not been rebased recently.\r\n\r\nPreviously, the above (common) situation would result in a build error by the CLI. (Note that this would be a false error, because in this case the version set by bazel would not reflect the actual version of the local packages.) The solution would be for the user to fetch the latest tags from `angular/angular`, rebase their branch and run a bazel build again (ensuring that it would actually build anew and not emit cached artifacts).

Browsers know which module to load by the 'nomodule' and 'type=module' attributes.\r\n\r\nHowever this won't work for IE (Internet Explorer 10/11). \r\nIn order to enable IE support we need to add the essential polyfills in the polyfill.ts file and enable IE support in the browserslist configuration. \r\n\r\nThe issue here is, that after doing so, the polyfill-es2015 file will now be bloated with the polyfills imported only for IE.\r\n\r\nA simple reproduction can be achieved by creating a fresh project with the angular-cli and turn IE support on and off and look at the created polyfill files.\r\n\r\nThe results would be similar to this:\r\nno IE support:\r\npolyfill-ie5 - 638kB\r\npolyfill-ie2015 - 141kB\r\n\r\nwith IE support:\r\npolyfill-ie5 - 698kB\r\npolyfill-ie2015 - 532kB\r\n\r\nThis values will of course shrink when minified but the polyfil-es-2015 file will still be significantly larger with IE11 support active than without.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Describe the solution you'd like\r\nIt would be nice if the IE polyfills would only be loaded by IE or at least only by older browsers and not pollute the polyfill file which is meant for newer browsers. \r\n\r\nMaybe a Switch to determine if a polyfill is supposed to be provided for older or newer browsers (i.E an annotation if it is module or nomodule relevant).\r\n\r\n### Describe alternatives you've considered\r\n\r\nI've considered to create an IE-only polyfill file manually and load it by the index.html. simillar to the solution mentioned in Fabrizio Fortunatos blog post: https://izifortune.com/angular-polyfill-strategies/\r\n","Url":"https://github.com/angular/angular-cli/issues/16336","RelatedDescription":"Closed issue \"IE polyfills should not bloat polyfill file for newer browsers\" (#16336)"},{"Id":"530582341","IsPullRequest":false,"CreatedAt":"2019-12-02T14:47:47","Actor":"jorgeucano","Number":"16321","RawContent":null,"Title":"Schematics move function does not work in v9.rc4","State":"closed","Body":"<!--🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅\r\n\r\nOh hi there! 😄\r\n\r\nTo expedite issue processing please search open and closed issues before submitting a new one.\r\nExisting issues often contain information about workarounds, resolution, or progress updates.\r\n\r\n🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅-->\r\n\r\n\r\n# 🐞 Bug report\r\n\r\n### Command (mark with an `x`)\r\n<!-- Can you pin-point the command or commands that are effected by this bug? -->\r\n<!-- ✍️edit: -->\r\n\r\n- [ ] new\r\n- [ ] build\r\n- [ ] serve\r\n- [ ] test\r\n- [ ] e2e\r\n- [x] generate\r\n- [ ] add\r\n- [ ] update\r\n- [ ] lint\r\n- [ ] xi18n\r\n- [ ] run\r\n- [ ] config\r\n- [ ] help\r\n- [ ] version\r\n- [ ] doc\r\n\r\n\r\n### Is this a regression?\r\nno\r\n\r\n\r\n### Description\r\nUpdate my schematics to Angular 9rc4 and the move function does nothing.

Multi select prompt is just supported within angular cli > `9.0.0-rc.3`.\r\n\r\n### Description\r\n\r\nCreating an angular schematic that prompts the user for multiple options is possible since https://github.com/angular/angular-cli/issues/16104. The prompt works quite good now but using the command line for multi selections will cause an error:\r\n\r\n```text\r\nError: Schematic input does not validate against the Schema: {\"name\":\"paul\"}\r\nErrors:\r\n\r\n  Data path \".name\" should be array.\r\n...\r\n```\r\n\r\nAt first I opened an issue for the docs because I thought it's just not documented: https://github.com/angular/angular/issues/33851 But after checking the implementation of the angular guard schematic which has `--implements` parameter (which works) and creating the minimal reproduction repo (see underneath), I think it's a bug somewhere in `@angular-devkit/schematics-cli`. \r\n\r\n## 🔬 Minimal Reproduction\r\nI created a very minimal repo for reproduction:\r\nhttps://github.com/d-koppenhagen/ngx-multi-select-schematic\r\n\r\n```bash\r\nnpm i -g @angular-devkit/schematics-cli@next\r\ngit clone git@github.com:d-koppenhagen/ngx-multi-select-schematic.git\r\ncd ngx-multi-select-schematic\r\nnpm i\r\n```\r\n\r\n**✅ Using prompt works good:**\r\n```bash\r\nschematics .:hello --debug=false\r\n? Which interfaces would you like to implement? (Press <space> to select, <a> to toggle all, <\r\ni> to invert selection)\r\n❯◉ hans\r\n ◉ peter\r\n ◉ paul\r\nschematics .:hello --debug=false --name=\"paul, peter\"\r\n```\r\n\r\n**❌Using command line parameter fails (event not with just a single name handed over:**\r\n```text\r\nschematics .:hello --debug=false --name=\"paul\"\r\nError: Schematic input does not validate against the Schema: {\"name\":\"paul\"}\r\nErrors:\r\n\r\n  Data path \".name\" should be array.\r\n    at MapSubscriber.registry.compile.pipe.operators_1.map.result [as project]

But i think raw-loader should do it automatically instead of returning modules.\r\n![Снимок экрана 2019-11-29 в 13 43 10](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/15385798/69864622-6407d380-12b0-11ea-8243-601e786f4a2e.png)\r\n\r\n## 🔬 Minimal Reproduction\r\n<!--\r\nSimple steps to reproduce this bug.\r\n\r\nPlease include: commands run (including args), packages added, related code changes.\r\n\r\nIf reproduction steps are not enough for reproduction of your issue, please create a minimal GitHub repository with the reproduction of the issue. \r\nA good way to make a minimal reproduction is to create a new app via `ng new repro-app` and add the minimum possible code to show the problem. \r\nShare the link to the repo below along with step-by-step instructions to reproduce the problem, as well as expected and actual behavior.\r\n\r\nIssues that don't have enough info and can't be reproduced will be closed.\r\n\r\nYou can read more about issue submission guidelines here: https://github.com/angular/angular-cli/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md#-submitting-an-issue\r\n-->\r\nSorry, but there is no minimal reproduction.\r\n\r\n## 🔥 Exception or Error\r\n<pre><code>\r\n<!-- If the issue is accompanied by an exception or an error, please share it below: -->\r\n<!-- ✍️--> input.match is not a function\r\n\r\n</code></pre>\r\n\r\n\r\n## 🌍 Your Environment\r\n<pre><code>\r\n<!-- run `ng version` and paste output below -->\r\n<!-- ✍️-->\r\n\r\nAngular CLI: 9.0.0-rc.4\r\nNode: 12.13.1\r\nOS: darwin x64\r\n\r\nAngular: 9.0.0-rc.4\r\n... cdk, cli, common, compiler, compiler-cli, core, forms\r\n... platform-browser, platform-browser-dynamic, upgrade\r\nIvy Workspace: Yes\r\n\r\nPackage                           Version\r\n-----------------------------------------------------------\r\n@angular-devkit/architect         0.900.0-rc.4\r\n@angular-devkit/build-angular     0.900.0-rc.4\r\n@angular-devkit/build-optimizer   0.900.0-rc.4\r\n@angular-devkit/build-webpack     0.900.0-rc.4\r\n@angular-devkit/core              9.0.0-rc.4\r\n@angular-devkit/schematics        9.0.0-rc.4\r\n@ngtools/webpack                  9.0.0-rc.4\r\n@schematics/angular               9.0.0-rc.4\r\n@schematics/update                0.900.0-rc.4\r\nrxjs                              6.5.3\r\ntypescript                        3.6.4\r\nwebpack                           4.40.2\r\n\r\nall storybook packages: 5.3.0-beta.12\r\n\r\n</code></pre>\r\n\r\n**Anything else relevant?**\r\n<!-- ✍️Is this a browser specific issue?

It illustrates two use cases:\r\n\r\n1) Simultaneous announcements. Current implementation of LiveAnnouncer uses a single DOM element for the announcement, so second message overrides the first one and screen reader users hear only the second message.\r\n\r\n2) Consequent announcement of the same message. Current implementation will announce only distinct messages, i.e. clicking the button multiple times will produce only one message for the screen reader. That's not always convenient. For example, if you have a table on the page and you do some polling which updates the table 5 times, we need to be able to announce every of those updates so that screen reader users know what's happening on the page.\r\n\r\n#### Implementation\r\n\r\nWe already have an implementation of a queued LiveAnnouncer which was used in GCP for the last 5 months, it alowed to fix a lot of accessibility problems on pages with heavy UIs. I will convert it to a PR here, but I'd like to have some discussion first. At the very least I'd like to know whether it should replace the existing LiveAnnouncer implementation or we should allow users to switch between two implementations","Url":"https://github.com/angular/components/issues/17852","RelatedDescription":"Open issue \"Queue messages sent to LiveAnnouncer\" (#17852)"},{"Id":"530721431","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2019-12-01T12:11:02","Actor":"crisbeto","Number":"17848","RawContent":null,"Title":"fix(drag-drop): not stopping drag if page is blurred","State":"open","Body":"Currently the only way to stop a drag sequence is via a `mouseup`/`touchend` event or by destroying the instance, however if the page loses focus while dragging the events won't be dispatched anymore and user will have to click again to stop dragging.
