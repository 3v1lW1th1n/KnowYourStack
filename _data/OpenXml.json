Notice that it does not fall under `./xl/`.\r\n\r\nWhile the generated file isn't corrupt and works with all spreadsheet clients, the discrepancy about the location of the parts does feel strange. It's especially confusing when one opens an Excel-generated file using the OpenXML SDK where the file already contains pivot table parts and one adds new pivot table parts. The resulting file will have the original pivot table cache parts in the `./xl/pivotCache` location, but the newly added parts will be in the `./pivotCache/` location. Additionally, this is the only spreadsheet-related part (that I've noticed) that does *not* save to some location under `./xl/`.\r\n\r\n**Information**\r\n\r\n- .NET Target: .NET 4.7.2\r\n- DocumentFormat.OpenXml Version: Commit 9d8629a7778c876e56b3c7e14c213b65f6f84ea0\r\n\r\n**Repro**\r\n\r\n```csharp\r\nusing DocumentFormat.OpenXml;\r\nusing DocumentFormat.OpenXml.Packaging;\r\n\r\nnamespace ConsoleApp1\r\n{\r\n    internal class Program\r\n    {\r\n        private static void Main(string[] args)\r\n        {\r\n            using (var package = SpreadsheetDocument.Create(\"outputfile.xlsx\", SpreadsheetDocumentType.Workbook))\r\n            {\r\n                var workbookPart = package.AddWorkbookPart();\r\n\r\n                workbookPart.AddNewPart<PivotTableCacheDefinitionPart>(\"rId2\");\r\n            }\r\n        }\r\n    }\r\n}\r\n``` \r\n\r\n**Observed**\r\n\r\nNotice location of result pivot cache parts:\r\n![pivotcache2](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/145854/60818071-33a68800-a19d-11e9-884c-0db6094a6625.gif)\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n**Expected**\r\n\r\nWhen one generates a file in Excel, pivot cache parts are in this location:\r\n![pivotcache](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/145854/60817203-81ba8c00-a19b-11e9-925b-9fba9d54eb6f.gif)"},{"Id":"9963390909","Type":"IssuesEvent","CreatedAt":"2019-07-07T23:08:51","Actor":"gdalsnes","Repository":"OfficeDev/Open-XML-SDK","Organization":"OfficeDev","RawContent":null,"RelatedAction":"opened","RelatedUrl":"https://github.com/OfficeDev/Open-XML-SDK/issues/611","RelatedDescription":"Opened issue \"Error MSB4044 The \"GetAssemblyVersion\" task was not given a value for the required parameter \"NuGetVersion\"\" (#611) at OfficeDev/Open-XML-SDK","RelatedBody":"Downloaded and unpacked v2.10.0-beta1.zip.
