It uses Protobuf's [`varint`](https://developers.google.com/protocol-buffers/docs/encoding#varints) for framing the protocol. This does save some bytes (only generally 1-2 bytes though), but it seems simpler to just use MsgPack's own [`bin`](https://github.com/msgpack/msgpack/blob/master/spec.md#bin-format-family) type. This would allow clients to use the existing MsgPack decoding libraries they are using and would not require an additional decoder layer. It may also be possible to avoid the outer framing entirely, but it would require the parser to be able to pause and resume parsing when more data is available. The end of a message is clearly defined in MsgPack (unlike ProtoBuf) but the exact byte length of a message isn't known until the end of parsing.\r\n\r\n2. MsgPack-CLI encodes DateTime as a `uint 64` but MsgPack has a spec-provided type for DateTime (the `Timestamp` extension type). This appears to be a limitation of the library: https://github.com/msgpack/msgpack-cli/issues/246\r\n\r\n3. I'm not sure I like how CompletionMessages are encoded using a \"result type\" enum. Not sure what I like better yet though. It's not bad, I just feel like introducing a new enumeration shouldn't be necessary.\r\n\r\n4. In adding headers (#1350), I'm wondering if it might be better to use two nested arrays. Currently the entire message is a single array, where each array has the same first two items `[headers, type, ...`. I wonder if a better pattern would be for all messages to have the same high-level format: `[headers, type, payload]` where `payload` is an array specific to the type.\r\n\r\nSure I'll find more as I go though implementing #1350 :)"},{"Id":"7168020941","Type":"PullRequestEvent","CreatedAt":"2018-01-29T22:36:03","Actor":"pakrym","Repository":"aspnet/SignalR","Organization":"aspnet","RawContent":null,"RelatedAction":"merged","RelatedUrl":"https://github.com/aspnet/SignalR/pull/1365","RelatedDescription":"Merged pull request \"React to pipeline changes\" (#1365) at aspnet/SignalR","RelatedBody":""},{"Id":"7167611886","Type":"PullRequestEvent","CreatedAt":"2018-01-29T21:09:15","Actor":"anurse","Repository":"aspnet/SignalR","Organization":"aspnet","RawContent":null,"RelatedAction":"merged","RelatedUrl":"https://github.com/aspnet/SignalR/pull/1364","RelatedDescription":"Merged pull request \"Update README.md\" (#1364) at aspnet/SignalR","RelatedBody":"Clarify package rename."},{"Id":"7167421553","Type":"PullRequestEvent","CreatedAt":"2018-01-29T20:30:03","Actor":"pakrym","Repository":"aspnet/SignalR","Organization":"aspnet","RawContent":null,"RelatedAction":"opened","RelatedUrl":"https://github.com/aspnet/SignalR/pull/1365","RelatedDescription":"Opened pull request \"React to pipeline changes\" (#1365) at aspnet/SignalR","RelatedBody":""}],"ResultType":"GitHubEvent"},"Mvc":{"Events":[{"Id":"7168489194","Type":"IssuesEvent","CreatedAt":"2018-01-30T00:47:58","Actor":"mkArtakMSFT","Repository":"aspnet/Mvc","Organization":"aspnet","RawContent":null,"RelatedAction":"closed","RelatedUrl":"https://github.com/aspnet/Mvc/issues/7306","RelatedDescription":"Closed issue \"InputFormatters: Adding additional content types is hard\" (#7306) at aspnet/Mvc","RelatedBody":"I recently implemented handling of browser's [CSP reports](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/CSP#Sample_violation_report) in an asp.net core app and it turned out to be quite hard.\r\n\r\nThe problem is that these reports are sent (at least by chrome) using `application/csp-report` as content type header. It took me a while to figure out how to correctly configure MVC to process the request, as I was only receiving 415 responses.\r\n\r\nI ended up with a startup code that feels quite hacky (and I'm still unsure if that's actually a correct approach):\r\n```c#\r\nservices.AddMvc(options =>\r\n{\r\n    // add csp report media type to the json input formatter\r\n    // the json patch formatter derives from the json formatter\r\n    // so use the first one supporting application/json\r\n    options.InputFormatters\r\n        .OfType<JsonInputFormatter>()\r\n        .First(formatter => formatter.SupportedMediaTypes.Contains(\"application/json\"))\r\n        .SupportedMediaTypes.Add(\"application/csp-report\");\r\n})\r\n```\r\n\r\nThe bad experience is that it took me quite some time to figure out how the input formatters worked and without browsing the source code on GitHub, I wouldn't have been able to make it it work (e.g. knowing about the json patch formatter's relationship with the normal json formatter). Google only returned useful results for adding content type mappings for responses.\r\n\r\nI propose doing one or more of the following:\r\n\r\n1. Add an easier to use API about how to handle non-standard content types for requests that map to one of the already implemented input formatters.\r\n2. Add some common content types like `application/csp-report` to the provided input formatters.\r\n3. Add a documentation sample for handling custom content types OR a sample for handling CSP reports that includes this."},{"Id":"7168458321","Type":"PullRequestEvent","CreatedAt":"2018-01-30T00:38:05","Actor":"jbagga","Repository":"aspnet/Mvc","Organization":"aspnet","RawContent":null,"RelatedAction":"opened","RelatedUrl":"https://github.com/aspnet/Mvc/pull/7314","RelatedDescription":"Opened pull request \"[Design] Add INFO level logging\" (#7314) at aspnet/Mvc","RelatedBody":"Addresses #7171 "},{"Id":"7167391390","Type":"PullRequestEvent","CreatedAt":"2018-01-29T20:23:44","Actor":"pranavkm","Repository":"aspnet/Mvc","Organization":"aspnet","RawContent":null,"RelatedAction":"merged","RelatedUrl":"https://github.com/aspnet/Mvc/pull/7313","RelatedDescription":"Merged pull request \"Ensure analyzer package uses -final version when IsFinalBuild=true\" (#7313) at aspnet/Mvc","RelatedBody":""},{"Id":"7167390891","Type":"PullRequestEvent","CreatedAt":"2018-01-29T20:23:37","Actor":"pranavkm","Repository":"aspnet/Mvc","Organization":"aspnet","RawContent":null,"RelatedAction":"opened","RelatedUrl":"https://github.com/aspnet/Mvc/pull/7313","RelatedDescription":"Opened pull request \"Ensure analyzer package uses -final version when IsFinalBuild=true\" (#7313) at aspnet/Mvc","RelatedBody":""},{"Id":"7167389950","Type":"PullRequestEvent","CreatedAt":"2018-01-29T20:23:25","Actor":"pranavkm","Repository":"aspnet/Mvc","Organization":"aspnet","RawContent":null,"RelatedAction":"merged","RelatedUrl":"https://github.com/aspnet/Mvc/pull/7312","RelatedDescription":"Merged pull request \"Ensure analyzer package uses -final version when IsFinalBuild=true\" (#7312) at aspnet/Mvc","RelatedBody":""},{"Id":"7167197694","Type":"PullRequestEvent","CreatedAt":"2018-01-29T19:43:57","Actor":"pranavkm","Repository":"aspnet/Mvc","Organization":"aspnet","RawContent":null,"RelatedAction":"closed","RelatedUrl":"https://github.com/aspnet/Mvc/pull/7144","RelatedDescription":"Closed pull request \"Add support for IPageParameterModelConvention, IPageHandlerModelConve…\" (#7144) at aspnet/Mvc","RelatedBody":"…ntion, IPagePropertyModelConvention\r\n\r\nFixes #6935"},{"Id":"7167197124","Type":"IssuesEvent","CreatedAt":"2018-01-29T19:43:50","Actor":"pranavkm","Repository":"aspnet/Mvc","Organization":"aspnet","RawContent":null,"RelatedAction":"closed","RelatedUrl":"https://github.com/aspnet/Mvc/issues/6935","RelatedDescription":"Closed issue \"Make IParameterModelConvention execute for page handler parameters\" (#6935) at aspnet/Mvc","RelatedBody":"We have the metadata required to run it, we just don't execute these today.

issue \"Consider changing the 'purpose' to device identifier\" (#1602) at aspnet/Identity","RelatedBody":"Hi,\r\nCurrently the method `ValidateAsync `from the `IUserTwoFactorTokenProvider<TUser>` contains a parameter called 'purpose' which is always equals to 'TwoFactory' if the default method in `UserManager `is not overridden. \r\n\r\nThis is because the default implementation inside the `Microsoft.AspNetCore.Identity.UserManager<TUser>`\r\nof the method `VerifyTwoFactorTokenAsync(TUser user,string tokenProvider, token)`\r\nlooks that: \r\n`var result = await _tokenProviders[tokenProvider].ValidateAsync(\"TwoFactor\", token, this, user);`\r\n \r\nSo this 'purpose' parameter seems to be pretty useless right now. However it could be replaced by some kind of device identifier so it would be easier to implement multiple 2FA device for the same TokenProvider (so the single user could have 2 devices for the same token provider).\r\n\r\nPlease let me know what you

This advisory also provides guidance on what developers can do to update their applications correctly.\r\n\r\nMicrosoft is aware of an elevation of privilege vulnerability exists when a ASP.NET Core web application, created using vulnerable project templates, fails to properly sanitize web requests. An attacker who successfully exploited this vulnerability could perform content injection attacks and run script in the security context of the logged-on user.\r\n\r\nTo exploit the vulnerability, an attacker could send a specially crafted email, containing a malicious link, to a user. Alternatively, an attacker could use a chat client to social engineer a user into clicking the malicious link. However, in all cases to exploit this vulnerability a user must click a maliciously crafted link from an attacker.\r\n\r\nThe security update addresses the vulnerability by correcting the ASP.NET Core project templates.\r\n\r\nDevelopers who have generated applications from the vulnerable templates should change their code using the following instructions. They should also change their code to address a further vulnerability,  [CVE-2018-0783](https://github.com/aspnet/Announcements/issues/284), which is in the same templates. Finally installing the latest .NET Core SDK, version 2.1.4, from https://www.microsoft.com/net/download/ will update the templates to correct the issue for any new applications created.\r\n\r\n### Discussion\r\n\r\nPlease use **** TODO: FILL IN ISSUE LINK *** for discussion of this advisory.\r\n\r\n### Mitigation Factors\r\nASP.NET Core applications which are not created using the ASP.NET Core 2.0 Individual Authentication templates are not vulnerable to this issue.\r\n\r\n## Affected Software\r\nThe vulnerabilities affect any Microsoft .NET Core project if it uses any of affected runtime versions listed below and have generated applications using Individual Authentication with usernames and passwords stored within the application. Applications which use Azure Active Directory, or Azure Active Directory B2C are not affected.\r\n\r\nVulnerable .NET SDK Version | Fixed SDK Version\r\n----------------| -------------------------\r\n2.0.0, 2.0.2, 2.0.3, 2.1.2, 2.1.3 |  2.1.4\r\n\r\n### Advisory FAQ\r\n#### How do I know if I am affected?\r\n\r\nYour application will be affected if you generated it using the ASP.NET 2.0 Web Application template or the ASP.NET 2.0 Web Application (Model/View/Controller) template from a vulnerable SDK version where you have selected individual authentication where user accounts are stored in-app.\r\n\r\nTo check the runtimes installed on a computer you must view the contents of the runtime folder. By default these are\r\n\r\n| Operating System          | Location          |\r\n|---------------------------|-------------------|\r\n| Windows | C:\\Program Files\\dotnet\\sdk\\ |\r\n| macOS | /usr/local/share/dotnet/sdk/    |\r\n| Supported Linux platforms | /usr/share/dotnet/sdk/   |\r\n\r\nEach SDK version is installed in its own directory, where the directory name is the version number. If you do not have a directory for 2.1.4 then any applications generated for ASP.NET Core 2.0 using Individual Authentication may be vulnerable.. Downloads for all supported platforms can be acquired from https://www.microsoft.com/net/download/\r\n\r\n#### How do I fix my affected application?\r\nApplications can be fixed by changing the code created during application generation using the following instructions.\r\n\r\n#### For ASP.NET Core 2.0 Web Application (Razor Pages)\r\n\r\n1. Open `Pages\\Account\\Manage\\EnableAuthenticator.cshtml.cs` find the `OnPostAsync()` method and search for the following line\r\n\r\n```\r\n<div id=\"qrCodeData\" data-url=\"@Html.Raw(Model.AuthenticatorUri)\"></div>\r\n```\r\n\r\nReplace this line with the following code, removing the call to `Html.Raw()`\r\n\r\n```C#\r\n<div id=\"qrCodeData\" data-url=\"@Model.AuthenticatorUri\"></div>\r\n```\r\n\r\n2. Open the `Pages\\Account\\Manage\\EnableAuthenticator.cshtml.cs` and search for the following line, inside the `OnGetAsync()` method;\r\n\r\n```C#\r\nawait LoadSharedKeyAndQrCodeUriAsync(user);\r\n```\r\n\r\nRemove the code shown below which follows the call to `LoadSharedKeyAndQrCodeUriAsync(user);`\r\n\r\n```C#\r\nif (string.IsNullOrEmpty(SharedKey))\t\t\r\n{\t\t\r\n    await _userManager.ResetAuthenticatorKeyAsync(user);\t\t\r\n    await LoadSharedKeyAndQrCodeUriAsync(user);\t\t\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nThe `OnGetAsync()` method should now look like\r\n\r\n```C#\r\npublic async Task<IActionResult> OnGetAsync()\r\n{\r\n    var user = await _userManager.GetUserAsync(User);\r\n    if (user == null)\r\n    {\r\n        throw new ApplicationException($\"Unable to load user with ID '{_userManager.GetUserId(User)}'.\");\r\n    }\r\n\r\n    await LoadSharedKeyAndQrCodeUriAsync(user);\r\n\r\n    return Page();\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\n3. Still in the `Pages\\Account\\Manage\\EnableAuthenticator.cshtml.cs` file  and search for the `LoadSharedKeyAndQrCodeUriAsync(ApplicationUser user) function` and replace it with \r\n\r\n```C#\r\nprivate async Task LoadSharedKeyAndQrCodeUriAsync(ApplicationUser user)\r\n{\r\n    // Load the authenticator key & QR code URI to display on the form\r\n    var unformattedKey = await _userManager.GetAuthenticatorKeyAsync(user);\r\n    if (string.IsNullOrEmpty(unformattedKey))\r\n    {\r\n        await _userManager.ResetAuthenticatorKeyAsync(user);\r\n        unformattedKey = await _userManager.GetAuthenticatorKeyAsync(user);\r\n     }\r\n\r\n    SharedKey = FormatKey(unformattedKey);\r\n    AuthenticatorUri = GenerateQrCodeUri(user.Email, unformattedKey);\r\n }\r\n```\r\n\r\n4. Recompile your application and test you can generate 2fa recovery codes correctly, then redeploy your application.\r\n\r\n#### For ASP.NET Core 2.0 Web Application (Model/View/Controller)\r\n\r\n1. Open the `Controllers\\ManageController.cs` file and find the declaration for `private const string AuthenticatorUriFormat`. Add the following new const declaration below it;\r\n\r\n```C#\r\nprivate const string RecoveryCodesKey = nameof(RecoveryCodesKey);\r\n```\r\n\r\n2. Still in `Controllers\\ManageController.cs` file and find the `EnableAuthenticator()` function. Replace its contents with\r\n\r\n```C#\r\n[HttpGet]\r\npublic async Task<IActionResult> EnableAuthenticator()\r\n{\r\n    var user = await _userManager.GetUserAsync(User);\r\n    if (user == null)\r\n    {\r\n        throw new ApplicationException($\"Unable to load user with ID '{_userManager.GetUserId(User)}'.\");\r\n    }\r\n\r\n    var model = new EnableAuthenticatorViewModel();\r\n    await LoadSharedKeyAndQrCodeUriAsync(user, model);\r\n\r\n    return View(model);\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\n3. Still in `Controllers\\ManageController.cs` file and find the `EnableAuthenticator(EnableAuthenticatorViewModel model)` method.

This advisory also provides guidance on what developers can do to update their applications correctly.\r\n\r\nMicrosoft is aware of a Cross Site Request Forgery vulnerability in the individual authentication templates for ASP.NET Core 2.0. An attacker who successfully exploited this vulnerability could change the recovery codes associated with the victim's user account without his/her consent. As a result, a victim of this attack may be permanently locked out of his/her account after loosing access to his/her 2FA device, as the initial recovery codes would be no longer valid.\r\n\r\nThe security update addresses the vulnerability by correcting the ASP.NET Core project templates.\r\n\r\nDevelopers who have generated applications from the vulnerable templates should change their code using the following instructions. They should also change their code to address a further vulnerability,  CVE-2018-0784, which is in the same templates.  ***** TODO: ADD LINK TO OTHER ISSUE ***** \r\n\r\nYou should also install the latest .NET Core SDK, version 2.1.4, from https://www.microsoft.com/net/download/ as will update the templates to correct the issue for any _new_ applications created after its installation. Existing applications must be manually updated using the instructions below.\r\n\r\n### Discussion\r\n\r\nPlease use **** TODO: FILL IN ISSUE LINK *** for discussion of this advisory.\r\n\r\n### Mitigation Factors\r\nASP.NET Core applications which are not created using the ASP.NET Core 2.0 Individual Authentication templates are not vulnerable to this issue.\r\n\r\n## Affected Software\r\nThe vulnerabilities affect any Microsoft .NET Core project if it uses any of affected runtime versions listed below and have generated applications using Individual Authentication with usernames and passwords stored within the application. Applications which use Azure Active Directory, or Azure Active Directory B2C are not affected.\r\n\r\nVulnerable .NET SDK Version | Fixed SDK Version\r\n----------------| -------------------------\r\n2.0.0, 2.0.2, 2.0.3, 2.1.2, 2.1.3 |  2.1.4\r\n\r\n### Advisory FAQ\r\n#### How do I know if I am affected?\r\n\r\nYour application will be affected if you generated it using the ASP.NET 2.0 Web Application template or the ASP.NET 2.0 Web Application (Model/View/Controller) template from a vulnerable SDK version where you have selected individual authentication where user accounts are stored in-app.\r\n\r\nTo check the runtimes installed on a computer you must view the contents of the runtime folder. By default these are\r\n\r\n| Operating System          | Location          |\r\n|---------------------------|-------------------|\r\n| Windows | C:\\Program Files\\dotnet\\sdk\\ |\r\n| macOS | /usr/local/share/dotnet/sdk/    |\r\n| Supported Linux platforms | /usr/share/dotnet/sdk/   |\r\n\r\nEach SDK version is installed in its own directory, where the directory name is the version number. If you do not have a directory for 2.1.4 then any applications generated for ASP.NET Core 2.0 using Individual Authentication may be vulnerable.. Downloads for all supported platforms can be acquired from https://www.microsoft.com/net/download/\r\n\r\n#### How do I fix my affected application?\r\nApplications can be fixed by changing the code created during application generation using the following instructions.\r\n\r\n#### For ASP.NET Core 2.0 Web Application (Razor Pages)\r\n\r\n1. Open `Pages\\Account\\Manage\\EnableAuthenticator.cshtml.cs` find the `OnPostAsync()` method. The last line of this file should be\r\n\r\n```C#\r\nreturn RedirectToPage(\"./GenerateRecoveryCodes\");\r\n```\r\n\r\nReplace this line with the following code\r\n\r\n```C#\r\nvar recoveryCodes = await _userManager.GenerateNewTwoFactorRecoveryCodesAsync(user, 10);\r\nTempData[\"RecoveryCodes\"] = recoveryCodes.ToArray();\r\nreturn RedirectToPage(\"./ShowRecoveryCodes\");\r\n```\r\n\r\n2. Open the `Pages\\Account\\Manage\\GenerateRecoveryCodes.cshtml` and replace its contents with \r\n\r\n```C#\r\n@page\r\n@model GenerateRecoveryCodesModel\r\n@{\r\n    ViewData[\"Title\"] = \"Generate two-factor authentication (2FA) recovery codes\";\r\n    ViewData[\"ActivePage\"] = \"TwoFactorAuthentication\";\r\n}\r\n\r\n<h4>@ViewData[\"Title\"]</h4>\r\n<div class=\"alert alert-warning\" role=\"alert\">\r\n    <p>\r\n        <span class=\"glyphicon glyphicon-warning-sign\"></span>\r\n        <strong>This action generates new recovery codes.</strong>\r\n    </p>\r\n    <p>\r\n        If you lose your device and don't have the recovery codes you will lose access to your account.\r\n    </p>\r\n    <p>\r\n        Generating new recovery codes does not change the keys used in authenticator apps.

To start with, we have moved the bugs from several other repos to the Home repo, and we will retire the issue trackers of those other repos.\r\n\r\nWe are doing this to try to improve the experience of logging issues for ASP.NET Core.\r\n\r\n* Labels in the form of `repo:RepoName` are used to associate the bug with a product/feature area\r\n* For issue trackers that moved to the Home repo, please log new issues in the Home repo. If a bug is logged in a moved issue tracker, it will be closed.\r\n* Over time, we plan to consolidate more issue trackers into the Home repo\r\n\r\nFor discussions on this topic, please go to https://github.com/aspnet/Home/issues/2736.\r\n\r\nThanks,\r\nEilon\r\n"}],"ResultType":"GitHubEvent"},"Twitter":{"ResultType":"TwitterTimeline","Tweets":[{"Id":"958121957295140864","CreatedAt":"2018-01-29T23:37:30+00:00","UserScreenname":"aspnet","Text":"Join us for the weekly #ASPNET Community Standup tomorrow at 3:45 PM Pacific / 23:45 GMT at https://t.co/4Ioo9jNSN2","Source":"<a href=\"https://about.twitter.com/products/tweetdeck\" rel=\"nofollow\">TweetDeck</a>","RetweetCount":2,"FavoriteCount":3,"RawContent":null},{"Id":"956668144784846849","CreatedAt":"2018-01-25T23:20:34+00:00","UserScreenname":"aspnet","Text":"Just blogged: @Azure Storage for Serverless .NET apps in Minutes.\nhttps://t.co/5vSYYtzt8p","Source":"<a href=\"https://about.twitter.com/products/tweetdeck\" rel=\"nofollow\">TweetDeck</a>","RetweetCount":80,"FavoriteCount":52,"RawContent":null},{"Id":"956524881121771521","CreatedAt":"2018-01-25T13:51:17+00:00","UserScreenname":"aspnet","Text":"Jeff and Maira - improving https://t.co/y1SqotEH5B LIVE at 10am ET / 15:00 UTC.
