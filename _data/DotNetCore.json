This is very similar to how we approached 2.x and 3.0 projects. As context, `master` branches produced 3.0 builds for the entire period of the 2.2 project.\r\n\r\nAt present, this change is only relevant if you contribute to .NET Core repositories. Otherwise, we recommend that you wait for the 5.0 Preview releases before installing this new version.\r\n\r\n## Discussion\r\nPlease share your thoughts on this change and see what others are saying at:\r\n\r\n[dotnet/core #3059](https://github.com/dotnet/core/issues/3059)\r\n\r\n## Details\r\n\r\nThe following repos have moved their master branches to \"5.0\":\r\n\r\n- [dotnet/coreclr](https://github.com/dotnet/coreclr)\r\n- [dotnet/corefx](https://github.com/dotnet/corefx)\r\n- [dotnet/core-setup](https://github.com/dotnet/core-setup)\r\n\r\nYou can see that [5.0 .NET Core Runtime builds](https://github.com/dotnet/core-setup#daily-builds) are now being built and published at dotnet/core-setup.\r\n\r\nIn large part, we switched `master` to 5.0 to enable to the community to contribute changes. As the .NET Core 3.0 released has progressed, we've had to increase scrutiny on the changes we will accept. Now that we've permanently branched for 3.0, we can accept a much broader set of changes. Please consider that to be an open invitation!\r\n\r\nNotably, [dotnet/core-sdk](https://github.com/dotnet/core-sdk) is not yet producing 5.0 builds. We expect that the dotnet/core-sdk master branch will continue as a 3.0 branch for 2-3 months while we finish up the .NET Core 3.0 project.\r\n\r\nAt present, there is no developer experience for 5.0. We are waiting on the dotnet/core-sdk repo to switch to 5.0. Switching your project file to target `netcoreapp5.0` won't do anything useful. We'll update this issue when a 5.0 SDK comes available."},{"Id":"9971220766","Type":"IssuesEvent","CreatedAt":"2019-07-08T23:25:31","Actor":"terrajobst","Repository":"dotnet/announcements","Organization":"dotnet","RawContent":null,"RelatedAction":"opened","RelatedUrl":"https://github.com/dotnet/announcements/issues/117","RelatedDescription":"Opened issue \"System.Text.Json usability study results\" (#117) at dotnet/announcements","RelatedBody":"We've performed a usability study on the new `System.Text.Json` APIs which will replace JSON.NET as the default JSON experience in .NET Core 3.0:\r\n\r\n* We focused on the primary \"getting started\" scenarios to validate that we picked the right type- and method names.\r\n* We simulated what we believe to be common error cases to validate that our exception messages are understandable and actionable.\r\n* Since we were short on time, we couldn't use the recruiting provided by the UX lab but instead brought in our own developers, which we recruited from the .NET engineering team\r\n\r\nThis has worked out well for us as we were able to get short term feedback which resulted in significant improvements to the overall API shape and usability.

Every person who started a scenario successfully finished it.\r\n    - We feel this validates that we picked the right scope for a 60 minute study of people from various backgrounds\r\n* Overall people liked the new API\r\n    - Key value prop for most people was the fact that \"it's now built in\"\r\n    - Very few mentioned perf and the ones that did thought that it probably wouldn't make a difference in their scenarios.\r\n    - Most people said they would prefer `System.Text.Json` for new APIs, but would stick to JSON.NET in code that already uses it.\r\n    - **[Action]** None, this is in line with what we expected.\r\n* Virtually everyone tried to google for sample code in the documentation\r\n    - Everyone found our blog post and online documentation\r\n    - People new to .NET were confused that JSON.NET and `System.Text.Json` weren't the same thing\r\n    - Everyone complained that the current docs are lacking, especially sample code.\r\n    - **[Action]** Docs are work in progress. We plan on shipping with a fully documented API surface and sample code.\r\n* Virtually everyone found the key type relatively quickly\r\n    - Some people were confused when types were static, rather than something that one can new up\r\n    - **[Action]** None. This is by-design as we try to reduce the number of allocations.\r\n* Virtually everyone had trouble selecting the correct method on\r\n  `JsonSerializer`\r\n    - We chose a very complicated naming convention\r\n    - **[Action]** We simplified it by using names that people in the study told us were looking for.\r\n* Most of our error messages were well received because they told people what\r\n  the problem is & how they can fix them.\r\n    - One error message was unclear because we reported an unexpected character when we could have reported that we didn't expect a comment.\r\n    - **[Action]** We've reworded the error message.\r\n    - We had one error message that was generated by a lower layer and provided an action item that doesn't make sense when people receive it when using the higher layer component.\r\n    - **[Action]** We've reworded the error message to be more generic so it makes sense for both kind of consumers.\r\n* Virtually everyone used the new Roslyn completion feature which will also show\r\n  types from namespaces not imported yet.\r\n    - However, virtually nobody realized that they were doing it.\r\n    - This caused confusion when people found other APIs that happen to include Json in them, specifically the old data contract serialization.\r\n    - **[Action]** Talk to the Roslyn IDE team to see if this something more people will run into. This could prove to be especially problematic for technologies that share type names (e.g. `UserControl` in WinForms and WPF) and both are referenced by the project.\r\n* Optional parameters and `async`/`await` are usability cliffs\r\n    - Many were confused by optional parameters and tried to pass them in, even though they didn't have to.\r\n    - **[Action]** Talk to the Roslyn IDE team to see if we can visualize them better in VS.\r\n    - **[Action]** Try to avoid heavy use of optional parameters for mainline APIs.\r\n    - Async is a very steep cliff. People have no idea what to do in their code to make async work. While IntelliSense shows the usage by prefixing it with await, people didn't notice that.\r\n    - **[Action]** Unclear; this is a broader issue.\r\n* Virtually nobody used F1 to get help for APIs\r\n    - *Surprise*. I expected more people to use <kbd>F1</kbd>.\r\n* Virtually everyone used F12 to explore the API (\"metadata view\")\r\n    - *Surprise*. I expected most people to explore the type via the\r\n      IntelliSense completion\r\n* Nobody used Object Browser to explorer the APIs\r\n    - *Surprise*. I expected at least some people to.\r\n\r\n## Discussion\r\n\r\nFor a discussion, please go to https://github.com/dotnet/corefx/issues/39304."},{"Id":"9963969636","Type":"IssuesEvent","CreatedAt":"2019-07-08T03:13:39","Actor":"leecow","Repository":"dotnet/announcements","Organization":"dotnet","RawContent":null,"RelatedAction":"opened","RelatedUrl":"https://github.com/dotnet/announcements/issues/116","RelatedDescription":"Opened issue \"Updates to releases.json (.NET Core release metadata)\" (#116) at dotnet/announcements","RelatedBody":"**The changes described in this issue will be live with the .NET Core July update on 7/9/2019.**\r\n\r\nThe releases.json files (e.g. [2.2 releases.json](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dotnet/core/master/release-notes/2.2/releases.json)) are comprehensive metadata files which capture details of each .NET Core release. These files, along with the top level [releases-index.json](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dotnet/core/master/release-notes/releases-index.json), are becoming increasingly important .NET Core release assets. These files, one for each major.minor channel, are relied upon by many to detect when updates for .NET Core are available, discover security update details and other uses.\r\n\r\nChanges are sometimes necessary, and the growing dependencies require that we treat compatibility of the schema with the utmost care. This announcement describes an addition to the releases.json schema.\r\n\r\n## SDK Versions and Visual Studio\r\n\r\nBecause of current .NET Core SDK product construction dependencies, there is a hard link between the Runtime, SDK, toolset (compilers, msbuild, nuget, and other components), and Visual Studio. Simplistically, this means that when anything updates, everything updates. The unfortunate result of this linking is that multiple versions of the SDK are released with each monthly update for each supported versions of Visual Studio. For example, the May Update for .NET Core 2.2 included the 2.2.5 runtime, 2.2.107 SDK for Visual Studio 2017 and 2.2.204 for Visual Studio 2019 and yet another pair of SDK versions for .NET Core 2.1. An example of this is the [2.2.5 Release Notes](https://github.com/dotnet/core/blob/master/release-notes/2.2/2.2.5/2.2.5.md). \r\n\r\nThis is a confusing situation and we are working to mitigate the need to release multiple SDKs with .NET Core 3.0. The need for multiple SDK versions will persist for 2.1 LTS.\r\n\r\n## Adding the SDKS array\r\n\r\nTo appropriately model multiple SDKs per release, we are adding an SDKs array to releases.json, which will contain SDK objects. The top-level SDK object will represent the highest versioned SDK for a given update. Using the previous 2.2.5 update example, SDK 2.2.204 is in the top SDK object as well as duplicated in the SDKS array. All other applicable 2.2* SDK objects are included in the SDKS array. The SDK objects within the array will carry specific Visual Studio compatibility and version inclusion information to provide appropriate context.\r\n\r\nHere is a partial example of the new array based on the upcoming July update. \r\nAgain, this will be additive and the previous SDK object will include the highest SDK version for the release.\r\n\r\n```json\r\n{\r\n  \"sdks\": [\r\n    {\r\n        \"version\": \"2.2.301\",\r\n        \"version-display\": \"2.2.301\",\r\n        \"runtime-version\": \"2.2.6\",\r\n        \"vs-version\": \"16.1.3\",\r\n        \"vs-support\": \"Visual Studio 2019 (v16.1)\",\r\n        \"csharp-version\": \"7.3\",\r\n        \"fsharp-version\": \"4.5\",\r\n        \"vb-version\": null,\r\n        \"files\": [\r\n            {\r\n            \"name\": \"\",\r\n            \"rid\": \"\",\r\n            \"url\": \"\",\r\n            \"hash\": \"\"\r\n            }\r\n        ]\r\n    }\r\n    ]\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\n## vs-version and the Runtime\r\n\r\nThe same version of the runtime is included in multiple versions of Visual Studio. To account for this, the vs-version field is being updated to a comma-delimited string. The string will represent all versions of Visual Studio which first include the particular .NET Core update. Again, an example from the upcoming July Update.\r\n\r\n```json\r\n\"runtime\": {\r\n        \"version\": \"2.2.6\",\r\n        \"version-display\": \"2.2.6\",\r\n        \"vs-version\": \"15.9.13, 16.1.3, 16.2.0\",\r\n```\r\n\r\nThe same `vs-versions` changes will be seen in the `aspnetcore-runtime` object.\r\n\r\n## Future Enhancements\r\n\r\nThere are other improvements to the schema which have been suggested by the communitiy which we are evaluating. Generally, theses enhancements are additive and should not represent compatibility comprimises for existing parsers and similar announcements will be published ahead of any changes.\r\n\r\n"}],"ResultType":"GitHubEvent"},"CoreCLR":{"Events":[{"Id":"10140428398","Type":"PullRequestEvent","CreatedAt":"2019-08-03T03:26:42","Actor":"jashook","Repository":"dotnet/coreclr","Organization":"dotnet","RawContent":null,"RelatedAction":"opened","RelatedUrl":"https://github.com/dotnet/coreclr/pull/25994","RelatedDescription":"Opened pull request \"Add --pmi flag to superpmi collect\" (#25994) at dotnet/coreclr","RelatedBody":"In addition to passing -pmi_assemblies run through all of the passed assemblies or directories and pmi all managed assemblies as part of the collection.\r\n\r\nThis and the ability to merge mch files are required for collecting using chem.\r\n\r\n/cc @dotnet/jit-contrib "},{"Id":"10140067378","Type":"IssuesEvent","CreatedAt":"2019-08-03T00:00:37","Actor":"jakobbotsch","Repository":"dotnet/coreclr","Organization":"dotnet","RawContent":null,"RelatedAction":"opened","RelatedUrl":"https://github.com/dotnet/coreclr/issues/25993","RelatedDescription":"Opened issue \"Wrong reflection invocation on ARM64 with HFAs\" (#25993) at dotnet/coreclr","RelatedBody":"The following example should print 1 twice but prints 0 when invoked through reflection on ARM64:\r\n```csharp\r\npublic struct Hfa\r\n{\r\n    public double A, B, C, D;\r\n    public Hfa(double a, double b, double c, double d)\r\n    {\r\n        A = a;\r\n        B = b;\r\n        C = c;\r\n        D = d;\r\n    }\r\n}\r\npublic class Program\r\n{\r\n    [MethodImpl(MethodImplOptions.NoInlining)]\r\n    public static double Foo(double a, Hfa b, Hfa c) => c.B;\r\n\r\n    internal static void Main()\r\n    {\r\n        Console.WriteLine(Foo(0, new Hfa(), new Hfa(0, 1, 0, 0)));\r\n\r\n        object[] arr = { 0d, new Hfa(), new Hfa(0, 1, 0, 0) };\r\n        MethodInfo fooMI = typeof(Program).GetMethod(\"Foo\");\r\n        Console.WriteLine(fooMI.Invoke(null, arr));\r\n    }\r\n}\r\n```"},{"Id":"10139982456","Type":"PullRequestEvent","CreatedAt":"2019-08-02T23:27:14","Actor":"sandreenko","Repository":"dotnet/coreclr","Organization":"dotnet","RawContent":null,"RelatedAction":"merged","RelatedUrl":"https://github.com/dotnet/coreclr/pull/25991","RelatedDescription":"Merged pull request \"Do not set source for CoreDisTools.\" (#25991) at dotnet/coreclr","RelatedBody":"We do not set it when we restore other packages so unify that.\r\n\r\ndotnet -restore will search for nuget.config and find https://github.com/dotnet/coreclr/blob/master/NuGet.config that contains https://dotnet.myget.org/F/dotnet-core/api/v3/index.json that is needed here.\r\n\r\n\r\nI will monitor if it fixes issues like https://dev.azure.com/dnceng/9ee6d478-d288-47f7-aacc-f6e6d082ae6d/_apis/build/builds/277007/logs/482."},{"Id":"10139932862","Type":"IssuesEvent","CreatedAt":"2019-08-02T23:09:55","Actor":"ww898","Repository":"dotnet/coreclr","Organization":"dotnet","RawContent":null,"RelatedAction":"closed","RelatedUrl":"https://github.com/dotnet/coreclr/issues/8175","RelatedDescription":"Closed issue \"Discussion: The portable PDB support\" (#8175) at dotnet/coreclr","RelatedBody":"Hi,\r\nI would to open the discussion about portable PDB support in CoreCLR. Now our product JetBrains profiler is using the COM object from `diasymreader.dll` (interfaces `ISymUnmanagedReader` / `ISymUnmanagedBinder2`) for windows PDB format (`Microsoft C/C++ MSF 7.00`). Now it possible to select what type of PDB will be generated for CoreCLR project due `debugType` option in `project.json` : `full` (windows specific) or `portable` (metadata based with signatures `BSJB` / `MPDB`).\r\n\r\nI spent last two weeks for writing my own C++11 library (with small piece of boost v1.62.0) for parsing the PE-file, the metadata `BSJB`, and deflating the `MPDB` blob. I'm finished it yesterday. Everything works, but I still have questions:\r\n\r\n1. What should I do when user started to profile .NET executable with windows specific PDB on Linux or MacOS? There is no COM object from `diasymreader.dll` on these OS. However, I found `Microsoft.DiaSymReader.Native.*.dll`. After investigation I assume that this is the libraries for windows specific PDB format support. Am I right? What kind of license they have? Why is there no source on GitHub for them?

In the CoreCLR runtimes, the System assembly can be System.Private.CoreLib.dll, System.Runtime.dll or netstandard.dll. \r\nPrior to this fix  `ildasm`  was using a string compare against `mscorlib` to mark the  System assembly. This would cause a failure to round tripping on CoreCLR where a different name is used for the System assembly.\r\nWith this fix we now determine the identity of the System assembly by querying if the Assembly defines the well known type System.Object as that type must be defined by the System assembly.\r\nThis allows us to successfully round trip the System assembly on CoreCLR.\r\nFor ilasm we also now have added System.Private.CoreLib.dll to list of assemblies that are accepted as the base System assembly.\r\n\r\n#### Customer Impact\r\n\r\nThis issue was impacting source build which is using IL as a source for several cases.  \r\nThey have requested that the tools  `ildasm/ilasm`  support round tripping of the various System assemblies on CoreCLR.

On .NET Core 3.0, every 10-15 seconds I'd start getting this small stutter while moving the camera around. It is a big enough of a negative that it significantly destroys the user experience of the application. However when I change to `.NET Framework 4.8` or `.NET Core 2.1` the performance issues (this small microstutter that that lasts for maybe 50-150ms) completely disappears. \r\n\r\nLong story short after a lot of digging, I found out the following:\r\n\r\n- Any GC at all causes this 'microstutter', even gen0, and even for very small amounts of garbage\r\n\r\n- Lots of GC at gen0/gen1 is perfectly fine on Framework 4.8/Core 2.1\r\n\r\n- In Core 2.2 there's a random pause when some thread exits and it prints to the output console in VS2019. This occurs less in Core 2.2 since there's only one one thread that exits, but in Core 3.0 this happens a lot more frequently (every 10-15 seconds or so) and causes a lot more problems\r\n\r\nThere is some 'background thread' that appears to be exiting which is generated beyond my control (I assume this is the runtime according to the debugging it in the threads window). Whatever is generating this thread, I notice in the VS2019 console when it says \"... thread has exited\" I get a stutter. I am not doing any threading, the application is purely single threaded (not using TPL or PLINQ if that helps, no async or await either). Regardless, even in a simple 'hello world' console app I still notice the message appearing in the console.\r\n\r\nI'm not sure why the presence of any kind of GC invocation causes pauses, or what this background thread that keeps getting spawned is (especially since it happens in a program that just prints hello world and then goes into a `while(true) { }` to prevent exiting). After some discussion online, other people seem to think it might be tiered compilation threads since it starts out causing microstutters every 10-15 seconds and then the gap gets wider and wider as time goes on, but I'm not sure what I could do to definitively prove or disprove this.\r\n\r\nSo what do I do?

Or we would need a way to resolve to the real directory somehow. I am not sure if snap gives us this ability. Is there a way to query snap to know if there is a dotnet-sdk installed and where can we find it's real directory. Can we do this without forking processes and parsing stdout?\r\n\r\nThe slow path could be a fallback. If there is a dotnet on PATH, but it does not resolve to a realpath with an sdk directory, try running it with --info. This would fix other hypothetical deployments like a dotnet that is a shell script that execs dotnet with custom args or whatever.

Heck, such XML is usually produced with  dynamically generated names. It's a horrible practice - not to be encouraged, but we should be able to simplify the life of people who need to interoperate with such XML.\r\n\r\nIt'd be nice if we could do this:\r\n\r\n```\r\nclass AwfulElement {\r\n  [XmlDynamicElementName]\r\n  string name;\r\n  [XmlText(typeOf(int))]\r\n  int aNumber;\r\n  ...\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nOther names for the proposed attribute may be `XmlInteropDynamicElementName` to signify that this is for interop purposes only, or `XmlAwfulDynamicElementName` to make it abundantly clear what it is :/\r\n\r\n### Rationale\r\n\r\nAs it stands, `XmlSerializer` infrastructure does a very poor job of supporting this - it requires quite a bit of semi-efficient code. Imagine you wanted a bunch of such elements in a collection with the following spec (note that currently it requires having an `INamedElement`, but with the support for the proposed attribute there'd be no need for it):\r\n\r\n```\r\npartial class AwfulCollection<T> : IXmlSerializable, IEnumerable<T> where T : INamedElement, new();\r\n\r\nclass AwfulParent {\r\n  public AwfulCollection<AwfulElement> Elements;\r\n}\r\n\r\n<?xml>\r\n<AwfulParemt>\r\n  <Awful1\\>\r\n  <Awful2\\>\r\n</AwfulParent>\r\n```\r\n\r\nI'll spare the details, but implementing this generic `AwfulCollection` is a pain. With the support for the proposed attribute, the usual array could be used:\r\n\r\n```\r\nclass LessAwfulParent {\r\n  public AwfulElement[] Element;\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\n### Spec\r\n\r\nThe attribute definition would be rather basic. A `DefaultElementName` property is a fallback if the name the attribute applies to is null. An exception would be thrown on serialization if both the name-attributed field as well as the default name were empty. On deserialization, the `name` is filled in with the name of the element.\r\n\r\n```\r\n[System.AttributeUsageAttribute(System.AttributeTargets.Field | System.AttributeTargets.Property, AllowMultiple=false)]\r\n    public partial class XmlDynamicElementNameAttribute: System.Attribute\r\n    {\r\n        public XmlDynamicElementNameAttribute() { }\r\n        public XmlDynamicElementNameAttribute(string defaultElementName) { }\r\n        public string DefaultElementName { get { throw null; } set { } }\r\n        public System.Xml.Schema.XmlSchemaForm Form { get { throw null; } set { } }\r\n        public string Namespace { get { throw null; } set { } }\r\n    }\r\n```","Url":"https://github.com/dotnet/standard/issues/1377","RelatedDescription":"Open issue \"System.Xml.Serialization needs a dynamic element name for interop\" (#1377)"},{"Id":"473740823","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2019-07-28T13:03:23","Actor":"dotnet-maestro[bot]","Number":"1376","RawContent":null,"Title":"[master] Update dependencies from dotnet/corefx","State":"closed","Body":"This pull request updates the following dependencies\r\n\r\n[marker]: <> (Begin:2a9b120a-74e9-4ac8-c08c-08d6da235811)\r\n## From https://github.com/dotnet/corefx\r\n- **Build**: 20190727.2\r\n- **Date Produced**: 7/28/2019 5:49 AM\r\n- **Commit**: 57df8b38e4e70fc25aabe3d061cd1745cff0b26b\r\n- **Branch**: refs/heads/master\r\n- **Updates**:\r\n  - **System.Reflection.Emit.Lightweight** -> 5.0.0-alpha1.19377.2\r\n  - **System.Reflection.Emit** -> 5.0.0-alpha1.19377.2\r\n  - **System.Reflection.Emit.ILGeneration** -> 5.0.0-alpha1.19377.2\r\n\r\n[marker]: <> (End:2a9b120a-74e9-4ac8-c08c-08d6da235811)\r\n\r\n","Url":"https://github.com/dotnet/standard/pull/1376","RelatedDescription":"Closed or merged PR \"[master] Update dependencies from dotnet/corefx\" (#1376)"},{"Id":"473635514","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2019-07-27T13:03:22","Actor":"dotnet-maestro[bot]","Number":"1375","RawContent":null,"Title":"[master] Update dependencies from dotnet/corefx","State":"closed","Body":"This pull request updates the following dependencies\r\n\r\n[marker]: <> (Begin:2a9b120a-74e9-4ac8-c08c-08d6da235811)\r\n## From https://github.com/dotnet/corefx\r\n- **Build**: 20190726.14\r\n- **Date Produced**: 7/27/2019 4:10 AM\r\n- **Commit**: 8a6389529afdc0dd53d4c94fe665695ec54c21af\r\n- **Branch**: refs/heads/master\r\n- **Updates**:\r\n  - **System.Reflection.Emit.Lightweight** -> 5.0.0-alpha1.19376.14\r\n  - **System.Reflection.Emit** -> 5.0.0-alpha1.19376.14\r\n  - **System.Reflection.Emit.ILGeneration** -> 5.0.0-alpha1.19376.14\r\n\r\n[marker]: <> (End:2a9b120a-74e9-4ac8-c08c-08d6da235811)\r\n\r\n","Url":"https://github.com/dotnet/standard/pull/1375","RelatedDescription":"Closed or merged PR \"[master] Update dependencies from dotnet/corefx\" (#1375)"},{"Id":"473583225","IsPullRequest":false,"CreatedAt":"2019-07-27T01:16:07","Actor":"GrabYourPitchforks","Number":"1374","RawContent":null,"Title":"Obsolete String.Copy in netstandard","State":"open","Body":"This is obsoleted in .NET Core 3 (see https://github.com/dotnet/corefx/issues/32563).

handler","State":"open","Body":"Hi,\r\nI have an issue with the way the `Console.CancelKeyPress` event is implemented:\r\n\r\nIn my scenario I'm running a vanilla ASP.Net Core 2.2 web application. The web application internally adds a ctrl-c handler and gracefully shuts down the application when ctrl-c is pressed.\r\n\r\nNow I had to add some logic to the application that's run in a Java VM via [JNI](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Java_Native_Interface). It seems that initializing JNI registers a SIGINT handler that throws away the console ctrl-c handler registered by ASP.Net.  \r\nPressing ctrl-c when JNI is initialized immediately exits the process even leaving zombie processes behind on Linux.\r\n\r\nI looked into the implementation of `Console.CancelKeyPress` and found that it uses an internal helper type [ConsolePal.ControlCHandlerRegistrar](https://github.com/dotnet/corefx/blob/954b1fdab8e98060cce3d0d88a34c3b0587a6acb/src/System.Console/src/System/Console.cs#L33) that's only registering a ctrl-c handler on the first usage of event addition. On subsequent event additions [only the cancel callbacks are chained together](https://github.com/dotnet/corefx/blob/954b1fdab8e98060cce3d0d88a34c3b0587a6acb/src/System.Console/src/System/Console.cs#L335).\r\n\r\nIn my scenario this means that after JNI init I can no longer use `Console.CancelKeyPress` because it will not re-register the handler and throw the JNI handler out.\r\n\r\nI have a workaround for this issue but it depends on private reflection. It sets `Console.s_registrar` to null and registers a dummy ctrl-c handler in order to throw out the JNI handler. Naturally this approach can break any day when the implementation changes and so I'd appreciate any help in this matter.\r\n\r\n```csharp\r\nvar consoleType = typeof(Console);\r\nvar registrar = consoleType.GetField(\"s_registrar\", BindingFlags.Static | BindingFlags.NonPublic);\r\n\r\nif (registrar != null)\r\n{\r\n\tregistrar.SetValue(null, null);\r\n\r\n\tvoid Dummy(object o, ConsoleCancelEventArgs e) { }\r\n\tConsole.CancelKeyPress += Dummy;\r\n}\r\n\r\n```\r\n\r\nThanks!\r\n\r\nEdit: Unfortunately the workaround above does not work on Linux.

method.","State":"open","Body":"**Version Used**: \r\nI am using VS community 2019 16.1.4...\r\n\r\n**Steps to Reproduce**:\r\n1) First, Write two abstract classes one inherits from the other. Let's call them AbstractClass and BaseAbstractClass for example.\r\n\r\n2) Second, Define two methods with the same name one in each class. In the BaseAbstractClass the method should take a more generic parameter type than the one in AbstractClass. For instance, in BaseAbstractClass we define void Method(int instance), and in AbstractClass we define void Method(object instance).\r\n\r\n3) Finally, create another class that inherits from AbstractClass. Now, try and call the one with the specific parameter type from the newly created class. And here we encounter the issue.The call is not possible unless the method with the more specific parameter is redefined in AbstractClass.\r\nHere is an example that reproduces the problem:\r\n\r\n```\r\n    public class TestClass : AbstractClass \r\n    {\r\n        public void CallTest(int instance)\r\n        {\r\n            // Calls AbstractClass.Method(object) instead of BaseAbstractClass.Method(int)\r\n            base.Method(instance);\r\n        }\r\n    }\r\n\r\n    public abstract class AbstractClass : BaseAbstractClass\r\n    {\r\n        public void Method(object instance)\r\n        {\r\n        }\r\n    }\r\n\r\n    public abstract class BaseAbstractClass\r\n    {\r\n        public void Method(int instance)\r\n        {\r\n        }\r\n    }\r\n\r\n```\r\n**Expected Behavior**:\r\nNormally this call base.Method(instance) is supposed to invoke the most specific method. Meaning it should call BaseAbstractClass.Method(int) but it doesn't. \r\n\r\n**Actual Behavior**:\r\nInstead it calls the more generic version which takes an object and there is no possible way to call the one that takes an int.","Url":"https://github.com/dotnet/roslyn/issues/37685","RelatedDescription":"Open issue \"Ambiguity in calling base class method.\" (#37685)"},{"Id":"476363726","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2019-08-02T21:32:50","Actor":"CyrusNajmabadi","Number":"37684","RawContent":null,"Title":"Make it clear in Syntax.xml when fields are exclusive of each other.","State":"open","Body":"This is a followup to https://github.com/dotnet/roslyn/pull/37674.  It will be easier to review once that goes in.\r\n\r\nThis is my **final** PR related to tweaking syntax.xml.    I'm at a happy point now.  \r\n\r\nThis PR adds some helper annotation nodes into the tree to make the relationship between different field-nodes in a type clearer.  For example, instead of just saying `a lambda has an optional block, or an optional expression`, the syntax now says `a lambda has either a block or an expression`.  This helps more clearly indicate that you really don't expect legal syntax to have neither of these, nor do you expect legal syntax to have both of them.\r\n\r\nThis is useful for some downstream tooling.  Specifically, it means we can generate better g4 productions like:\r\n\r\n```g4\r\nlambda_expression\r\n  : parenthesized_lambda_expression\r\n  | simple_lambda_expression\r\n  ;\r\n\r\nparenthesized_lambda_expression\r\n  : 'async'? parameter_list '=>' (block | expression)\r\n  ;\r\n\r\nsimple_lambda_expression\r\n  : 'async'? parameter '=>' (block | expression)\r\n  ;\r\n```\r\n\r\ninstead of\r\n\r\n```g4\r\nlambda_expression\r\n  : parenthesized_lambda_expression\r\n  | simple_lambda_expression\r\n  ;\r\n\r\nparenthesized_lambda_expression\r\n  : 'async'? parameter_list '=>' block? expression?\r\n  ;\r\n\r\nsimple_lambda_expression\r\n  : 'async'? parameter '=>' block? expression?\r\n  ;\r\n```","Url":"https://github.com/dotnet/roslyn/pull/37684","RelatedDescription":"Open PR \"Make it clear in Syntax.xml when fields are exclusive of each other.\" (#37684)"},{"Id":"475938402","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2019-08-02T21:30:07","Actor":"dotnet-bot","Number":"37670","RawContent":null,"Title":"Merge release/dev16.4-preview1 to release/dev16.4-preview1-vs-deps","State":"closed","Body":"\nThis is an automatically generated pull request from release/dev16.4-preview1 into release/dev16.4-preview1-vs-deps.\n\n``` bash\ngit fetch --all\ngit checkout merges/release/dev16.4-preview1-to-release/dev16.4-preview1-vs-deps\ngit reset --hard upstream/release/dev16.4-preview1-vs-deps\ngit merge upstream/release/dev16.4-preview1\n# Fix merge conflicts\ngit commit\ngit push upstream merges/release/dev16.4-preview1-to-release/dev16.4-preview1-vs-deps --force\n```\n\nOnce all conflicts are resolved and all the tests pass, you are free to merge the pull request.","Url":"https://github.com/dotnet/roslyn/pull/37670","RelatedDescription":"Closed or merged PR \"Merge release/dev16.4-preview1 to release/dev16.4-preview1-vs-deps\" (#37670)"},{"Id":"476352635","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2019-08-02T20:55:02","Actor":"JoeRobich","Number":"37683","RawContent":null,"Title":"Update signing cert used for EE.ResultProvider","State":"open","Body":"Move off SHA1 cert","Url":"https://github.com/dotnet/roslyn/pull/37683","RelatedDescription":"Open PR \"Update signing cert used for EE.ResultProvider\" (#37683)"},{"Id":"476348255","IsPullRequest":false,"CreatedAt":"2019-08-02T20:41:10","Actor":"vsfeedback","Number":"37682","RawContent":null,"Title":"Allow user to set opacity for fading in text editor","State":"open","Body":"_This issue has been moved from [a ticket on Developer Community](https://developercommunity.visualstudio.com/idea/659234/allow-user-to-set-opacity-for-fading-in-text-edito.html)._\n\n---\nWhen fading unused usings and private methods, allow the user to customise level of opacity used to fade the text to improve readability.\n\n---\n### Original Comments\n\n#### Fiona Niu[MSFT] on 7/24/2019, 00:48 AM: \n\nWe have converted this feedback item from problem to idea.

declarations","State":"open","Body":"**Version Used**: Visual Studio 2019 Version 16.2.0\r\n\r\n**Steps to Reproduce**:\r\n\r\nConsider the following code:\r\n\r\n    using System;\r\n\r\n    internal sealed class Disposable : IDisposable\r\n    {\r\n        public string Property { get; set; }\r\n        public void Dispose() { }\r\n    }\r\n\r\n    internal static class Program\r\n    {\r\n

code using\r\n\r\n    <Project Sdk=\"Microsoft.NET.Sdk\">\r\n\r\n      <PropertyGroup>\r\n        <OutputType>Exe</OutputType>\r\n        <TargetFramework>netcoreapp2.2</TargetFramework>\r\n        <LangVersion>8.0</LangVersion>\r\n      </PropertyGroup>\r\n\r\n    </Project>\r\n\r\n\r\n**Expected Behavior**:\r\n\r\nIDE0017 should not be reported and the associated code fix should not be available.\r\n\r\n**Actual Behavior**:\r\n\r\nIDE0017 is reported on the using declaration. When the associated code fix is applied, it generates the following code:\r\n\r\n    private static void Main(string[] args)\r\n    {\r\n        using var disposable = new Disposable\r\n        {\r\n            Property = args[2]\r\n        };\r\n    }\r\n\r\nThe behavior of this code is substantially different from the behavior of the original code. This may not be a problem, or even desired, when simply assigning to a variable. It would never be a problem when initializing a newly declared local variable, as the difference in behavior is not observable in that case (AFAIK).\r\n\r\nHowever, a using declaration is more than simply a declaration, and the difference in behavior is certainly observable! The intent of the original code clearly was to construct an object, making sure that constructed object would be disposed at the end of the current scope, even if exceptions are raised in subsequent statements. By moving the assignments in those subsequent statements into an object initializer, that intent is violated. Indeed, in the above example, if `args[2]` throws, the Dispose method will not be called on the newly created Disposable.\r\n\r\nIDE0017 should not be offered on using declarations.\r\n\r\nPS: We discovered a real bug in a real application under development, that was introduced as a result of a developer applying the IDE0017 code fix on a using declaration.","Url":"https://github.com/dotnet/roslyn/issues/37675","RelatedDescription":"Open issue \"IDE0017 should not be offered on using declarations\" (#37675)"},{"Id":"476065708","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2019-08-02T08:40:54","Actor":"CyrusNajmabadi","Number":"37674","RawContent":null,"Title":" Switch to a strongly typed version of anonymous-function syntax nodes for their \"body\"","State":"open","Body":"Instead of effectively having a property `SyntaxNode Body` we have a pair of `BlockSyntax Block` and `ExpressionSyntax ExpressionBody`.

The design for .NET Framework is that when we find RID-specific assets AND there is no explicit AnyCPU and no explicit RID, then we take the win7-x86 assets and use PlatformTarget=x86. \r\n\r\n(I regret this design, but that is the design since 1.0 SDK. It was done so that .NET Framework ASP.NET Core projects could consume libuv without setting a RID or PlatformTarget. Project.json just picked the RID of the current machine, which was worse as you get different apps on different machines. We tried to make it an error and say you had to pick a PlatformTarget or RID on .NET Framework exes, but there was a ton of complaints about it and we landed on the design described above by compromise.)\r\n\r\nThe thing is that we use win7-x86, but without a RID graph, we/NuGet don't know that win-x86 assets are applicable to win7-x86. Now that we have the RID graph always, we discover these win-x86 assets for the first time and the (regrettable) design actually kicks in.\r\n\r\nMy suggestion to avoid a breaking change here is to not pass the RID graph by default for TFMs that are not .NET Core 3.0+ or .NET Standard 2.1+. We can put it behind an opt-in for other TFMs.\r\n\r\nSeparately, roslyn should explicitly set Any CPU defensively so that they are not sensitive to which SDK is used to build them.\r\n\r\ncc @jaredpar @dsplaisted ","Url":"https://github.com/dotnet/sdk/issues/3495","RelatedDescription":"Open issue \"Inclusion of runtime graph for all TFMs causes existing .NET Framework projects to turn x86\" (#3495)"},{"Id":"474566979","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2019-07-31T20:00:57","Actor":"dotnet-maestro[bot]","Number":"3488","RawContent":null,"Title":"[release/3.0.1xx] Update dependencies from dotnet/core-setup","State":"closed","Body":"This pull request updates the following dependencies\r\n\r\n[marker]: <> (Begin:ee7760b1-2875-4869-d002-08d7114cdbad)\r\n## From https://github.com/dotnet/core-setup\r\n- **Build**: 20190729.05\r\n- **Date Produced**: 7/29/2019 3:24 PM\r\n- **Commit**: d15a0adeb874801e7bfaa4fbbb306a2efa268497\r\n- **Branch**: refs/heads/release/3.0\r\n- **Updates**:\r\n  - **Microsoft.NET.HostModel** -> 3.0.0-preview8-28379-05\r\n\r\n[marker]: <> (End:ee7760b1-2875-4869-d002-08d7114cdbad)\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n","Url":"https://github.com/dotnet/sdk/pull/3488","RelatedDescription":"Closed or merged PR \"[release/3.0.1xx] Update dependencies from dotnet/core-setup\" (#3488)"},{"Id":"475103999","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2019-07-31T15:57:53","Actor":"dotnet-maestro[bot]","Number":"3493","RawContent":null,"Title":"[master] Update dependencies from dotnet/arcade","State":"closed","Body":"This pull request updates the following dependencies\r\n\r\n[marker]: <> (Begin:daa187e0-7e60-4c7a-c1ac-08d6354da8a8)\r\n## From https://github.com/dotnet/arcade\r\n- **Build**: 20190730.3\r\n- **Date Produced**: 7/30/2019 6:57 PM\r\n- **Commit**: def377f94747dac91482aad67b33a1c011ffc770\r\n- **Branch**: refs/heads/master\r\n- **Updates**:\r\n  - **Microsoft.DotNet.Arcade.Sdk** -> 1.0.0-beta.19380.3\r\n  - **Microsoft.DotNet.SignTool** -> 1.0.0-beta.19380.3\r\n\r\n[marker]: <> (End:daa187e0-7e60-4c7a-c1ac-08d6354da8a8)\r\n\r\n","Url":"https://github.com/dotnet/sdk/pull/3493","RelatedDescription":"Closed or merged PR \"[master] Update dependencies from dotnet/arcade\" (#3493)"},{"Id":"474174355","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2019-07-31T14:57:57","Actor":"livarcocc","Number":"3481","RawContent":null,"Title":"Updating the branding to preview9","State":"closed","Body":"","Url":"https://github.com/dotnet/sdk/pull/3481","RelatedDescription":"Closed or merged PR \"Updating the branding to preview9\" (#3481)"},{"Id":"474677142","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2019-07-30T23:33:44","Actor":"dotnet-maestro[bot]","Number":"3491","RawContent":null,"Title":"[release/3.0.100-preview8] Update dependencies from dotnet/core-setup","State":"closed","Body":"This pull request updates the following dependencies\r\n\r\n[marker]: <> (Begin:0e68ca02-619f-4dab-d003-08d7114cdbad)\r\n## From https://github.com/dotnet/core-setup\r\n- **Build**: 20190730.08\r\n- **Date Produced**: 7/30/2019 7:48 PM\r\n- **Commit**: c855ac718789051d5d67282c88decca445de7711\r\n- **Branch**: refs/heads/release/3.0\r\n- **Updates**:\r\n  - **Microsoft.NET.HostModel** -> 3.0.0-preview8-28380-08\r\n\r\n[marker]: <> (End:0e68ca02-619f-4dab-d003-08d7114cdbad)\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n","Url":"https://github.com/dotnet/sdk/pull/3491","RelatedDescription":"Closed or merged PR \"[release/3.0.100-preview8] Update dependencies from dotnet/core-setup\" (#3491)"},{"Id":"474614791","IsPullRequest":false,"CreatedAt":"2019-07-30T22:18:15","Actor":"JohanLarsson","Number":"3489","RawContent":null,"Title":"Pack when referencing Microsoft.CodeAnalysis.CSharp generates exclude=\"Build,Analyzers\"","State":"closed","Body":"Repro steps:\r\n\r\n1.

As context, `master` branches produced 3.0 builds for the entire period of the 2.2 project.\r\n\r\nAt present, this change is only relevant if you contribute to .NET Core repositories. Otherwise, we recommend that you wait for the 5.0 Preview releases before installing this new version.\r\n\r\n## Discussion\r\nPlease share your thoughts on this change and see what others are saying at:\r\n\r\n[dotnet/core #3059](https://github.com/dotnet/core/issues/3059)\r\n\r\n## Details\r\n\r\nThe following repos have moved their master branches to \"5.0\":\r\n\r\n- [dotnet/coreclr](https://github.com/dotnet/coreclr)\r\n- [dotnet/corefx](https://github.com/dotnet/corefx)\r\n- [dotnet/core-setup](https://github.com/dotnet/core-setup)\r\n\r\nYou can see that [5.0 .NET Core Runtime builds](https://github.com/dotnet/core-setup#daily-builds) are now being built and published at dotnet/core-setup.\r\n\r\nIn large part, we switched `master` to 5.0 to enable to the community to contribute changes. As the .NET Core 3.0 released has progressed, we've had to increase scrutiny on the changes we will accept. Now that we've permanently branched for 3.0, we can accept a much broader set of changes. Please consider that to be an open invitation!\r\n\r\nNotably, [dotnet/core-sdk](https://github.com/dotnet/core-sdk) is not yet producing 5.0 builds. We expect that the dotnet/core-sdk master branch will continue as a 3.0 branch for 2-3 months while we finish up the .NET Core 3.0 project.\r\n\r\nAt present, there is no developer experience for 5.0. We are waiting on the dotnet/core-sdk repo to switch to 5.0. Switching your project file to target `netcoreapp5.0` won't do anything useful. We'll update this issue when a 5.0 SDK comes available.","Url":"https://github.com/dotnet/announcements/issues/118","RelatedDescription":"Open issue \".NET Core master branches have switched to \"5.0\"\" (#118)"},{"Id":"465501070","IsPullRequest":false,"CreatedAt":"2019-07-08T23:25:31","Actor":"terrajobst","Number":"117","RawContent":null,"Title":"System.Text.Json usability study results","State":"open","Body":"We've performed a usability study on the new `System.Text.Json` APIs which will replace JSON.NET as the default JSON experience in .NET Core 3.0:\r\n\r\n* We focused on the primary \"getting started\" scenarios to validate that we picked the right type- and method names.\r\n* We simulated what we believe to be common error cases to validate that our exception messages are understandable and actionable.\r\n* Since we were short on time, we couldn't use the recruiting provided by the UX lab but instead brought in our own developers, which we recruited from the .NET engineering team\r\n\r\nThis has worked out well for us as we were able to get short term feedback which resulted in significant improvements to the overall API shape and usability.

Every person who started a scenario successfully finished it.\r\n    - We feel this validates that we picked the right scope for a 60 minute study of people from various backgrounds\r\n* Overall people liked the new API\r\n    - Key value prop for most people was the fact that \"it's now built in\"\r\n    - Very few mentioned perf and the ones that did thought that it probably wouldn't make a difference in their scenarios.\r\n    - Most people said they would prefer `System.Text.Json` for new APIs, but would stick to JSON.NET in code that already uses it.\r\n    - **[Action]** None, this is in line with what we expected.\r\n* Virtually everyone tried to google for sample code in the documentation\r\n    - Everyone found our blog post and online documentation\r\n    - People new to .NET were confused that JSON.NET and `System.Text.Json` weren't the same thing\r\n    - Everyone complained that the current docs are lacking, especially sample code.\r\n    - **[Action]** Docs are work in progress. We plan on shipping with a fully documented API surface and sample code.\r\n* Virtually everyone found the key type relatively quickly\r\n    - Some people were confused when types were static, rather than something that one can new up\r\n    - **[Action]** None. This is by-design as we try to reduce the number of allocations.\r\n* Virtually everyone had trouble selecting the correct method on\r\n  `JsonSerializer`\r\n    - We chose a very complicated naming convention\r\n    - **[Action]** We simplified it by using names that people in the study told us were looking for.\r\n* Most of our error messages were well received because they told people what\r\n  the problem is & how they can fix them.\r\n    - One error message was unclear because we reported an unexpected character when we could have reported that we didn't expect a comment.\r\n    - **[Action]** We've reworded the error message.\r\n    - We had one error message that was generated by a lower layer and provided an action item that doesn't make sense when people receive it when using the higher layer component.\r\n    - **[Action]** We've reworded the error message to be more generic so it makes sense for both kind of consumers.\r\n* Virtually everyone used the new Roslyn completion feature which will also show\r\n  types from namespaces not imported yet.\r\n    - However, virtually nobody realized that they were doing it.\r\n    - This caused confusion when people found other APIs that happen to include Json in them, specifically the old data contract serialization.\r\n    - **[Action]** Talk to the Roslyn IDE team to see if this something more people will run into. This could prove to be especially problematic for technologies that share type names (e.g. `UserControl` in WinForms and WPF) and both are referenced by the project.\r\n* Optional parameters and `async`/`await` are usability cliffs\r\n    - Many were confused by optional parameters and tried to pass them in, even though they didn't have to.\r\n    - **[Action]** Talk to the Roslyn IDE team to see if we can visualize them better in VS.\r\n    - **[Action]** Try to avoid heavy use of optional parameters for mainline APIs.\r\n    - Async is a very steep cliff. People have no idea what to do in their code to make async work. While IntelliSense shows the usage by prefixing it with await, people didn't notice that.\r\n    - **[Action]** Unclear; this is a broader issue.\r\n* Virtually nobody used F1 to get help for APIs\r\n    - *Surprise*. I expected more people to use <kbd>F1</kbd>.\r\n* Virtually everyone used F12 to explore the API (\"metadata view\")\r\n    - *Surprise*. I expected most people to explore the type via the\r\n      IntelliSense completion\r\n* Nobody used Object Browser to explorer the APIs\r\n    - *Surprise*. I expected at least some people to.\r\n\r\n## Discussion\r\n\r\nFor a discussion, please go to https://github.com/dotnet/corefx/issues/39304.","Url":"https://github.com/dotnet/announcements/issues/117","RelatedDescription":"Open issue \"System.Text.Json usability study results\" (#117)"},{"Id":"465034831","IsPullRequest":false,"CreatedAt":"2019-07-08T03:13:38","Actor":"leecow","Number":"116","RawContent":null,"Title":"Updates to releases.json (.NET Core release metadata)","State":"open","Body":"**The changes described in this issue will be live with the .NET Core July update on 7/9/2019.**\r\n\r\nThe releases.json files (e.g. [2.2 releases.json](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dotnet/core/master/release-notes/2.2/releases.json)) are comprehensive metadata files which capture details of each .NET Core release. These files, along with the top level [releases-index.json](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dotnet/core/master/release-notes/releases-index.json), are becoming increasingly important .NET Core release assets. These files, one for each major.minor channel, are relied upon by many to detect when updates for .NET Core are available, discover security update details and other uses.\r\n\r\nChanges are sometimes necessary, and the growing dependencies require that we treat compatibility of the schema with the utmost care. This announcement describes an addition to the releases.json schema.\r\n\r\n## SDK Versions and Visual Studio\r\n\r\nBecause of current .NET Core SDK product construction dependencies, there is a hard link between the Runtime, SDK, toolset (compilers, MSBuild, NuGet, and other components), and Visual Studio. Simplistically, this means that when anything updates, everything updates. The unfortunate result of this linking is that multiple versions of the SDK are released with each monthly update for each supported versions of Visual Studio. For example, the May Update for .NET Core 2.2 included the 2.2.5 runtime, 2.2.107 SDK for Visual Studio 2017 and 2.2.204 for Visual Studio 2019 and yet another pair of SDK versions for .NET Core 2.1. An example of this is the [2.2.5 Release Notes](https://github.com/dotnet/core/blob/master/release-notes/2.2/2.2.5/2.2.5.md). \r\n\r\nThis is a confusing situation and we are working to mitigate the need to release multiple SDKs with .NET Core 3.0. The need for multiple SDK versions will persist for 2.1 LTS.\r\n\r\n## Adding the SDKS array\r\n\r\nTo appropriately model multiple SDKs per release, we are adding an SDKs array to releases.json, which will contain SDK objects. The top-level SDK object will represent the highest versioned SDK for a given update. Using the previous 2.2.5 update example, SDK 2.2.204 is in the top SDK object as well as duplicated in the SDKS array. All other applicable 2.2* SDK objects are included in the SDKS array. The SDK objects within the array will carry specific Visual Studio compatibility and version inclusion information to provide appropriate context.\r\n\r\nHere is an example of the new array based on the upcoming July update.\r\nAgain, this will be additive and the previous SDK object will include the highest SDK version for the release.\r\n\r\n```json\r\n{\r\n    \"sdk\": {\r\n        \"version\": \"2.2.301\",\r\n        \"version-display\": \"2.2.301\",\r\n        \"runtime-version\": \"2.2.6\",\r\n        \"vs-version\": \"16.1.3\",\r\n        \"vs-support\": \"Visual Studio 2019 (v16.1)\",\r\n        \"csharp-version\": \"7.3\",\r\n        \"fsharp-version\": \"4.5\",\r\n        \"vb-version\": null,\r\n        \"files\": []\r\n    },\r\n    \"sdks\": [\r\n        {\r\n            \"version\": \"2.2.301\",\r\n            \"version-display\": \"2.2.301\",\r\n            \"runtime-version\": \"2.2.6\",\r\n            \"vs-version\": \"16.1.3\",\r\n            \"vs-support\": \"Visual Studio 2019 (v16.1)\",\r\n            \"csharp-version\": \"7.3\",\r\n            \"fsharp-version\": \"4.5\",\r\n            \"vb-version\": null,\r\n            \"files\": []\r\n        },\r\n        {\r\n          \"version\": \"2.2.205\",\r\n          \"version-display\": \"2.2.205\",\r\n          \"runtime-version\": \"2.2.6\",\r\n          \"vs-version\": \"16.0.5\",\r\n          \"vs-support\": \"Visual Studio 2019 (v16.0)\",\r\n          \"csharp-version\": \"7.3\",\r\n          \"fsharp-version\": \"4.5\",\r\n          \"vb-version\": null,\r\n          \"files\": []\r\n        }\r\n    ]\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\n## vs-version and the Runtime\r\n\r\nThe same version of the runtime is included in multiple versions of Visual Studio. To account for this, the vs-version field is being updated to a comma-delimited string. The string will represent all versions of Visual Studio which first include the particular .NET Core update. Again, an example from the upcoming July Update.\r\n\r\n```json\r\n\"runtime\": {\r\n        \"version\": \"2.2.6\",\r\n        \"version-display\": \"2.2.6\",\r\n        \"vs-version\": \"15.9.13, 16.1.3, 16.2.0\",\r\n```\r\n\r\nThe same `vs-versions` changes will be seen in the `aspnetcore-runtime` object.\r\n\r\n## Future Enhancements\r\n\r\nThere are other improvements to the schema which have been suggested by the community which we are evaluating. Generally, theses enhancements are additive and should not represent compatibility compromises for existing parsers and similar announcements will be published ahead of any changes.\r\n\r\n","Url":"https://github.com/dotnet/announcements/issues/116","RelatedDescription":"Open issue \"Updates to releases.json (.NET Core release metadata)\" (#116)"},{"Id":"444065225","IsPullRequest":false,"CreatedAt":"2019-05-14T18:38:23","Actor":"TaraOverfield","Number":"114","RawContent":null,"Title":"May 2019 .NET Updates","State":"open","Body":"# May 2019 .NET Updates\r\n\r\nThe following .NET updates were released in May 2019.

Either target .NET Core 2.1 or lower, or use a version of the .NET SDK that supports .NET Core 2.2.`\r\n\r\nIf you downloaded the .NET Core SDK 2.2 between April 2 and April 12, 2019, the main [.NET downloads page](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/download/) included only 2.2.2nn. Starting April 12th, a new button marked \"Compatible with Visual Studio 2017\" is provided to target 2.2.1nn. If you downloaded 2.2 prior to this date, and you use Visual Studio 2017, install the compatible version.\r\n\r\n### Visual Studio 2017 can't target .NET Core 2.1\r\n\r\nIf you receive this error message in Visual Studio 2017:\r\n\r\n`The current .NET SDK does not support targeting .NET Core 2.1. Either target .NET Core 2.0 or lower, or use a version of the .NET SDK that supports .NET Core 2.1.`\r\n\r\nThis problem most often occurs because you manually uninstall the 2.1.5nn version. Simply reinstall it from the [.NET Core 2.1 downloads page](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/download/dotnet-core/2.1).\r\n\r\n## More information\r\n\r\nHere is the draft of an article we are preparing for .NET Core documentation:\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n## Solving Problems with .NET Core SDK Selection in Visual Studio\r\n\r\nYou may have .NET Core SDKs on your machine and still have problems with Visual Studio finding an appropriate one. This article explains why this happens and how you can fix your installation.\r\n\r\nWhen Visual Studio can't find an appropriate version of the .NET Core SDK, you'll receive an error message. This may appear in the Error pane as NETSDK1045:\r\n\r\n\"The current .NET SDK does not support targeting .NET Core 2...\"\r\n\r\nYou can check what .NET Core SDKs you have on your machine with the following command:\r\n\r\n```bash\r\ndotnet --list-sdks\r\n```\r\n\r\nUnless you have a global.json file, when you use `dotnet` from the command line, the latest .NET Core SDK is used.\r\n\r\n> [TIP!] \r\n> Open a command prompt and try to build with `dotnet build`. If the command line build works, but Visual Studio doesn't suggestions in this article may help.\r\n\r\nThe last two digits of the .NET Core SDK version numbers are in the format are a patch number, which is represented by `nn` in this article because we will continue to service them to include the latest runtimes. To find out more, vist the [Overview of how .NET Core is versioned page](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/core/versions/).\r\n\r\n## Fixes for Common Problems\r\n\r\n### Visual Studio 2017 can't target .NET Core 2.2\r\n\r\nIf you receive the error message in Visual Studio 2017:\r\n\r\n`The current .NET SDK does not support targeting .NET Core 2.2… Either target .NET Core 2.1 or lower, or use a version of the .NET SDK that supports .NET Core 2.2.`\r\n\r\nUse `dotnet --list-sdks` to ensure you have .NET Core SDK 2.2.1nn. As an example, 2.2.106 would be a valid entry.\r\n\r\nIf you downloaded the .NET Core SDK 2.2 after April 2, 2019, version 2.2.2nn (such as 2.2.203) is listed first and is the highest version available. However, Visual Studio 2017 requires 2.2.1nn (such as 2.2.106). .NET Core SDK 2.2.2nn works with Visual Studio 2019. Visual Studio 2017 and Visual Studio 2019 can be installed side by side, but this requires both .NET Core SDK 2.2.1nn and .NET Core SDK 2.2.2nn to develop .NET Core 2.2 applications.\r\n\r\nTo download .NET Core SDK 2.2.2nn, visit the [.NET downloads page](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/download/dotnet-core/2.2).\r\n\r\n### Visual Studio 2017 can't target .NET Core 2.1\r\n\r\nIf you receive this error message in Visual Studio 2017:\r\n\r\n`The current .NET SDK does not support targeting .NET Core 2.1. Either target .NET Core 2.0 or lower, or use a version of the .NET SDK that supports .NET Core 2.1.`\r\n\r\nUse `dotnet --list-sdks` to ensure you have .NET Core SDK 2.1.5nn. As an example, 2.1.505 would be a valid entry. \r\n\r\nThis problem occurs of you manually uninstall the 2.1.5nn version.\r\n\r\nThe Visual Studio 2019 installation will not remove this file and Visual Studio 2017 will continue to work side by side.\r\n\r\nTo reinstall .NET Core SDK 2.1.5nn, visit the [.NET downloads page](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/download/dotnet-core/2.1).\r\n\r\n### Visual Studio 2019 can't target .NET Core 3.0 Preview\r\n\r\nIf you receive this error message in Visual Studio 2019:\r\n\r\n`The current .NET SDK does not support targeting .NET Core 2.1. Either target .NET Core 2.0 or lower, or use a version of the .NET SDK that supports .NET Core 2.1.`\r\n\r\nUse `dotnet --list-sdks` to ensure you have .NET Core SDK 3.0.100-preview... As an example, SDK 3.0.100-preview3-010431 would be a valid entry.\r\n\r\nTo install .NET Core SDK 3.0.1nn preview, visit the [.NET downloads page](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/download/dotnet-core/3.0).\r\n\r\nIn Visual Studio, go to `Tools\\Options\\Projects and Solutions\\.NET Core` and check the box `Use Previews of the .NET Core SDK`.\r\n\r\n> [NOTE!]\r\n> This option will be moving to `Tools\\Options\\Environment` and renamed `Preview Features` in Visual Studio 2019 version 16.1 Preview 2.\r\n\r\nIf you are targeting .NET Core 3.0 preview, the [C# language version will be C# 8.0 Preview by default](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/visualstudio/releases/2019/release-notes#csharp-defaults) allowing you to use new C# features.\r\n\r\n## Understand the relationship between .NET Core SDKs and Visual Studio build tools\r\n\r\nVisual Studio has its own copies of tools like MSBuild, NuGet and the compilers. If you install the .NET Core workload, it also installs the .NET Core SDK which has versions of these tools and provides tasks and targets. These two versions are built from the same repositories, but target .NET Framework and .NET Core respectively. \r\n\r\nWhen you build a .NET Core project in Visual Studio, it uses Visual Studio's copy of MSBuild, but the tasks and targets are supplied from the selected version of the .NET Core SDK. \r\n\r\nWhen you upgrade the .NET Core SDK, you get new tasks and targets. These new tasks and targets may contain features that are not supported by older versions of MSBuild. Like all of the .NET Core SDK, MSBuild is backwards compatible. It is not forwards compatible.\r\n\r\nThis generally works well, but requires a guarantee that the tasks and targets work with the MSBuild version. To ensure this, each .NET Core SDK indicates an MSBuild version range that is used by Visual Studio to determine compatibility. Versions of the .NET Core SDK that have a higher MSBuild identifier than expected are ignored by Visual Studio. In the normal case, this simply means you use the tasks and targets that were installed with your version of Visual Studio.\r\n\r\nBecause of this, you may have many versions of the .NET Core SDK on your machine and Visual Studio still fail to find one it considers appropriate. This is compounded by a poor error message, which we cannot fully correct because it is from the old version of the .NET Core SDK on your machine. Confusion is also compounded by a complex non-linear release matrix that makes it difficult to predict the right .NET Core SDK to select. We are working to improve all this. \r\n\r\n## The Visual Studio / .NET Core SDK support matrix\r\n\r\nThe last two digits of the .NET Core SDK version number are a patch number, which are represented by a `nn` in this table. You can learn more about .NET Core SDK and .NET Core Runtime versioning at the [Overview of how .NET Core is versioned page](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/core/versions/).\r\n\r\nThe following table shows which Visual Studio versions and .NET Core SDKs are compatible and how they are acquired if you are working with Visual Studio. \r\n\r\n| .NET Core SDK | .NET Core Runtime | Compatible Visual Studio | MSBuild | Notes                                     |\r\n|---------------|-------------------|--------------------------|---------|-------------------------------------------|\r\n| 2.1.5nn       | 2.1               | 2017                     | 15      | Installed as part of VS 2017 version 15.9 |\r\n| 2.1.6nn       | 2.1               | 2019                     | 16      | Installed as part of VS 2019              |\r\n| 2.2.1nn       | 2.2               | 2017                     | 15      | Installed manually                        |\r\n| 2.2.2nn       | 2.2               | 2019                     | 16      | Installed as part of VS 2019              |\r\n| 3.0.1nn       | 3.0 (Preview)     | 2019                     | 16      | Installed manually                        |\r\n\r\nVisual Studio 2017 cannot work with .NET Core SDK 2.1.6nn or 2.2.2nn.\r\n\r\nTo find out more about removing older versions of the .NET Core Runtime and .NET Core SDK, visit the [How to remove the .NET Core Runtime and SDK page](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/core/versions/remove-runtime-sdk-versions?tabs=macos).\r\n\r\nTo download the .NET Core SDK, visit the [.NET downloads page](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/download/dotnet-core).","Url":"https://github.com/dotnet/announcements/issues/108","RelatedDescription":"Open issue \".NET Core SDK 2.2.2nn and 2.1.6nn do not work with Visual Studio 2017\" (#108)"},{"Id":"432081093","IsPullRequest":false,"CreatedAt":"2019-04-11T15:16:43","Actor":"KathleenDollard","Number":"107","RawContent":null,"Title":"Limit DotNetCliToolReference Tools to .NET Core 2.2 and Below","State":"open","Body":"# Limit DotNetCliToolReference Tools to .NET Core 2.2 and Below\r\n\r\n.NET Core 3 takes the next step in the .NET Core tool strategy with local tools.

This issue would occur much more frequently if targeting .NET Core 3.0 was allowed. Restricting tools to target only .NET Core 2.2 and below means existing scenarios to continue to work (as well as they previously did), regardless of the framework version targeted by the project or the current .NET Core SDK. \r\n\r\nThe new .NET Core tool strategy avoids this flaw in restore strategy and offers other benefits, like the ability to author one type of tool and install it in different ways depending on project and user needs.\r\n\r\nWe look forward to your feedback on .NET Core Local Tools, and on challenges you face moving away from DotNetCliToolReference tools. \r\n\r\n[dotnet/sdk #3057](https://github.com/dotnet/sdk/pull/3057)","Url":"https://github.com/dotnet/announcements/issues/107","RelatedDescription":"Open issue \"Limit DotNetCliToolReference Tools to .NET Core 2.2 and Below\" (#107)"},{"Id":"431012407","IsPullRequest":false,"CreatedAt":"2019-04-09T14:51:18","Actor":"MichaelSimons","Number":"106","RawContent":null,"Title":".NET Core SDK container images now contain the Visual Studio 2019 toolset","State":"open","Body":"# .NET Core SDK container images now contain the Visual Studio 2019 toolset\r\n\r\n.NET Core SDK container images now include Visual Studio 2019 tools.

There are now multiple repos for our nightly builds:\r\n\r\n* [.NET Core Nightly product repo](https://hub.docker.com/_/microsoft-dotnet-core-nightly)\r\n* [.NET Core SDK Nightly repo](https://hub.docker.com/_/microsoft-dotnet-core-nightly-sdk/)\r\n* [.NET Core ASP.NET Core Nightly repo](https://hub.docker.com/_/microsoft-dotnet-core-nightly-aspnet/)\r\n* [.NET Core Runtime Nightly repo](https://hub.docker.com/_/microsoft-dotnet-core-nightly-runtime/)\r\n* [.NET Core Runtime-deps Nightly repo](https://hub.docker.com/_/microsoft-dotnet-core-nightly-runtime-deps/)\r\n\r\nThe same split will exist for the non-nightly stable repo (currently hosted at  [microsoft/dotnet](https://hub.docker.com/r/microsoft/dotnet)) when we start publishing it to MCR and syndicating it back to DockerHub.\r\n\r\n## Changes to registry URL\r\n\r\nThe biggest change is that your Dockerfiles need to be updated to point to the MCR registry in order get access to new .NET Core container tags. The same change is required for scripts or human operations that pull images via `docker pull`.\r\n\r\nThe following example shows the registry path, repo and tag for the .NET Core 2.2 \"Nightly\" SDK on MCR:\r\n\r\n```console\r\nmcr.microsoft.com/dotnet/core-nightly/sdk:2.2\r\n```\r\n\r\nAs comparison, the following repo and tag have been used to date for the .NET Core 2.2 \"Nightly\" SDK on Docker Hub:\r\n\r\n```console\r\nmicrosoft/dotnet-nightly:2.2-sdk\r\n```\r\n\r\nThe new repo URL is provided at each of the news repos. For example, the new .NET Core SDK \"nightly\" repo provides a box on the right where you can copy and paste the correct MCR-based repo syntax that you can use for `docker pull` or in `FROM` statements in your Dockerfiles.\r\n\r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/2608468/52811702-95c5eb80-304a-11e9-8de8-e6ea1f4b4d75.png)\r\n\r\n## Servicing existing Docker Hub tags\r\n\r\nWe will continue to service existing non-version-specific or floating tags on Docker Hub while the associated .NET Core version is supported. For example the `microsoft/dotnet:2.1-sdk` tag is a floating tag that will continue to be serviced for the lifetime of .NET Core 2.1. You can continue using floating tags without issue.\r\n\r\nIf you use non-floating tags, like `microsoft/dotnet:2.1.504-sdk-alpine`, then you will need to update your Dockerfile to use a new non-floating tag. No new non-floating tags will be published to `microsoft/dotnet` and `microsoft/dotnet-nightly` after we fully transition to MCR.\r\n\r\n.NET Core 3.0 Preview 3 and later will only be made available on MCR.\r\n\r\n## Microsoft is a Verified Publisher\r\n\r\nUntil now, Microsoft-provided container images were considered \"community images\". As part of this change, we are re-classifying Microsoft as a \"verified publisher\" on Docker Hub. This designation should make it clearer that .NET and other Microsoft-provided images are coming from a verified source. There clearly was that expectation previously, but Docker is now making that clearer in the Docker Hub pages they host for Microsoft.\r\n\r\nWe will provide official vulnerability scanning Microsoft-provided images as a second phase of this transition.","Url":"https://github.com/dotnet/announcements/issues/101","RelatedDescription":"Open issue \"Publishing .NET Core images to Microsoft Container Registry (MCR)\" (#101)"},{"Id":"410784442","IsPullRequest":false,"CreatedAt":"2019-02-15T14:06:29","Actor":"TaraOverfield","Number":"100","RawContent":null,"Title":"RESOLVED: Advisory on February 2019 Security update for Windows 10 update 1809","State":"open","Body":"<strong><em>Final Update 2/19/19 @1:30 PM (PST)</em></strong><em>: This </em><em>advisory is now resolved with no action needed from Microsoft Customers.

Congratulations, Alpine team! On the .NET team, we are committed to supporting new Alpine versions quickly, and also need to define a policy for older versions. This policy only applies for the container images that we publish.\r\n\r\n## Discussion\r\nPlease share your thoughts on this change and see what others are saying at:\r\n\r\n* [dotnet-docker #933](https://github.com/dotnet/dotnet-docker/issues/933)\r\n\r\n## Policy\r\n\r\nWe intend to establish the following policy for supporting Alpine with .NET Core container images:\r\n\r\n* Support new Alpine versions within 60 days of release (hopefully much less).\r\n* Support n-1 Alpine versions for 3 months after we support a new Alpine version.\r\n\r\nNote: The [.NET Core support policy](https://github.com/dotnet/core/blob/master/os-lifecycle-policy.md) may be broader. This policy is specific to the container images we produce.\r\n\r\n## Plans\r\n\r\nWe're in the process of [fixing issues required to support Alpine 3.9](https://github.com/dotnet/dotnet-docker/issues/921). We expect that these issues will be resolved in February and that we'll be able to provide support for Alpine 3.9 in March.\r\n\r\nWe will produce Alpine 3.9 images for .NET Core 2.1, 2.2 and 3.0. Assuming we publish 3.9 images in March, we'll stop producing and supporting Alpine 3.7 and 3.8 images after June (2019).\r\n\r\n## Using Alpine-based .NET Core images\r\n\r\nWe produce a variety of Alpine-based images. You can either depend on a specific Alpine version, like with `microsoft/dotnet:2.2-sdk-alpine3.8` or opt to use the latest Alpine image we have to offer, like with `microsoft/dotnet:2.2-sdk-alpine`. Either are good choices. It is just a question of whether you want to make a conscious decision to move to later Alpine releases.\r\n\r\n## Support for ARM32?\r\n\r\nWe produce Alpine images for x64 (and ARM64, shortly). The [Alpine 3.9 announcement](https://twitter.com/alpinelinux/status/1090416212822110214) made mention of support for ARM32v7. We would like to enable .NET Core [Alpine-based images on ARM32](https://github.com/gliderlabs/docker-alpine/issues/463#issuecomment-460530395). We are patiently waiting for that to happen.

To check the currently installed runtimes, open a command prompt and run the `dotnet --info` command. If you have a 2.1 or greater runtime installed, you'll see output like the following;\r\n\r\n```text\r\n.NET Core SDK (reflecting any global.json):\r\n Version:   2.2.100\r\n Commit:    b9f2fa0ca8\r\n\r\nRuntime Environment:\r\n OS Name:     Windows\r\n OS Version:  10.0.17134\r\n OS Platform: Windows\r\n RID:         win10-x64\r\n Base Path:   C:\\Program Files\\dotnet\\sdk\\2.2.100\\\r\n\r\nHost (useful for support):\r\n  Version: 2.2.0\r\n  Commit:  1249f08fed\r\n\r\n.NET Core SDKs installed:\r\n  2.1.5 [C:\\Program Files\\dotnet\\sdk]\r\n  2.1.502 [C:\\Program Files\\dotnet\\sdk]\r\n  2.2.100 [C:\\Program Files\\dotnet\\sdk]\r\n\r\n.NET Core runtimes installed:\r\n  Microsoft.AspNetCore.All 2.1.6 [C:\\Program Files\\dotnet\\shared\\Microsoft.AspNetCore.All]\r\n  Microsoft.AspNetCore.App 2.1.6 [C:\\Program Files\\dotnet\\shared\\Microsoft.AspNetCore.App]\r\n  Microsoft.AspNetCore.All 2.2.0 [C:\\Program Files\\dotnet\\shared\\Microsoft.AspNetCore.All]\r\n  Microsoft.AspNetCore.App 2.2.0 [C:\\Program Files\\dotnet\\shared\\Microsoft.AspNetCore.App]\r\n  Microsoft.NETCore.App 2.1.6 [C:\\Program Files\\dotnet\\shared\\Microsoft.NETCore.App]\r\n  Microsoft.NETCore.App 2.2.0 [C:\\Program Files\\dotnet\\shared\\Microsoft.NETCore.App]\r\n\r\nTo install additional .NET Core runtimes or SDKs:\r\n  https://aka.ms/dotnet-download\r\n```\r\n\r\nIf your host version is 2.1.x and the highest `Microsoft.NETCore.App` runtime version is less than 2.1.7, you're vulnerable to this issue.\r\nIf your host version is 2.2.x and the highest 2.1.x `Microsoft.NETCore.App` runtime version is less than 2.2.1, you're vulnerable to this issue.\r\n\r\nYou will not see SDK versions if you have only installed the runtime.\r\n\r\n#### Applications not using Microsoft.NetCore.App\r\n\r\nThe affected assembly is also available separately as a NuGet package. If you are not using Microsoft.NetCore.App, you may still be affected if you are referencing the packages listed above.\r\n\r\n##### Direct dependencies\r\n\r\nDirect dependencies are discoverable by examining your `csproj` file. They can be fixed by [editing the project file](#fixing-direct-dependencies) or using NuGet to update the dependency.\r\n\r\n##### Transitive dependencies\r\n\r\nTransitive dependencies occur when you add a package to your project that in turn relies on another package. For example, if Contoso publishes a package `Contoso.Utility` which, in turn, depends on `Contoso.Internals` and you add the `Contoso.Utility` package to your project now your project has a direct dependency on `Contoso.Utility` and, because `Contoso.Utility` depends 'Contoso.Internals', your application gains a transitive dependency on the `Contoso.Internals` package.\r\n\r\nTransitive dependencies are reviewable in two ways:\r\n\r\n* In the Visual Studio Solution Explorer window, which supports searching.\r\n* By examining the `project.assets.json` file contained in the obj directory of your project for `csproj` based projects\r\n\r\nThe `project.assets.json` files are the authoritative list of all packages used by your project, containing both direct and transitive dependencies.\r\n\r\nThere are two ways to view transitive dependencies. You can either [use Visual Studio’s Solution Explorer](#vs-solution-explorer), or you can review [the `project.assets.json` file](#project-assets-json)).\r\n\r\n##### <a name=\"vs-solution-explorer\"></a>Using Visual Studio Solution Explorer\r\n\r\nTo use Solution Explorer, open the project in Visual Studio, and then press Ctrl+; to activate the search in Solution Explorer. Search for the [vulnerable package](#affected-software) and make a note of the version numbers of any results you find.\r\n\r\nFor example, searching for `Microsoft.AspNetCore.Mvc.Core` in an example project that contains a package that takes a dependency on `Microsoft.AspNetCore.Mvc` shows the following results in Visual Studio 2017:\r\n\r\n![Screenshot of search results in Visual Studio 2017](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/796298/25858816/8ecdc2b4-3491-11e7-9363-746804bb9832.png)\r\n\r\nThe search results appear as a tree. In the previous results, you can see that a reference to `Microsoft.AspNetCore.Mvc.Core` version 1.1.2 is discovered.\r\n\r\nUnder the Dependencies node is a NuGet node. Under the NuGet node is the list of packages you have directly taken a dependency on and their versions.\r\nIn screenshot, the application takes a direct dependency on `Microsoft.AspNetCore.Mvc`. `Microsoft.AspNetCore.Mvc` in turn has leaf nodes that list its dependencies and their versions.\r\nThe `Microsoft.AspNetCore.Mvc` package takes a dependency on a version of `Microsoft.AspNetCore.Mvc.ApiExplorer`, that in turn takes a dependency on a version of `Microsoft.AspNetCore.Mvc.Core`.\r\n\r\n##### <a name=\"project-assets-json\"></a> Manually reviewing project.assets.json\r\n\r\nOpen the *project.assets.json* file from your project’s obj directory in your editor. We suggest you use an editor that understands JSON and allows you to collapse and expand nodes to review this file.\r\nVisual Studio and Visual Studio Code provide JSON friendly editing.\r\n\r\nSearch the *project.assets.json* file for the [vulnerable package](#affected-software), using the format `packagename/` for each of the package names from the preceding table. If you find the assembly name in your search:\r\n\r\n* Examine the line on which they are found, the version number is after the `/`.\r\n* Compare to the [vulnerable versions table](#affected-software).\r\n\r\nFor example, a search result that shows `System.Private.Uri/4.3.0` is a reference to version 4.3.0 of `System.Private.Uri`.\r\n\r\nIf your *project.assets.json* file includes references to the [vulnerable package](#affected-software), then you need to fix the transitive dependencies.\r\n\r\nIf you have not found any reference to any vulnerable packages, this means either\r\n\r\n* None of your direct dependencies depend on any vulnerable packages, or\r\n* You have already fixed the problem by updating the direct dependencies.\r\n\r\n### <a name=\"how-fix\"></a>How do I fix the issue?\r\n\r\n#### Updating the version of Microsoft.NETCore.App\r\n\r\nIf your host version is a 2.1.x host you must install version 2.1.8 or later of the [.NET Core 2.1 runtime](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/download/dotnet-core/2.1), or corresponding [.NET Core 2.1 SDK](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/download/dotnet-core/2.1).\r\n\r\nIf your host version is a 2.2.x you must install version 2.2.2 or later of the [.NET Core 2.2 runtime](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/download/dotnet-core/2.2), or corresponding  [.NET Core 2.2 SDK](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/download/dotnet-core/2.2).\r\n\r\n#### <a name=\"fixing-direct-dependencies\"></a>Fixing direct dependencies\r\n\r\nOpen *projectname.csproj* in your editor. If you're using Visual Studio, right-click the project and choose **Edit projectname.csproj** from the context menu, where projectname is the name of your project. Look for `PackageReference` elements. The following shows an example project file:\r\n\r\n```xml\r\n<Project Sdk=\"Microsoft.NET.Sdk.Web\">\r\n  <PropertyGroup>\r\n    <TargetFramework>netcoreapp2.1</TargetFramework>\r\n  </PropertyGroup>\r\n  <ItemGroup>\r\n    <PackageReference Include=\"System.Private.Uri\" Version=\"4.3.0\" />\r\n  </ItemGroup>\r\n</Project>\r\n```\r\n\r\nThe preceding example has a reference to the [vulnerable package](#affected-software), as seen by the single `PackageReference` element. The name of the package is in the `Include` attribute.\r\nThe package version number is in the `Version` attribute. The previous example shows a single direct dependency on `System.Private.Uri` version 4.3.0\r\n\r\nTo update the version to the secure package, change the version number to the updated package version as listed on the table [previously](#affected-software).\r\nIn this example, update `System.Private.Uri` to the appropriate [fixed package number](#affected-software) for your major version. Save the *csproj* file. The example *csproj* now looks as follows:\r\n\r\n```xml\r\n<Project Sdk=\"Microsoft.NET.Sdk.Web\">\r\n  <PropertyGroup>\r\n    <TargetFramework>netcoreapp2.1</TargetFramework>\r\n  </PropertyGroup>\r\n  <ItemGroup>\r\n    <PackageReference Include=\"System.Private.Uri\" Version=\"4.3.0\" />\r\n  </ItemGroup>\r\n</Project>\r\n```\r\n\r\nIf you're using Visual Studio and you save your updated *csproj* file, Visual Studio will restore the new package version.\r\nYou can see the restore results by opening the **Output** window (Ctrl+Alt+O) and changing the **Show output from** drop-down list to **Package Manager**.\r\n\r\nIf you're not using Visual Studio, open a command line and change to your project directory. Execute the `dotnet restore` command to restore the updated dependencies.\r\n\r\nNow recompile your application. If after recompilation you see a *Dependency conflict warning*, you must update your other direct dependencies to versions that take a dependency on the updated package.\r\n\r\n#### <a name=\"transitive-dependencies\"></a>Fixing transitive dependencies\r\n\r\nIf your transitive dependency review found references to the [vulnerable package](#affected-software), you must add a direct dependency to the updated package to your *csproj* file to override the transitive dependency.\r\n\r\nOpen *projectname.csproj* in your editor. If you're using Visual Studio, right-click the project and choose **Edit projectname.csproj** from the context menu, where projectname is the name of your project.\r\nLook for `PackageReference` nodes, for example:\r\n\r\n```xml\r\n<Project Sdk=\"Microsoft.NET.Sdk.\">\r\n  <PropertyGroup>\r\n    <TargetFramework>net461</TargetFramework>\r\n  </PropertyGroup>\r\n  <ItemGroup>\r\n    <PackageReference Include=\"ThirdParty.NotUpdatedYet\" Version=\"2.0.0\" />\r\n  </ItemGroup>\r\n</Project>\r\n```\r\n\r\nYou must add a direct dependency to the updated version of the [vulnerable package](#affected-software) by adding it to the *csproj* file.\r\nYou do this by adding a new line to the dependencies section, referencing the fixed version.\r\nFor example, if your search showed a transitive reference to a vulnerable `System.ServiceModel.Http` version, you'd add a reference to the [fixed package number](#affected-software).\r\n\r\n```xml\r\n<Project Sdk=\"Microsoft.NET.Sdk.Web\">\r\n  <PropertyGroup>\r\n    <TargetFramework>net461</TargetFramework>\r\n  </PropertyGroup>\r\n  <ItemGroup>\r\n    <PackageReference Include=\"System.Private.Uri\" Version=\"4.3.0\" />\r\n    <PackageReference Include=\"ThirdParty.NotUpdatedYet\" Version=\"2.0.0\" />\r\n  </ItemGroup>\r\n</Project>\r\n```\r\n\r\nAfter you've added the direct dependency reference, save your *csproj* file.\r\n\r\nIf you're using Visual Studio, save your updated *csproj* file and Visual Studio will restore the new package versions.\r\nYou can see the restore results by opening the **Output** window (Ctrl+Alt+O) and changing the **Show output from** drop-down list to **Package Manager**.\r\n\r\nIf you're not using Visual Studio, open a command line and change to your project directory. Execute the `dotnet restore` command to restore the new dependencies.\r\n\r\n##### Rebuilding your application\r\n\r\nFinally, you must rebuild your application, test, and redeploy.\r\n\r\n## Other Information\r\n\r\n### Reporting Security Issues\r\n\r\nIf you have found a potential security issue in .NET Core, please email details to secure@microsoft.com.

To check the currently installed runtimes, open a command prompt and run the `dotnet --info` command. If you have a 2.1 or greater runtime installed, you'll see output like the following;\r\n\r\n```text\r\n.NET Core SDK (reflecting any global.json):\r\n Version:   2.2.100\r\n Commit:    b9f2fa0ca8\r\n\r\nRuntime Environment:\r\n OS Name:     Windows\r\n OS Version:  10.0.17134\r\n OS Platform: Windows\r\n RID:         win10-x64\r\n Base Path:   C:\\Program Files\\dotnet\\sdk\\2.2.100\\\r\n\r\nHost (useful for support):\r\n  Version: 2.2.0\r\n  Commit:  1249f08fed\r\n\r\n.NET Core SDKs installed:\r\n  2.1.5 [C:\\Program Files\\dotnet\\sdk]\r\n  2.1.502 [C:\\Program Files\\dotnet\\sdk]\r\n  2.2.100 [C:\\Program Files\\dotnet\\sdk]\r\n\r\n.NET Core runtimes installed:\r\n  Microsoft.AspNetCore.All 2.1.6 [C:\\Program Files\\dotnet\\shared\\Microsoft.AspNetCore.All]\r\n  Microsoft.AspNetCore.App 2.1.6 [C:\\Program Files\\dotnet\\shared\\Microsoft.AspNetCore.App]\r\n  Microsoft.AspNetCore.All 2.2.0 [C:\\Program Files\\dotnet\\shared\\Microsoft.AspNetCore.All]\r\n  Microsoft.AspNetCore.App 2.2.0 [C:\\Program Files\\dotnet\\shared\\Microsoft.AspNetCore.App]\r\n  Microsoft.NETCore.App 2.1.6 [C:\\Program Files\\dotnet\\shared\\Microsoft.NETCore.App]\r\n  Microsoft.NETCore.App 2.2.0 [C:\\Program Files\\dotnet\\shared\\Microsoft.NETCore.App]\r\n\r\nTo install additional .NET Core runtimes or SDKs:\r\n  https://aka.ms/dotnet-download\r\n```\r\n\r\nIf your host version is 2.1.x and the highest `Microsoft.NETCore.App` runtime version is less than 2.1.7, you're vulnerable to this issue.\r\nIf your host version is 2.2.x and the highest 2.1.x `Microsoft.NETCore.App` runtime version is less than 2.1.7, you're vulnerable to this issue.\r\n\r\nYou will not see SDK versions if you have only installed the runtime.\r\n\r\n#### Applications not using Microsoft.NetCore.App\r\n\r\nThe affected assembly is also available separately as a NuGet package. If you are not using Microsoft.NetCore.App, you may still be affected if you are referencing the packages listed above.\r\n\r\n##### Direct dependencies\r\n\r\nDirect dependencies are discoverable by examining your `csproj` file. They can be fixed by [editing the project file](#fixing-direct-dependencies) or using NuGet to update the dependency.\r\n\r\n##### Transitive dependencies\r\n\r\nTransitive dependencies occur when you add a package to your project that in turn relies on another package. For example, if Contoso publishes a package `Contoso.Utility` which, in turn, depends on `Contoso.Internals` and you add the `Contoso.Utility` package to your project now your project has a direct dependency on `Contoso.Utility` and, because `Contoso.Utility` depends 'Contoso.Internals', your application gains a transitive dependency on the `Contoso.Internals` package.\r\n\r\nTransitive dependencies are reviewable in two ways:\r\n\r\n* In the Visual Studio Solution Explorer window, which supports searching.\r\n* By examining the `project.assets.json` file contained in the obj directory of your project for `csproj` based projects\r\n\r\nThe `project.assets.json` files are the authoritative list of all packages used by your project, containing both direct and transitive dependencies.\r\n\r\nThere are two ways to view transitive dependencies. You can either [use Visual Studio’s Solution Explorer](#vs-solution-explorer), or you can review [the `project.assets.json` file](#project-assets-json)).\r\n\r\n##### <a name=\"vs-solution-explorer\"></a>Using Visual Studio Solution Explorer\r\n\r\nTo use Solution Explorer, open the project in Visual Studio, and then press Ctrl+; to activate the search in Solution Explorer. Search for the [vulnerable package](#affected-software) and make a note of the version numbers of any results you find.\r\n\r\nFor example, searching for `Microsoft.AspNetCore.Mvc.Core` in an example project that contains a package that takes a dependency on `Microsoft.AspNetCore.Mvc` shows the following results in Visual Studio 2017:\r\n\r\n![Screenshot of search results in Visual Studio 2017](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/796298/25858816/8ecdc2b4-3491-11e7-9363-746804bb9832.png)\r\n\r\nThe search results appear as a tree. In the previous results, you can see that a reference to `Microsoft.AspNetCore.Mvc.Core` version 1.1.2 is discovered.\r\n\r\nUnder the Dependencies node is a NuGet node. Under the NuGet node is the list of packages you have directly taken a dependency on and their versions.\r\nIn screenshot, the application takes a direct dependency on `Microsoft.AspNetCore.Mvc`. `Microsoft.AspNetCore.Mvc` in turn has leaf nodes that list its dependencies and their versions.\r\nThe `Microsoft.AspNetCore.Mvc` package takes a dependency on a version of `Microsoft.AspNetCore.Mvc.ApiExplorer`, that in turn takes a dependency on a version of `Microsoft.AspNetCore.Mvc.Core`.\r\n\r\n##### <a name=\"project-assets-json\"></a> Manually reviewing project.assets.json\r\n\r\nOpen the *project.assets.json* file from your project’s obj directory in your editor. We suggest you use an editor that understands JSON and allows you to collapse and expand nodes to review this file.\r\nVisual Studio and Visual Studio Code provide JSON friendly editing.\r\n\r\nSearch the *project.assets.json* file for the [vulnerable package](#affected-software), using the format `packagename/` for each of the package names from the preceding table. If you find the assembly name in your search:\r\n\r\n* Examine the line on which they are found, the version number is after the `/`.\r\n* Compare to the [vulnerable versions table](#affected-software).\r\n\r\nFor example, a search result that shows `SSystem.Net.Http/4.3.0` is a reference to version 4.3.0 of `System.Net.Http`.\r\n\r\nIf your *project.assets.json* file includes references to the [vulnerable package](#affected-software), then you need to fix the transitive dependencies.\r\n\r\nIf you have not found any reference to any vulnerable packages, this means either\r\n\r\n* None of your direct dependencies depend on any vulnerable packages, or\r\n* You have already fixed the problem by updating the direct dependencies.\r\n\r\n### <a name=\"how-fix\"></a>How do I fix the issue?\r\n\r\n#### Updating the version of Microsoft.NETCore.App\r\n\r\nIf your host version is a 2.1.x host you must install version 2.1.7 or later of the [.NET Core 2.1 runtime](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/download/dotnet-core/2.1), or corresponding [.NET Core 2.1 SDK](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/download/dotnet-core/2.1).\r\n\r\nIf your host version is a 2.2.x you must install version 2.2.1 or later of the [.NET Core 2.2 runtime](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/download/dotnet-core/2.2), or corresponding  [.NET Core 2.2 SDK](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/download/dotnet-core/2.2).\r\n\r\n#### <a name=\"fixing-direct-dependencies\"></a>Fixing direct dependencies\r\n\r\nOpen *projectname.csproj* in your editor. If you're using Visual Studio, right-click the project and choose **Edit projectname.csproj** from the context menu, where projectname is the name of your project. Look for `PackageReference` elements. The following shows an example project file:\r\n\r\n```xml\r\n<Project Sdk=\"Microsoft.NET.Sdk.Web\">\r\n  <PropertyGroup>\r\n    <TargetFramework>netcoreapp2.1</TargetFramework>\r\n  </PropertyGroup>\r\n  <ItemGroup>\r\n    <PackageReference Include=\"System.Net.Http\" Version=\"4.3.0\" />\r\n  </ItemGroup>\r\n</Project>\r\n```\r\n\r\nThe preceding example has a reference to the [vulnerable package](#affected-software), as seen by the single `PackageReference` element. The name of the package is in the `Include` attribute.\r\nThe package version number is in the `Version` attribute. The previous example shows a single direct dependency on `System.Net.Http` version 4.3.0\r\n\r\nTo update the version to the secure package, change the version number to the updated package version as listed on the table [previously](#affected-software).\r\nIn this example, update `System.IO.Pipelines` to the appropriate [fixed package number](#affected-software) for your major version. Save the *csproj* file. The example *csproj* now looks as follows:\r\n\r\n```xml\r\n<Project Sdk=\"Microsoft.NET.Sdk.Web\">\r\n  <PropertyGroup>\r\n    <TargetFramework>netcoreapp2.1</TargetFramework>\r\n  </PropertyGroup>\r\n  <ItemGroup>\r\n    <PackageReference Include=\"System.Net.Http\" Version=\"4.3.5\" />\r\n  </ItemGroup>\r\n</Project>\r\n```\r\n\r\nIf you're using Visual Studio and you save your updated *csproj* file, Visual Studio will restore the new package version.\r\nYou can see the restore results by opening the **Output** window (Ctrl+Alt+O) and changing the **Show output from** drop-down list to **Package Manager**.\r\n\r\nIf you're not using Visual Studio, open a command line and change to your project directory. Execute the `dotnet restore` command to restore the updated dependencies.\r\n\r\nNow recompile your application. If after recompilation you see a *Dependency conflict warning*, you must update your other direct dependencies to versions that take a dependency on the updated package.\r\n\r\n#### <a name=\"transitive-dependencies\"></a>Fixing transitive dependencies\r\n\r\nIf your transitive dependency review found references to the [vulnerable package](#affected-software), you must add a direct dependency to the updated package to your *csproj* file to override the transitive dependency.\r\n\r\nOpen *projectname.csproj* in your editor. If you're using Visual Studio, right-click the project and choose **Edit projectname.csproj** from the context menu, where projectname is the name of your project.\r\nLook for `PackageReference` nodes, for example:\r\n\r\n```xml\r\n<Project Sdk=\"Microsoft.NET.Sdk.\">\r\n  <PropertyGroup>\r\n    <TargetFramework>net461</TargetFramework>\r\n  </PropertyGroup>\r\n  <ItemGroup>\r\n    <PackageReference Include=\"ThirdParty.NotUpdatedYet\" Version=\"2.0.0\" />\r\n  </ItemGroup>\r\n</Project>\r\n```\r\n\r\nYou must add a direct dependency to the updated version of the [vulnerable package](#affected-software) by adding it to the *csproj* file.\r\nYou do this by adding a new line to the dependencies section, referencing the fixed version.\r\nFor example, if your search showed a transitive reference to a vulnerable `System.ServiceModel.Http` version, you'd add a reference to the [fixed package number](#affected-software).\r\n\r\n```xml\r\n<Project Sdk=\"Microsoft.NET.Sdk.Web\">\r\n  <PropertyGroup>\r\n    <TargetFramework>net461</TargetFramework>\r\n  </PropertyGroup>\r\n  <ItemGroup>\r\n    <PackageReference Include=\"System.Net.Http\" Version=\"4.3.5\" />\r\n    <PackageReference Include=\"ThirdParty.NotUpdatedYet\" Version=\"2.0.0\" />\r\n  </ItemGroup>\r\n</Project>\r\n```\r\n\r\nAfter you've added the direct dependency reference, save your *csproj* file.\r\n\r\nIf you're using Visual Studio, save your updated *csproj* file and Visual Studio will restore the new package versions.\r\nYou can see the restore results by opening the **Output** window (Ctrl+Alt+O) and changing the **Show output from** drop-down list to **Package Manager**.\r\n\r\nIf you're not using Visual Studio, open a command line and change to your project directory. Execute the `dotnet restore` command to restore the new dependencies.\r\n\r\n##### Rebuilding your application\r\n\r\nFinally, you must rebuild your application, test, and redeploy.\r\n\r\n## Other Information\r\n\r\n### Reporting Security Issues\r\n\r\nIf you have found a potential security issue in .NET Core, please email details to secure@microsoft.com.

However, .NET hasn't had a (great) built-in way to deal with JSON. Instead we've relied on [Json.NET] which continues to serve the .NET ecosystem well.\r\n\r\n[Json.NET]: https://www.newtonsoft.com/json\r\n\r\nMoving forward, we plan on making some changes to our JSON support:\r\n\r\n* **We need high-performance JSON APIs**. We need a new set of JSON APIs that are highly tuned for performance by using `Span<T>` and allows for processing UTF-8 directly without having to transcode to UTF-16 `string` instances. Both aspects are critical for our web server Kestrel, where throughput is a key requirement.\r\n\r\n* **Remove dependency from ASP.NET Core to Json.NET**. Today, ASP.NET Core has a dependency on Json.NET. While this provides a tight integration between ASP.NET Core and Json.NET, it also means that application developers cannot freely choose which JSON library they are using. This is also problematic for customers of Json.NET as the version is dictated by the underlying platform. However, Json.NET is frequently updated and application developers often want to -- or even have to -- use a specific version. Thus, we want to remove the dependency from ASP.NET Core 3.0 to Json.NET so that customers can choose which version to use, without fearing they might accidentally break the underlying platform. In addition, this makes it also possible to plug-in an entirely different JSON library.\r\n\r\n* **Provide an ASP.NET Core integration package for Json.NET**. Json.NET has basically become the Swiss Army knife of JSON processing in .NET. It provides many options and facilities that allow customers to handle their JSON needs with ease. We don't want to compromise on the Json.NET support customers are getting today, for example, the ability to configure the JSON serialization via the `AddJsonOptions` extension method. Thus, we want to provide the Json.NET integration as a NuGet package that developers can optionally install so they get all the bells and whistles they get from Json.NET today. The other part of this work item is to ensure we have the right extension points so that other parties can provide similar integration packages for their JSON library of choice.\r\n\r\nBelow are more details around this plan.\r\n\r\n## The need for high-performance JSON APIs\r\n\r\nThe requirements for the .NET stack have changed a bit since the arrival of .NET Core. Historically, .NET has valued usability and convenience. With .NET Core, we've added a focus on performance, and we've made significant investments to serve high performance needs. And the [improvements we made][techempower] in the popular TechEmpower benchmark are a testament to that.\r\n\r\n[techempower]: https://www.techempower.com/blog/2016/11/16/framework-benchmarks-round-13/\r\n\r\nWith .NET Core 2.1, we've added a brand new primitive called [Span\\<T>][span-msdn] that allows us to represent native memory and arrays in a uniform way. With this type, we've also added a set of parsing and encoding APIs that are much more memory efficient without having to resort to unsafe code.\r\n\r\n[span-msdn]: https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/magazine/mt814808.aspx\r\n\r\nPart of the work of minimizing allocations is to avoid having to transcode UTF-8 payloads into UTF-16 strings, purely for parsing reasons. Currently, Json.NET is implemented by reading UTF-16. We need the ability to read (and write) JSON documents directly in UTF-8 because most network protocols (including HTTP) use UTF-8.\r\n\r\nDuring .NET Core 2.1 we've learned that updating our existing APIs to leverage `Span<T>` has limits. While we did add a bunch of overloads that accept spans, we also had to produce brand new APIs that are designed around minimizing allocations and dealing with buffers, which we exposed in `System.Buffers` namespaces. And with `System.IO.Pipelines` we've also added a programming model that enables developers to share buffers without having to deal with lifetime issues.\r\n\r\nBased on these experiences we believe in order to support JSON parsing, we'll need to expose a new set of JSON APIs that are specifically geared for high-performance scenarios.\r\n\r\nYou might wonder why we can't just update Json.NET to include support for parsing JSON using `Span<T>`? Well, James Newton-King -- the author of Json.NET -- has the following to say about that:\r\n\r\n> Json.NET was created over 10 years ago, and since then it has added a wide range of features aimed to help developers work with JSON in .NET. In that time Json.NET has also become far and away NuGet's most depended on and downloaded package, and is the go-to library for JSON support in .NET. Unfortunately, Json.NET's wealth of features and popularity works against making major changes to it. Supporting new technologies like `Span<T>` would require fundamental breaking changes to the library and would disrupt existing applications and libraries that depend on it.\r\n>\r\n> Going forward Json.NET will continue to be worked on and invested in, both addressing known issues today and supporting new platforms in the future. Json.NET has always existed alongside other JSON libraries for .NET, and there will be nothing to prevent you using one or more together, depending on whether you need the performance of the new JSON APIs or the large feature set of Json.NET.\r\n\r\n## Move Json.NET integration into a separate NuGet package\r\n\r\nToday, you cannot use ASP.NET Core without Json.NET because it is a dependency of ASP.NET Core itself. Over the years, we've received feedback that the dependency can conflict with other libraries that have their own dependency on a different version of Json.NET. In the past, we've considered addressing this issue by using a private copy of Json.NET in ASP.NET. However, this would create problems when developers want to configure Json.NET (for instance, in order to control how the serializer behaves when formatting JSON objects).\r\n\r\nMoving forward we'd like to:\r\n\r\n1. Replace the internal usage of Json.NET in ASP.NET Core by the new platform-provided JSON APIs.\r\n\r\n2. Factor the public facing usage of Json.NET into an optional integration package that can be acquired from NuGet.\r\n\r\nSo the existing integration between ASP.NET Core and Json.NET will continue to be supported, but will be moving out of the platform and into a separate package. However, since the integration is then designed to sit on top of the platform, it will also allow customers to update Json.NET to later versions.\r\n\r\nFurthermore, customers who need more performance can also choose to use the new JSON APIs, at the expense of the rich feature set that Json.NET offers.\r\n\r\n## Discussion\r\n\r\nFor a discussion, please go to https://github.com/dotnet/corefx/issues/33115.","Url":"https://github.com/dotnet/announcements/issues/90","RelatedDescription":"Open issue \"The future of JSON in .NET Core 3.0\" (#90)"},{"Id":"368440353","IsPullRequest":false,"CreatedAt":"2018-10-09T23:44:06","Actor":"vivmishra","Number":"89","RawContent":null,"Title":"October 2018 .NET Updates","State":"open","Body":"# October 2018 .NET Updates\r\n\r\nThe following .NET updates were released in October 2018.
