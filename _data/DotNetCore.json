When .NET Core SDK 3.0.200 becomes available and is installed on the same machine, .NET Core SDK versions like 3.0.101 will not be removed but stay side by side with 3.0.200.\r\n\r\nThis approach supports use of `global.json` which will roll forward across patch versions, but not feature bands of the SDK. Thus, upgrading via the SDK installer will not result in errors due to a missing SDK. Feature bands also align with side by side Visual Studio installations for those users that install SDKs for Visual Studio use. For example, Visual Studio 15.9 uses .NET Core SDK 2.2.500 but does not support .NET Core SDK 2.2.600.\r\n\r\nFind out how to [remove other .NET Core SDK versions here.](https://docs.microsoft.com/dotnet/core/versions/remove-runtime-sdk-versions)."},{"Id":"9078417647","Type":"IssuesEvent","CreatedAt":"2019-02-15T22:24:40","Actor":"richlander","Repository":"dotnet/announcements","Organization":"dotnet","RawContent":null,"RelatedAction":"opened","RelatedUrl":"https://github.com/dotnet/announcements/issues/101","RelatedDescription":"Opened issue \"Publishing .NET Core images to Microsoft Container Registry (MCR)\" (#101) at dotnet/announcements","RelatedBody":"# Publishing .NET Core images to Microsoft Container Registry (MCR)\r\n\r\nMicrosoft teams are now publishing container images to the [Microsoft Container Registry](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/blog/microsoft-syndicates-container-catalog/). There are two primary reasons for this change:\r\n\r\n* Syndicate Microsoft-provided container images to multiple registries, like Docker Hub and Red Hat.\r\n* Use Microsoft Azure as a global CDN for delivering Microsoft-provided container images.\r\n\r\nYou will use and see MCR as a storage back-end for Microsoft images. The primary way you learn about Microsoft container images and tags will be through a registry, which for most users will continue to be Docker Hub. Most of the experience you've had browsing for .NET Core container images will continue unchanged with this new model. The Docker Hub URLs you've used for Microsoft repos will continue to work, and forward to updated locations on Docker Hub. Existing Docker Hub will images will be maintained as-is.\r\n\r\n## Discussion\r\nPlease share your thoughts on this change and see what others are saying at:\r\n\r\n* [dotnet-docker #935](https://github.com/dotnet/dotnet-docker/issues/935)\r\n\r\n## Starting with .NET Core nightly repo\r\n\r\nOn the .NET team, we started our [transition to MCR](https://github.com/dotnet/dotnet-docker/issues/745) with the .NET Core \"nightly\" repo. [dotnet-nightly](dockerhub.com/r/microsoft/dotnet-nightly) is now hosted on MCR and syndicated to Docker Hub. We started with the nightly repo in order to discover and fix any challenges we found with this new model before we move our higher-traffic primary container repository.\r\n\r\nWe will start publishing [dotnet](dockerhub.com/r/microsoft/dotnet) to MCR a bit later, in either February or March. This issue will be updated when that happens.\r\n\r\n## Repo Split\r\n\r\nThe [.NET Core repo](https://hub.docker.com/r/microsoft/dotnet) currently includes 4 major categories of tags: \r\n\r\n* `sdk`\r\n* `aspnetcore-runtime`\r\n* `runtime` \r\n* `runtime-deps`\r\n\r\nProviding all of the tags in one place has helped with discoverability but made for a repo with an enormous README that can be challenging to navigate and consume. It is large enough that we exceeded Docker Hub README limits and had to artificially make it smaller.\r\n\r\nGoing forward, we will provide a repo for each of the tag categories listed above. We'll also provide a \"product repo\" that will hierarchicaly group all of our repos together. This will satisfy discoverability needs so that it will be easy to find the tags you want.\r\n\r\nYou can already see this experience with [microsoft-dotnet-core-nightly](https://hub.docker.com/_/microsoft-dotnet-core-nightly). There are now multiple repos for our nightly builds:\r\n\r\n* [.NET Core Nightly product repo](https://hub.docker.com/_/microsoft-dotnet-core-nightly)\r\n* [.NET Core SDK Nightly repo](https://hub.docker.com/_/microsoft-dotnet-core-nightly-sdk/)\r\n* [.NET Core ASP.NET Core Nightly repo](https://hub.docker.com/_/microsoft-dotnet-core-nightly-aspnet/)\r\n* [.NET Core Runtime Nightly repo](https://hub.docker.com/_/microsoft-dotnet-core-nightly-runtime/)\r\n* [.NET Core Runtime-deps Nightly repo](https://hub.docker.com/_/microsoft-dotnet-core-nightly-runtime-deps/)\r\n\r\nThe same split will exist for the non-nightly stable repo (currently hosted at  [microsoft/dotnet](https://hub.docker.com/r/microsoft/dotnet)) when we start publishing it to MCR and syndicating it back to DockerHub.\r\n\r\n## Changes to registry URL\r\n\r\nThe biggest change is that your Dockerfiles need to be updated to point to the MCR registry in order get access to new .NET Core container tags. The same change is required for scripts or human operations that pull images via `docker pull`.\r\n\r\nThe following example shows the registry path, repo and tag for the .NET Core 2.2 \"Nightly\" SDK on MCR:\r\n\r\n```console\r\nmcr.microsoft.com/dotnet/core-nightly/sdk:2.2\r\n```\r\n\r\nAs comparison, the following repo and tag have been used to date for the .NET Core 2.2 \"Nightly\" SDK on Docker Hub:\r\n\r\n```console\r\nmicrosoft/dotnet-nightly:2.2-sdk\r\n```\r\n\r\nThe new repo URL is provided at each of the news repos. For example, the new .NET Core SDK \"nightly\" repo provides a box on the right where you can copy and paste the correct MCR-based repo syntax that you can use for `docker pull` or in `FROM` statements in your Dockerfiles.\r\n\r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/2608468/52811702-95c5eb80-304a-11e9-8de8-e6ea1f4b4d75.png)\r\n\r\n## Servicing existing Docker Hub tags\r\n\r\nWe will continue to service existing non-version-specific or floating tags on Docker Hub while the associated .NET Core version is supported. For example the `microsoft/dotnet:2.1-sdk` tag is a floating tag that will continue to be serviced for the lifetime of .NET Core 2.1. You can continue using floating tags without issue.\r\n\r\nIf you use non-floating tags, like `microsoft/dotnet:2.1.504-sdk-alpine`, then you will need to update your Dockerfile to use a new non-floating tag. No new non-floating tags will be published to `microsoft/dotnet` and `microsoft/dotnet-nightly` after we fully transition to MCR.\r\n\r\n.NET Core 3.0 Preview 3 and later will only be made available on MCR.\r\n\r\n## Microsoft is a Verified Publisher\r\n\r\nUntil now, Microsoft-provided container images were considered \"community images\". As part of this change, we are re-classifying Microsoft as a \"verified publisher\" on Docker Hub. This designation should make it clearer that .NET and other Microsoft-provided images are coming from a verified source. There clearly was that expectation previously, but Docker is now making that clearer in the Docker Hub pages they host for Microsoft.\r\n\r\nWe will provide official vulnerability scanning Microsoft-provided images as a second phase of this transition."},{"Id":"9075495754","Type":"IssuesEvent","CreatedAt":"2019-02-15T14:06:30","Actor":"TaraOverfield","Repository":"dotnet/announcements","Organization":"dotnet","RawContent":null,"RelatedAction":"opened","RelatedUrl":"https://github.com/dotnet/announcements/issues/100","RelatedDescription":"Opened issue \"Advisory on February 2019 Security update for Windows 10 update 1809\" (#100) at dotnet/announcements","RelatedBody":"<span>The </span><a href=\"https://blogs.msdn.microsoft.com/dotnet/2019/02/13/net-framework-february-2019-security-and-quality-rollup/\" rel=\"nofollow\">February 2019 Security and Quality Rollup for Windows 10 update 1809</a><span> was released earlier this week.

Congratulations, Alpine team! On the .NET team, we are committed to supporting new Alpine versions quickly, and also need to define a policy for older versions. This policy only applies for the container images that we publish.\r\n\r\n## Discussion\r\nPlease share your thoughts on this change and see what others are saying at:\r\n\r\n* [dotnet-docker #933](https://github.com/dotnet/dotnet-docker/issues/933)\r\n\r\n## Policy\r\n\r\nWe intend to establish the following policy for supporting Alpine with .NET Core container images:\r\n\r\n* Support new Alpine versions within 60 days of release (hopefully much less).\r\n* Support n-1 Alpine versions for 3 months after we support a new Alpine version.\r\n\r\nNote: The [.NET Core support policy](https://github.com/dotnet/core/blob/master/os-lifecycle-policy.md) may be broader. This policy is specific to the container images we produce.\r\n\r\n## Plans\r\n\r\nWe're in the process of [fixing issues required to support Alpine 3.9](https://github.com/dotnet/dotnet-docker/issues/921). We expect that these issues will be resolved in February and that we'll be able to provide support for Alpine 3.9 in March.\r\n\r\nWe will produce Alpine 3.9 images for .NET Core 2.1, 2.2 and 3.0. Assuming we publish 3.9 images in March, we'll stop producing and supporting Alpine 3.7 and 3.8 images after June (2019).\r\n\r\n## Using Alpine-based .NET Core images\r\n\r\nWe produce a variety of Alpine-based images. You can either depend on a specific Alpine version, like with `microsoft/dotnet:2.2-sdk-alpine3.8` or opt to use the latest Alpine image we have to offer, like with `microsoft/dotnet:2.2-sdk-alpine`. Either are good choices. It is just a question of whether you want to make a conscious decision to move to later Alpine releases.\r\n\r\n## Support for ARM32?\r\n\r\nWe produce Alpine images for x64 (and ARM64, shortly). The [Alpine 3.9 announcement](https://twitter.com/alpinelinux/status/1090416212822110214) made mention of support for ARM32v7.

exceptions, which were impossible to pinpoint because of the missing stack trace. After spending some time commenting out code I found that there is an issue with dependency injection, specifically when you do a lot of it.\r\n\r\nOne service had about 500 generic classes injected (think IQueryContext<T> concept), which in turn had 5 other services injected. When doing any API call the class got created, without issues, but when doing a subsequent call it would throw the StackOverflowException. When removing some of the injected services it would throw the StackOverflow exception only after 5-6 API calls, and by removing even more it would stop.\r\n\r\nAfter doing some testing I couldn't reproduce the stack overflow exception but noticed when you inject more than 700 services into a class it will fail in Visual Studio 2017 with an Access Violation. I attached a sample to show this issue.\r\n[TestApp1.zip](https://github.com/dotnet/core/files/2967265/TestApp1.zip)\r\n\r\nNow I understand that this is excessive and I re-wrote some of our app to dynamically load the correct service instead, but is there any official stance on the limitations of dependency injection?\r\n\r\n\n\n_Copied from original issue: dotnet/core#2458_"},{"Id":"9259512450","Type":"PullRequestEvent","CreatedAt":"2019-03-18T00:06:23","Actor":"dotnet-maestro-bot","Repository":"dotnet/coreclr","Organization":"dotnet","RawContent":null,"RelatedAction":"opened","RelatedUrl":"https://github.com/dotnet/coreclr/pull/23308","RelatedDescription":"Opened pull request \"[automated] Merge branch 'master' => 'release/3.0'\" (#23308) at dotnet/coreclr","RelatedBody":"I detected changes in the master branch which have not been merged yet to release/3.0.

Followup to https://github.com/dotnet/roslyn/pull/33647.  This will be easier to review if that goes in.\r\n2. There's a large amount of diff here due to resource files switchin from tabs to spaces.  not sure what's up with that.\r\n\r\n## Description\r\n\r\nThis PR stems from several pieces of feedback we've gotten over time about how \"use var when type is apparent\" is a bit too broad for some people's tastes.\r\n\r\nSpecifically, \"when apparent\" has a couple of cases that are a little too broad for people.  For example, 'when apparent' supports this case:\r\n\r\n```c#\r\nvar v = x.ToString();\r\n```\r\n\r\nThe feeling here was that a `ToXXX` method made it apparent-enough that the type on the left would be `XXX`.  However, this was unpleasant for some as it's a very tenuous connection, with `XXX` not actually appearing on the RHS as an actual type.\r\n\r\nIn a similar vein, \"when apparent\" was not strict about generics.  if you had, for example:\r\n\r\n```c#\r\nvar arr = ImmutableArray.Create(1, 2, 3);\r\n```\r\n\r\nIt would consider this an apparent enough match since the type on the left and the right are both `ImmutableArray` in terms of their name.  However, the type on the left is `ImmutableArray<int>` and the lack of `int` on the RHS made this unpalatable for people.\r\n\r\nFinally, there were common method invocation patterns not detected.  For example:\r\n\r\n```c#\r\nvar logger = component.GetService<ILogger>();\r\n```\r\n\r\nIn this case, people felt that this was an apparent use of ILogger and should fall under that category.\r\n\r\nin this PR we now add a new editorconfig option `csharp_style_var_when_type_is_explicit`.  The meaning is similar to `csharp_style_var_when_type_is_apparent` except that it's now a requirement that the actual type show up in an appropriate location in syntax on the RHS.  The allowed syntax locations are:\r\n\r\n1. `= default(SomeType)`\r\n2. `= new SomeType(...)`\r\n3. `= new SomeType[...] { ... }`\r\n4. `= ... as SomeType`\r\n5. `= (SomeType)...`\r\n6. `= Foo<SomeType>(...)` (Foo has to return `SomeType`).\r\n7. `= SomeType.FactoryMethod(...)` (FactoryMethod has to return `SomeType`).\r\n\r\n## Design questions\r\n\r\nNote: there is an open design question around a few cases.\r\n\r\n1. tuples.  i.e. if you have:\r\n\r\n```c#\r\nvar v = (default(SomeType), default(SomeOtherType);\r\n```\r\n\r\nIs the type of 'v' considered 'explicit'?  I personally think so.  It's clearly `(SomeType, SomeOtherType)` from very obvious syntax.  However, i could see some debate here, so i bring this up in case we want to consider that non-explicit.\r\n\r\n2. There are certain C# constructs that are completely clear about what type they are, even if the type is not stated.  for example `var v = x is Y`.  'bool' here has the type `bool`.  But `bool` was never stated explicit.  Do we care about this sort of case?  Probably not IMO. It's pretty reasonable that `explicit` means `stated as type` or `stated as type within a large type syntax` (like the tuple case).  \r\n\r\n3. Sometimes a type can be semi-explicit in code in something like `ImmutableArray.Create<int>(...)`.  Here, both `ImmutableArray` and `<int>` are specified.  So one might see that as explicit-enough to indicate that it is `ImmutableArray<int>`.\r\n\r\n## UI \r\n\r\nTo help make the concept understandable, here's the UI:\r\n\r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/4564579/53307441-76e70680-384d-11e9-9539-5545cf93cf4f.png)\r\n\r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/4564579/53307443-7cdce780-384d-11e9-83a5-1fe62927008e.png)\r\n\r\n## TODO\r\n\r\n- [ ] Needs tests.

This is different from today where if a user wants to store checksum information they must store it *inside* the data they are storing in the persistence engine.\r\n\r\nThe benefit of this approach is taht it now allows clients to read and check that checksum information without having to read the entire row of the DB and process it.  For example, imagine out syntax indices for files are several KB each.  After a user opens a solution, we need to go check each index to see if we should recompute it.  Ideally, most of the time this shouldn't be necessary and we can check the persisted checksum against our current checksum.  However, with the older persistence system you'd have to read every single index out and validate it's checksum against the current checksum.  That means several large allocations and processing of that data, even for the common case of nothing changing.\r\n"},{"Id":"9260380101","Type":"PullRequestEvent","CreatedAt":"2019-03-18T05:22:09","Actor":"CyrusNajmabadi","Repository":"dotnet/roslyn","Organization":"dotnet","RawContent":null,"RelatedAction":"closed","RelatedUrl":"https://github.com/dotnet/roslyn/pull/30954","RelatedDescription":"Closed pull request \"Update 'remove unnecessary parens' to support removing from 'negated if statements'.\" (#30954) at dotnet/roslyn","RelatedBody":"Followup to https://github.com/dotnet/roslyn/pull/30945.

The impl satisfies an updated grammar production of:\r\n\r\n```\r\nif_statement\r\n    : 'if' '!'? '(' boolean_expression ')' embedded_statement\r\n    | 'if' '!' ?'(' boolean_expression ')' embedded_statement 'else' embedded_statement\r\n    ;\r\n```\r\n\r\nHowever, it does so with a potentially unexpected implementation strategy.  Specifically, i looked into a few ways to implement this in the C# compiler. \r\n\r\nThe first was simply to add an optional `!` token to `IfStatementSyntax`.  This had the pro of being an exceptionally simple grammar.xml/syntax change.  However, it had a lot of unpleasant fallout. \r\n\r\nSpecifically, every single piece of code that analyzed semantics of expressions in the compiler and IDE now likely needed to be updated to understand this form.  i.e. when analyzing the 'Condition' of a If-Statement, you needed to pass a boolean along saying if it was negated, and that then had to flow into the code that deals with LogicalNotExpressions.  In a similar vein, every IDE feature had to be updated to understand this form.  For example, in order to goto-def on an overloaded `!` operator, you needed special code to analyze an `IfStatement` and get the right operator called, since htat was not available on the actual condition operator.  This had widespread consequences and turned out to be highly unpalatable.  \r\n\r\nThe second implementation strategy was similar to the first.  Except this involved a common base type that there would be two 'IfStatements' deriving from.  The existing IfStatement, and a new GuardIfStatement.   This was also unpalatable because it meant every single piece of code that examined a `SyntaxKind.IfStatement` something highly suspect and in need of auditing.\r\n\r\nThe approach i settled on here was to instead change the Roslyn syntactic model to allow the parentheses of an IfStatement to be *optional*.  However, there is a compiler/parser enforced invariant, that you can *only* elide those parentheses **if** the conditional is of the form `!(...)`.  i.e. the condition *must*  be a `logical-not surrounding a parenthesized-expression`.    \r\n\r\nThe actual LanguageParser impl initially operates exactly as the updated grammar would expect.  It looks for an optional `!`, and then parses the rest of the `if statement` normally.  Then, if it saw `!`, it takes it, the `parens` and the `condition` and then manually just constructs the `!(cond)` *expression* and passes that along as hte condition, with the `parens` no longer being passed explicitly.  \r\n\r\nThis approach also ensures we don't have any sort of weird precedence problems.  For example, we explicitly do *not* call `ParseExpression` on the `(` as that could consume up through the `)` as many different types of expressions, including something that would then try to consume the code of the subsequent `true-statement` of the `if`.\r\n\r\nThis enforcement means we only parse exactly the set of input strings that the above grammar rules allow.  However, it also means that the entire roslyn stack now gets a standard IfStatementSyntax with a normal 'Condition' expression.  For nearly all analysis/compilation/semantics, this means no changes necessary whatsoever, as almost none of those codepaths care about the presence or absence of outer parens on the IfStatement.  Instead, the burden is placed on a far smaller set of consumers.  Specifically, those customers for whom specific decisions have to be made based on these tokens being there are not.  In other words, a minimal set of IDE features that have specialized logic involving the Open/CloseParent tokens of an IfStatement.  Fortunately, it is not hard to determine which features these are.  It suffices to just audit usages of those two properties (of which there are just a tiny set in the **entire** codebase).  \r\n\r\nWhile this approach feels a little different than how we might normally do things, i think the pros are significant.  IfStatement conditions always remain expressions, and those expressions behave exactly how they always have.  There's just a new facility for leaving off the parens in a very specific case, and only features that specifically care about these parens need to care.\r\n\r\n--\r\n\r\nNote: i have only done this work for IfStatements.  I think it would be appropriate to extend this to `while` and `do` statements as well.  However, i don't want to move forward unless this approach is felt to be appropriate.\r\n\r\n--\r\n\r\nTodos:\r\n- [x] Gate this behind a language version check.  Have currently gated this behind C#8.  Will have to move to 8.1 if this would not fit in the 8.0 release.\r\n- [ ] Adequate testing at the compiler layer.  This includes, but is not limited to: \r\n- [ ] Parsing\r\n- [ ] Semantic analysis\r\n- [ ] Analyzer callbacks\r\n- [ ] Emit\r\n- [ ] Support 'while' or 'do' statements if the LDM wants this.\r\n- [ ] IDE test pass of all potentially impacted features.\r\n- [ ] IDE design work for anything new.  For example, do we need a formatting option to say if you prefer `if !(...)` vs. `if! (...)`?  Have to discuss things with team to see what is felt to be appropriate.\r\n- [ ] Potential codestyle/feature to allow users to say if they prefer this form, and to update their code accordingly.  Work for that is ongoing in: https://github.com/dotnet/roslyn/pull/30954.  I'd like to keep new feature-work separate from just the language-change/fallout PR.\r\n-[ ] For LDM, we need a PR with a proposal in a separate file next to the template https://github.com/dotnet/csharplang/blob/master/proposals/proposal-template.md.\r\n- [ ] In the feature branch, we need to add a feature document under https://github.com/dotnet/roslyn/tree/features/NegatedConditionStatements/docs/features, see for examples for other features in this folder.\r\n- [ ] SemanticModel/IOperation/ControlFlowGraph test, etc.\r\nAlso, we need an issue with a Test Plan for the feature, see #25073, #28588, etc. for example.

clrjit!Compiler::fgMorphSmpOp/clrjit!Compiler::fgMorphTree","State":"open","Body":"_From @farlock85 on March 14, 2019 15:53_\n\nOur new application suddenly started throwing StackOverflow exceptions, which were impossible to pinpoint because of the missing stack trace. After spending some time commenting out code I found that there is an issue with dependency injection, specifically when you do a lot of it.\r\n\r\nOne service had about 500 generic classes injected (think IQueryContext<T> concept), which in turn had 5 other services injected. When doing any API call the class got created, without issues, but when doing a subsequent call it would throw the StackOverflowException. When removing some of the injected services it would throw the StackOverflow exception only after 5-6 API calls, and by removing even more it would stop.\r\n\r\nAfter doing some testing I couldn't reproduce the stack overflow exception but noticed when you inject more than 700 services into a class it will fail in Visual Studio 2017 with an Access Violation. I attached a sample to show this issue.\r\n[TestApp1.zip](https://github.com/dotnet/core/files/2967265/TestApp1.zip)\r\n\r\nNow I understand that this is excessive and I re-wrote some of our app to dynamically load the correct service instead, but is there any official stance on the limitations of dependency injection?\r\n\r\n\n\n_Copied from original issue: dotnet/core#2458_","Url":"https://github.com/dotnet/coreclr/issues/23309","RelatedDescription":"Open issue \"Stack overflow in clrjit!Compiler::fgMorphSmpOp/clrjit!Compiler::fgMorphTree\" (#23309)"},{"Id":"421991105","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2019-03-18T00:06:22","Actor":"dotnet-maestro-bot","Number":"23308","RawContent":null,"Title":"[automated] Merge branch 'master' => 'release/3.0'","State":"open","Body":"I detected changes in the master branch which have not been merged yet to release/3.0.

Perhaps one could argue that `qre` and `qim` needs visibility because I named the variables (lvalue expressions to borrow a term from c++) but it also seems intermediate results are stored on the stack (rvalue expressions).\r\n\r\nI was helped somewhat by adding `in` that did eliminate some code but no the unnecessary writes to stack (unnecessary as it seems to me).\r\n\r\nIf inline all operations so that my inner loop looks like this:\r\n\r\n```csharp\r\n        var qrex  = Avx.Multiply(rex,rex);\r\n        var qrey  = Avx.Multiply(rey,rey);\r\n        var qrez  = Avx.Multiply(rez,rez);\r\n        var qimx  = Avx.Multiply(imx,imx);\r\n        var qimy  = Avx.Multiply(imy,imy);\r\n        var qimz  = Avx.Multiply(imz,imz);\r\n        var reimx = Avx.Multiply(rex,imx);\r\n        var reimy = Avx.Multiply(rey,imy);\r\n        var reimz = Avx.Multiply(rez,imz);\r\n        rex = Avx.Add(Avx.Subtract(qrex,qimx),crex);\r\n        rey = Avx.Add(Avx.Subtract(qrey,qimy),crey);\r\n        rez = Avx.Add(Avx.Subtract(qrez,qimz),crez);\r\n        imx = Avx.Add(Avx.Add(reimx,reimx),cimx);\r\n        imy = Avx.Add(Avx.Add(reimy,reimy),cimy);\r\n        imz = Avx.Add(Avx.Add(reimz,reimz),cimz);\r\n```\r\n\r\nThen the disassembly looks more appealing and performs 3x faster.\r\n\r\n\r\n```asm\r\n; qre = re*re\r\n00007ffa`edf88373 c54c59e6        vmulps  ymm12,ymm6,ymm6\r\n00007ffa`edf88377 c54459ef        vmulps  ymm13,ymm7,ymm7\r\n00007ffa`edf8837b c4413c59f0      vmulps  ymm14,ymm8,ymm8\r\n; qim = im*im\r\n00007ffa`edf88380 c4413459f9      vmulps  ymm15,ymm9,ymm9\r\n00007ffa`edf88385 c4c12c59ea      vmulps  ymm5,ymm10,ymm10\r\n00007ffa`edf8838a c4c12459e3      vmulps  ymm4,ymm11,ymm11\r\n; reim = re*im\r\n00007ffa`edf8838f c4414459d2      vmulps  ymm10,ymm7,ymm10\r\n00007ffa`edf88394 c4413c59db      vmulps  ymm11,ymm8,ymm11\r\n00007ffa`edf88399 c4414c59c9      vmulps  ymm9,ymm6,ymm9\r\n; (qre - qim) + cre\r\n00007ffa`edf8839e c4c11c5cf7      vsubps  ymm6,ymm12,ymm15\r\n00007ffa`edf883a3 c5cc58f0        vaddps  ymm6,ymm6,ymm0\r\n00007ffa`edf883a7 c5945ced        vsubps  ymm5,ymm13,ymm5\r\n00007ffa`edf883ab c5d458f9        vaddps  ymm7,ymm5,ymm1\r\n00007ffa`edf883af c58c5ce4        vsubps  ymm4,ymm14,ymm4\r\n00007ffa`edf883b3 c55c58c2        vaddps  ymm8,ymm4,ymm2\r\n; (reim + reim) + cim\r\n00007ffa`edf883b7 c4c13458e1      vaddps  ymm4,ymm9,ymm9\r\n00007ffa`edf883bc c55c58cb        vaddps  ymm9,ymm4,ymm3\r\n00007ffa`edf883c0 c4c12c58e2      vaddps  ymm4,ymm10,ymm10\r\n00007ffa`edf883c5 c5fd10ac24a0010000 vmovupd ymm5,ymmword ptr [rsp+1A0h]\r\n00007ffa`edf883ce c55c58d5        vaddps  ymm10,ymm4,ymm5\r\n00007ffa`edf883d2 c4c12458e3      vaddps  ymm4,ymm11,ymm11\r\n00007ffa`edf883d7 c57d10a42480010000 vmovupd ymm12,ymmword ptr [rsp+180h]\r\n00007ffa`edf883e0 c4415c58dc      vaddps  ymm11,ymm4,ymm12\r\n; Loop\r\n00007ffa`edf883e5 ffc2            inc     edx\r\n00007ffa`edf883e7 81fa80969800    cmp     edx,989680h\r\n; What is this\r\n00007ffa`edf883ed c5fd11ac24a0010000 vmovupd ymmword ptr [rsp+1A0h],ymm5\r\n00007ffa`edf883f6 c57d11a42480010000 vmovupd ymmword ptr [rsp+180h],ymm12\r\n00007ffa`edf883ff 0f8c6effffff    jl      00007ffa`edf88373\r\n```\r\n\r\nFor F# the disassembly looks even worse. \r\n\r\nPerhaps there are some obvious flags I don't know of that I should have set on my struct types to enable the jitter to eliminate the intermediate results.

This discussion is about possible solutions for this scenario in .Net Core 3.\r\n \r\n## Customer requirements\r\n \r\nThe developer wants to:\r\n* Implement a suite of several libraries, that are used by several client apps.\r\n* Deploy one copy of library-suite on client machines in a central location\r\n* Push updates to the library-suite without having to recompile the client apps\r\n* Is happy to change their library-suite/apps to target .net core 3\r\n \r\nIn particular, the customer specifically asked allowing third party frameworks (similar to standard frameworks like `Microsoft.AspNetCore.App`).\r\n\r\n## Solution Options\r\n \r\n### Additional-deps\r\nThis is a simple solution to separate some of the app’s dependencies to a separate (possible shared) location. This option involves:\r\n* App development: Remove references to the library-suite from the apps, instead use a different light-up option such as startup-hook.\r\n* On client machines: Deploy the library-suite to a shared location, and set up `DOTNET_ADDITIONAL_DEPS` when apps are run.\r\n\r\nAdditional-deps have several known limitations, for example, as noted here.\r\n \r\n### Startup Hook\r\nThis option involves dynamically loading the library-suite into apps during application startup. \r\n* This requires setting `DOTNET_STARTUP_HOOKS` to appropriate loader code on client machines at app-startup. The loader code can then use custom logic to load the library-suite from a possible shared/versioned location.\r\n* This may require some coordination with other parties (ex: profiler) that may use the startup-hook (multiple assemblies can be hooked up at startup).\r\n\r\n### Custom AppHost\r\nThe library developer provides a custom host to be used by the app-developers. The custom host will then setup the appropriate library dependencies during app startup, before starting the runtime.\r\n \r\n### Components\r\nThis option is to load the library-suite as a plugin, where:\r\n* The library-suite exposes a minimal version (similar to reference assemblies) which only exposes the public API, and implements stub code to load the implementation assemblies dynamically.\r\n* Apps build with a package-reference to the suite.\r\nAt runtime, the above stub code loads the actual library code (say, using the AssemblyDependencyResolver), from a possibly shared location.\r\n \r\n### Third-party frameworks\r\nIn this option, the library-suite is published as a framework. This naturally achieves the customer requirements because:\r\n* The library-suite is published as a nuget package that contains:\r\n    * Its reference assemblies\r\n    * A target file that can be imported by the apps to include this suite as an additional target framework\r\n* Apps import/reference the above nuget package and ship independent of the library-suite’s implementation\r\n* The implementation assemblies of the library-suite are installed to `dotnet/shared/<library-suite>/<version>` on client machines. (one-copy shared, versioned location).\r\n \r\nThe above approach is straight-forward for developers to use. However, support for third-party frameworks is not yet officially available. \r\n\r\nI tried out a prototype, and was able to load a custom framework from a shared location (with some work-arounds for issues discussed below).\r\n \r\n### Pending work\r\nHere’s the known required work, there will likely be more as we productize this feature:\r\n* Tooling for adding frameworks: It should easy to add a framework to the list of dependent frameworks published in the `runtimeconfig.json` file (ex: add a framework to `RuntimeFramework` item). However, currently doesn’t work in the CLI because the property is overwritten by one of the build tasks. This should be a straightforward issue to fix.\r\n* Mismatched shared framework versions can cause problems: dotnet/core-setup#4947. This is again a bug that should be fixed.\r\n \r\n### Reservations\r\nWhile we agree that supporting third-party frameworks is useful for developers, there are some reservations about making this feature publicly available in .Net Core 3. The concerns are:\r\n* Bugs: We have a controlled environment with known frameworks. Custom frameworks may trigger unforeseen bugs. It is better to let the multiple-frameworks feature bake with existing framework for a release cycle.\r\n* Framework references: There are unresolved issues with supporting custom framework-references (which are not exposed by using third-party frameworks with package-references).\r\n* Install location:  Unanticipated issues with custom code within `dotnet` install location (`dotnet/shared/…`).\r\n* Design limitation: We have previously excluded custom frameworks from .net core 3. We may redesign the issue in .net core 3.1. But exposing the feature now may create a compatibility requirement, and restrict design options. Note that users may themselves figure out and use custom frameworks – but these are not supported by the `dotnet` org.\r\n \r\n## Discussion\r\n \r\nPlease add your thoughts / considerations about:\r\n* Exposing the possibility of third-party frameworks to customers, say as a sample.\r\n* Any other options to solve the customer scenario.\r\n* Similar usage scenarios\r\n","Url":"https://github.com/dotnet/cli/issues/10986","RelatedDescription":"Open issue \"Supporting third party libraries/frameworks \" (#10986)"},{"Id":"421727930","IsPullRequest":false,"CreatedAt":"2019-03-15T22:34:42","Actor":"MichaelSimons","Number":"10985","RawContent":null,"Title":"'Exec format error' when running global tool on ARM32","State":"open","Body":"Installing a global tool on ARM32 doesn't run.

According to documentation - \"Portable\" debugging information ensures that a \"pdb\" file is created. It says **nothing** about the fact that the DLL itself will contain an information about where the DLL was compiled at. Therefore, when this information is inside DLL - you are able to step into the source, given that location and checksum not changed.\r\n\r\nHere is the documentation I was referencing to:\r\nhttps://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/visualstudio/ide/reference/advanced-build-settings-dialog-box-csharp?view=vs-2017\r\n\r\n> * none\r\n> \r\n> Specifies that no debugging information will be generated.\r\n> \r\n> * portable\r\n> \r\n> Produces a .PDB file, a non-platform-specific, portable symbol file that provides other tools, especially debuggers, information about what is in the main executable file and how it was produced.

Open the solution in VisualStudio\r\n2. Build project \"DllWithPortableDebuggingInformation\"\r\n**Note 1**: see the post-build events. The script will copy the DLL into a console app project.\r\n**Note 2**: script will also delete PDB so there is no information anywhere about the source..\r\n**Note 3**: see the project settings. Debugging information set to \"Portable\".\r\n3. For console application, right click on project, \"Add -> Reference\". Browse for DLL that was copied into the root folder of console app project, add a reference to it!\r\nPath: \"\\Bugs\\13032019_DllIncludesPdbInformation\\DllIncludesPdbInformation\\DllWithPortableDebuggingInformation.dll\"\r\n4. Go to \"Program.cs\" of console application and un-comment the line which is marked with a comment. \r\n5. Put a debug point onto the same line that you have uncommented.\r\n6. Start console app in debug mode. On break - step into the code of external library.\r\n\r\n**Expected result:**\r\nStepping into the code is skipped because DLL has no information about source code location.\r\n\r\n**Actual result:**\r\nStepping into the code works, despite the fact that PDB file does not even exists.\r\n\r\n\r\n## Proposed solution\r\n\r\nWe either need information about this behavior to be properly documented, or, if it's a bug, then it needs to be fixed.\r\n\r\n## Additional questions\r\n\r\nPlease take a minute to answer following questions:\r\n\r\n1. How to tell, if PDB information is embedded into an DLL? For example, can I use \"JetBrains dotPeek\" to inspect DLL and see what kind of information it contains about the source? I couldn't find any tutorials on how to do it and how/where this information is stored in DLL. Any hints or links are appreciated.\r\n\r\n2. Is it possible to override the \"default source location\" for the loaded DLLs? For example, if an assembly was compiled at \"C:/myCompiledLibs\", but afterwards I moved the source to \"D:/newLocation\" - how do I make it so, that the Visual Studio would look into this new directory for sources, instead of using this info that is embedded into DLL/PDB?\r\n\r\nAny answers are much appreciated.\n\n","Url":"https://github.com/dotnet/cli/issues/10982","RelatedDescription":"Open issue \"Assembly built with \"Portable\" debugging information - contains source information\" (#10982)"},{"Id":"421593590","IsPullRequest":false,"CreatedAt":"2019-03-15T16:06:51","Actor":"qmfrederik","Number":"10981","RawContent":null,"Title":"Build hangs on low-memory device with many CPU cores","State":"open","Body":"## Steps to reproduce\r\n\r\nI'm compiling a .NET Core solution (~40 projects) on a Raspberry Pi.

These APIs provide support for writing more efficient algorithms that can take advantage of hardware specific functionality.\r\n\r\nWhile the number of APIs exposed may seem daunting, the APIs are hardware specific and were designed such that you must perform the appropriate checks before attempting to use a given API or they will result in a `PlatformNotSupportedException` at runtime. For example, `System.Runtime.Intrinsics.X86.Sse` is a class that exposes the SSE ISA for the x86 and x64 architectures. Before using any of the methods on that class, you must emit an `if (Sse.IsSupported)` check to validate that both the current hardware and the current runtime support this ISA.\r\n\r\nThese API declarations are also part of the existing shared framework code and have a default implementation of returning `false` for the `IsSupported` checks and throwing `PlatformNotSupportedException` from any of the other exposed hardware-specific APIs. This has allowed us to already take a cross-runtime dependency on these intrinsics in places like `SpanHelpers`, `Decimal`, `BitOperations`, `BitArray`, and more.\r\n\r\nGiven the above, I propose that these APIs be included as part of `netstandard2.1` as it will allow general library and application developers to share in the same benefits we have already seen. That is, it will light-up on .NET Core 3.0 and will do nothing on other runtimes. This will avoid the need for them to cross-compile their code in a number of cases.\r\n\r\nFor the runtimes that don't support this functionality yet, they should require somewhere between no and minimal changes. For the most part, they should already be internally compiling these APIs and hitting the `IsSupported=false` paths. So they will ultimately just be exposing these APIs to the end-user and would require no changes. The work that may be required is to ensure that the `Vector64<T>`, `Vector128<T>`, and `Vector256<T>` types have the appropriate ABI dependent type layouts. That is, these types should have the appropriate packing (e.g. `16` for `Vector128<T>` on x86/x64 since it maps to the `__m128` ABI primitive defined by the Windows and System V calling convention specifications).\r\n\r\nExposing this will also allow the various runtimes to have incremental \"light-up\" of these APIs. That is, rather than waiting for the next release to both expose and implement the APIs, they can expose the the APIs as part of `netstandard2.1` and the corresponding version of their runtime (e.g `x.0`). They can then light up individual ISAs and make them available to their users as they see fit (e.g. They could enable just `SSE` in `x.1` and could enable SSE2/SSE3 in `x.2`, etc).\r\n\r\n","Url":"https://github.com/dotnet/standard/issues/1094","RelatedDescription":"Open issue \"Consider the HWIntrinsic APIs for NS2.1\" (#1094)"},{"Id":"416499863","IsPullRequest":false,"CreatedAt":"2019-03-03T18:13:53","Actor":"proof85","Number":"1093","RawContent":null,"Title":"HashCode to standard","State":"closed","Body":"Hi,\r\n\r\nis it possible to add the HashCode-\"Helper\" struct to the .net standard?

It is specific to Windows only and uses HttpListener as the server for the WebSocket. I was able to reproduce the problem on .NET Framework as well.\r\n\r\nThe problem was due to the logic in WebSocketHttpListenerDuplexStream where it was always creating a TaskCompletionSource and doing a TrySetException even if the error occured on a synchronous codepath. The ReadAsyncFast (and WriteAsyncFast) methods are always calling a callback to finish the operation and thus always setting an exception into the task. But the task was never awaited because the exception was also rethrown from the ReadAsyncFast method and skips the await.\r\n\r\nThe fix is to change the logic slightly so that ReadAsyncFast won't rethrow the exception. It doesn't need to since the exception is already stored in the task. So, awaiting that task will be fast since it is already completed (faulted with the exception).\r\n\r\nIn addition to the CI tests, I also verified the fix with the original repro from the issue.\r\n\r\nFixes #29005","Url":"https://github.com/dotnet/corefx/pull/36110","RelatedDescription":"Closed or merged PR \"Fix WebSocketHttpListenerDuplexStream error handling\" (#36110)"},{"Id":"421955679","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2019-03-17T22:43:22","Actor":"Potapy4","Number":"36107","RawContent":null,"Title":"Fix typo","State":"closed","Body":"According to the [glossary](https://github.com/dotnet/docs/blob/master/docs/standard/glossary.md#net) - rename from `.Net` to `.NET`","Url":"https://github.com/dotnet/corefx/pull/36107","RelatedDescription":"Closed or merged PR \"Fix typo\" (#36107)"},{"Id":"421980149","IsPullRequest":false,"CreatedAt":"2019-03-17T22:14:55","Actor":"wli3","Number":"36109","RawContent":null,"Title":"text.json, how to surface meaningful GetString() exception?","State":"open","Body":"The current \"there is a type mismatch exception\" is like the following without extra effort .

This PR introduces a new class called `ExecuteAsyncHelper` which allows lazy creation and caching of those delegates for each connection object. This is of benefit when using the same command object to call `ExecuteNonQueryAsync` multiple times but has a very minor (a single wrapping object) degradation on single call per command, in practice I expect this additional memory to get lost in the noise and I think I've made enough improvements in other PR's to have a little space to work with.\r\n\r\nContinuing the theme of reducing repeated delegate creation I have added some a cached delegate and context objects to `SqlReferenceCollection` which is used when validating that the connection is in a state allowing execution, this will affect all kinds of query, the general pattern used is one I've found elsewhere in the corefx codebase:\r\n\r\n```csharp\r\n    FindLiveReaderContext context = Interlocked.Exchange(ref cachedFindLiveReaderContext, null) ?? new FindLiveReaderContext();\r\n    context.Setup(command);\r\n    SqlDataReader retval = FindItem(DataReaderTag, context.Func);\r\n    context.Clear();\r\n    Interlocked.CompareExchange(ref cachedFindLiveReaderContext, context, null);\r\n```\r\nusing interlocked to try and re-use a single item per collection if possible and falling back to the previous allocating behaviour in the case where it isn't available. This should allow low contention scenarios to be low allocation and ramp up to meet high contention needs without bottlenecking.\r\n\r\nThe performance improvements are modest:\r\n\r\n|       Method |     Mean |    Error |   StdDev | Gen 0/1k Op | Gen 1/1k Op | Gen 2/1k Op | Allocated Memory/Op |\r\n|------------- |---------:|---------:|---------:|------------:|------------:|------------:|--------------------:|\r\n| AsyncFloat32 master | 212.9 ms | 1.896 ms | 1.681 ms |           - |           - |           - |             1.95 KB |\r\n| AsyncFloat32 branch | 212.0 ms | 1.479 ms | 1.235 ms |           - |           - |           - |             1.47 KB |\r\n\r\nThis is mostly because the dominating allocations are unavoidable task machinery or waiting another PR [SqlParameter cleanup](https://github.com/dotnet/corefx/pull/34049).\r\n![asyncnonquery-dottrace](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/13322696/54497017-940f7200-48ed-11e9-8594-84e2654f4b00.PNG).\r\n\r\nAll the usual functional and manual tests pass. \r\n/cc @AfsanehR @tarikulsabbir, @Gary-Zh , @david-engel\r\n","Url":"https://github.com/dotnet/corefx/pull/36108","RelatedDescription":"Open PR \"SqlClient reduce memory use for repeated ExecuteNonQueryAsync\" (#36108)"},{"Id":"421934544","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2019-03-17T15:10:26","Actor":"stephentoub","Number":"36106","RawContent":null,"Title":"Unlock SslStream for writes after failed write","State":"open","Body":"If we try to write to the underlying stream and that throws synchronously, we neglect to \"unlock\" the stream for writes, and all future attempts to write will throw an exception saying that the stream is being used for a concurrent write.

It contains the following changes: \r\n\r\n1. Renames `GetOpenDocumentInCurrentContextWithChanges` To `GetDocument`.  GetOpenDocumentInCurrentContextWithChanges was a late addition when we added shared-projects, so we didn't get a good chance to name it properly, but is the method we use all the time.  It's name is full of unnecessary info.  First, 'open' and 'current context' are somewhat pointless.  The starting point is a VS file buffer.  So it's clearly teh Document corresponding to that.  Furthermore, 'WithChanges' is an affection from when it was possible to get a Document that might not be in sync with the snapshot you started with.  This is not a common case, and the immutable nature of VS and Roslyn makes it clear that you want the immutable doc associated with the immutable snap.\r\n\r\n2. Rename `GetFullyLoadedOpenDocumentInCurrentContextWithChangesAsync` to `GetFullyLoadedDocument`.  Same reason as above to not have 'open' 'currentcontext' or 'withchanges'.  \r\n\r\n3. Made GetFullyLoadedDocument non-async.  All callers are synchronous (by def) since they're blocking some editor operation (with a dialog) for this load to finish.  So the blocking was pushed inward to make all callers simpler.\r\n\r\n4. Made GetFullyLoadedDocument operate on a text buffer.  This simplifies things for all callers, and makes more sense from an API perspective as \"FullyLoaded\" implies mutation will be happening, and that would not affect the results associated with an ITextSnapshot, but would affect an ITextBuffer.\r\n\r\n5. Allows one to front-load quick brail-out checks before blocking on waiting for the solution to load.  no point fully loading the project only to immediately bail out a moment later.","Url":"https://github.com/dotnet/roslyn/pull/34204","RelatedDescription":"Open PR \"Cleanup and improvements around getting and waiting for documents.\" (#34204)"},{"Id":"421875216","IsPullRequest":false,"CreatedAt":"2019-03-17T13:59:30","Actor":"terrajobst","Number":"34203","RawContent":null,"Title":".editorconfig should have setting to not indent case blocks","State":"closed","Body":"**Version Used**: 15.9.9\r\n\r\n**Steps to Reproduce**:\r\n\r\nFormat this `switch` statement:\r\n\r\n```C#\r\nswitch (value)\r\n{\r\n    case CaseLabel1:\r\n        return 42;\r\n\r\n    case CaseLabel2:\r\n    {\r\n        var x = ComputeValue();\r\n        return x;\r\n    }\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\n**Expected Behavior**:\r\n\r\nHave the option in `.editorconfig` to indent case contents, but not case blocks.\r\n\r\n**Actual Behavior**:\r\n\r\nI can either not indent case contents, in which case it will look like this:\r\n\r\n```C#\r\nswitch (value)\r\n{\r\n    case CaseLabel1:\r\n    return 42;\r\n\r\n    case CaseLabel2:\r\n    {\r\n        var x = ComputeValue();\r\n        return x;\r\n    }\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nor I can choose to indent case contents in which case it will also indent blocks:\r\n\r\n```C#\r\nswitch (value)\r\n{\r\n    case CaseLabel1:\r\n        return 42;\r\n\r\n    case CaseLabel2:\r\n        {\r\n            var x = ComputeValue();\r\n            return x;\r\n        }\r\n}\r\n```","Url":"https://github.com/dotnet/roslyn/issues/34203","RelatedDescription":"Closed issue \".editorconfig should have setting to not indent case blocks\" (#34203)"},{"Id":"421833478","IsPullRequest":false,"CreatedAt":"2019-03-17T04:22:57","Actor":"CreateAndInject","Number":"34196","RawContent":null,"Title":"PE TimeDataStamp is wrong in VS2017.","State":"closed","Body":"PE TimeDataStamp is seconds passed from 1970-1-1 in old visual studio:\r\n`var dateTime = new DateTime(1970, 1, 1, 0, 0, 0).AddSeconds(TimeDataStamp)`\r\n\r\nFor example, build any application in VS2015, TimeDataStamp = 5C8D3366 (2019/3/16 17:33:26)\r\n\r\nBut build it in VS2017, TimeDataStamp = AC884742 (2061/9/22 10:58:10)\r\n\r\nIs it a bug?\r\n","Url":"https://github.com/dotnet/roslyn/issues/34196","RelatedDescription":"Closed issue \"PE TimeDataStamp is wrong in VS2017.\" (#34196)"},{"Id":"421873924","IsPullRequest":false,"CreatedAt":"2019-03-17T02:20:48","Actor":"sharwell","Number":"34202","RawContent":null,"Title":"Consider removing GCManager","State":"open","Body":"Originally noted by @heejaechang in https://github.com/dotnet/roslyn/pull/34055#issuecomment-473607996.\r\n\r\n> do we still need this low latency mode? can we just remove whole GCManager stuff.

These all simply pass it to `LockFileExtensions.CreateProjectContext`.  In that method, it's used as part of the check to determine if the app is framework dependent:\r\n    ```C#\r\n    bool isFrameworkDependent = (platformLibrary != null || runtimeFrameworks?.Any() == true) &&\r\n        (!isSelfContained || string.IsNullOrEmpty(lockFileTarget.RuntimeIdentifier));\r\n    ```\r\n    Note that for .NET Core 3.0 and higher, the `ResolveFrameworkReferences` should add `RuntimeFramework` items, so the `isFrameworkDependent` calculation should still work.\r\n- In the created `ProjectContext`, the `GetRuntimeLibraries` method excludes assets from the platform library for framework dependent apps.\r\n- The `GenerateRuntimeConfigurationFiles` task also uses the platform library from the `ProjectContext` in order to write the runtimeconfig file, but only if there aren't any `RuntimeFrameworks`.\r\n- The `ResolvePackageAssets` task excludes assets from the platform library in `GetPlatformPackageExclusions`.  (It also excludes assets from libraries matching names of `RuntimeFrameworks`, which I believe we should now remove, as those assets will come from runtime packs and won't be in the assets file anyway now).\r\n- The `_RestoreCrossgen` and `PrepforRestoreForComposeStore` use the platform library name.  These are both part of support for `dotnet store`, which we are [considering dropping](https://github.com/dotnet/sdk/issues/2914), and which will need a lot of work in any case if we want it to work when targeting .NET Core 3","Url":"https://github.com/dotnet/sdk/pull/3019","RelatedDescription":"Closed or merged PR \"Don't set \"platform library\" for .NET Core 3.0 and higher\" (#3019)"},{"Id":"416793797","IsPullRequest":false,"CreatedAt":"2019-03-12T23:01:18","Actor":"SomeAnon42","Number":"3004","RawContent":null,"Title":"ResolvePackageAssets fails when targeting Core 3.0","State":"closed","Body":"```\r\nError\tMSB4018\tThe \"ResolvePackageAssets\" task failed unexpectedly.\r\nSystem.Collections.Generic.KeyNotFoundException: The given key was not present in the dictionary.\r\n   at System.Collections.Generic.Dictionary`2.get_Item(TKey key)\r\n   at Microsoft.NET.Build.Tasks.LockFileExtensions.CollectDependencies(IDictionary`2 libraryLookup, IEnumerable`1 dependencies, HashSet`1 exclusionList) in /_/src/Tasks/Microsoft.NET.Build.Tasks/LockFileExtensions.cs:line 193\r\n   at Microsoft.NET.Build.Tasks.LockFileExtensions.CollectDependencies(IDictionary`2 libraryLookup, IEnumerable`1 dependencies, HashSet`1 exclusionList) in /_/src/Tasks/Microsoft.NET.Build.Tasks/LockFileExtensions.cs:line 180\r\n   at Microsoft.NET.Build.Tasks.LockFileExtensions.GetPlatformExclusionList(LockFileTarget lockFileTarget, LockFileTargetLibrary platformLibrary, IDictionary`2 libraryLookup) in /_/src/Tasks/Microsoft.NET.Build.Tasks/LockFileExtensions.cs:line 153\r\n   at Microsoft.NET.Build.Tasks.ResolvePackageAssets.CacheWriter.GetPlatformPackageExclusions() in /_/src/Tasks/Microsoft.NET.Build.Tasks/ResolvePackageAssets.cs:line 1191\r\n   at Microsoft.NET.Build.Tasks.ResolvePackageAssets.CacheWriter..ctor(ResolvePackageAssets task, Stream stream) in /_/src/Tasks/Microsoft.NET.Build.Tasks/ResolvePackageAssets.cs:line 610\r\n   at Microsoft.NET.Build.Tasks.ResolvePackageAssets.CacheReader.CreateReaderFromDisk(ResolvePackageAssets task, Byte[] settingsHash) in /_/src/Tasks/Microsoft.NET.Build.Tasks/ResolvePackageAssets.cs:line 483\r\n   at Microsoft.NET.Build.Tasks.ResolvePackageAssets.CacheReader..ctor(ResolvePackageAssets task) in /_/src/Tasks/Microsoft.NET.Build.Tasks/ResolvePackageAssets.cs:line 434\r\n   at Microsoft.NET.Build.Tasks.ResolvePackageAssets.ReadItemGroups() in /_/src/Tasks/Microsoft.NET.Build.Tasks/ResolvePackageAssets.cs:line 279\r\n   at Microsoft.NET.Build.Tasks.ResolvePackageAssets.ExecuteCore() in /_/src/Tasks/Microsoft.NET.Build.Tasks/ResolvePackageAssets.cs:line 271\r\n   at Microsoft.NET.Build.Tasks.TaskBase.Execute() in /_/src/Tasks/Common/TaskBase.cs:line 35\r\n   at Microsoft.Build.BackEnd.TaskExecutionHost.Microsoft.Build.BackEnd.ITaskExecutionHost.Execute()\r\n   at Microsoft.Build.BackEnd.TaskBuilder.<ExecuteInstantiatedTask>d__26.MoveNext()\tNitroSharpDbg\tC:\\Program Files\\dotnet\\sdk\\3.0.100-preview4-010582\\Sdks\\Microsoft.NET.Sdk\\targets\\Microsoft.PackageDependencyResolution.targets\t228\t\r\n```\r\n\r\nSteps to reproduce:\r\n1.

Very weird - depends on order of and some hacky `Import` declarations, but it breaks `xunit` runner and VS Code. Ssee lines with `Microsoft.NET.Sdk`:\r\n```xml\r\n<Project>\r\n  <PropertyGroup>\r\n    <TargetFramework>netstandard2.0</TargetFramework>\r\n    <LangVersion>latest</LangVersion>\r\n  </PropertyGroup>\r\n  <PropertyGroup Condition=\"'$(Configuration)|$(Platform)'=='Debug|AnyCPU'\">\r\n    <OutputPath>.bin\\Debug\\</OutputPath>\r\n    <BaseIntermediateOutputPath>.obj\\Debug\\</BaseIntermediateOutputPath>\r\n    <IntermediateOutputPath>.obj\\Debug\\</IntermediateOutputPath>\r\n  </PropertyGroup>\r\n  <PropertyGroup Condition=\"'$(Configuration)|$(Platform)'=='Release|AnyCPU'\">\r\n    <OutputPath>.bin\\Release\\</OutputPath>\r\n    <BaseIntermediateOutputPath>.obj\\Release\\</BaseIntermediateOutputPath>\r\n    <IntermediateOutputPath>.obj\\Release\\</IntermediateOutputPath>\r\n  </PropertyGroup>\r\n  <Import Project=\"Sdk.props\" Sdk=\"Microsoft.NET.Sdk\" />\r\n  <ItemGroup>\r\n    <None Remove=\".gitignore\" />\r\n\r\n    <None Remove=\"**/*.meta\" />\r\n  </ItemGroup>\r\n\r\n  <ItemGroup>\r\n    <PackageReference Include=\"System.Buffers\" Version=\"4.5.0\" />\r\n    <PackageReference Include=\"System.IO.Pipelines\" Version=\"4.5.3\" />\r\n    <PackageReference Include=\"System.Memory\" Version=\"4.5.1\" />\r\n    <PackageReference Include=\"System.Runtime.CompilerServices.Unsafe\" Version=\"4.5.2\" />\r\n  </ItemGroup>\r\n\r\n  <Import Project=\"Sdk.targets\" Sdk=\"Microsoft.NET.Sdk\" />\r\n</Project>\r\n```\r\nDoes next relates dotnet/project-system#1438? \r\n\r\nI was not able to find solution on SO. \r\n\r\nShould I create separate issue with that with steps:\r\n1.

There are two primary reasons for this change:\r\n\r\n* Syndicate Microsoft-provided container images to multiple registries, like Docker Hub and Red Hat.\r\n* Use Microsoft Azure as a global CDN for delivering Microsoft-provided container images.\r\n\r\nYou will use and see MCR as a storage back-end for Microsoft images. The primary way you learn about Microsoft container images and tags will be through a registry, which for most users will continue to be Docker Hub. Most of the experience you've had browsing for .NET Core container images will continue unchanged with this new model. The Docker Hub URLs you've used for Microsoft repos will continue to work, and forward to updated locations on Docker Hub. Existing Docker Hub will images will be maintained as-is.\r\n\r\nSee [.NET Core Container Images now Published to Microsoft Container Registry](https://devblogs.microsoft.com/dotnet/net-core-container-images-now-published-to-microsoft-container-registry/) for the most updated information on our use of MCR.\r\n\r\n## Discussion\r\nPlease share your thoughts on this change and see what others are saying at:\r\n\r\n* [dotnet-docker #935](https://github.com/dotnet/dotnet-docker/issues/935)\r\n\r\n## Starting with .NET Core nightly repo\r\n\r\nOn the .NET team, we started our [transition to MCR](https://github.com/dotnet/dotnet-docker/issues/745) with the .NET Core \"nightly\" repo. [dotnet-nightly](dockerhub.com/r/microsoft/dotnet-nightly) is now hosted on MCR and syndicated to Docker Hub. We started with the nightly repo in order to discover and fix any challenges we found with this new model before we move our higher-traffic primary container repository.\r\n\r\nWe will start publishing [dotnet](dockerhub.com/r/microsoft/dotnet) to MCR a bit later, in either February or March. This issue will be updated when that happens.\r\n\r\n## Repo Split\r\n\r\nThe [.NET Core repo](https://hub.docker.com/r/microsoft/dotnet) currently includes 4 major categories of tags: \r\n\r\n* `sdk`\r\n* `aspnetcore-runtime`\r\n* `runtime` \r\n* `runtime-deps`\r\n\r\nProviding all of the tags in one place has helped with discoverability but made for a repo with an enormous README that can be challenging to navigate and consume. It is large enough that we exceeded Docker Hub README limits and had to artificially make it smaller.\r\n\r\nGoing forward, we will provide a repo for each of the tag categories listed above. We'll also provide a \"product repo\" that will hierarchicaly group all of our repos together. This will satisfy discoverability needs so that it will be easy to find the tags you want.\r\n\r\nYou can already see this experience with [microsoft-dotnet-core-nightly](https://hub.docker.com/_/microsoft-dotnet-core-nightly). There are now multiple repos for our nightly builds:\r\n\r\n* [.NET Core Nightly product repo](https://hub.docker.com/_/microsoft-dotnet-core-nightly)\r\n* [.NET Core SDK Nightly repo](https://hub.docker.com/_/microsoft-dotnet-core-nightly-sdk/)\r\n* [.NET Core ASP.NET Core Nightly repo](https://hub.docker.com/_/microsoft-dotnet-core-nightly-aspnet/)\r\n* [.NET Core Runtime Nightly repo](https://hub.docker.com/_/microsoft-dotnet-core-nightly-runtime/)\r\n* [.NET Core Runtime-deps Nightly repo](https://hub.docker.com/_/microsoft-dotnet-core-nightly-runtime-deps/)\r\n\r\nThe same split will exist for the non-nightly stable repo (currently hosted at  [microsoft/dotnet](https://hub.docker.com/r/microsoft/dotnet)) when we start publishing it to MCR and syndicating it back to DockerHub.\r\n\r\n## Changes to registry URL\r\n\r\nThe biggest change is that your Dockerfiles need to be updated to point to the MCR registry in order get access to new .NET Core container tags. The same change is required for scripts or human operations that pull images via `docker pull`.\r\n\r\nThe following example shows the registry path, repo and tag for the .NET Core 2.2 \"Nightly\" SDK on MCR:\r\n\r\n```console\r\nmcr.microsoft.com/dotnet/core-nightly/sdk:2.2\r\n```\r\n\r\nAs comparison, the following repo and tag have been used to date for the .NET Core 2.2 \"Nightly\" SDK on Docker Hub:\r\n\r\n```console\r\nmicrosoft/dotnet-nightly:2.2-sdk\r\n```\r\n\r\nThe new repo URL is provided at each of the news repos. For example, the new .NET Core SDK \"nightly\" repo provides a box on the right where you can copy and paste the correct MCR-based repo syntax that you can use for `docker pull` or in `FROM` statements in your Dockerfiles.\r\n\r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/2608468/52811702-95c5eb80-304a-11e9-8de8-e6ea1f4b4d75.png)\r\n\r\n## Servicing existing Docker Hub tags\r\n\r\nWe will continue to service existing non-version-specific or floating tags on Docker Hub while the associated .NET Core version is supported. For example the `microsoft/dotnet:2.1-sdk` tag is a floating tag that will continue to be serviced for the lifetime of .NET Core 2.1. You can continue using floating tags without issue.\r\n\r\nIf you use non-floating tags, like `microsoft/dotnet:2.1.504-sdk-alpine`, then you will need to update your Dockerfile to use a new non-floating tag. No new non-floating tags will be published to `microsoft/dotnet` and `microsoft/dotnet-nightly` after we fully transition to MCR.\r\n\r\n.NET Core 3.0 Preview 3 and later will only be made available on MCR.\r\n\r\n## Microsoft is a Verified Publisher\r\n\r\nUntil now, Microsoft-provided container images were considered \"community images\". As part of this change, we are re-classifying Microsoft as a \"verified publisher\" on Docker Hub. This designation should make it clearer that .NET and other Microsoft-provided images are coming from a verified source. There clearly was that expectation previously, but Docker is now making that clearer in the Docker Hub pages they host for Microsoft.\r\n\r\nWe will provide official vulnerability scanning Microsoft-provided images as a second phase of this transition.","Url":"https://github.com/dotnet/announcements/issues/101","RelatedDescription":"Open issue \"Publishing .NET Core images to Microsoft Container Registry (MCR)\" (#101)"},{"Id":"410784442","IsPullRequest":false,"CreatedAt":"2019-02-15T14:06:29","Actor":"TaraOverfield","Number":"100","RawContent":null,"Title":"RESOLVED: Advisory on February 2019 Security update for Windows 10 update 1809","State":"open","Body":"<strong><em>Final Update 2/19/19 @1:30 PM (PST)</em></strong><em>: This </em><em>advisory is now resolved with no action needed from Microsoft Customers.

Congratulations, Alpine team! On the .NET team, we are committed to supporting new Alpine versions quickly, and also need to define a policy for older versions. This policy only applies for the container images that we publish.\r\n\r\n## Discussion\r\nPlease share your thoughts on this change and see what others are saying at:\r\n\r\n* [dotnet-docker #933](https://github.com/dotnet/dotnet-docker/issues/933)\r\n\r\n## Policy\r\n\r\nWe intend to establish the following policy for supporting Alpine with .NET Core container images:\r\n\r\n* Support new Alpine versions within 60 days of release (hopefully much less).\r\n* Support n-1 Alpine versions for 3 months after we support a new Alpine version.\r\n\r\nNote: The [.NET Core support policy](https://github.com/dotnet/core/blob/master/os-lifecycle-policy.md) may be broader. This policy is specific to the container images we produce.\r\n\r\n## Plans\r\n\r\nWe're in the process of [fixing issues required to support Alpine 3.9](https://github.com/dotnet/dotnet-docker/issues/921). We expect that these issues will be resolved in February and that we'll be able to provide support for Alpine 3.9 in March.\r\n\r\nWe will produce Alpine 3.9 images for .NET Core 2.1, 2.2 and 3.0. Assuming we publish 3.9 images in March, we'll stop producing and supporting Alpine 3.7 and 3.8 images after June (2019).\r\n\r\n## Using Alpine-based .NET Core images\r\n\r\nWe produce a variety of Alpine-based images. You can either depend on a specific Alpine version, like with `microsoft/dotnet:2.2-sdk-alpine3.8` or opt to use the latest Alpine image we have to offer, like with `microsoft/dotnet:2.2-sdk-alpine`. Either are good choices. It is just a question of whether you want to make a conscious decision to move to later Alpine releases.\r\n\r\n## Support for ARM32?\r\n\r\nWe produce Alpine images for x64 (and ARM64, shortly). The [Alpine 3.9 announcement](https://twitter.com/alpinelinux/status/1090416212822110214) made mention of support for ARM32v7. We would like to enable .NET Core [Alpine-based images on ARM32](https://github.com/gliderlabs/docker-alpine/issues/463#issuecomment-460530395). We are patiently waiting for that to happen.

To check the currently installed runtimes, open a command prompt and run the `dotnet --info` command. If you have a 2.1 or greater runtime installed, you'll see output like the following;\r\n\r\n```text\r\n.NET Core SDK (reflecting any global.json):\r\n Version:   2.2.100\r\n Commit:    b9f2fa0ca8\r\n\r\nRuntime Environment:\r\n OS Name:     Windows\r\n OS Version:  10.0.17134\r\n OS Platform: Windows\r\n RID:         win10-x64\r\n Base Path:   C:\\Program Files\\dotnet\\sdk\\2.2.100\\\r\n\r\nHost (useful for support):\r\n  Version: 2.2.0\r\n  Commit:  1249f08fed\r\n\r\n.NET Core SDKs installed:\r\n  2.1.5 [C:\\Program Files\\dotnet\\sdk]\r\n  2.1.502 [C:\\Program Files\\dotnet\\sdk]\r\n  2.2.100 [C:\\Program Files\\dotnet\\sdk]\r\n\r\n.NET Core runtimes installed:\r\n  Microsoft.AspNetCore.All 2.1.6 [C:\\Program Files\\dotnet\\shared\\Microsoft.AspNetCore.All]\r\n  Microsoft.AspNetCore.App 2.1.6 [C:\\Program Files\\dotnet\\shared\\Microsoft.AspNetCore.App]\r\n  Microsoft.AspNetCore.All 2.2.0 [C:\\Program Files\\dotnet\\shared\\Microsoft.AspNetCore.All]\r\n  Microsoft.AspNetCore.App 2.2.0 [C:\\Program Files\\dotnet\\shared\\Microsoft.AspNetCore.App]\r\n  Microsoft.NETCore.App 2.1.6 [C:\\Program Files\\dotnet\\shared\\Microsoft.NETCore.App]\r\n  Microsoft.NETCore.App 2.2.0 [C:\\Program Files\\dotnet\\shared\\Microsoft.NETCore.App]\r\n\r\nTo install additional .NET Core runtimes or SDKs:\r\n  https://aka.ms/dotnet-download\r\n```\r\n\r\nIf your host version is 2.1.x and the highest `Microsoft.NETCore.App` runtime version is less than 2.1.7, you're vulnerable to this issue.\r\nIf your host version is 2.2.x and the highest 2.1.x `Microsoft.NETCore.App` runtime version is less than 2.2.1, you're vulnerable to this issue.\r\n\r\nYou will not see SDK versions if you have only installed the runtime.\r\n\r\n#### Applications not using Microsoft.NetCore.App\r\n\r\nThe affected assembly is also available separately as a NuGet package. If you are not using Microsoft.NetCore.App, you may still be affected if you are referencing the packages listed above.\r\n\r\n##### Direct dependencies\r\n\r\nDirect dependencies are discoverable by examining your `csproj` file. They can be fixed by [editing the project file](#fixing-direct-dependencies) or using NuGet to update the dependency.\r\n\r\n##### Transitive dependencies\r\n\r\nTransitive dependencies occur when you add a package to your project that in turn relies on another package. For example, if Contoso publishes a package `Contoso.Utility` which, in turn, depends on `Contoso.Internals` and you add the `Contoso.Utility` package to your project now your project has a direct dependency on `Contoso.Utility` and, because `Contoso.Utility` depends 'Contoso.Internals', your application gains a transitive dependency on the `Contoso.Internals` package.\r\n\r\nTransitive dependencies are reviewable in two ways:\r\n\r\n* In the Visual Studio Solution Explorer window, which supports searching.\r\n* By examining the `project.assets.json` file contained in the obj directory of your project for `csproj` based projects\r\n\r\nThe `project.assets.json` files are the authoritative list of all packages used by your project, containing both direct and transitive dependencies.\r\n\r\nThere are two ways to view transitive dependencies. You can either [use Visual Studio’s Solution Explorer](#vs-solution-explorer), or you can review [the `project.assets.json` file](#project-assets-json)).\r\n\r\n##### <a name=\"vs-solution-explorer\"></a>Using Visual Studio Solution Explorer\r\n\r\nTo use Solution Explorer, open the project in Visual Studio, and then press Ctrl+; to activate the search in Solution Explorer. Search for the [vulnerable package](#affected-software) and make a note of the version numbers of any results you find.\r\n\r\nFor example, searching for `Microsoft.AspNetCore.Mvc.Core` in an example project that contains a package that takes a dependency on `Microsoft.AspNetCore.Mvc` shows the following results in Visual Studio 2017:\r\n\r\n![Screenshot of search results in Visual Studio 2017](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/796298/25858816/8ecdc2b4-3491-11e7-9363-746804bb9832.png)\r\n\r\nThe search results appear as a tree. In the previous results, you can see that a reference to `Microsoft.AspNetCore.Mvc.Core` version 1.1.2 is discovered.\r\n\r\nUnder the Dependencies node is a NuGet node. Under the NuGet node is the list of packages you have directly taken a dependency on and their versions.\r\nIn screenshot, the application takes a direct dependency on `Microsoft.AspNetCore.Mvc`. `Microsoft.AspNetCore.Mvc` in turn has leaf nodes that list its dependencies and their versions.\r\nThe `Microsoft.AspNetCore.Mvc` package takes a dependency on a version of `Microsoft.AspNetCore.Mvc.ApiExplorer`, that in turn takes a dependency on a version of `Microsoft.AspNetCore.Mvc.Core`.\r\n\r\n##### <a name=\"project-assets-json\"></a> Manually reviewing project.assets.json\r\n\r\nOpen the *project.assets.json* file from your project’s obj directory in your editor. We suggest you use an editor that understands JSON and allows you to collapse and expand nodes to review this file.\r\nVisual Studio and Visual Studio Code provide JSON friendly editing.\r\n\r\nSearch the *project.assets.json* file for the [vulnerable package](#affected-software), using the format `packagename/` for each of the package names from the preceding table. If you find the assembly name in your search:\r\n\r\n* Examine the line on which they are found, the version number is after the `/`.\r\n* Compare to the [vulnerable versions table](#affected-software).\r\n\r\nFor example, a search result that shows `System.Private.Uri/4.3.0` is a reference to version 4.3.0 of `System.Private.Uri`.\r\n\r\nIf your *project.assets.json* file includes references to the [vulnerable package](#affected-software), then you need to fix the transitive dependencies.\r\n\r\nIf you have not found any reference to any vulnerable packages, this means either\r\n\r\n* None of your direct dependencies depend on any vulnerable packages, or\r\n* You have already fixed the problem by updating the direct dependencies.\r\n\r\n### <a name=\"how-fix\"></a>How do I fix the issue?\r\n\r\n#### Updating the version of Microsoft.NETCore.App\r\n\r\nIf your host version is a 2.1.x host you must install version 2.1.8 or later of the [.NET Core 2.1 runtime](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/download/dotnet-core/2.1), or corresponding [.NET Core 2.1 SDK](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/download/dotnet-core/2.1).\r\n\r\nIf your host version is a 2.2.x you must install version 2.2.2 or later of the [.NET Core 2.2 runtime](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/download/dotnet-core/2.2), or corresponding  [.NET Core 2.2 SDK](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/download/dotnet-core/2.2).\r\n\r\n#### <a name=\"fixing-direct-dependencies\"></a>Fixing direct dependencies\r\n\r\nOpen *projectname.csproj* in your editor. If you're using Visual Studio, right-click the project and choose **Edit projectname.csproj** from the context menu, where projectname is the name of your project. Look for `PackageReference` elements. The following shows an example project file:\r\n\r\n```xml\r\n<Project Sdk=\"Microsoft.NET.Sdk.Web\">\r\n  <PropertyGroup>\r\n    <TargetFramework>netcoreapp2.1</TargetFramework>\r\n  </PropertyGroup>\r\n  <ItemGroup>\r\n    <PackageReference Include=\"System.Private.Uri\" Version=\"4.3.0\" />\r\n  </ItemGroup>\r\n</Project>\r\n```\r\n\r\nThe preceding example has a reference to the [vulnerable package](#affected-software), as seen by the single `PackageReference` element. The name of the package is in the `Include` attribute.\r\nThe package version number is in the `Version` attribute. The previous example shows a single direct dependency on `System.Private.Uri` version 4.3.0\r\n\r\nTo update the version to the secure package, change the version number to the updated package version as listed on the table [previously](#affected-software).\r\nIn this example, update `System.Private.Uri` to the appropriate [fixed package number](#affected-software) for your major version. Save the *csproj* file. The example *csproj* now looks as follows:\r\n\r\n```xml\r\n<Project Sdk=\"Microsoft.NET.Sdk.Web\">\r\n  <PropertyGroup>\r\n    <TargetFramework>netcoreapp2.1</TargetFramework>\r\n  </PropertyGroup>\r\n  <ItemGroup>\r\n    <PackageReference Include=\"System.Private.Uri\" Version=\"4.3.0\" />\r\n  </ItemGroup>\r\n</Project>\r\n```\r\n\r\nIf you're using Visual Studio and you save your updated *csproj* file, Visual Studio will restore the new package version.\r\nYou can see the restore results by opening the **Output** window (Ctrl+Alt+O) and changing the **Show output from** drop-down list to **Package Manager**.\r\n\r\nIf you're not using Visual Studio, open a command line and change to your project directory. Execute the `dotnet restore` command to restore the updated dependencies.\r\n\r\nNow recompile your application. If after recompilation you see a *Dependency conflict warning*, you must update your other direct dependencies to versions that take a dependency on the updated package.\r\n\r\n#### <a name=\"transitive-dependencies\"></a>Fixing transitive dependencies\r\n\r\nIf your transitive dependency review found references to the [vulnerable package](#affected-software), you must add a direct dependency to the updated package to your *csproj* file to override the transitive dependency.\r\n\r\nOpen *projectname.csproj* in your editor. If you're using Visual Studio, right-click the project and choose **Edit projectname.csproj** from the context menu, where projectname is the name of your project.\r\nLook for `PackageReference` nodes, for example:\r\n\r\n```xml\r\n<Project Sdk=\"Microsoft.NET.Sdk.\">\r\n  <PropertyGroup>\r\n    <TargetFramework>net461</TargetFramework>\r\n  </PropertyGroup>\r\n  <ItemGroup>\r\n    <PackageReference Include=\"ThirdParty.NotUpdatedYet\" Version=\"2.0.0\" />\r\n  </ItemGroup>\r\n</Project>\r\n```\r\n\r\nYou must add a direct dependency to the updated version of the [vulnerable package](#affected-software) by adding it to the *csproj* file.\r\nYou do this by adding a new line to the dependencies section, referencing the fixed version.\r\nFor example, if your search showed a transitive reference to a vulnerable `System.ServiceModel.Http` version, you'd add a reference to the [fixed package number](#affected-software).\r\n\r\n```xml\r\n<Project Sdk=\"Microsoft.NET.Sdk.Web\">\r\n  <PropertyGroup>\r\n    <TargetFramework>net461</TargetFramework>\r\n  </PropertyGroup>\r\n  <ItemGroup>\r\n    <PackageReference Include=\"System.Private.Uri\" Version=\"4.3.0\" />\r\n    <PackageReference Include=\"ThirdParty.NotUpdatedYet\" Version=\"2.0.0\" />\r\n  </ItemGroup>\r\n</Project>\r\n```\r\n\r\nAfter you've added the direct dependency reference, save your *csproj* file.\r\n\r\nIf you're using Visual Studio, save your updated *csproj* file and Visual Studio will restore the new package versions.\r\nYou can see the restore results by opening the **Output** window (Ctrl+Alt+O) and changing the **Show output from** drop-down list to **Package Manager**.\r\n\r\nIf you're not using Visual Studio, open a command line and change to your project directory. Execute the `dotnet restore` command to restore the new dependencies.\r\n\r\n##### Rebuilding your application\r\n\r\nFinally, you must rebuild your application, test, and redeploy.\r\n\r\n## Other Information\r\n\r\n### Reporting Security Issues\r\n\r\nIf you have found a potential security issue in .NET Core, please email details to secure@microsoft.com.

To check the currently installed runtimes, open a command prompt and run the `dotnet --info` command. If you have a 2.1 or greater runtime installed, you'll see output like the following;\r\n\r\n```text\r\n.NET Core SDK (reflecting any global.json):\r\n Version:   2.2.100\r\n Commit:    b9f2fa0ca8\r\n\r\nRuntime Environment:\r\n OS Name:     Windows\r\n OS Version:  10.0.17134\r\n OS Platform: Windows\r\n RID:         win10-x64\r\n Base Path:   C:\\Program Files\\dotnet\\sdk\\2.2.100\\\r\n\r\nHost (useful for support):\r\n  Version: 2.2.0\r\n  Commit:  1249f08fed\r\n\r\n.NET Core SDKs installed:\r\n  2.1.5 [C:\\Program Files\\dotnet\\sdk]\r\n  2.1.502 [C:\\Program Files\\dotnet\\sdk]\r\n  2.2.100 [C:\\Program Files\\dotnet\\sdk]\r\n\r\n.NET Core runtimes installed:\r\n  Microsoft.AspNetCore.All 2.1.6 [C:\\Program Files\\dotnet\\shared\\Microsoft.AspNetCore.All]\r\n  Microsoft.AspNetCore.App 2.1.6 [C:\\Program Files\\dotnet\\shared\\Microsoft.AspNetCore.App]\r\n  Microsoft.AspNetCore.All 2.2.0 [C:\\Program Files\\dotnet\\shared\\Microsoft.AspNetCore.All]\r\n  Microsoft.AspNetCore.App 2.2.0 [C:\\Program Files\\dotnet\\shared\\Microsoft.AspNetCore.App]\r\n  Microsoft.NETCore.App 2.1.6 [C:\\Program Files\\dotnet\\shared\\Microsoft.NETCore.App]\r\n  Microsoft.NETCore.App 2.2.0 [C:\\Program Files\\dotnet\\shared\\Microsoft.NETCore.App]\r\n\r\nTo install additional .NET Core runtimes or SDKs:\r\n  https://aka.ms/dotnet-download\r\n```\r\n\r\nIf your host version is 2.1.x and the highest `Microsoft.NETCore.App` runtime version is less than 2.1.7, you're vulnerable to this issue.\r\nIf your host version is 2.2.x and the highest 2.1.x `Microsoft.NETCore.App` runtime version is less than 2.1.7, you're vulnerable to this issue.\r\n\r\nYou will not see SDK versions if you have only installed the runtime.\r\n\r\n#### Applications not using Microsoft.NetCore.App\r\n\r\nThe affected assembly is also available separately as a NuGet package. If you are not using Microsoft.NetCore.App, you may still be affected if you are referencing the packages listed above.\r\n\r\n##### Direct dependencies\r\n\r\nDirect dependencies are discoverable by examining your `csproj` file. They can be fixed by [editing the project file](#fixing-direct-dependencies) or using NuGet to update the dependency.\r\n\r\n##### Transitive dependencies\r\n\r\nTransitive dependencies occur when you add a package to your project that in turn relies on another package. For example, if Contoso publishes a package `Contoso.Utility` which, in turn, depends on `Contoso.Internals` and you add the `Contoso.Utility` package to your project now your project has a direct dependency on `Contoso.Utility` and, because `Contoso.Utility` depends 'Contoso.Internals', your application gains a transitive dependency on the `Contoso.Internals` package.\r\n\r\nTransitive dependencies are reviewable in two ways:\r\n\r\n* In the Visual Studio Solution Explorer window, which supports searching.\r\n* By examining the `project.assets.json` file contained in the obj directory of your project for `csproj` based projects\r\n\r\nThe `project.assets.json` files are the authoritative list of all packages used by your project, containing both direct and transitive dependencies.\r\n\r\nThere are two ways to view transitive dependencies. You can either [use Visual Studio’s Solution Explorer](#vs-solution-explorer), or you can review [the `project.assets.json` file](#project-assets-json)).\r\n\r\n##### <a name=\"vs-solution-explorer\"></a>Using Visual Studio Solution Explorer\r\n\r\nTo use Solution Explorer, open the project in Visual Studio, and then press Ctrl+; to activate the search in Solution Explorer. Search for the [vulnerable package](#affected-software) and make a note of the version numbers of any results you find.\r\n\r\nFor example, searching for `Microsoft.AspNetCore.Mvc.Core` in an example project that contains a package that takes a dependency on `Microsoft.AspNetCore.Mvc` shows the following results in Visual Studio 2017:\r\n\r\n![Screenshot of search results in Visual Studio 2017](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/796298/25858816/8ecdc2b4-3491-11e7-9363-746804bb9832.png)\r\n\r\nThe search results appear as a tree. In the previous results, you can see that a reference to `Microsoft.AspNetCore.Mvc.Core` version 1.1.2 is discovered.\r\n\r\nUnder the Dependencies node is a NuGet node. Under the NuGet node is the list of packages you have directly taken a dependency on and their versions.\r\nIn screenshot, the application takes a direct dependency on `Microsoft.AspNetCore.Mvc`. `Microsoft.AspNetCore.Mvc` in turn has leaf nodes that list its dependencies and their versions.\r\nThe `Microsoft.AspNetCore.Mvc` package takes a dependency on a version of `Microsoft.AspNetCore.Mvc.ApiExplorer`, that in turn takes a dependency on a version of `Microsoft.AspNetCore.Mvc.Core`.\r\n\r\n##### <a name=\"project-assets-json\"></a> Manually reviewing project.assets.json\r\n\r\nOpen the *project.assets.json* file from your project’s obj directory in your editor. We suggest you use an editor that understands JSON and allows you to collapse and expand nodes to review this file.\r\nVisual Studio and Visual Studio Code provide JSON friendly editing.\r\n\r\nSearch the *project.assets.json* file for the [vulnerable package](#affected-software), using the format `packagename/` for each of the package names from the preceding table. If you find the assembly name in your search:\r\n\r\n* Examine the line on which they are found, the version number is after the `/`.\r\n* Compare to the [vulnerable versions table](#affected-software).\r\n\r\nFor example, a search result that shows `SSystem.Net.Http/4.3.0` is a reference to version 4.3.0 of `System.Net.Http`.\r\n\r\nIf your *project.assets.json* file includes references to the [vulnerable package](#affected-software), then you need to fix the transitive dependencies.\r\n\r\nIf you have not found any reference to any vulnerable packages, this means either\r\n\r\n* None of your direct dependencies depend on any vulnerable packages, or\r\n* You have already fixed the problem by updating the direct dependencies.\r\n\r\n### <a name=\"how-fix\"></a>How do I fix the issue?\r\n\r\n#### Updating the version of Microsoft.NETCore.App\r\n\r\nIf your host version is a 2.1.x host you must install version 2.1.7 or later of the [.NET Core 2.1 runtime](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/download/dotnet-core/2.1), or corresponding [.NET Core 2.1 SDK](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/download/dotnet-core/2.1).\r\n\r\nIf your host version is a 2.2.x you must install version 2.2.1 or later of the [.NET Core 2.2 runtime](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/download/dotnet-core/2.2), or corresponding  [.NET Core 2.2 SDK](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/download/dotnet-core/2.2).\r\n\r\n#### <a name=\"fixing-direct-dependencies\"></a>Fixing direct dependencies\r\n\r\nOpen *projectname.csproj* in your editor. If you're using Visual Studio, right-click the project and choose **Edit projectname.csproj** from the context menu, where projectname is the name of your project. Look for `PackageReference` elements. The following shows an example project file:\r\n\r\n```xml\r\n<Project Sdk=\"Microsoft.NET.Sdk.Web\">\r\n  <PropertyGroup>\r\n    <TargetFramework>netcoreapp2.1</TargetFramework>\r\n  </PropertyGroup>\r\n  <ItemGroup>\r\n    <PackageReference Include=\"System.Net.Http\" Version=\"4.3.0\" />\r\n  </ItemGroup>\r\n</Project>\r\n```\r\n\r\nThe preceding example has a reference to the [vulnerable package](#affected-software), as seen by the single `PackageReference` element. The name of the package is in the `Include` attribute.\r\nThe package version number is in the `Version` attribute. The previous example shows a single direct dependency on `System.Net.Http` version 4.3.0\r\n\r\nTo update the version to the secure package, change the version number to the updated package version as listed on the table [previously](#affected-software).\r\nIn this example, update `System.IO.Pipelines` to the appropriate [fixed package number](#affected-software) for your major version. Save the *csproj* file. The example *csproj* now looks as follows:\r\n\r\n```xml\r\n<Project Sdk=\"Microsoft.NET.Sdk.Web\">\r\n  <PropertyGroup>\r\n    <TargetFramework>netcoreapp2.1</TargetFramework>\r\n  </PropertyGroup>\r\n  <ItemGroup>\r\n    <PackageReference Include=\"System.Net.Http\" Version=\"4.3.5\" />\r\n  </ItemGroup>\r\n</Project>\r\n```\r\n\r\nIf you're using Visual Studio and you save your updated *csproj* file, Visual Studio will restore the new package version.\r\nYou can see the restore results by opening the **Output** window (Ctrl+Alt+O) and changing the **Show output from** drop-down list to **Package Manager**.\r\n\r\nIf you're not using Visual Studio, open a command line and change to your project directory. Execute the `dotnet restore` command to restore the updated dependencies.\r\n\r\nNow recompile your application. If after recompilation you see a *Dependency conflict warning*, you must update your other direct dependencies to versions that take a dependency on the updated package.\r\n\r\n#### <a name=\"transitive-dependencies\"></a>Fixing transitive dependencies\r\n\r\nIf your transitive dependency review found references to the [vulnerable package](#affected-software), you must add a direct dependency to the updated package to your *csproj* file to override the transitive dependency.\r\n\r\nOpen *projectname.csproj* in your editor. If you're using Visual Studio, right-click the project and choose **Edit projectname.csproj** from the context menu, where projectname is the name of your project.\r\nLook for `PackageReference` nodes, for example:\r\n\r\n```xml\r\n<Project Sdk=\"Microsoft.NET.Sdk.\">\r\n  <PropertyGroup>\r\n    <TargetFramework>net461</TargetFramework>\r\n  </PropertyGroup>\r\n  <ItemGroup>\r\n    <PackageReference Include=\"ThirdParty.NotUpdatedYet\" Version=\"2.0.0\" />\r\n  </ItemGroup>\r\n</Project>\r\n```\r\n\r\nYou must add a direct dependency to the updated version of the [vulnerable package](#affected-software) by adding it to the *csproj* file.\r\nYou do this by adding a new line to the dependencies section, referencing the fixed version.\r\nFor example, if your search showed a transitive reference to a vulnerable `System.ServiceModel.Http` version, you'd add a reference to the [fixed package number](#affected-software).\r\n\r\n```xml\r\n<Project Sdk=\"Microsoft.NET.Sdk.Web\">\r\n  <PropertyGroup>\r\n    <TargetFramework>net461</TargetFramework>\r\n  </PropertyGroup>\r\n  <ItemGroup>\r\n    <PackageReference Include=\"System.Net.Http\" Version=\"4.3.5\" />\r\n    <PackageReference Include=\"ThirdParty.NotUpdatedYet\" Version=\"2.0.0\" />\r\n  </ItemGroup>\r\n</Project>\r\n```\r\n\r\nAfter you've added the direct dependency reference, save your *csproj* file.\r\n\r\nIf you're using Visual Studio, save your updated *csproj* file and Visual Studio will restore the new package versions.\r\nYou can see the restore results by opening the **Output** window (Ctrl+Alt+O) and changing the **Show output from** drop-down list to **Package Manager**.\r\n\r\nIf you're not using Visual Studio, open a command line and change to your project directory. Execute the `dotnet restore` command to restore the new dependencies.\r\n\r\n##### Rebuilding your application\r\n\r\nFinally, you must rebuild your application, test, and redeploy.\r\n\r\n## Other Information\r\n\r\n### Reporting Security Issues\r\n\r\nIf you have found a potential security issue in .NET Core, please email details to secure@microsoft.com.

However, .NET hasn't had a (great) built-in way to deal with JSON. Instead we've relied on [Json.NET] which continues to serve the .NET ecosystem well.\r\n\r\n[Json.NET]: https://www.newtonsoft.com/json\r\n\r\nMoving forward, we plan on making some changes to our JSON support:\r\n\r\n* **We need high-performance JSON APIs**. We need a new set of JSON APIs that are highly tuned for performance by using `Span<T>` and allows for processing UTF-8 directly without having to transcode to UTF-16 `string` instances. Both aspects are critical for our web server Kestrel, where throughput is a key requirement.\r\n\r\n* **Remove dependency from ASP.NET Core to Json.NET**. Today, ASP.NET Core has a dependency on Json.NET. While this provides a tight integration between ASP.NET Core and Json.NET, it also means that application developers cannot freely choose which JSON library they are using. This is also problematic for customers of Json.NET as the version is dictated by the underlying platform. However, Json.NET is frequently updated and application developers often want to -- or even have to -- use a specific version. Thus, we want to remove the dependency from ASP.NET Core 3.0 to Json.NET so that customers can choose which version to use, without fearing they might accidentally break the underlying platform. In addition, this makes it also possible to plug-in an entirely different JSON library.\r\n\r\n* **Provide an ASP.NET Core integration package for Json.NET**. Json.NET has basically become the Swiss Army knife of JSON processing in .NET. It provides many options and facilities that allow customers to handle their JSON needs with ease. We don't want to compromise on the Json.NET support customers are getting today, for example, the ability to configure the JSON serialization via the `AddJsonOptions` extension method. Thus, we want to provide the Json.NET integration as a NuGet package that developers can optionally install so they get all the bells and whistles they get from Json.NET today. The other part of this work item is to ensure we have the right extension points so that other parties can provide similar integration packages for their JSON library of choice.\r\n\r\nBelow are more details around this plan.\r\n\r\n## The need for high-performance JSON APIs\r\n\r\nThe requirements for the .NET stack have changed a bit since the arrival of .NET Core. Historically, .NET has valued usability and convenience. With .NET Core, we've added a focus on performance, and we've made significant investments to serve high performance needs. And the [improvements we made][techempower] in the popular TechEmpower benchmark are a testament to that.\r\n\r\n[techempower]: https://www.techempower.com/blog/2016/11/16/framework-benchmarks-round-13/\r\n\r\nWith .NET Core 2.1, we've added a brand new primitive called [Span\\<T>][span-msdn] that allows us to represent native memory and arrays in a uniform way. With this type, we've also added a set of parsing and encoding APIs that are much more memory efficient without having to resort to unsafe code.\r\n\r\n[span-msdn]: https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/magazine/mt814808.aspx\r\n\r\nPart of the work of minimizing allocations is to avoid having to transcode UTF-8 payloads into UTF-16 strings, purely for parsing reasons. Currently, Json.NET is implemented by reading UTF-16. We need the ability to read (and write) JSON documents directly in UTF-8 because most network protocols (including HTTP) use UTF-8.\r\n\r\nDuring .NET Core 2.1 we've learned that updating our existing APIs to leverage `Span<T>` has limits. While we did add a bunch of overloads that accept spans, we also had to produce brand new APIs that are designed around minimizing allocations and dealing with buffers, which we exposed in `System.Buffers` namespaces. And with `System.IO.Pipelines` we've also added a programming model that enables developers to share buffers without having to deal with lifetime issues.\r\n\r\nBased on these experiences we believe in order to support JSON parsing, we'll need to expose a new set of JSON APIs that are specifically geared for high-performance scenarios.\r\n\r\nYou might wonder why we can't just update Json.NET to include support for parsing JSON using `Span<T>`? Well, James Newton-King -- the author of Json.NET -- has the following to say about that:\r\n\r\n> Json.NET was created over 10 years ago, and since then it has added a wide range of features aimed to help developers work with JSON in .NET. In that time Json.NET has also become far and away NuGet's most depended on and downloaded package, and is the go-to library for JSON support in .NET. Unfortunately, Json.NET's wealth of features and popularity works against making major changes to it. Supporting new technologies like `Span<T>` would require fundamental breaking changes to the library and would disrupt existing applications and libraries that depend on it.\r\n>\r\n> Going forward Json.NET will continue to be worked on and invested in, both addressing known issues today and supporting new platforms in the future. Json.NET has always existed alongside other JSON libraries for .NET, and there will be nothing to prevent you using one or more together, depending on whether you need the performance of the new JSON APIs or the large feature set of Json.NET.\r\n\r\n## Move Json.NET integration into a separate NuGet package\r\n\r\nToday, you cannot use ASP.NET Core without Json.NET because it is a dependency of ASP.NET Core itself. Over the years, we've received feedback that the dependency can conflict with other libraries that have their own dependency on a different version of Json.NET. In the past, we've considered addressing this issue by using a private copy of Json.NET in ASP.NET. However, this would create problems when developers want to configure Json.NET (for instance, in order to control how the serializer behaves when formatting JSON objects).\r\n\r\nMoving forward we'd like to:\r\n\r\n1. Replace the internal usage of Json.NET in ASP.NET Core by the new platform-provided JSON APIs.\r\n\r\n2. Factor the public facing usage of Json.NET into an optional integration package that can be acquired from NuGet.\r\n\r\nSo the existing integration between ASP.NET Core and Json.NET will continue to be supported, but will be moving out of the platform and into a separate package. However, since the integration is then designed to sit on top of the platform, it will also allow customers to update Json.NET to later versions.\r\n\r\nFurthermore, customers who need more performance can also choose to use the new JSON APIs, at the expense of the rich feature set that Json.NET offers.\r\n\r\n## Discussion\r\n\r\nFor a discussion, please go to https://github.com/dotnet/corefx/issues/33115.","Url":"https://github.com/dotnet/announcements/issues/90","RelatedDescription":"Open issue \"The future of JSON in .NET Core 3.0\" (#90)"},{"Id":"368440353","IsPullRequest":false,"CreatedAt":"2018-10-09T23:44:06","Actor":"vivmishra","Number":"89","RawContent":null,"Title":"October 2018 .NET Updates","State":"open","Body":"# October 2018 .NET Updates\r\n\r\nThe following .NET updates were released in October 2018.

LTS releases are stable release which receive critical updates and are supported for at least three years. Current releases can include new features that may undergo future change based on feedback. Current releases are supported for three months after the subsequent .NET Core major or minor release. Both LTS and Current releases receive critical fixes throughout their lifecycle, for security, reliability, or to add support for new operating system versions. You must stay up-to-date with the latest patches to qualify for support. \r\n\r\n## .NET Core 2.0 Lifecycle\r\n\r\n[.NET Core 2.0](https://blogs.msdn.microsoft.com/dotnet/2017/08/14/announcing-net-core-2-0/) was released in August 2017 as a Current release. Per the lifecycle policy, Current releases reach end of life 3 months after a subsequent release (Current or LTS). .NET Core 2.1 released May 2018 and began the end of life countdown for .NET Core 2.0. The 3 month maintenance period for .NET Core 2.0 was scheduled to end August 2018 but was [extended to October](https://blogs.msdn.microsoft.com/dotnet/2018/06/20/net-core-2-0-will-reach-end-of-life-on-september-1-2018/) to allow time to address an issue some customers were experiencing while migrating to .NET Core 2.1.\r\n\r\n## .NET Core 2.0 Downloads\r\n\r\n.NET Core 2.0 installers, zips and tar.gzs will remain available, but unsupported. This includes existing releases available on Linux package feeds. Previous versions, including 2.0, will be accessible through the [Download Archives](https://www.microsoft.com/net/download/archives). \r\n\r\n## .NET Core 2.0 Docker Images\r\n\r\n.NET Core 2.0 will be removed from the .NET and ASP.NET Docker repo READMEs, however the existing images remain available in those repos.\r\n\r\n* [microsoft/dotnet](https://hub.docker.com/r/microsoft/dotnet/)\r\n* [microsoft/dotnet-nightly](https://hub.docker.com/r/microsoft/dotnet-nightly/)\r\n* [microsoft/aspnetcore](https://hub.docker.com/r/microsoft/aspnetcore/)\r\n* [microsoft/aspnetcore-build](https://hub.docker.com/r/microsoft/aspnetcore-build/)\r\n\r\n## Policy Information\r\n\r\nAdditional lifecycle and support details  and background can be seen in the following:\r\n\r\n* [.NET Core Support Lifecycle](https://www.microsoft.com/net/platform/support-policy)\r\n* [Support and Versioning](https://blogs.msdn.microsoft.com/dotnet/2016/07/26/net-support-and-versioning/)\r\n* [2.0 end of life early announcement](https://blogs.msdn.microsoft.com/dotnet/2018/06/20/net-core-2-0-will-reach-end-of-life-on-september-1-2018/)\r\n* [.NET Core OS Lifecycle Policy](https://github.com/dotnet/core/blob/master/os-lifecycle-policy.md)\r\n","Url":"https://github.com/dotnet/announcements/issues/86","RelatedDescription":"Open issue \".NET Core 2.0 has reached end of life\" (#86)"},{"Id":"361098704","IsPullRequest":false,"CreatedAt":"2018-09-18T01:10:23","Actor":"spshant","Number":"85","RawContent":null,"Title":"NET Framework 4.8 Early Access build 3646 is available!","State":"open","Body":"Today, we are happy to share an Early Access build for the .NET Framework 4.8.

This advisory also provides guidance on what developers can do to update their applications to remove this vulnerability.\r\n\r\nMicrosoft is aware of a denial of service vulnerability in .NET Core when System.IO.Pipelines improperly handles requests. An attacker who successfully exploited this vulnerability could cause a denial of service against an application that is leveraging System.IO.Pipelines. The vulnerability can be exploited remotely, without authentication. A remote unauthenticated attacker could exploit this vulnerability by providing specially crafted requests to the application.\r\n\r\nThe update addresses the vulnerability by correcting how System.IO.Pipelines handles requests.\r\n\r\nIf you are using ASP.NET Core 2.1 you will also need to update your ASP.NET version this by following the instructions in the [ASP.NET Core bulletin](https://github.com/aspnet/Announcements/issues/316).\r\n\r\n## Discussion\r\n\r\nDiscussion for this issue can be found at https://github.com/dotnet/corefx/issues/32228\r\n\r\n### <a name=\"mitigation-factors\"></a>Mitigation factors\r\n\r\nThere are no mitigating factors for this vulnerability.\r\n\r\n## <a name=\"affected-software\"></a>Affected software\r\n\r\nAny .NET Core based application that uses the System.IO.Pipelines package with a vulnerable version listed below.\r\n\r\nPackage name | Vulnerable versions | Secure versions\r\n------------ | ------------------- | -------------------------\r\nSystem.IO.Pipelines | 4.5.0 | 4.5.1\r\n\r\n## <a name=\"advisory-faq\"></a>Advisory FAQ\r\n\r\n### <a name=\"how-affected\"></a>How do I know if I am affected?\r\n\r\n#### Applications which use System.IO.Pipelines\r\n\r\nSystem.IO.Pipelines is distributed both in ASP.NET Core 2.1 and separately as a NuGet package. If you are not using Microsoft.AspNetCore.App or .All, you may still be affected if you are referencing the System.IO.Pipelines package.\r\n\r\n##### Direct dependencies\r\n\r\nDirect dependencies are discoverable by examining your `csproj` file. They can be fixed by [editing the project file](#fixing-direct-dependencies) or using NuGet to update the dependency.\r\n\r\n##### Transitive dependencies\r\n\r\nTransitive dependencies occur when you add a package to your project that in turn relies on another package. For example, if Contoso publishes a package `Contoso.Utility` which, in turn, depends on `Contoso.Internals` and you add the `Contoso.Utility` package to your project now your project has a direct dependency on `Contoso.Utility` and, because `Contoso.Utility` depends 'Contoso.Internals', your application gains a transitive dependency on the `Contoso.Internals` package.\r\n\r\nTransitive dependencies are reviewable in two ways:\r\n\r\n* In the Visual Studio Solution Explorer window, which supports searching.\r\n* By examining the `project.assets.json` file contained in the obj directory of your project for `csproj` based projects\r\n\r\nThe `project.assets.json` files are the authoritative list of all packages used by your project, containing both direct and transitive dependencies.\r\n\r\nThere are two ways to view transitive dependencies. You can either [use Visual Studio’s Solution Explorer](#vs-solution-explorer), or you can review [the `project.assets.json` file](#project-assets-json)).\r\n\r\n##### <a name=\"vs-solution-explorer\"></a>Using Visual Studio Solution Explorer\r\n\r\nTo use Solution Explorer, open the project in Visual Studio, and then press Ctrl+; to activate the search in Solution Explorer. Search for the [vulnerable package](#affected-software) and make a note of the version numbers of any results you find.\r\n\r\nFor example, searching for `Microsoft.AspNetCore.Mvc.Core` in an example project that contains a package that takes a dependency on `Microsoft.AspNetCore.Mvc` shows the following results in Visual Studio 2017:\r\n\r\n![Screenshot of search results in Visual Studio 2017](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/796298/25858816/8ecdc2b4-3491-11e7-9363-746804bb9832.png)\r\n\r\nThe search results appear as a tree. In the previous results, you can see that a reference to `Microsoft.AspNetCore.Mvc.Core` version 1.1.2 is discovered.\r\n\r\nUnder the Dependencies node is a NuGet node. Under the NuGet node is the list of packages you have directly taken a dependency on and their versions.\r\nIn screenshot, the application takes a direct dependency on `Microsoft.AspNetCore.Mvc`. `Microsoft.AspNetCore.Mvc` in turn has leaf nodes that list its dependencies and their versions.\r\nThe `Microsoft.AspNetCore.Mvc` package takes a dependency on a version of `Microsoft.AspNetCore.Mvc.ApiExplorer`, that in turn takes a dependency on a version of `Microsoft.AspNetCore.Mvc.Core`.\r\n\r\n##### <a name=\"project-assets-json\"></a> Manually reviewing project.assets.json\r\n\r\nOpen the *project.assets.json* file from your project’s obj directory in your editor. We suggest you use an editor that understands JSON and allows you to collapse and expand nodes to review this file.\r\nVisual Studio and Visual Studio Code provide JSON friendly editing.\r\n\r\nSearch the *project.assets.json* file for the [vulnerable package](#affected-software), using the format `packagename/` for each of the package names from the preceding table. If you find the assembly name in your search:\r\n\r\n* Examine the line on which they are found, the version number is after the `/`.\r\n* Compare to the [vulnerable versions table](#affected-software).\r\n\r\nFor example, a search result that shows `System.IO.Pipelines/4.5.0` is a reference to version 4.5.0 of `System.IO.Pipelines`.\r\n\r\nIf your *project.assets.json* file includes references to the [vulnerable package](#affected-software), then you need to fix the transitive dependencies.\r\n\r\nIf you have not found any reference to any vulnerable packages, this means either\r\n\r\n* None of your direct dependencies depend on any vulnerable packages, or\r\n* You have already fixed the problem by updating the direct dependencies.\r\n\r\n### <a name=\"how-fix\"></a>How do I fix the issue?\r\n\r\n#### <a name=\"fixing-direct-dependencies\"></a>Fixing direct dependencies\r\n\r\nOpen *projectname.csproj* in your editor. If you're using Visual Studio, right-click the project and choose **Edit projectname.csproj** from the context menu, where projectname is the name of your project. Look for `PackageReference` elements. The following shows an example project file:\r\n\r\n```xml\r\n<Project Sdk=\"Microsoft.NET.Sdk.Web\">\r\n  <PropertyGroup>\r\n    <TargetFramework>netcoreapp2.1</TargetFramework>\r\n  </PropertyGroup>\r\n  <ItemGroup>\r\n    <PackageReference Include=\"System.IO.Pipelines\" Version=\"4.5.0\" />\r\n  </ItemGroup>\r\n</Project>\r\n```\r\n\r\nThe preceding example has a reference to the [vulnerable package](#affected-software), as seen by the single `PackageReference` element. The name of the package is in the `Include` attribute.\r\nThe package version number is in the `Version` attribute. The previous example shows a single direct dependency on `System.IO.Pipelines` version 4.5.0\r\n\r\nTo update the version to the secure package, change the version number to the updated package version as listed on the table [previously](#affected-software).\r\nIn this example, update `System.IO.Pipelines` to the appropriate [fixed package number](#affected-software) for your major version. Save the *csproj* file. The example *csproj* now looks as follows:\r\n\r\n```xml\r\n<Project Sdk=\"Microsoft.NET.Sdk.Web\">\r\n  <PropertyGroup>\r\n    <TargetFramework>netcoreapp2.1</TargetFramework>\r\n  </PropertyGroup>\r\n  <ItemGroup>\r\n    <PackageReference Include=\"System.IO.Pipelines\" Version=\"4.5.1\" />\r\n  </ItemGroup>\r\n</Project>\r\n```\r\n\r\nIf you're using Visual Studio and you save your updated *csproj* file, Visual Studio will restore the new package version.\r\nYou can see the restore results by opening the **Output** window (Ctrl+Alt+O) and changing the **Show output from** drop-down list to **Package Manager**.\r\n\r\nIf you're not using Visual Studio, open a command line and change to your project directory. Execute the `dotnet restore` command to restore the updated dependencies.\r\n\r\nNow recompile your application. If after recompilation you see a *Dependency conflict warning*, you must update your other direct dependencies to versions that take a dependency on the updated package.\r\n\r\n#### <a name=\"transitive-dependencies\"></a>Fixing transitive dependencies\r\n\r\nIf your transitive dependency review found references to the [vulnerable package](#affected-software), you must add a direct dependency to the updated package to your *csproj* file to override the transitive dependency.\r\n\r\nOpen *projectname.csproj* in your editor. If you're using Visual Studio, right-click the project and choose **Edit projectname.csproj** from the context menu, where projectname is the name of your project.\r\nLook for `PackageReference` nodes, for example:\r\n\r\n```xml\r\n<Project Sdk=\"Microsoft.NET.Sdk.\">\r\n  <PropertyGroup>\r\n    <TargetFramework>net461</TargetFramework>\r\n  </PropertyGroup>\r\n  <ItemGroup>\r\n    <PackageReference Include=\"ThirdParty.NotUpdatedYet\" Version=\"2.0.0\" />\r\n  </ItemGroup>\r\n</Project>\r\n```\r\n\r\nYou must add a direct dependency to the updated version of the [vulnerable package](#affected-software) by adding it to the *csproj* file.\r\nYou do this by adding a new line to the dependencies section, referencing the fixed version.\r\nFor example, if your search showed a transitive reference to a vulnerable `System.ServiceModel.Http` version, you'd add a reference to the [fixed package number](#affected-software).\r\n\r\n```xml\r\n<Project Sdk=\"Microsoft.NET.Sdk.Web\">\r\n  <PropertyGroup>\r\n    <TargetFramework>net461</TargetFramework>\r\n  </PropertyGroup>\r\n  <ItemGroup>\r\n    <PackageReference Include=\"System.IO.Pipelines\" Version=\"4.5.1\" />\r\n    <PackageReference Include=\"ThirdParty.NotUpdatedYet\" Version=\"2.0.0\" />\r\n  </ItemGroup>\r\n</Project>\r\n```\r\n\r\nAfter you've added the direct dependency reference, save your *csproj* file.\r\n\r\nIf you're using Visual Studio, save your updated *csproj* file and Visual Studio will restore the new package versions.\r\nYou can see the restore results by opening the **Output** window (Ctrl+Alt+O) and changing the **Show output from** drop-down list to **Package Manager**.\r\n\r\nIf you're not using Visual Studio, open a command line and change to your project directory. Execute the `dotnet restore` command to restore the new dependencies.\r\n\r\n#### Rebuilding your application\r\n\r\nFinally you must rebuild your application, test, and redeploy.\r\n\r\n## Other Information\r\n\r\n### Reporting Security Issues\r\n\r\nIf you have found a potential security issue in .NET Core, please email details to secure@microsoft.com.

Please try this build and provide support.\r\n\r\n## Discussion\r\n\r\nPlease share your thoughts on this change and see what others are saying at:\r\n\r\n* [dotnet/coreclr #19843](https://github.com/dotnet/coreclr/issues/19843)\r\n\r\n## Current Status\r\n\r\nARM64 builds are functional, for console and ASP.NET Core apps.\r\n\r\n## Details\r\n\r\nInitial support for ARM64 was added in the .NET Core 2.1 release. The team is not maintaining .NET Core 2.x branches with respect to ARM64. All ARM64 improvements will be made in the .NET Core 3.0 branch (currently [master](https://github.com/dotnet/coreclr)).\r\n\r\nSee [Installing .NET Core 3.0 on Linux ARM64](https://gist.github.com/richlander/467813274cea8abc624553ee72b28213) to install .NET Core on your ARM64 machine. Builds are available from the [daily builds page](https://github.com/dotnet/core/blob/master/daily-builds.md).\r\n\r\n## Bug Queries\r\n\r\nthe following bugs queries are available for ARM64:\r\n\r\n* [dotnet/coreclr](https://github.com/dotnet/coreclr/issues?q=is%3Aopen+is%3Aissue+label%3Aarch-arm64)\r\n* [dotnet/corefx](https://github.com/dotnet/corefx/issues?q=is%3Aopen+is%3Aissue+label%3Aarch-arm64)\r\n\r\n## Operating Systems\r\n\r\n.NET Core 3.0 ARM64 builds are tested on the following operating systems:\r\n\r\n* Ubuntu 16.04 and 18.04\r\n* Debian 9\r\n\r\n## Test Hardware\r\n\r\n.NET Core 3.0 ARM64 builds have been tested on the following hardware:\r\n\r\n* [NVIDIA Jetson TX2 Module](https://developer.nvidia.com/embedded/buy/jetson-tx2)\r\n* [Pine A64](https://www.pine64.org/?page_id=46823)\r\n* [Qualcomm Centriq 2400](https://www.qualcomm.com/products/qualcomm-centriq-2400-processor)\r\n* [Qualcomm Snapdragon](https://www.qualcomm.com/snapdragon/always-connected-pc)\r\n* [Raspberry Pi3](https://www.raspberrypi.org/products/raspberry-pi-3-model-b-plus/)","Url":"https://github.com/dotnet/announcements/issues/82","RelatedDescription":"Open issue \".NET Core Runtime ARM64 Status\" (#82)"},{"Id":"349693735","IsPullRequest":false,"CreatedAt":"2018-08-22T18:23:01","Actor":"richlander","Number":"80","RawContent":null,"Title":"Improving Performance of ARM32 Docker Images with .NET Core Package Cache","State":"closed","Body":"# Improving Performance of ARM32 Docker Images with .NET Core Package Cache\r\n\r\n.NET Core SDK distributions include a compressed copy of NuGet packages for .NET Core, ASP.NET Core and EF Core. These packages are decompressed upon installation of the .NET Core SDK. The packages are not currently included in ARM32 distributions due to the time and space cost to decompress the packages. Instead, they will be added to [.NET Core ARM32 Docker images](https://hub.docker.com/r/microsoft/dotnet/), where these costs can be paid as part of image creation.\r\n\r\nThese NuGet packages include content for two purposes:\r\n\r\n- Reference assemblies for .NET Core, for code compilation.\r\n- Pre-compiled assemblies (compiled with [crossgen](https://github.com/dotnet/coreclr/blob/master/Documentation/building/crossgen.md)) for .NET Core, for use in self-contained applications.\r\n\r\nIn both cases, the presence of these packages avoid the need to access remote NuGet feeds for .NET Core assemblies as part of package restore.\r\n\r\nThis change only affects [.NET Core 2.1 SDK ARM32 Docker images](https://hub.docker.com/r/microsoft/dotnet/). This change will be made in August 2018.\r\n\r\n## Discussion\r\n\r\nPlease share your thoughts on this change and see what others are saying at:\r\n\r\n* [dotnet/dotnet-docker #653](https://github.com/dotnet/dotnet-docker/issues/653)\r\n\r\n## .NET Core SDK NugetFallbackFolder\r\n\r\nThe .NET Core SDK includes a compressed copy of all NuGet package, in LZMA format. It exists at the following version-specific location:\r\n\r\n```\r\nroot@3778032bc43d:/# ls -l /usr/share/dotnet/sdk/2.1.302/*.lzma\r\n-rw-r--r-- 1 1004 sudo 35995936 Jul  2 22:51 /usr/share/dotnet/sdk/2.1.302/nuGetPackagesArchive.lzma\r\n```\r\n\r\nThis file is decompressed to the following location: `/usr/share/dotnet/sdk/NuGetFallbackFolder/`\r\n\r\nA package restore for a .NET Core assembly will restore the assembly from the NuGetFallbackFolder location and copy it to the user NuGet cache. At that point, regular NuGet behavior is used.\r\n\r\n## Impact of this change\r\n\r\nThere should be no functional difference in behavior after this change. .NET SDK commands should complete faster and require fewer package restore network requests.\r\n\r\nThe following examples demonstrates the benefit of this change. The improvement can be observed with package restore. Build times (assuming no restore) are not affected.\r\n\r\n### .NET Core 2.1 SDK image after this change\r\n\r\n> The change has already been made in the `microsoft/dotnet-nightly` repo, as you can see in the example below.

This issue was resolved earlier this year, with the [May 2018 Preview of Quality Rollup](https://blogs.msdn.microsoft.com/dotnet/2018/05/15/net-framework-may-2018-preview-of-quality-rollup/). We recently learned that some applications, including Johnson Controls’ C-CURE 9000 Software, were negatively impacted by this change as this update requires all client and server workstations to be updated simultaneously with the appropriate Microsoft updates. The changes made to .NET Framework 4.7.1 were also integrated into .NET Framework 4.6 and later servicing releases. As a result, this advisory applies to .NET Framework 4.6 and later versions.\r\n\r\nThis advisory is provided so that developers can correctly diagnose this issue and be aware of our guidance. We will continue to update this issue as we have new information to share.\r\n\r\n## Discussion\r\n\r\nPlease share your thoughts on this change and see what others are saying at:\r\n\r\n* [microsoft/dotnet #832](https://github.com/Microsoft/dotnet/issues/832)\r\n\r\n## Guidance\r\n\r\nThis guidance only applies to customers that have experienced this issue.\r\n\r\nWe have released [an update for .NET Framework 4.6](https://blogs.msdn.microsoft.com/dotnet/2018/08/30/net-framework-august-2018-preview-of-quality-rollup/) and later that resolves the issue. **You must deploy the .NET Framework update for this issue to all .NET Framework 4.6+ machines that communicate via serialized objects**. After doing that, cross-machine serialization will work as expected. \r\n \r\nPlease consult your software vendor to understand if this impacts the software you are using.\r\n\r\n## Technical Context\r\n\r\nIn the [May 2018 Preview of Quality Rollup](https://blogs.msdn.microsoft.com/dotnet/2018/05/15/net-framework-may-2018-preview-of-quality-rollup/), we made a change to the internal type CultureAwareComparer to implement ISerializable. We made the change in order to address [issue with serializing/deserializing a CultureAwareComparer](https://github.com/Microsoft/dotnet/blob/master/releases/net471/KnownIssues/521954%20-%20BCL%20CultureAwareComparer%20with%20ignore%20casing%20on%20serialized%20on%20previous%20versions%20of%20.NET%20do%20not%20correctly%20deserialize%20on%20.NET%204.7.1.md).\r\n\r\nThe issue reported was that a type that contains an instance of CultureAwareComparer was not able to correctly serialize and deserialize across different versions of the .NET Framework. There are a few types in .NET Framework that do this, the most commonly impacted one being the Dictionary<TKey, TValue> type.\r\n \r\nThe change to implement the ISerializable interface had unintended side effects when exchanging this type across different machines. We have had a small number of reports from customers who have been affected.\r\n\r\nA common, but not unique way, of exchanging objects across machines is to use WCF in conjunction with a serializer. One of the common serializers being DataContractSerializer. The side-effect of the change prevented data serialized on systems where the type implements ISerializable to correctly deserialize of systems where the type does NOT implement ISerializable. The same is true of the opposite case, that systems where the type does not implement ISerializable will not correctly deserialize data from systems where the type does implement ISerializable.\r\n\r\nWe have an updated fix that we intend to release within the next month that will remove the implementation of the ISerializable interface on the type and use a different internal mechanism for ensuring the cross-version serialization continues to work as expected. This change addresses the break experienced with WCF.\r\n\r\nThe upcoming fix will remove the implementation of the ISerializable interface on the type and use a different mechanism for ensuring the cross-version serialization of that type continues to work. This change addresses the break experienced with WCF.\r\n\r\n## Symptoms\r\n\r\nAn application that is affected by this issue will most likely crash when trying to deserialize an object. It may print or log an error message similar to the following one:\r\n\r\n```\r\nThe formatter threw an exception while trying to deserialize the message: \r\nThere was an error while trying to deserialize parameter . The InnerException message was ''EndElement' 'Comparer' from namespace '' is not expected. Expecting element '_compareInfo'.'.  Please see InnerException for more details.\r\n```\r\n","Url":"https://github.com/dotnet/announcements/issues/81","RelatedDescription":"Open issue \"Advisory serializing/deserializing a CultureAwareComparer with .NET Framework 4.6+\" (#81)"},{"Id":"348162872","IsPullRequest":false,"CreatedAt":"2018-08-07T04:26:40","Actor":"richlander","Number":"79","RawContent":null,"Title":"August 2018 .NET Updates","State":"open","Body":"# August 2018 .NET Updates\r\n\r\nThe following .NET updates were released in August 2018.

Debian Jessie is no longer a supported operating system for .NET Core. Docker users need to switch to Debian Stretch-based (AKA Debian 9) images to stay in support.\r\n\r\n## Discussion\r\n\r\nPlease share your thoughts on this change and see what others are saying at:\r\n\r\n* [dotnet/dotnet-docker #647](https://github.com/dotnet/dotnet-docker/issues/647)\r\n\r\n## Context\r\n\r\nJessie-based images are currently provided for .NET Core 1.0, 1.1 and 2.0. .NET Core 1.0 and 1.1 expose multi-arch tags, such as `1.0-runtime` and `1.1-sdk`, that support Debian Jessie. When pulled for a Linux Docker daemon (on Linux or Windows), these tags pull Jessie-based images. .NET Core 2.0 supports Jessie, but it is not the default. .NET Core 2.0 multi-arch tags, such as `2.0-runtime` and `2.0-sdk`, pull Debian Stretch-based images, when pulled for a Linux Docker daemon. We made a conscious decision with .NET Core 2.0 to move off of Jessie as the default to avoid this problem, based the Jessie 2018 EOL date. .NET Core 2.1 does not support Jessie, only Stretch.\r\n\r\nWe recently posted about our policy for underlying operating system dependencies with Docker:\r\n\r\n> For each major and minor .NET version, we may take a new major operating system version dependency. As I mentioned earlier, we adopted Debian 9 as the base image for .NET Core 2.0. We stayed with Debian 9 for .NET Core 2.1, since Debian 10 (AKA “Buster”) has not been released. Debian 9 will remain the default base image for .NET Core 2.1 for the life of .NET Core 2.1. **Once we adopt an underlying operating system major version, we will not change it for the life of that given .NET release.**\r\n\r\nSource: https://blogs.msdn.microsoft.com/dotnet/2018/06/18/staying-up-to-date-with-net-container-images/\r\n\r\n## Plan\r\n\r\nWe will continue to re-build .NET Core 1.0 and 1.1 multi-arch tags on top of Jessie for the remaining [supported lifetime of .NET Core 1.0 and 1.1](https://github.com/dotnet/core/blob/master/microsoft-support.md). We will also provide a Stretch-based image for .NET Core 1.1. This tag will look like the following: `1.1-runtime-stretch` or `1.1.9-sdk-stretch`. This is same format that Jessie has used.\r\n\r\nWe will produce Jessie-based images for NET Core 2.0 until October 2018, which is when [.NET Core 2.0 support ends](https://github.com/dotnet/core/blob/master/microsoft-support.md). .NET Core 2.0 multi-arch tags support Debian Stretch, not Jessie, as described above.\r\n\r\nIn summary, .NET Core is no longer supported on Debian Jessie, with Docker or otherwise. We will produce Docker images for Jessie until .NET Core 1.0, 1.1 and 2.0 support ends, respectively, to avoid breaking applications.

See Guidance section.~~\r\n\r\n~~Guidance has changed for Windows 7, Windows Server 2008 and Windows Server 2008 R2. See Guidance section.~~\r\n\r\nThe [July 2018 Security and Quality Rollup updates for .NET Framework](https://portal.msrc.microsoft.com/en-US/security-guidance/advisory/CVE-2018-8356) was released earlier this month. We have received multiple customer reports of [applications that fail to start or don't run correctly](https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/help/4345913) after installing the July 2018 update. These reports are specific to applications that initialize a COM component and run with restricted permissions.\r\n\r\nWe have stopped distributing the .NET Framework July 2018 updates on Windows Update and are actively working on fixing and re-shipping this month's updates. If you installed the July 2018 update and have not yet seen any negative behavior, we recommend that you leave your systems as-is but closely monitor them and ensure that you apply upcoming .NET Framework updates.\r\n\r\nAs a team, we regret that this release was shipped with this flaw. This release was tested using our regular and extensive testing process. We discovered while investigating this issue that we have a test hole for the specific combination of COM activation and restricted permissions, including impersonation. We will be mitigating that gap going forward. Again, we are sorry for any inconvenience that this product flaw has caused.\r\n\r\nWe will continue to update this issue and [post](https://blogs.msdn.microsoft.com/dotnet/2018/07/20/advisory-on-july-2018-net-framework-updates/) as we have new information.\r\n\r\n## Discussion\r\nPlease share your thoughts/experience on this advisory and see what others are saying at:\r\n\r\n* [microsoft/dotnet #811](https://github.com/Microsoft/dotnet/issues/811)\r\n\r\n## Guidance\r\n\r\nWe strongly recommend that you install [.NET Framework August 2018 Update](https://blogs.msdn.microsoft.com/dotnet/2018/08/14/august-2018-security-and-quality-rollup/).\r\n\r\n~~We recommend that you install [.NET Framework July 2018 Update](https://blogs.msdn.microsoft.com/dotnet/2018/07/30/net-framework-july-2018-update/) on your systems if you experienced the symptoms described in this advisory. If you did not experience these symptoms, we recommend you wait to update your machines until the next regular update, in August.~~\r\n\r\n~~On Windows 7, Windows Server 2008, and Windows Server 2008 R2, we have found that the combination of [July 2018 Security and Quality Rollup updates for .NET Framework](https://portal.msrc.microsoft.com/en-US/security-guidance/advisory/CVE-2018-8356) and  [.NET Framework July 2018 Update](https://blogs.msdn.microsoft.com/dotnet/2018/07/30/net-framework-july-2018-update/) do not resolve all symptoms. On these Windows versions, if you are experiencing these symptoms after installing this combination of patches, we recommend that you uninstall (only) the Monthly Rollup patch and then install the appropriate Security Only patch listed at [July 2018 Security and Quality Rollup updates for .NET Framework](https://portal.msrc.microsoft.com/en-US/security-guidance/advisory/CVE-2018-8356).~~\r\n\r\n## Technical Context\r\n\r\nThe .NET Framework runtime uses the process token to determine whether the process is being run within an elevated context. These system calls can fail if the required process inspection permissions are not present. This causes an “access denied\" error.\r\n\r\n## Symptoms\r\n\r\nA COM component fails to load because of “access denied,” “class not registered,” or “internal failure occurred for unknown reasons” errors. \r\n\r\nThe most commonly reported failure results in the following error message:\r\n\r\n```console\r\nException type: System.UnauthorizedAccessException\r\nMessage: Access is denied. (Exception from HRESULT: 0x80070005 (E_ACCESSDENIED))\r\n```\r\n\r\n### Sharepoint\r\n\r\nWhen users browse to a SharePoint site they may see the following HTTP 403 message:\r\n\r\n```console\r\n\"The Web Site declined to show this webpage\"\r\n```\r\n\r\nThe SharePoint ULS Logs will contain a message like the following:  \r\n\r\n```console\r\nw3wp.exe (0x1894)         0x0B94  SharePoint Foundation  General 0000       High                UnauthorizedAccessException for the request. 403 Forbidden will be returned.

(WinMgmt) \r\n\r\nProgram Location:  \r\n\r\n   at System.Runtime.InteropServices.Marshal.ThrowExceptionForHRInternal(Int32 errorCode, IntPtr errorInfo) \r\n\r\n   at System.Management.ManagementObject.Get() \r\n\r\n   at Microsoft.BizTalk.SnapIn.Framework.WmiProvider.SelectInstance\r\n```\r\n\r\n> Warning: The following workarounds may make a computer or a network more vulnerable to attack by malicious users or by malicious software such as viruses. We do not recommend these workarounds but are providing this information so that you can implement the workarounds at your own discretion. Use these workarounds at your own risk.\r\n\r\nUse the following guidance as a workaround:\r\n\r\n* Add “NETWORK SERVICE” to the local Administrators group. \r\n\r\n### IIS with Classic ASP\r\n\r\nIIS Hosted Classic ASP calling CreateObject for .NET COM objects may receive the following error: \"ActiveX component can't create object\". Use the following guidance as a workaround.\r\n\r\n* If your web site uses Anonymous Authentication, change the Web Site Anonymous Authentication credentials to use the \"Application pool identity\"\r\n* If your site uses Basic Authentication, log into the application once as the application pool identity and then create an instance of the .NET COM component. All subsequent activations for that .NET COM component should succeed, for any user.\r\n\r\n### .NET applications using COM and impersonation\r\n\r\n.NET Applications that creates instances of .NET COM application within an Impersonation Context may receive the following error: \"0x80040154 (REGDB_E_CLASSNOTREG)\". Use the following guidance as a workaround.\r\n\r\n* Create an instance of the .NET COM component prior to the impersonation context call. Later impersonated create instance calls should work as expected.\r\n* Run the .NET Application in the context of the impersonated user\r\n* Avoid using Impersonation when creating the .NET COM object","Url":"https://github.com/dotnet/announcements/issues/74","RelatedDescription":"Open issue \"Advisory on July 2018 .NET Framework Updates\" (#74)"}],"ResultType":"GitHubIssue"},"Twitter":{"ResultType":"TwitterTimeline","Tweets":[{"Id":"1106559820415406080","CreatedAt":"2019-03-15T14:16:34+00:00","UserScreenname":"dotnet","Text":".NET Core Container Images now Published to Microsoft Container Registry https://t.co/025dCayCnx","Source":"<a href=\"https://about.twitter.com/products/tweetdeck\" rel=\"nofollow\">TweetDeck</a>","RetweetCount":87,"FavoriteCount":52,"RawContent":null},{"Id":"1106511609768357889","CreatedAt":"2019-03-15T11:05:00+00:00","UserScreenname":"dotnet","Text":"Did you know you could build video games with .NET? \n\nCheck out this episode of #OnDotNet where \n@BrianPeek &amp;… https://t.co/g6DSHnfV18","Source":"<a href=\"https://about.twitter.com/products/tweetdeck\" rel=\"nofollow\">TweetDeck</a>","RetweetCount":54,"FavoriteCount":19,"RawContent":null},{"Id":"1105555943285288961","CreatedAt":"2019-03-12T19:47:31+00:00","UserScreenname":"dotnet","Text":"Tune in to the @VisualStudio channel on Thursday for a virtual workshop for Windows Application Developers\n\nMore de… https://t.co/6IsLRLIz6N","Source":"<a href=\"https://about.twitter.com/products/tweetdeck\" rel=\"nofollow\">TweetDeck</a>","RetweetCount":17,"FavoriteCount":5,"RawContent":null},{"Id":"1105063819985014785","CreatedAt":"2019-03-11T11:12:00+00:00","UserScreenname":"dotnet","Text":"In this episode of #OnDotNet, Brady Gaster (@bradygaster) joins Cecil (@cecilphillip) to show how easy it is to add… https://t.co/qBrPW5zgnp","Source":"<a href=\"https://about.twitter.com/products/tweetdeck\" rel=\"nofollow\">TweetDeck</a>","RetweetCount":65,"FavoriteCount":21,"RawContent":null},{"Id":"1103473660508160001","CreatedAt":"2019-03-07T01:53:16+00:00","UserScreenname":"dotnet","Text":"Announcing .NET Core 3 Preview 3 https://t.co/sXYAjLR9Wb","Source":"<a href=\"https://about.twitter.com/products/tweetdeck\" rel=\"nofollow\">TweetDeck</a>","RetweetCount":359,"FavoriteCount":219,"RawContent":null}]}},"RunOn":"2019-03-18T05:30:31.5231868Z","RunDurationInMilliseconds":10214}
