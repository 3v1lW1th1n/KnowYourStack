We would like to keep the user's scroll position even though the route has changed.\r\n\r\nRight now we have to drop using the default scrolling system and use our own. It's probably less efficient and won't get updated as much.\r\n\r\n### Possible Solutions Considered\r\nIt could be solved a few different ways.\r\n\r\n**1. Global Blacklist**\r\n\r\n```ts\r\n{ \r\n  anchorScrolling: 'enabled',\r\n  scrollPositionRestoration: 'enabled',\r\n  scrollPositionBlacklist: [{from: /^todo\\/.*$/, to: /^todo\\/.*$/}]\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nBy allowing the `from` and `to`, you can provide a lot more flexibility and a very easy to reason about system at the global level. This is also a relatively straightforward implementation, without needing to introduce any other concepts or dependencies.\r\n\r\nThe downside to this implementation is that it would be very easy to update the route without updating the corresponding blacklist. It's not easy to understand the whole route logic without seeing the route.\r\n\r\n**2. Route Option**\r\nThe ideal long-term solution (IMO) would be two new parameters on the `Route` definition for `scrollPositionRestoration` and `anchorScrolling`\r\n\r\nThe option would look something like.\r\n\r\n```ts\r\n{ path: '/todo/:id', scrollPositionRestoration: { value: 'enabled',  from : /todo\\/.+/  } }\r\n```\r\n\r\nThe positive to this is that it keeps things consistent for the global/local options. It also allows for extension to make it a async function in a future feature.\r\n\r\nThe downside is that it extends the already bloated `Route` options. It lacks the ability to define global cases that are a little more broad, creating repetition.\r\n\r\n## Contributing\r\nThis is something I am willing to try and tackle, if given permission and we can agree on a strategy.","Url":"https://github.com/angular/angular/issues/30709","RelatedDescription":"Open issue \"Allow whitelisting and blacklisting for scroll reset\" (#30709)"},{"Id":"449514260","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2019-05-28T23:00:48","Actor":"AndrewKushnir","Number":"30708","RawContent":null,"Title":"fix(ivy): generate explicit type annotation for NgModuleFactory calls in ngfactories","State":"open","Body":"Prior to this commit there were no explicit types setup for NgModuleFactory calls in ngfactories, so TypeScript inferred the type based on a given call.

My application has just one Promise with a catch block. So, this Uncaught error should not be thrown. \r\nThe \"rejected\" status of the promise comes from a http request which fails. \r\n\r\n\r\n## 🔬 Minimal Reproduction\r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/kemler89/uncaught-error\r\n\r\nShort summary:\r\nThe project contains a service (AppConfigService) which loads a Json-Config file as runtime configuration file of the application. The load functionality will be handled in the loadAppConfig method which returns a promise – because the APP_INITIALIZER only supports promises as of now. For the error handling the promise has a catch block. To load the runtime configuration before the application has started the AppConfigService will be executed when the application gets initialized. This will be handled in app-config.module.ts\r\n\r\nStep to reproduce:\r\njust run \"ng build\"\r\n\r\nThe console will show the following error:\r\nERROR { Error: Uncaught (in promise): Error\r\n\r\nexpected behavior would be that no error occurs because the error will be caught in app-config.service.ts\r\n\r\nTo avoid the error you have to run \"ng serve\" and change the path to the json file from './assets/data/appConfig.json' to 'http://localhost:4200/assets/data/appConfig.json' in app.module.ts\r\n\r\nnow \"ng build\" will run without the ERROR.\r\n\r\n\r\n## 🔥 Exception or Error\r\nERROR { Error: Uncaught (in promise): Error\r\n    at resolvePromise (P:\\Projekte\\uncaught-error\\node_modules\\zone.js\\dist\\zone-node.js:831:31)\r\n    at P:\\Projekte\\uncaught-error\\node_modules\\zone.js\\dist\\zone-node.js:741:17\r\n    at SafeSubscriber._error (P:\\Projekte\\uncaught-error\\node_modules\\rxjs\\internal\\Observable.js:99:89)\r\n    at SafeSubscriber.__tryOrUnsub (P:\\Projekte\\uncaught-error\\node_modules\\rxjs\\internal\\Subscriber.js:205:16)\r\n    at SafeSubscriber.error (P:\\Projekte\\uncaught-error\\node_modules\\rxjs\\internal\\Subscriber.js:156:26)\r\n    at Subscriber._error (P:\\Projekte\\uncaught-error\\node_modules\\rxjs\\internal\\Subscriber.js:92:26)\r\n    at Subscriber.error (P:\\Projekte\\uncaught-error\\node_modules\\rxjs\\internal\\Subscriber.js:72:18)\r\n    at MapSubscriber.Subscriber._error (P:\\Projekte\\uncaught-error\\node_modules\\rxjs\\internal\\Subscriber.js:92:26)\r\n    at MapSubscriber.Subscriber.error (P:\\Projekte\\uncaught-error\\node_modules\\rxjs\\internal\\Subscriber.js:72:18)\r\n    at FilterSubscriber.Subscriber._error (P:\\Projekte\\uncaught-error\\node_modules\\rxjs\\internal\\Subscriber.js:92:26)\r\n    at FilterSubscriber.Subscriber.error (P:\\Projekte\\uncaught-error\\node_modules\\rxjs\\internal\\Subscriber.js:72:18)\r\n    at MergeMapSubscriber.OuterSubscriber.notifyError (P:\\Projekte\\uncaught-error\\node_modules\\rxjs\\internal\\OuterSubscriber.js:26:26)\r\n    at InnerSubscriber._error (P:\\Projekte\\uncaught-error\\node_modules\\rxjs\\internal\\InnerSubscriber.js:31:21)\r\n    at InnerSubscriber.Subscriber.error (P:\\Projekte\\uncaught-error\\node_modules\\rxjs\\internal\\Subscriber.js:72:18)\r\n    at ZoneTask.onComplete [as callback] (P:\\Projekte\\uncaught-error\\node_modules\\@angular\\platform-server\\bundles\\platform-server.umd.js:379:34)\r\n    at ZoneDelegate.invokeTask (P:\\Projekte\\uncaught-error\\node_modules\\zone.js\\dist\\zone-node.js:423:31)\r\n  rejection: Error,\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n## 🌍  Your Environment\r\n\r\n**Angular Version:**\r\n7.2.15\r\n","Url":"https://github.com/angular/angular/issues/30689","RelatedDescription":"Open issue \"Uncaught Error while prerendering during ng build --prod\" (#30689)"},{"Id":"448862134","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2019-05-27T13:36:59","Actor":"devversion","Number":"30688","RawContent":null,"Title":"fix(ivy): module with providers are processed too early","State":"open","Body":"Currently with Ivy, `ModuleWithProvider` providers are processed in order\r\nof declaration in the `NgModule` imports.

All @ViewChild/@ContentChild queries were categorized into one of two buckets at compile time: \"static\" or \"dynamic\".\r\n\r\nBut now we have to define this, and this is cool with me, but what if my code relied on a Query which, in one case, needs to be dynamic, and in another case, needs to be static?\r\n\r\nExample:\r\n- I have a base_validation component, which gets specialized in input_validation, select_validation, etc...\r\n- The base_validation component keeps a link on a generic NgModel declared in each of the specialized components\r\n- In \"input_validation\", the NgModel must be resolved statically\r\n- In \"select_validation\", the NgModel must be resolved dynamically (i have to do some *ngIf magic there)\r\n\r\nAfter fiddling with this for some time i found a way to make the new ViewChild act exactly like the previous version so that component logic refactoring will not (as far as my tests go) be required.\r\n\r\n(Apparently i'm unable to format this decently...)\r\n\r\n@ViewChild(NgModel, { static: false }) validationControl: NgModel;\r\n\r\n@ViewChild(NgModel, { static: true }) set validationControl_static(comp: NgModel) {\r\n    if (comp) { this.validationControl = comp; }\r\n};\r\n\r\nThis way, apparently, you get the dynamic part of the ViewChild and you \"manually\" merge it with the static part. (also, setters on a dynamic ViewChild doesn't get fired for some reason).\r\n\r\nI think this might be useful to add to the static-query-migration.

In our case it tried to get the new version on https://www.jobs.af/ngsw-worker.js, which redirects to https://jobs.af/ngsw-worker.js.

Usually, it is not delivered from server to browser directly. In most cases, it is compressed (gzip or brotli, etc) during deployment.\r\n\r\nTo improve page-loading performance, what developers should care about is the actual payload JS size. Even if the same 1MB, it may be 400KB or 300KB depending on the compression result. It is a big difference for users.\r\n\r\n### Describe the solution you'd like\r\n<!-- ✍️--> If you have a solution in mind, please describe it.\r\n\r\nI want a way to validate a compressed bundle size with `budgets` feature.\r\n\r\nMy current idea is adding budget types like `initial:gzip` and  `bundle:gzip`. Or adding a new field like `compressed: boolean` . \r\n\r\n### Describe alternatives you've considered\r\n<!-- ✍️--> Have you considered any alternative solutions or workarounds?\r\n\r\n\r\n","Url":"https://github.com/angular/angular-cli/issues/14536","RelatedDescription":"Closed issue \"Proposal: Budgets for actual payload size after compression\" (#14536)"},{"Id":"449169684","IsPullRequest":false,"CreatedAt":"2019-05-28T11:01:35","Actor":"crooksey","Number":"14531","RawContent":null,"Title":"@angular-devkit/build-angular package doesn't reflect master","State":"closed","Body":"# 🐞 Bug report\r\n\r\n### Command (mark with an `x`)\r\n<!-- Can you pin-point the command or commands that are effected by this bug? -->\r\n<!-- ✍️edit: -->\r\n```\r\n\r\n- [X] build\r\n- [X] serve\r\n\r\n```\r\n\r\n### Description\r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/angular/angular-cli/blob/master/packages/angular_devkit/build_angular/src/angular-cli-files/models/jit-polyfills.js \r\n\r\nReferences\r\n```\r\nimport 'core-js/proposals/reflect-metadata';\r\n```\r\nHowever, my installed version (on a clean node modules) shows\r\n```\r\nimport 'core-js/es7/reflect';\r\n```\r\nThis code was updated approx 6 weeks ago in master, yet is still not published on a recent release to npm, \r\n\r\n## 🔬 Minimal Reproduction\r\nInstall latest package, view installed polyfill\r\n\r\n## 🔥 Exception or Error\r\n<pre><code>\r\nERROR in ./node_modules/@angular-devkit/build-angular/src/angular-cli-files/models/jit-polyfills.js\r\nModule not found: Error: Can't resolve 'core-js/es7/reflect' in '/home/luke/nodejs/ecom2/ecom2-frontend/node_modules/@angular-devkit/build-angular/src/angular-cli-files/models'\r\nℹ ｢wdm｣: Failed to compile.\r\n\r\n\r\n</code></pre>\r\n\r\n\r\n## 🌍 Your Environment\r\n<pre><code>\r\n@angular-devkit/architect         0.13.9\r\n@angular-devkit/build-angular     0.13.9\r\n@angular-devkit/build-optimizer   0.13.9\r\n@angular-devkit/build-webpack     0.13.9\r\n@angular-devkit/core              7.3.9\r\n@angular-devkit/schematics        7.3.9\r\n@angular/cli                      7.3.9\r\n@ngtools/webpack                  7.3.9\r\n@schematics/angular               7.3.9\r\n@schematics/update                0.13.9\r\nrxjs                              6.5.2\r\ntypescript                        3.1.3\r\nwebpack                           4.29.0\r\n\r\n\r\n</code></pre>","Url":"https://github.com/angular/angular-cli/issues/14531","RelatedDescription":"Closed issue \"@angular-devkit/build-angular package doesn't reflect master\" (#14531)"},{"Id":"449195115","IsPullRequest":false,"CreatedAt":"2019-05-28T10:39:41","Actor":"aescarcha","Number":"14532","RawContent":null,"Title":"Ng update forces double quotemarkt","State":"open","Body":"# 🐞 Bug report\r\n\r\n### Command (mark with an `x`)\r\n<!-- Can you pin-point the command or commands that are effected by this bug? -->\r\n<!-- ✍️edit: -->\r\n```\r\n- [ ] new\r\n- [ ] build\r\n- [ ] serve\r\n- [ ] test\r\n- [ ] e2e\r\n- [ ] generate\r\n- [ ] add\r\n- [x] update\r\n- [ ] lint\r\n- [ ] xi18n\r\n- [ ] run\r\n- [ ] config\r\n- [ ] help\r\n- [ ] version\r\n- [ ] doc\r\n```\r\n\r\n### Is this a regression?\r\n\r\nProbably, I used ng update several times already and this never happened\r\n\r\n### Description\r\n\r\nAfter running `ng update` to update from 7.3 to 8.0.0-rc.5 I get a big amount of tslint errors because it used double quotes (\") on the modified imports.

The error also pointed clearly to my code with an error on the input, not the autocomplete.","Url":"https://github.com/angular/components/issues/16121","RelatedDescription":"Closed issue \"ERROR multiple event matches matInput / matAutocomplete / FormControl\" (#16121)"},{"Id":"448921918","IsPullRequest":false,"CreatedAt":"2019-05-27T15:52:56","Actor":"AnisTss","Number":"16127","RawContent":null,"Title":"Add copy button to API references in documentation web app","State":"open","Body":"#### Feature Description\r\n\r\nI found myself using mouse selection a lot to copy module imports, It would be nice to see a copy icon button in API imports section.\r\n\r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/11518540/58430037-b7019380-809f-11e9-8a66-09bd37c80a5f.png)\r\n\r\n\r\n","Url":"https://github.com/angular/components/issues/16127","RelatedDescription":"Open issue \"Add copy button to API references in documentation web app\" (#16127)"},{"Id":"448656739","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2019-05-27T04:06:01","Actor":"crisbeto","Number":"16125","RawContent":null,"Title":"docs(menu): reflect default overlap trigger behavior","State":"open","Body":"Fixes the menu docs still referring to the old `overlapTrigger` behavior.\r\n\r\nFixes #16123.","Url":"https://github.com/angular/components/pull/16125","RelatedDescription":"Open PR \"docs(menu): reflect default overlap trigger behavior\" (#16125)"},{"Id":"448605632","IsPullRequest":false,"CreatedAt":"2019-05-26T20:56:24","Actor":"paweljur","Number":"16124","RawContent":null,"Title":"Mat nav list item border radius does not affect ripple","State":"open","Body":"(This is my first ever public issue, bug report etc.)\r\n#### Bug, feature request, or proposal:\r\nBug\r\n\r\n#### What is the expected behavior?\r\nWhen defining border radius for mat-list-item the ripple should have the same border radius as the mat-list-item.\r\n\r\n#### What is the current behavior?\r\nRipple is unaffected by mat-list-item's border radius (it does work with mat-button).\r\n\r\n#### What are the steps to reproduce?\r\nhttps://stackblitz.com/edit/mat-nav-item-ripple-bug?file=app/app.component.html\r\n\r\nMat-button has defined border radius and it's ripple is correct.\r\nMat-list-item inside mat-nav-list with the same style has incorrect ripple even tho the borders are changed.\r\n\r\n#### What is the use-case or motivation for changing an existing behavior?\r\nCurrent behavior is inconsistent with other components and requires bad practices to work around to work as expected.\r\n\r\n#### Which versions of Angular, Material, OS, TypeScript, browsers are affected?\r\nAngular Core: 7.2.15\r\nCDK/Material: 7.3.7\r\nBrowser: Chrome 74.0.3729.169\r\nOS: Windows 10\r\n\r\n#### Is there anything else we should know?\r\nAfter closer inspection in chromes dev tools i was able to determine that: \r\n- in case of mat-button, mat-ripple is first child of mat-button, and has border-radius set to inherit\r\n- in case of mat-nav-item, mat-ripple is inside mat-nav-item-content and none of them has defined border-radius\r\n- applying border-radius as inherit with chromes dev tools for both mat-nav-item-content and mat-ripple fixes the ripple","Url":"https://github.com/angular/components/issues/16124","RelatedDescription":"Open issue \"Mat nav list item border radius does not affect ripple\" (#16124)"},{"Id":"448584819","IsPullRequest":false,"CreatedAt":"2019-05-26T16:42:06","Actor":"waynetsai","Number":"16123","RawContent":null,"Title":"[Docs]Update material menu's description about menu default overlap behavior on document","State":"open","Body":"By default, current version(^7.3.7)'s angular material menu won't overlap its trigger element.\r\nIf we want the menu overlap the trigger element, we need to set [overlapTrigger] to true manually.\r\n \r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/26406404/58384742-01d7c880-8018-11e9-8925-cbd35ecad6e6.png)\r\n\r\nIt's default position behavior is opposite to the description on document. \r\n\r\n[docs link] https://material.angular.io/components/menu/overview?fbclid=IwAR0VwYfp7HyiEJTFIgvHGcy-lPnqiXvx8xn1cB4XVDzynCqz6eZxR0J72OM\r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/26406404/58384724-ac9bb700-8017-11e9-8373-70ef118631c7.png)\r\n\r\n","Url":"https://github.com/angular/components/issues/16123","RelatedDescription":"Open issue \"[Docs]Update material menu's description about menu default overlap behavior on document\" (#16123)"},{"Id":"448550190","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2019-05-26T10:04:03","Actor":"crisbeto","Number":"16122","RawContent":null,"Title":"fix(expansion-panel): header animating on init when using non-default height","State":"open","Body":"Works around the expansion panel header animating on init, if its header is different from the default one.
