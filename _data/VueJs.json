I\r\n wish that the beforeRouteLeave event is triggered.\r\n\r\n### What is actually happening?\r\nIt is not happen。bug when the code \"this.$router.push('/user')\" run, will trigger beforeRouteLeave\r\n\r\n---\r\nnow, my solution is add component named 'BeforeMain' before Main component.\r\nwhen BeforeMain'mounted trigger,run  \"this.$router.push({name:'main'})\"\r\nAdd 'beforeEach':\r\nrouter.beforeEach((to, from, next) => {\r\n  // gameview的\r\n  if (to.name === 'beforemain' && from.name === 'main') {\r\n    router.go(-1)\r\n    next(false)\r\n  } else {\r\n    next()\r\n  }\r\n})\r\nThus,while current component is 'Main' ,you press back button of brower, you can trigger 'beforeRouteLeave'\r\nBut , it 's so trouble\r\n\r\n\r\nChinese version:\r\n将第一个组件前再增加一个beforemain组件，做一次push跳转。这样main可以正常触发beforeRouteLeave\r\n\r\n<!-- generated by vue-issues.
