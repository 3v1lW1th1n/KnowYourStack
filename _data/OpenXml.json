For example, a excel file has a formula cell A3=sum(A1:A2), if we need insert a row of data after row1, the formula should change to sum(A1:A3) . \r\nThis can be done automatically either in excel application or in office automation solution. But with OpenXML SDK, we need to do by programming, it's not a simple task because we need parse all the formula elements completely and compose it again.\r\nThis is just a simple example about the topic, actually there are many scenarios like this.  It's very appreciate if OpenXML SDK provides calculation mechanism.\r\n"}],"ResultType":"GitHubEvent"},"PowerTools":{"Events":[{"Id":"8105895082","Type":"PullRequestEvent","CreatedAt":"2018-08-13T15:50:05","Actor":"twsouthwick","Repository":"OfficeDev/Open-Xml-PowerTools","Organization":"OfficeDev","RawContent":null,"RelatedAction":"merged","RelatedUrl":"https://github.com/OfficeDev/Open-Xml-PowerTools/pull/238","RelatedDescription":"Merged pull request \"Add support for .Net Core\" (#238) at OfficeDev/Open-Xml-PowerTools","RelatedBody":""},{"Id":"8091875678","Type":"IssuesEvent","CreatedAt":"2018-08-09T18:21:09","Actor":"mumby0168","Repository":"OfficeDev/Open-Xml-PowerTools","Organization":"OfficeDev","RawContent":null,"RelatedAction":"closed","RelatedUrl":"https://github.com/OfficeDev/Open-Xml-PowerTools/issues/242","RelatedDescription":"Closed issue \"error CS0246: The type or namespace name 'DocumentFormat' could not be found (are you missing a using directive or an assembly reference?)\" (#242) at OfficeDev/Open-Xml-PowerTools","RelatedBody":"Trying to use this along with open XML SDK and I have included both in my project yet this error still persists any ideas?"}],"ResultType":"GitHubEvent"}},"RunOn":"2018-08-18T05:30:41.9784062Z","RunDurationInMilliseconds":1682}
