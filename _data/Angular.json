The problem is that all attributes seem to be deserialized as strings into the property of an Angular Elements. This means that people can't declaratively set a property on an Angular Element if it has any of the following type:\r\n- boolean\r\n- number\r\n- object\r\n- array\r\n\r\nI feel like those attributes should be automatically deserialized to the proper type\r\n\r\n\r\nFurthermore the boolean attributes presence don't follow the HTML specs in the sense that setting a boolean attribute on an angular element like this:\r\n```\r\n<my-comp is-beautiful></my-comp>\r\n```\r\nwill see the `isBeautiful` property be evaluated to false, when it should be true. Setting a value to it (`is-beautiful=\"true\"`) makes it truthy but also a string. This part of the issue is likely related to https://github.com/angular/angular/issues/14761 (but arguably angular elements are talking to the outside world and should follow HTML spec as opposed to angular components)\r\n\r\n## 🔬 Minimal Reproduction\r\n\r\nstackblitz exposing an element with various attributes types and how setting them impact the value/type of the property of the angular component\r\n\r\nhttps://stackblitz.com/edit/angular7-elements-attributes-types?file=src%2Findex.html\r\n\r\n## 🌍  Your Environment\r\n\r\n**Angular Version:**\r\n<pre><code>\r\nAngular CLI: 7.3.7\r\nNode: 10.11.0\r\nOS: darwin x64\r\nAngular: 7.2.11\r\n... common, compiler, compiler-cli, core, elements, forms, http\r\n... language-service, platform-browser, platform-browser-dynamic\r\n... router\r\n\r\nPackage                            Version\r\n------------------------------------------------------------\r\n@angular-devkit/architect          0.10.7\r\n@angular-devkit/build-angular      0.10.7\r\n@angular-devkit/build-ng-packagr   0.13.7\r\n@angular-devkit/build-optimizer    0.10.7\r\n@angular-devkit/build-webpack      0.10.7\r\n@angular-devkit/core               7.0.7\r\n@angular-devkit/schematics         7.3.7\r\n@angular/cli                       7.3.7\r\n@ngtools/webpack                   7.0.7\r\n@schematics/angular                7.3.7\r\n@schematics/update                 0.13.7\r\nrxjs                               6.4.0\r\ntypescript                         3.1.6\r\nwebpack                            4.29.6\r\n</code></pre>\r\n\r\n**Anything else relevant?**\r\n\r\nI can see the object and array (complex) types being controversial and arguably not allowing to auto deserialize those, even though it would be a nice feature.

This in and of itself, is not the concern. The issue is that, in this particular context, AOT and JIT behave similarly but differ without compiler warnings or errors in one particular case.\r\n\r\nIf I define a function on a route's `data` field, it will appear with JIT on `ActivatedRoute.snapshot.firstChild.data`. However, with AOT, it silently drops this field. No compiler error, no compiler warning. This seems to go against the precedent that has been set, wherein both AOT and JIT give compiler errors if you attempt to build with lambda expressions or non exported functions.\r\n\r\nSee example code below.\r\n\r\n## 🔬 Minimal Reproduction\r\n<!--\r\nSimple steps to reproduce this bug.\r\n\r\nPlease include: commands run (including args), packages added, related code changes.\r\n\r\nIf reproduction steps are not enough for reproduction of your issue, please create a minimal GitHub repository with the reproduction of the issue. \r\nA good way to make a minimal reproduction is to create a new app via `ng new repro-app` and add the minimum possible code to show the problem. \r\nShare the link to the repo below along with step-by-step instructions to reproduce the problem, as well as expected and actual behavior.\r\n\r\nIssues that don't have enough info and can't be reproduced will be closed.\r\n\r\nYou can read more about issue submission guidelines here: https://github.com/angular/angular-cli/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md#-submitting-an-issue\r\n-->\r\n\r\nServe commands with arguments I used.\r\n \r\n```\r\nng serve -c=debug\r\nng serve -c=debug --aot\r\n```\r\n\r\nExample Route\r\n\r\n```\r\n  {\r\n    path: 'someroute',\r\n    component: SomeComponent,\r\n    pathMatch: 'full',\r\n    data: {\r\n      pageTitle: 'Some | Title',\r\n      doesShowUpWithAOT: doesShowUpWithAOT,\r\n      // throwsCompileErrorWithAndWithoutAOT: throwsCompileErrorWithAndWithoutAOT, this behaves as expected\r\n      doesNotShowUpWithAOTAndDoesNotThrowCompilerError() { // behaves inconsistently between JIT and AOT\r\n        console.log('foo');\r\n      },\r\n      // alsoThrowsCompilerErrorWithAndWithoutAOT: () => console.log('foo') this behaves as expected\r\n    }\r\n```\r\n\r\n```\r\n// code from within some class\r\nconstructor(private _route: ActivatedRoute, private _router: Router) {\r\n   this._router.events\r\n      .subcribe(event => {\r\n         if(event instanceof NavigationEnd) {\r\n               const data = this._route.snapshot.firstChild.data;\r\n               const functionMember = data['doesNotShowUpWithAOTAndDoesNotThrowCompilerError']; // is null with AOT, properly defined with JIT\r\n         }\r\n      })\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nI would argue, for the sake of consistency and explicitness, that both AOT and JIT should throw compiler errors, instead of the function making it through in JIT, and dropping away silently in AOT. I believe this would save development time by cutting down on debugging.\r\n\r\nOf course, I am always open to an explanation.\r\n\r\nThanks!\r\n\r\n## 🔥 Exception or Error\r\n<pre><code>\r\n<!-- If the issue is accompanied by an exception or an error, please share it below: -->\r\n<!-- ✍️-->\r\nIn this particular case, there is none, which what I contend the bad behavior (bug) is.\r\n</code></pre>\r\n\r\n\r\n## 🌍 Your Environment\r\nOS: Windows 10 Enterprise, 64-bit\r\n<pre><code>\r\n<!-- run `ng version` and paste output below -->\r\n<!-- ✍️-->\r\n@angular-devkit/architect         0.12.1\r\n@angular-devkit/build-angular     0.12.1\r\n@angular-devkit/build-optimizer   0.12.1\r\n@angular-devkit/build-webpack     0.12.1\r\n@angular-devkit/core              7.2.1\r\n@angular-devkit/schematics        7.2.1\r\n@angular/cli                      7.2.1\r\n@ngtools/webpack                  7.2.1\r\n@schematics/angular               7.2.1\r\n@schematics/update                0.12.1\r\nrxjs                              6.3.3\r\ntypescript                        3.2.2\r\nwebpack                           4.23.1\r\n</code></pre>\r\n\r\n**Anything else relevant?**\r\n<!-- ✍️Is this a browser specific issue?

After the initial load finished, I took the snapshots.\r\n\r\nComparing the two heap sizes, the heap size difference between v6 and v7 is always the difference of (string) constants in memory.\r\n\r\nDid anyone notice the same behavior already? Is it something renderer or compiler specific? I don't know, how to isolate the problem.\r\n\r\n## 🔬 Minimal Reproduction\r\n<!--\r\nPlease create and share minimal reproduction of the issue starting with this template: https://stackblitz.com/fork/angular-issue-repro2\r\n-->\r\n<!-- ✍️ https://stackblitz.com/...-->\r\n\r\n<!--\r\nIf StackBlitz is not suitable for reproduction of your issue, please create a minimal GitHub repository with the reproduction of the issue.

Removing this import makes lazy loading implemented correctly, but the error which is being thrown during the import is not correct at all. Similar topics:\r\n\r\n- [#9488](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli/issues/9488) (it's [answer](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli/issues/9488#issuecomment-374037802) helps, but [comment just from 27 days ago](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli/issues/9488#issuecomment-470359455) clearly shows current error message is still confusing);\r\n- [#9825](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli/issues/9825) (not really address the problem, just the error message is the same);\r\n- [#23412](https://github.com/angular/angular/issues/23412) (it's [answer](https://github.com/angular/angular/issues/23412#issuecomment-422682849) helps);\r\n\r\n\r\n## 🔬 Minimal Reproduction\r\n\r\nStep 1. Generate a new component to lazy load, here it's `ng g c about-us`.\r\nStep 2. Create its module, here it's `about-us.module.ts`.\r\nStep 3. Add **RouterModule.forChild** in **about-us.module.ts**, sample code below:\r\n\r\n```\r\nimport { NgModule } from '@angular/core';\r\nimport { RouterModule } from '@angular/router';\r\nimport { AboutUsComponent } from './about-us/about-us.component';\r\n\r\n@NgModule({\r\n  declarations: [AboutUsComponent],\r\n  imports: [RouterModule.forChild([{ path: '', component: AboutUsComponent }])]\r\n})\r\nexport class AboutUsModule {}\r\n```\r\n\r\nStep 4. Add **AboutUsModule** (FeatureModule) to **AppModule**,  **AboutUsModule** we want to lazy load, like that (code for **app.module.ts**):\r\n\r\n**AboutUsModule**.\r\n```\r\nimport { AppComponent } from './app.component';\r\nimport { BrowserModule } from '@angular/platform-browser';\r\nimport { BrowserAnimationsModule } from '@angular/platform-browser/animations';\r\nimport { NgModule } from '@angular/core';\r\nimport { AboutUsModule } from '@app/about-us';\r\n\r\n@NgModule({\r\n  declarations: [AppComponent],\r\n  imports: [\r\n    BrowserModule,\r\n    BrowserAnimationsModule,\r\n    AboutUsModule\r\n  ],\r\n  bootstrap: [AppComponent]\r\n})\r\nexport class AppModule {}\r\n```\r\n\r\nStep 5. Create **app-routing.module.ts** to define paths, for **about-us** it would be like that:\r\n\r\n```\r\nimport { NgModule } from '@angular/core';\r\nimport { Routes, RouterModule } from '@angular/router';\r\n\r\nconst routes: Routes = [\r\n  {\r\n    path: 'about-us',\r\n    loadChildren: '@ditectrev-libs/about-us/src/lib/about-us.module#AboutUsModule'\r\n  }\r\n];\r\n\r\n@NgModule({\r\n  imports: [RouterModule.forRoot(routes)],\r\n  exports: [RouterModule]\r\n})\r\nexport class RoutingModule {}\r\n```\r\n\r\nStep 6. Add **<router-outlet>** to **app.component.html**, below:\r\n\r\n`<router-outlet></router-outlet>`\r\n\r\nStep 7. Run **ng serve**, and navigate to **localhost:4200/about-us**, you should see an error like in **Exception or Error** section below.\r\n\r\n## 🔥 Exception or Error\r\n\r\n```\r\ncore.js:15713 ERROR Error: Uncaught (in promise): TypeError: undefined is not a function\r\nTypeError: undefined is not a function\r\n```\r\n\r\n\r\n## 🌍 Your Environment\r\n<pre><code>\r\nAngular CLI: 7.2.4\r\nNode: 10.15.0\r\nOS: win32 x64\r\nAngular: 7.2.4\r\n... animations, cli, common, compiler, compiler-cli, core, forms\r\n... language-service, platform-browser, platform-browser-dynamic\r\n... router\r\n\r\nPackage                           Version\r\n-----------------------------------------------------------\r\n@angular-devkit/architect         0.13.1\r\n@angular-devkit/build-angular     0.13.1\r\n@angular-devkit/build-optimizer   0.13.1\r\n@angular-devkit/build-webpack     0.13.1\r\n@angular-devkit/core              7.3.1\r\n@angular-devkit/schematics        7.2.4\r\n@angular/cdk                      7.3.2\r\n@angular/flex-layout              7.0.0-beta.23\r\n@angular/material                 7.3.2\r\n@ngtools/webpack                  7.3.1\r\n@schematics/angular               7.2.4\r\n@schematics/update                0.12.4\r\nrxjs                              6.3.3\r\ntypescript                        3.2.4\r\nwebpack                           4.29.0\r\n</code></pre>\r\n\r\n## Describe the solution you'd like to have\r\n\r\nThrow an error something like \"AboutUsModule is incorrectly imported into AppModule, because it supposed to be lazy loaded.\"\r\n","Url":"https://github.com/angular/angular-cli/issues/14065","RelatedDescription":"Open issue \"Improve semantics of error message for incorrectly imported lazy loaded FeatureModule in AppModule\" (#14065)"},{"Id":"428452676","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2019-04-02T21:27:30","Actor":"manfredsteyer","Number":"14061","RawContent":null,"Title":"feat(@angular-devkit/build-angular): differential loading","State":"open","Body":"--- WORK IN PROGRESS ---\r\n\r\nThis PR is work in progress with the intention to get early feedback before providing the complete one.\r\n\r\nThis PR adds differential loading to the browser builder.

So our workflow is currently to start the `ng build` in watch mode with a custom configuration, and then add or remove modules to a lazy route file. The idea is that we may have thousands of extensions that are loaded dynamically by the client, so we only build them on demand. This is hard with webpack.\r\n\r\nThe problem I am experiencing is that after deleting these modules, webpack is still looking for them. \r\n\r\n<!-- ✍️--> A clear and concise description of the problem...\r\n\r\n## 🔬 Minimal Reproduction\r\n\r\n1. Create an Angular application with one lazy route module with no routes (see below)\r\n2. Start `ng build --watch` \r\n3. Add in a new module file into the source directory (say module A)\r\n4. Reference the module from the lazy route module using `loadChildren`\r\n5. Wait for the build to pick up the changes\r\n6. Delete the module and remove it from the lazy route module\r\n7. Add a different new module file and add it to the lazy route module (say module B)\r\n\r\nDuring the compilation of the new module, the error above occurs. At this point, it is trying to still build module A even though it was removed from the file system.\r\n\r\nNote that I'm using watch mode as building with AOT is too slow starting each time (~1 minute on a single build vs. ~15 seconds with an incremental watch build, which will not meet our KPIs). \r\n<!--\r\nSimple steps to reproduce this bug.\r\n\r\nPlease include: commands run (including args), packages added, related code changes.\r\n\r\nIf reproduction steps are not enough for reproduction of your issue, please create a minimal GitHub repository with the reproduction of the issue. \r\nA good way to make a minimal reproduction is to create a new app via `ng new repro-app` and add the minimum possible code to show the problem. \r\nShare the link to the repo below along with step-by-step instructions to reproduce the problem, as well as expected and actual behavior.\r\n\r\nIssues that don't have enough info and can't be reproduced will be closed.\r\n\r\nYou can read more about issue submission guidelines here: https://github.com/angular/angular-cli/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md#-submitting-an-issue\r\n-->\r\n\r\n## 🔥 Exception or Error\r\n<pre><code>\r\n<!-- If the issue is accompanied by an exception or an error, please share it below: -->\r\n<!-- ✍️-->\r\nError: ENOENT: no such file or directory, open '/Users/andrew/development/work/client/nw-client/src/pathtomyapp.module.ngfactory.js'\r\n    at Object.openSync (fs.js:436:3)\r\n    at Object.readFileSync (fs.js:341:35)\r\n    at Storage.provideSync (/Users/andrew/development/work/client/nw-client/node_modules/enhanced-resolve/lib/CachedInputFileSystem.js:98:13)\r\n    at CachedInputFileSystem.readFileSync (/Users/andrew/development/work/client/nw-client/node_modules/enhanced-resolve/lib/CachedInputFileSystem.js:259:32)\r\n    at Observable.rxjs_1.Observable.obs [as _subscribe] (/Users/andrew/development/work/client/nw-client/node_modules/@ngtools/webpack/src/webpack-input-host.js:35:51)\r\n    at Observable._trySubscribe (/Users/andrew/development/work/client/nw-client/node_modules/@ngtools/webpack/node_modules/rxjs/internal/Observable.js:44:25)\r\n    at Observable.subscribe (/Users/andrew/development/work/client/nw-client/node_modules/@ngtools/webpack/node_modules/rxjs/internal/Observable.js:30:22)\r\n    at SyncDelegateHost._doSyncCall (/Users/andrew/development/work/client/nw-client/node_modules/@angular-devkit/core/src/virtual-fs/host/sync.js:22:20)\r\n    at SyncDelegateHost.read (/Users/andrew/development/work/client/nw-client/node_modules/@angular-devkit/core/src/virtual-fs/host/sync.js:49:21)\r\n    at WebpackCompilerHost.readFileBuffer (/Users/andrew/development/work/client/nw-client/node_modules/@ngtools/webpack/src/compiler_host.js:125:44)\r\n    at VirtualFileSystemDecorator.readFile (/Users/andrew/development/work/client/nw-client/node_modules/@ngtools/webpack/src/virtual_file_system_decorator.js:39:54)\r\n    at processResource (/Users/andrew/development/work/client/nw-client/node_modules/loader-runner/lib/LoaderRunner.js:202:11)\r\n    at iteratePitchingLoaders (/Users/andrew/development/work/client/nw-client/node_modules/loader-runner/lib/LoaderRunner.js:158:10)\r\n    at iteratePitchingLoaders (/Users/andrew/development/work/client/nw-client/node_modules/loader-runner/lib/LoaderRunner.js:165:10)\r\n    at /Users/andrew/development/work/client/nw-client/node_modules/loader-runner/lib/LoaderRunner.js:176:18\r\n    at loadLoader (/Users/andrew/development/work/client/nw-client/node_modules/loader-runner/lib/loadLoader.js:47:3)\r\n\r\n</code></pre>\r\n\r\n\r\n## 🌍 Your Environment\r\n<pre><code>\r\n<!-- run `ng version` and paste output below -->\r\n<!-- ✍️-->\r\nAngular CLI: 7.3.4\r\nNode: 10.14.1\r\nOS: darwin x64\r\nAngular: 7.2.7\r\n... animations, common, compiler, compiler-cli, core, forms\r\n... language-service, platform-browser, platform-browser-dynamic\r\n... router\r\n\r\nPackage                           Version\r\n-----------------------------------------------------------\r\n@angular-devkit/architect         0.13.4\r\n@angular-devkit/build-angular     0.13.4\r\n@angular-devkit/build-optimizer   0.13.4\r\n@angular-devkit/build-webpack     0.13.4\r\n@angular-devkit/core              7.3.4\r\n@angular-devkit/schematics        7.3.4\r\n@angular/cli                      7.3.4\r\n@ngtools/webpack                  7.3.4\r\n@schematics/angular               7.3.4\r\n@schematics/update                0.13.4\r\nrxjs                              6.4.0\r\ntypescript                        3.2.4\r\nwebpack                           4.29.0\r\n</code></pre>\r\n\r\n**Anything else relevant?**\r\n<!-- ✍️Is this a browser specific issue?
