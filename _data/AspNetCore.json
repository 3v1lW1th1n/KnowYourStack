Later in rc1, we expanded this to controllers. However, `BindPropertyAttribute` has properties such as `Name` and `BinderType` that do not make much sense in the context of a type (See https://github.com/aspnet/Mvc/issues/7355). In addition, the implementation for Razor Pages allows for other model binding properties to be applied to the model type which is well beyond the intent of the initial issue. The suggestion here is\r\n\r\n1. Introduce a new `BindPropertiesAttribute` that can be applied to controller and page model types. `BindPropertiesAttribute` has a single property `SupportsGet` which has the same semantic as `BindProperty.SupportsGet`\r\n2. Replace support for declaring `BindPropertyAttribute` on types, and replace the current implementations to look at `BindPropertiesAttribute`.\r\n3.

The problem is that after 30 minutes, when it's time to revalidate the security stamp and the user refreshes, one of two things happens:\r\n\r\n-If I do NOT override FindByIdAsync, it somewhat works, meaning the user stays logged in and claims are generated - however, the user object passed ot GenerateClaimsAsync does NOT contain the required OrganizationMemberships property populated.\r\n-If I DO override FindByIdAsync, I hit that breakpoint when I refresh the page after the security stamp timeout expires. However, after I continue, I don't hit the ClaimsGeneration method. Instead, I'm logged out and redirected to the login page.\r\n\r\nAlso maybe relevant:\r\n\r\n           services.AddIdentity<MyDotNetCoreAppUser, MyDotNetCoreAppRole>(opt =>\r\n            {\r\n                opt.Password.RequireNonAlphanumeric = false;\r\n                opt.Password.RequireUppercase = false;\r\n            })\r\n                .AddEntityFrameworkStores<MyDotNetCoreAppDbContext>()\r\n                .AddUserManager<MyDotNetCoreAppUserManager>()\r\n                .AddSignInManager<MyDotNetCoreAppSignInManager>()\r\n                .AddDefaultTokenProviders();\r\n\r\n            services.AddAuthorization(opt =>\r\n            {\r\n                opt.AddPolicy(\"OrgAdmin\", policy => policy.RequireClaim(MyDotNetCoreAppClaimTypes.MyDotNetCoreAppOrgAdmin));\r\n                opt.AddPolicy(\"OrgMember\", policy => policy.RequireClaim(MyDotNetCoreAppClaimTypes.MyDotNetCoreAppOrgMember));\r\n            });\r\n            services.Configure<SecurityStampValidatorOptions>(options =>\r\n            {\r\n                // enables immediate logout, after updating the user's stat.\r\n                options.ValidationInterval = TimeSpan.FromSeconds(6);\r\n            });\r\n\r\n(I set the validation interval to 6 seconds to be able to debug the security stamp validation more easily.)\r\n\r\nAppreciative of any thoughts on this.
