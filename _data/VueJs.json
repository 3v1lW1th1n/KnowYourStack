This is impossible when working with nested routes, specifically 'default child routes' (routes with an empty path: ''), because all child routes will always be appended after the trailing slash of the parent route.\r\n\r\nFor example, consider that I have a parent route with component HomeBase, and two child components HomeIndex (default child route) and HomeArticle (path: ':aid').\r\n\r\n```\r\nconst routes = [\r\n    path: '/home',\r\n    components: {\r\n        default: HomeBase\r\n    },\r\n    children: [\r\n        {\r\n            path: '',\r\n            component: HomeIndex\r\n        },\r\n        {\r\n            path: ':aid',\r\n            component: HomeArticle\r\n        }\r\n    ]\r\n]\r\n```\r\n\r\nI want the routes to work like this:\r\n\r\n* /home -> HomeIndex rendered within HomeBase\r\n* /home/123 -> HomeArticle rendered within HomeBase\r\n\r\nBut VueRouter makes the routes look like this:\r\n* /home/ -> HomeIndex rendered within HomeBase\r\n* /home/123 -> HomeArticle rendered within HomeBase\r\n\r\nEven though I probably could link directly to \"/home\" using <router-link/>, I want to use named routes, so it matters that VueRoute generates the correct path by itself.\r\n\r\n### What does the proposed API look like?\r\nI'm not sure, as this could be handled multiple ways. At first I thought about making the base (HomeBase) route a named route and routing to that instead of the default child route, but VueRouter then explicitly doesn't render the children (\"Named Route has a default child route. When navigating to this named route, the default child route will not be rendered. Remove the name from this route and use the name of the default child route for named links instead.\"). One way would be to have this functionality be configurable.\r\n\r\nAnother way would be to set some sort of param on a child route so that its path is always appended on top of the parent path, without the path separator being added inbetween.\r\n\r\n<!-- generated by vue-issues.

This means that currently a Nuxt.js app will include two copies of that function, one from vue-router and one from Nuxt.js itself which increases the bundle size needlessly.\r\n\r\nAnother solution for the above could be that `vue-router` would expose the path-to-regexp methods like `tokensToFunction` method so Nuxt.js can use those, but using dependencies has more benefits ofc like quicker delivery of patches for `path-to-regexp`.\r\n\r\n### What does the proposed API look like?\r\nRevert: 76d83b6eb4af507763c5ee6f61a52ed9a7804572\r\n\r\n<!-- generated by vue-issues.
