This PR includes a minor change to line https://github.com/angular/angular/blob/master/packages/bazel/src/ng_module.bzl#L272 which should resolve the g3 issue:\r\n\r\n```\r\nERROR: /third_party/javascript/angular2/BUILD:150:1: output 'third_party/javascript/angular2/core_ngc_messages.xmb' was not created\r\nERROR: /third_party/javascript/angular2/BUILD:150:1: not all outputs were created or valid\r\nTarget //javascript/angular2/tools/ngc/e2e:message_extraction_test failed to build\r\n```\r\n\r\n* Updates to Bazel 0.27.0 and makes compatibility fixes.\r\n* Updates to rules_nodejs 0.32.2 and makes compatibility fixes for breaking changes since 0.31.x\r\n* Turns on symlinked node_modules finally as 0.32.2 fixes rules_nodejs#802\r\n* Fixes worker mode issue with ts_library (yeay) -- ts_library workers should be turned back on\r\n* Improves how ts_library consumes @types npm packages\r\n***See 0.32.2 release notes for more info: https://github.com/bazelbuild/rules_nodejs/releases/tag/0.32.2***\r\n\r\n## rules_nodejs 0.32.0 compat fixes\r\n\r\n@npm//node_modules/foobar:foobar.js labels changed to @npm//:node_modules/foobar/foobar.js with fix for bazelbuild/rules_nodejs#802\r\n\r\n## Bazel 0.27.0 compat fixes\r\n\r\nctx.new_file is deprecated and ctx.actions.declare_file should be used in Bazel 0.27.0. Error seen here is:\r\n```\r\n        File \"ng_module.bzl\", line 272, in _expected_outs\r\n                ctx.new_file(ctx.genfiles_dir, (ctx.label.name ...\"))\r\nUse ctx.actions.declare_file instead of ctx.new_file.\r\nUse --incompatible_new_actions_api=false to temporarily disable this check.\r\n```\r\nThis can be worked around with incompatible_new_actions_api flag but may as well fix it proper so downstream doesn't require this flag due to this code.\r\n\r\nAlso, depset() is no longer iterable by default without a flag. This required fixing in a few spots in @angular/bazel.\r\n\r\n## PR Checklist\r\nPlease check if your PR fulfills the following requirements:\r\n\r\n- [x] The commit message follows our guidelines: https://github.com/angular/angular/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md#commit\r\n- [ ] Tests for the changes have been added (for bug fixes / features)\r\n- [ ] Docs have been added / updated (for bug fixes / features)\r\n\r\n\r\n## PR Type\r\nWhat kind of change does this PR introduce?\r\n\r\n<!-- Please check the one that applies to this PR using \"x\". -->\r\n\r\n- [ ] Bugfix\r\n- [ ] Feature\r\n- [ ] Code style update (formatting, local variables)\r\n- [x] Refactoring (no functional changes, no api changes)\r\n- [ ] Build related changes\r\n- [ ] CI related changes\r\n- [ ] Documentation content changes\r\n- [ ] angular.io application / infrastructure changes\r\n- [ ] Other...

I think documentation improvements could help users to handle this better, but it really seems to me to be more of a design flaw in the service injection framework. From a coding perspective, I'm not really sure what could be done to improve it, but there may well be a good solution that I've been unable to think of.\r\n\r\nMuch of this problem has already been touched on by a couple of other github issues:\r\n- https://github.com/angular/angular-cli/issues/10170\r\n- https://github.com/angular/angular/issues/25784\r\n\r\n## The Current Situation ##\r\nPrior to Angular 6, services were generally configured for injection by decorating the service's containing NgModule as follows:\r\n```\r\n@NgModule({\r\n    providers: [MyService]\r\n})\r\nexport class MyServiceModule {\r\n```\r\nBut since Angular 6, users have been encouraged to configure services as follows instead:\r\n```\r\n@Injectable({\r\n    providedIn: 'root'\r\n})\r\nexport class MyService {\r\n```\r\n\r\nThe new approach has 2 advantages, namely:\r\n1.  It enables tree-shaking of unused services - since they no longer have to be included in the `providers` array of an NgModule.\r\n2.  It ensures that only one instance of the service will ever exist - _even if the service is consumed by multiple, lazy-loaded modules_\r\n\r\nI think it's worth noting however, that:\r\n1.  Tree-shaking of services is only really necessary when writing a third party library. When writing an _application_ it is pretty unlikely that you would include - except perhaps by accident - a service which you weren't intending to use somewhere.\r\n2.  Service duplication can be avoided anyway by taking appropriate care when lazy-loading modules - although the new approach _is_ safer in this respect.\r\n\r\nThe new approach also has one very important implication though, which I don't think is made sufficiently clear in the documentation, and which in turn can lead to confusing dependency issues when both approaches are used within the same application (or across different libraries which are consumed by that application):\r\n\r\n## Service \"Ownership\" ##\r\nIf `MyService` is configured for injection using the `@NgModule` `providers` decoration, the service can rightly be considered to \"belong\" to that NgModule. It is also therefore that module's responsibility to make sure that it imports any other NgModules which provide services that `MyService` depends on.\r\n\r\nIf `MyService` is configured using the `@Injectable`, `providedIn: 'root'` syntax though, the service no longer really \"belongs\" anywhere. It might be co-located with a particular NgModule on the file system, but it has no relationship to it - it doesn't know about the module, and the module doesn't know about the service. This may not be immediately obvious to developers.\r\n\r\nBecause there is no longer an \"owning\" NgModule, the `MyService` class will now just be bundled with whatever consumes it, and it is then the _consumer's_ responsibility to ensure that the service's dependencies - i.e. any services which are injected into it - are available. This is fine if all _those_ services have also been configured with `providedIn: 'root'` (and also all of _their_ dependencies, etc.). It becomes more complicated though, in a scenario where interdependencies exist between services that have been configured in different ways - as can easily happen when using third party libraries, or even when consuming built-in Angular services that have been configured via the old-style `providers` array.\r\n\r\n## Problem Example ###\r\nConsider the following scenario:\r\n\r\n1.  `MyComponent` is in `MyComponentModule` and consumes `MyService` which has been decorated with `providedIn: 'root'`. `MyService` is \"in\" (but not really - it is just co-located with) `MyServiceModule`.\r\n2.  `MyService` consumes `ThirdPartyService` _which hasn't been similarly decorated_. Instead, `ThirdPartyService` has been provided via the `providers` array in `ThirdPartyServiceModule`.\r\n3. `MyServiceModule` imports `ThirdPartyServiceModule`, but as it turns out this is incidental, because _`MyService` doesn't really belong to `MyServiceModule`_\r\n\r\nThe code fails at run time, when it attempts to instantiate `MyService` for injection into `MyComponent` with:\r\n```\r\nNullInjectorError: No provider for ThirdPartyService!\r\n```\r\n\r\nThis is because `MyComponentModule` has not imported `ThirdPartyServiceModule`, but this is not very obvious to the developer. It doesn't seem very logical (to me anyway) that `MyComponentModule` should have to care about `MyService`'s dependencies (or perhaps even its dependencies' dependencies), just because of the different ways in which these services have been configured.\r\n\r\nAs I say, I don't really know what the best way is to fix this - apart from perhaps making the implications of all this a little clearer in the documentation. The cat is now somewhat out of the bag regarding the (now not-so-)new `providedIn: 'root'` syntax and at the moment I can't think of a way to make these 2 different approaches play nicely with each other.","Url":"https://github.com/angular/angular/issues/31309","RelatedDescription":"Open issue \"Different approaches to service injection don't play well together\" (#31309)"},{"Id":"461516571","IsPullRequest":false,"CreatedAt":"2019-06-27T12:21:57","Actor":"vthinkxie","Number":"31310","RawContent":null,"Title":"bazel should support less ","State":"open","Body":"# üöÄ Feature request\r\n\r\n\r\n### Command (mark with an `x`)\r\n<!-- Can you pin-point the command or commands that are relevant for this feature request? -->\r\n<!-- ‚úçÔ∏èedit: -->\r\n```\r\n- [x] new\r\n- [x] build\r\n- [x] serve\r\n- [ ] test\r\n- [ ] e2e\r\n- [ ] generate\r\n- [ ] add\r\n- [ ] update\r\n- [ ] lint\r\n- [ ] xi18n\r\n- [ ] run\r\n- [ ] config\r\n- [ ] help\r\n- [ ] version\r\n- [ ] doc\r\n```\r\n\r\n### Description\r\n\r\nAngular or Angular CLI should support less loader\r\n\r\n### Describe the solution you'd like\r\n\r\nAngular CLI support ng new with bazel and `less loader` before `@angular/cli@8.0.3`\r\nbut there is a bug https://github.com/angular/angular/issues/31209\r\n\r\nThe less option was removed after `8.1.0-rc.0` with https://github.com/angular/angular/pull/31234\r\n\r\nAngular CLI should support `less` when run\r\n\r\n`ng new --collection=@angular/bazel`\r\n\r\n### Describe alternatives you've considered\r\n\r\nAngular CLI should support `less` option with bazel\r\n","Url":"https://github.com/angular/angular/issues/31310","RelatedDescription":"Open issue \"bazel should support less \" (#31310)"},{"Id":"461445762","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2019-06-27T10:20:21","Actor":"gkalpak","Number":"31308","RawContent":null,"Title":"build(docs-infra): upgrade cli command docs sources to 823731f6e","State":"open","Body":"Updating [angular#8.1.x](https://github.com/angular/angular/tree/8.1.x) from [cli-builds#8.0.x](https://github.com/angular/cli-builds/tree/8.0.x).\n\n##\nRelevant changes in [commit range](https://github.com/angular/cli-builds/compare/01a7186bb...823731f6e):\n\n**Modified**\n- help/analytics.json\n- help/build.json\n- help/e2e.json\n- help/generate.json\n- help/new.json\n- help/serve.json\n- help/test.json\n- help/update.json\n- help/xi18n.json\n\n##","Url":"https://github.com/angular/angular/pull/31308","RelatedDescription":"Open PR \"build(docs-infra): upgrade cli command docs sources to 823731f6e\" (#31308)"},{"Id":"461442384","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2019-06-27T10:12:50","Actor":"pkozlowski-opensource","Number":"31306","RawContent":null,"Title":"fix(ivy): properly handle re-projection with an empty set of nodes to re-project","State":"open","Body":"","Url":"https://github.com/angular/angular/pull/31306","RelatedDescription":"Open PR \"fix(ivy): properly handle re-projection with an empty set of nodes to re-project\" (#31306)"},{"Id":"461426662","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2019-06-27T09:41:42","Actor":"ukyo","Number":"31305","RawContent":null,"Title":"docs: fix cli builder doc","State":"open","Body":"## PR Checklist\r\nPlease check if your PR fulfills the following requirements:\r\n\r\n- [x] The commit message follows our guidelines: https://github.com/angular/angular/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md#commit\r\n- [ ] Tests for the changes have been added (for bug fixes / features)\r\n- [x] Docs have been added / updated (for bug fixes / features)\r\n\r\n\r\n## PR Type\r\nWhat kind of change does this PR introduce?\r\n\r\n<!-- Please check the one that applies to this PR using \"x\". -->\r\n\r\n- [ ] Bugfix\r\n- [ ] Feature\r\n- [ ] Code style update (formatting, local variables)\r\n- [ ] Refactoring (no functional changes, no api changes)\r\n- [ ] Build related changes\r\n- [ ] CI related changes\r\n- [x] Documentation content changes\r\n- [ ] angular.io application / infrastructure changes\r\n- [ ] Other...

I'm dumping the key points of that discussion here for future reference and discussion.\r\n\r\n# üöÄ feature request\r\n\r\n### Relevant Package\r\n\r\nFor @angular/compiler-cli, `Ngtsc` indexer module.\r\n\r\n### Description\r\n\r\nThe compiler's indexing module does not currently support indexing HTML elements in templates. We want to add support for that. Initially, the scope of this was\r\n\r\n- Record element selectors used in the template\r\n- Record used directives in the template\r\n\r\nsuch that an indexer could link an element selector to the directive it references, if any. This approach is quite limiting, however, because directive selectors can match on many things beside element selectors, including matching on attributes and implicitly matching on the absence of an attribute. A better approach is\r\n\r\n- Record element selectors used in the template\r\n  - each selector record also includes a record of attributes on the element\r\n  - each selector record also includes a record of used directives on the element\r\n\r\nTo consider the usefulness of this, consider a template like `<my-comp applied-dir>` that uses the directives `MyComp`, `AppliedDir`, and an implicitly loaded directive `ImplicitDir`. The compiler's indexer module will index the template and record an element identifier that looks something like\r\n\r\n```typescript\r\n{\r\n  name: 'my-comp',\r\n  span: ...,\r\n  attributes: [ { name: 'applied-dir', span: ... } ],\r\n  usedDirectives: [ MyComp, AppliedDir, ImplicitDir ],\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nA source code indexer implementation can then use this information to generate useful references, like xreferencing `my-comp` to the `MyComp` class declaration, `applied-dir` to the `AppliedDir` class declaration, and adding an implicit reference of all three used directives on `my-comp`.\r\n\r\n### Alternatives\r\n\r\n- Do not record attributes separately; pass the entire element tag source code as the element identifier name instead.\r\n  - __advantages__: less work for the compiler's indexing module.\r\n  - __disadvantages__: an indexer implementation now has to write an HTML parser to discern attributes on the element.\r\n- Perform the linking of attributes to the directives that match it in the compiler.\r\n  - __advantages__: less work for an indexer implementation\r\n  - __disadvantages__: directives are applied to an element, not an attribute, so such an implementation would be needlessly complicated. Furthermore, it is not necessarily the job of the compiler's semantic analysis API to make decisions about what spans of text reference one another, especially in ambiguous cases like the one presented here - that should be on the indexer implementation.","Url":"https://github.com/angular/angular/issues/31299","RelatedDescription":"Open issue \"Add support for indexing templates\" (#31299)"},{"Id":"461137886","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2019-06-26T20:33:39","Actor":"josephperrott","Number":"31297","RawContent":null,"Title":"ci: target default pool for linux RBE executions","State":"closed","Body":"As part of setting up configuration for windows RBE, our current RBE setup must target the linux pool directly, which is current named `default`.

And legacy browsers like IE11 don't have it. So, its polyfill is necessary.\r\n\r\nCLI v7 used core-js v2 and its `core-js/es6/symbol` contains `Symbol.iterator` support.\r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/angular/angular-cli/blob/7.3.x/packages/angular_devkit/build_angular/src/angular-cli-files/models/es2015-polyfills.js\r\n\r\nSince core-js v3, `Symbol.iterator` has been seperated from `Symbol` itself.\r\n\r\n- https://github.com/zloirock/core-js/blob/v3.1.4/packages/core-js/modules/es.symbol.js\r\n- https://github.com/zloirock/core-js/blob/v3.1.4/packages/core-js/modules/es.symbol.iterator.js\r\n\r\nBecause of that, to support IE11 Angular CLI should include `es.symbol.iterator.js` in `es5-polyfills`.

regression?\r\n\r\n<!-- Did this behavior use to work in the previous version? -->\r\n\r\nNot sure. Possibly a regression caused by the new builders API.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Description\r\n\r\nTSLint provides control on the rules' severity. The severity could be `warn`/`error`. Currently the CLI always exits with code 1 if there are linting errors found in the project.\r\n\r\n## üî¨ Minimal Reproduction\r\n<!--\r\nSimple steps to reproduce this bug.\r\n\r\nPlease include: commands run (including args), packages added, related code changes.\r\n\r\nIf reproduction steps are not enough for reproduction of your issue, please create a minimal GitHub repository with the reproduction of the issue. \r\nA good way to make a minimal reproduction is to create a new app via `ng new repro-app` and add the minimum possible code to show the problem. \r\nShare the link to the repo below along with step-by-step instructions to reproduce the problem, as well as expected and actual behavior.\r\n\r\nIssues that don't have enough info and can't be reproduced will be closed.\r\n\r\nYou can read more about issue submission guidelines here: https://github.com/angular/angular-cli/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md#-submitting-an-issue\r\n-->\r\n\r\n1. In a project introduce a linting error.\r\n1. Run `ng lint`\r\n1. `echo $?`\r\n1. Update the rule severity to `error`\r\n1. Run `ng lint` again\r\n1. `echo $?`\r\n\r\nIn both cases the output will be 1.\r\n\r\n## üåç Your Environment\r\n\r\n^8.0.0\r\n","Url":"https://github.com/angular/angular-cli/issues/14914","RelatedDescription":"Closed issue \"CLI lint builder ignores tslint severity setting\" (#14914)"},{"Id":"461207881","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2019-06-26T22:23:00","Actor":"hansl","Number":"14913","RawContent":null,"Title":"fix(@angular/cli): pass in metrics to the pageview for commands","State":"open","Body":"We might want to pass those later.","Url":"https://github.com/angular/angular-cli/pull/14913","RelatedDescription":"Open PR \"fix(@angular/cli): pass in metrics to the pageview for commands\" (#14913)"},{"Id":"461126133","IsPullRequest":false,"CreatedAt":"2019-06-26T18:47:15","Actor":"cedx","Number":"14910","RawContent":null,"Title":"TypeError : meta is undefined, @angular-devkit/build-angular: 0.800.3 => 0.800.4 ","State":"open","Body":"# üêû Bug report\r\n\r\n### Command (mark with an `x`)\r\n\r\n```\r\n- [ ] new\r\n- [ ] build\r\n- [ ] serve\r\n- [x] test\r\n- [ ] e2e\r\n- [ ] generate\r\n- [ ] add\r\n- [ ] update\r\n- [ ] lint\r\n- [ ] xi18n\r\n- [ ] run\r\n- [ ] config\r\n- [ ] help\r\n- [ ] version\r\n- [ ] doc\r\n```\r\n\r\n### Is this a regression?\r\nYes, the previous version in which this bug was not present was:\r\n`@angular-devkit/build-angular: 0.800.3`\r\n\r\n\r\n### Description\r\nThis project : https://github.com/cedx/ngx-core.js\r\nhas tests that worked fine until I upgraded `@angular-devkit/build-angular` to version 0.800.4 (i.e. if I revert this package, and only this package, to version 0.800.3, everything is OK).\r\n\r\n\r\n## üî¨ Minimal Reproduction\r\nI have absolutely no idea how to reproduce this bug.

It forces the main display at 60hz.\r\n\r\nIt was not reproduced by me because I don't have multiple monitors but was reported by users multiple times with the same monitor configurations.\r\n\r\nThe problem was fixed by switching the animation mode from 'buffer' to 'determinate'.

The fact that there's that pretty animation scrolling on the bottom forces the display to update at 60hz, which, through the power of the magnificent DWM that can't handle this in 2019, forces the main display at 60hz and with massive stutters. Switching to a different tab in the browser fixes this.\r\n```\r\n```\r\nthis is gonna sound weird, but when i had the tab with the site open just now on my secondary monitor and waiting for a trade to pop, it really killed the performance of my game client. like it was forcing a vsync ingame or something, very noticeably choppy. it could be just a one off thing i dont know, just bringing it up in case anyone else gets that and can confirm/deny. my primary monitor is 144hz, secondary is 60hz.\r\ni could just need a pc restart. my pc acts weird sometimes when i wake it from sleep and just go about doing my normal stuff\r\n```\r\n\r\n#### Environment\r\n\r\n- Angular: 8.0.0\r\n- CDK/Material: 8.0.0\r\n- Browser(s): Google Chrome\r\n- Operating System (e.g. Windows, macOS, Ubuntu): Windows 10\r\n","Url":"https://github.com/angular/components/issues/16389","RelatedDescription":"Open issue \"Performance degradation when using an animated progress bar with multiple monitors\" (#16389)"},{"Id":"460739515","IsPullRequest":false,"CreatedAt":"2019-06-26T03:19:03","Actor":"Crazyang","Number":"16388","RawContent":null,"Title":"About expend panel animation ","State":"open","Body":"#### Feature Description\r\n\r\n\r\nCould you give me an interface to set animation time\r\n\r\n#### Use Case\r\n\r\nSome time I need animation go fast or slow\r\n","Url":"https://github.com/angular/components/issues/16388","RelatedDescription":"Open issue \"About expend panel animation \" (#16388)"},{"Id":"460677136","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2019-06-25T22:38:41","Actor":"jelbourn","Number":"16386","RawContent":null,"Title":"chore: fix new typescript errors with 3.5","State":"open","Body":"Google's TypeScript team is flushing out errors for 3.5.
