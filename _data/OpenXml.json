If further fixes many (but not all) issues flagged by\r\nstatic code analysis.\r\n\r\nFor easier reference, the existing `WmlComparer` class is temporarily retained in the `OpenXmlPowerTools.Previous` namespace. For organizational purposes, the refactored version is stored in the`Comparer` folder, which does however not create a namespace.\r\n\r\nThe objective of this commit is to not create breaking changes. The one exception is the removal of the internal `WmlComparer.Coalesce` method, which was only invoked in one unit test. This is deemed a left-over from previous rewrites and is thus removed. The unit test is commented\r\nout for now.\r\n\r\nThis pull request essentially prepares the `WmlComparer` for future enhancements."},{"Id":"8354079435","Type":"IssuesEvent","CreatedAt":"2018-10-02T12:16:45","Actor":"DiplIngAndreasScholz","Repository":"OfficeDev/Open-Xml-PowerTools","Organization":"OfficeDev","RawContent":null,"RelatedAction":"opened","RelatedUrl":"https://github.com/OfficeDev/Open-Xml-PowerTools/issues/254","RelatedDescription":"Opened issue \"Converting ordered/unordered lists\" (#254) at OfficeDev/Open-Xml-PowerTools","RelatedBody":"When converting an ordered list to word using ConvertHtmlToWml output is always an unordered list.\r\nInput: \r\n<html xml:space=\"preserve\" xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\">   <ol>     <li>   ordered list</li>     <li>zwei</li>   </ol>   <ul>     <li>unordered list</li>     <li>bullet</li>   </ul> </html>\r\n\r\nOutput:\r\n•\tordered list\r\n•\tzwei\r\n•\tunordered list\r\n•\tbullet\r\n"},{"Id":"8303257049","Type":"IssuesEvent","CreatedAt":"2018-09-21T16:55:57","Actor":"jureles","Repository":"OfficeDev/Open-Xml-PowerTools","Organization":"OfficeDev","RawContent":null,"RelatedAction":"opened","RelatedUrl":"https://github.com/OfficeDev/Open-Xml-PowerTools/issues/253","RelatedDescription":"Opened issue \"HtmlToWmlCssParser.cs Parsing Error\" (#253) at OfficeDev/Open-Xml-PowerTools","RelatedBody":"Hi,\r\n\r\nThere is a CSS parsing error that occurs in HtmlToWmlCssParser.cs.\r\n\r\nThe CSS parser throws an exception for the following CSS style:\r\n`border: solid red .5pt`\r\n\r\nOn the other side the following CSS style string is properly parsed:\r\n`border: solid red 0.5pt`\r\n\r\nI would try to  fix this myself, but I haven't seen any grammar file in the project where I could fix this.
