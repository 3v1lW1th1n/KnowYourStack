This configuration seems like it should be valid. The only workaround I could find was to use an absolute path, e.g.\r\n\r\n```\r\n{ path: 'test', pathMatch: 'full', redirectTo: '/test/(test:default)' },\r\n```\r\n\r\n## üî¨ Minimal Reproduction\r\n\r\nhttps://stackblitz.com/edit/angular-issue-repro2-fikqg2\r\n\r\n\r\n## üî• Exception or Error\r\n<pre><code>\r\nError: Invalid configuration of route 'test/': a componentless route without children or loadChildren cannot have a named outlet set\r\n</code></pre>\r\n\r\n\r\n## üåç  Your Environment\r\n\r\n**Angular Version:**\r\n<pre><code>\r\n     _                      _                 ____ _     ___\r\n    / \\   _ __   __ _ _   _| | __ _ _ __     / ___| |   |_ _|\r\n   / ‚ñ≥ \\ | '_ \\ / _` | | | | |/ _` | '__|   | |   | |    | |\r\n  / ___ \\| | | | (_| | |_| | | (_| | |      | |___| |___ | |\r\n /_/   \\_\\_| |_|\\__, |\\__,_|_|\\__,_|_|       \\____|_____|___|\r\n                |___/\r\n\r\n\r\nAngular CLI: 8.3.17\r\nNode: 12.4.0\r\nOS: darwin x64\r\nAngular: 8.2.13\r\n... animations, common, compiler, compiler-cli, core, forms\r\n... language-service, platform-browser, platform-browser-dynamic\r\n... router\r\n\r\nPackage                         Version\r\n---------------------------------------------------------\r\n@angular-devkit/architect       <error>\r\n@angular-devkit/build-angular   0.802.2\r\n@angular-devkit/core            <error>\r\n@angular-devkit/schematics      <error>\r\n@angular/cdk                    7.3.7\r\n@angular/cli                    8.3.17\r\n@angular/material               7.3.7\r\n@schematics/angular             <error>\r\n@schematics/update              <error>\r\nrxjs                            6.5.3\r\ntypescript                      3.5.3\r\nwebpack                         4.38.0\r\n</code></pre>\r\n\r\n**Anything else relevant?**\r\nNope.","Url":"https://github.com/angular/angular/issues/33783","RelatedDescription":"Open issue \"unable to create a redirect for named outlet\" (#33783)"},{"Id":"521905429","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2019-11-13T01:46:06","Actor":"kyliau","Number":"33782","RawContent":null,"Title":"fix(language-service): Function alias should be callable","State":"open","Body":"This commit fixes a long standing bug whereby a template variable that\r\ngets initialized to a class method gets resolved to the Any type, thus\r\nwhen it is called the language service produces error \"Member X is not\r\ncallable\".\r\n\r\nPR closes #16643\r\nPR closes angular/vscode-ng-language-service#234\r\n\r\n## PR Checklist\r\nPlease check if your PR fulfills the following requirements:\r\n\r\n- [x] The commit message follows our guidelines: https://github.com/angular/angular/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md#commit\r\n- [x] Tests for the changes have been added (for bug fixes / features)\r\n- [ ] Docs have been added / updated (for bug fixes / features)\r\n\r\n\r\n## PR Type\r\nWhat kind of change does this PR introduce?\r\n\r\n<!-- Please check the one that applies to this PR using \"x\". -->\r\n\r\n- [x] Bugfix\r\n- [ ] Feature\r\n- [ ] Code style update (formatting, local variables)\r\n- [ ] Refactoring (no functional changes, no api changes)\r\n- [ ] Build related changes\r\n- [ ] CI related changes\r\n- [ ] Documentation content changes\r\n- [ ] angular.io application / infrastructure changes\r\n- [ ] Other...

So the Chrome team created a babel preset for getting more compact modern JavaScript.\r\n\r\nPlease see more https://github.com/babel/preset-modules#how-does-it-work. \r\n\r\nI guess that idea can help also Angular CLI's build process. Generate original bundles for browsers that support ES Modules, and down-leveling it for legacy browsers.\r\n\r\nI'm not sure how we can achieve it with TypeScript-based toolchain, but I hope it isn't impossible.\r\n\r\n","Url":"https://github.com/angular/angular-cli/issues/16170","RelatedDescription":"Open issue \"Proposal: More intelligent transpilation for Differential Loading\" (#16170)"},{"Id":"521865786","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2019-11-12T23:38:24","Actor":"dgp1130","Number":"16169","RawContent":null,"Title":"fix(@angular-devkit/build-webpack): rewrite ES5 polyfills file name","State":"open","Body":"The asset name is incorrect because the file is renamed after generation by Webpack, so the stats file contains a broken link.
