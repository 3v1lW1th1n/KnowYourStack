On Vue 2.6.11 the action of collapse didn't have animation and didn't trigger the transitionend event. But it can work when adding a `setTimeout` inside the `$nextTick` callback. So I assumed that is because the class didn't finish binding after the `$nextTick`.\r\n\r\n### What is expected?\r\nIt should react in the same way between the different version of Vue.\r\n\r\n### What is actually happening?\r\nFor this repo's example, Vue 2.5.1 is working fine, Vue 2.6.11 is not.\r\n\r\n<!-- generated by vue-issues.

While `beforeRouteUpdate` and `beforeRouteLeave` could get such access through `this.$router` and `this.$options`, it seems not way to achieve it in `beforeRouteEnter`. Importing router instance (similar to store import suggestion [here](https://github.com/vuejs/vue-router/issues/2118#issuecomment-484037415)) is not an option for us because we have shared set of router components, which are re-used in different vue applications, so there is no single place to import it from.\r\n\r\n### Use case\r\n\r\nI'm trying to create generic plugin for our applications which will define hook to pre-load data. In some component data pre-load will happen via vuex store, so it should be accessible in this hook.\r\n\r\nHere is simplified code for the plugin:\r\n```js\r\nexport default function install(Vue) {\r\n  Vue.mixin({\r\n    async beforeRouterEnter(to, from, next) {\r\n      if (componentOptions.preloadData) {\r\n        try {\r\n          const nextCallback = componentOptions.preloadData.call(null, router.app.$store);\r\n          next(nextCallback);\r\n        } catch (error) {\r\n          // Custom error for a generic error handler\r\n          next(new DataPreloadError(error));\r\n        }\r\n      } else {\r\n        next();\r\n      }\r\n    },\r\n  });\r\n};\r\n```\r\n\r\nThis plugin will make it possible to define custom `preloadData() { ... }` component option for a generic data pre-load as part of routing process. The only missing  references to make it work are `componentOptions` and `router`.\r\n\r\nNote that it is possible to provide `router` access in this particular example by passing it as plugin argument – `export default function install(Vue, router) { ... }`. However, it might be still beneficial to have access to router in the `beforeRouteEnter` guard, as it will be a solution for #3157.\r\n\r\n### What does the proposed API look like?\r\nProposal is to add additional `guardContext` argument to the guard function:\r\n```js\r\nbeforeRouteEnter(to, from, next, context) {\r\n // where context is { router: ..., componentOptions: ... }\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nHowever if it should be implemented in different way – would be great to hear it.\r\n\r\n<!-- generated by vue-issues.

Also there is optional `onComplete` callback for `router.push`, but there is no way to set it from `<router-link>`.\r\nNavigation with error (because of JS error in one of the guards or hooks) can be catched in global `onError` hook. Also there is optional `onAbort` callback for `router.push` (which will be called for both navigation with error and aborted navigation), but there is no way to set it from `<router-link>`.\r\nWhen it comes to aborted navigations, the only place where it can be catched – `onAbort` callback for `router.push`. However, as mentioned before, it is not possible to set it from `<router-link>`. Moreover, there is no global hook to catch aborted navigations at all.\r\n\r\n### Use case\r\n\r\nIn our application we would like to simply display loading indicator in the root App component while navigation is in progress. Also, we would like to have this functionality be generic, so it can be applied to different applications. The easiest way to achieve it is by creating separate ES module like this `navigation-state-plugin.js`:\r\n``` js\r\nimport Vue from 'vue';\r\n\r\nexport const state = Vue.observable({ navigating: false });\r\n\r\nexport default router => {\r\n  // When navigation initiated – update state and proceed\r\n  router.beforeEach((to, from, next) {\r\n    state.navigating = true;\r\n    next();\r\n  });\r\n\r\n  // When navigation successfully finished – update state accordingly\r\n  router.afterEach(() => {\r\n    state.navigating = false;\r\n  });\r\n\r\n  // When navigation failed –also update state\r\n  router.onError(error => {\r\n    state.navigating = false;\r\n  });\r\n};\r\n```\r\n\r\nIn this way in can be applied in the `main.js`:\r\n```js\r\nimport VueRouter from 'vue-router';\r\nimport applyPlugin from './navigation-state-plugin.js`;\r\n\r\n// do other initializations\r\n\r\nconst router = new VueRouter(...);\r\napplyPlugin(router);\r\n\r\n// init application\r\n```\r\n\r\nAlso state from this file can be imported in App.vue and used to display loading indicator when `state.navigating` is `true`.\r\n\r\nHowever, when navigation is aborted there is no way to track it in a global manner, which leads to loading indicator to stay visible on a screen.\r\n\r\nAs possible solution, [it was suggested](https://github.com/vuejs/vue-router/issues/3027#issuecomment-599474646) to _\"use `router.push` or the v-slot api and get the promise returned from `navigate`\"_ (which is currently not available because #3042 has no PR). However this solution would require to create wrappers around vue-router API, which should always be used throughout entire application instead of native `vue-router` api. Even though it is easy to do for `router.push`, it is cumbersome to do for `<router-link>` because wrapper should be able to support the same rendering scenarios (without slot content, with slot content, with scoped slot content, etc.)\r\nIt is also not suitable for us, because we have shared set of router components, which are re-used in different vue applications. And not all applications will have `navigation-state-plugin.js`. So we need to have possibility to use native `router.push` and `<router-link>` with an option to globally manage navigation state.\r\n\r\n### What does the proposed API look like?\r\nMost obvious would be to introduce global `onAbort` hook:\r\n```js\r\n  router.onAbort(function callback(abortedRoute, reason) { ... });\r\n```\r\nwhere `reason` can be one of the errors from #3047\r\n\r\nIt may be possible to call existing `onError` or `afterEach` hooks also for aborted navigations, but that would be a breaking change, and probably would make API more confusing.\r\n\r\n<!-- generated by vue-issues.

The check in push state wheter push state can be used, checks for `window.history && 'pushState' in window.history`, but office.js resets the fields on window.history, not window.history itself (see https://stackoverflow.com/a/42703406/).

It is impossible to clean up its popstate listener.\r\n\r\n#### Basepath bug\r\n\r\nIf you have multiple vue applications, each using vue-router, they must all share the same base path, even if you ensure only one of them is active at a time by destroying / remounting when navigating between them. Otherwise they will all attempt to ensure that every route starts with their base path.\r\n\r\nSame goes for if you have one vue-router and one react-router. The vue-router will force all urls to start with its base path within the react-owned pages, even if you have destroyed the vue application before navigating to the react application.\r\n\r\n### What is expected?\r\nI think the best solution is to call `window.addEventListener('popstate', handler)` when `const intance = new Vue({router})` is called, instead of when `new VueRouter()` is called. And then call `window.removeEventListener('popstate', handler)` when `instance.$destroy()` is called.\r\n\r\nAlternatively, it could be cleaned up like so:\r\n\r\n```js\r\n// Alternative solution (not my preferred one, but works)\r\n\r\nconst router = new VueRouter({...})\r\n// later, to clean up event listeners:\r\nrouter.detach()\r\n// later, to reattach event listeners\r\nrouter.attach()\r\n```\r\n\r\n### What is actually happening?\r\nwindow.addEventListener is called during `new VueRouter()`, and there is no way to ever remove that event listener.\r\n\r\n---\r\nSee related https://github.com/single-spa/single-spa/issues/488. I am a maintainer of single-spa, which has dozens of organizations using one or more instances of vue-router. For us, cleaning up the event listener when the application is unmounted is important to being able to have isolated apps on the same page.\r\n\r\n<!-- generated by vue-issues.

of reasons. \r\n\r\n1. bad readability\r\n2. magic strings are hard to maintain and refactor\r\n3. can't navigate to the source in the IDE\r\n\r\nI think it would be nice to access the module directly.\r\n\r\n### What does the proposed API look like?\r\n\r\n```js\r\nconst cart = {\r\n  actions: {\r\n    checkout ({ commit, state }, products) {\r\n    }\r\n  }\r\n}\r\n```\r\nto dispatch checkout action, you can call the method directly.\r\n\r\n```js\r\n$store.cart.actions.checkout(products)\r\n```\r\n\r\nI made a simple plugin [vuex-help](https://github.com/shredmaster/vuex-help) to
