This PR addresses a few important points:\r\n\r\n1. `next` in `beforeRouteEnter` and `beforeRouteUpdate` behaves the same.\r\n\r\n2. When `router-view` has a key, you can now access the new `vm` from `next`, making it possible to update the new component. Example:\r\n\r\n\t* Before: http://jsfiddle.net/thatguystone/6zv7gtt9/\r\n\t* After: http://plnkr.co/edit/C6iAdPENh47sQAhQgr0S?p=preview\r\n\r\n3. All callbacks added by `next(cb)` are called after navigation has finished, ensuring that torn updates don't happen. Example:\r\n\r\n\t* Before: http://jsfiddle.net/thatguystone/7wLkmk2h/\r\n\t* After: http://plnkr.co/edit/tlytSymlu3768PuqrslZ?p=preview"}],"ResultType":"GitHubEvent"},"Vuex":{"Events":[{"Id":"7222174822","Type":"PullRequestEvent","CreatedAt":"2018-02-09T10:57:54","Actor":"ktsn","Repository":"vuejs/vuex","Organization":"vuejs","RawContent":null,"RelatedAction":"closed","RelatedUrl":"https://github.com/vuejs/vuex/pull/1155","RelatedDescription":"Closed pull request \"Update index.js\" (#1155) at vuejs/vuex","RelatedBody":"added a question."},{"Id":"7222154483","Type":"PullRequestEvent","CreatedAt":"2018-02-09T10:53:22","Actor":"whthT","Repository":"vuejs/vuex","Organization":"vuejs","RawContent":null,"RelatedAction":"opened","RelatedUrl":"https://github.com/vuejs/vuex/pull/1155","RelatedDescription":"Opened pull request \"Update index.js\" (#1155) at vuejs/vuex","RelatedBody":"added a question."},{"Id":"7222120604","Type":"IssuesEvent","CreatedAt":"2018-02-09T10:45:51","Actor":"moeinroid","Repository":"vuejs/vuex","Organization":"vuejs","RawContent":null,"RelatedAction":"opened","RelatedUrl":"https://github.com/vuejs/vuex/issues/1154","RelatedDescription":"Opened issue \"State not changes in UI component after commit\" (#1154) at vuejs/vuex","RelatedBody":"### Version\r\n3.0.1\r\n\r\n### Reproduction link\r\n[https://gist.github.com/moeinroid/3743a5814e8b172e91ef40be830f4be1](https://gist.github.com/moeinroid/3743a5814e8b172e91ef40be830f4be1)\r\n\r\n### Steps to reproduce\r\nI'm using vuejs with vue-router and vuex.\r\nI have a module with state, actions and mutations.
