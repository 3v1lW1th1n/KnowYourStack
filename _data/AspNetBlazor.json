Support for type inference of usage of generic-typed components is coming next.\r\n\r\nYou can define type parameters on a component with the new `@typeparam` directive. There is currently no support for type constraints when defining generic-typed components from Razor.\r\n\r\nIf you are defining a component from C# then everything should 'just work' the way you'd expect.\r\n\r\nMost of the work and tricky cases are related to making it possible to consume generic-typed components in generated code.\r\n\r\n## How does it work\r\n\r\nWhen we discover a generic-typed component, we synthesize an extra 'type-argument' attribute for each type-parameter. This gives us intellisense and completion support for specifying types when using the component. The type argument must be a nominal type (like the inside of a `typeof(...)` expression.. ie, it can't be a variable.\r\n\r\nOnce we've bound the component tree and processed cross-cutting features like event handlers and `bind` we find each generic-typed component and process the type parameters. We rewrite the type name of the component and the type name of each parameter that's set (for type-checking) and do code generation with the type-arguments substituted in.\r\n\r\nThis approach obviously won't be used for type-inference, but it's an important feature to provide for cases where you want to (or need to) be specific. \r\n\r\n## Misc\r\n\r\nWhen setting a generic-typed parameter, you won't get support for the shorthand the Razor supports for `string` attributes.\r\n\r\nEx: `<Generic TValue=string Value=\"Foo\" />`\r\nIn this example if `Value` is of type `TValue` then `Foo` will be interpreted as C# not as the contents of a string. \r\n\r\n--\r\n\r\nWhen using generics, there's always the possibility that the error messages could be confusing or misleading when the generic types can't be figured out. I've tried my best to minimize the error cases that you'll get in the editor, so that you can clearly see the error that Blazor reports about missing generic types.

This feature now supports any number of child content parameters and they can have any valid element name as names. Previously only the name `ChildContent` could be used, and the type was always `RenderFragment` of `T`. \r\n\r\nChild content arguments can be can be passed explicitly by wrapping the content in an element that matches the parameter name. Child content arguments must be passed explicitly when passing multiple child content arguments through the component body. The tooling will help with completion for child content  both as attributes and as elements in the body.\r\n\r\nWe've improved the validation and diagnostics of these features to try and make the limitations and mistakes clear. I don't anticipate that any of these new features are breaking changes. Passing child content to the `ChildContent` parameter still works implicitly, even when the `ChildContent` parameter isn't declared.\r\n\r\n----\r\n\r\nChild content arguments of type `RenderFragment<T>` passed as elements will have an implict parameter name of `context`. You can change the parameter name if you wish:\r\n```\r\n    <ItemTemplate Context=\"item\">\r\n        <tr><td>@item.Col1</td><td>@item.Col2</td><td>@item.Col3</td></tr>\r\n    </ItemTemplate>\r\n```\r\n\r\nThe value passed through `Context` must be a static/constant value. You should see completion/intellisense inside the `<ItemTemplate>` element for `item` in this example.\r\n\r\n----\r\n\r\nAdditionally, we've changed the siganture of `RenderFragment<T>` to be more usable. Now a `RenderFragment<T>` will return a `RenderFragment` when evaluated. This makes defining templates using the existing Razor syntax more natural.\r\n\r\n```\r\n@{\r\n    RenderFragment t1 = @<div>...</div>;\r\n    RenderFragment<Person> t2 = (person) => @<div>...</div>;\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nWhen using a `RenderFragment<T>` with Razor templates, you need to define the parameter name yourself. \r\n\r\n\r\n## Notes\r\n- It's probably best to look at this commit by commit.

Using a console application I can ref the two libraries and successfully make calls to the AuthService.svc.  If I try to wire in the same assemblies into the Blazor project, when it calls the wcf service I get the error in the title.\r\n\r\nI found a [suggestion](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/10054581/monotouch-wcf-how-to-consume-the-wcf-service-without-svcutil) to override the ChannelBase for the ClientBase, but that didnt work as-is because ChannelBase has no `Invoke` method, only the `Begin/EndInvoke` pair. When I tried to use those I would get only null reference exceptions. \r\n\r\nKeeping the arrangement of libraries and the existing wcf services is critical to the story, as there are a few hundred projects and a few million lines of code invested in that stack type and there is no financial benefit to just changing from the wcf/xml/soap to rest/json. However, there is as much leeway as code generation can permit, I just cant find a working pattern that I can use within this \"getting started\" project.\r\n\r\nBefore I spend another afternoon trying to make this work, can someone please tell me if what I am trying to do is possible, or is going to be possible with Blazor?","Url":"https://github.com/aspnet/Blazor/issues/1403","RelatedDescription":"Closed issue \"\"MonoTouch does not support dynamic proxy code generation.\" when trying to call existing services using existing controllers.\" (#1403)"},{"Id":"358488218","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2018-09-10T06:44:05","Actor":"shibutamang","Number":"1405","RawContent":null,"Title":"Small tweaks to support publish","State":"open","Body":"","Url":"https://github.com/aspnet/Blazor/pull/1405","RelatedDescription":"Open PR \"Small tweaks to support publish\" (#1405)"},{"Id":"358386053","IsPullRequest":false,"CreatedAt":"2018-09-10T04:04:17","Actor":"lakani","Number":"1402","RawContent":null,"Title":"for loop only render last value","State":"closed","Body":"i've modified a littel the counter page to try how i can render array of buttons, but i got a strange behavior \r\n`\r\n`@page \"/counter\"`\r\n`\r\n<h1>Counter</h1>`\r\n\r\n`<p>Current count: @currentCount</p>`\r\n\r\n`<button class=\"btn btn-primary\" onclick=\"@IncrementCount\">Click me</button>`\r\n\r\n`<button class=\"btn btn-primary\" onclick=\"@Reset\">Reset</button>`\r\n\r\n\r\n`@for (int i = 0; i < _Sarr.Length; i++)   {`\r\n\t` <button class=\"btn btn-primary\" onclick=\"@(e => bReset( i ))\">@_Sarr[i]</button>`\r\n`}`\r\n\r\n\r\n@functions {\r\n\tint currentCount = 0;\r\n\r\n\tstring[] _Sarr = new string[] { \"one\", \"two\", \"three\" };\r\n\r\n\tvoid IncrementCount()\r\n\t{\r\n\t\tcurrentCount++;\r\n\t}\r\n\r\n\tvoid bReset(int s)\r\n\t{\r\n\t\tConsole.WriteLine(s.ToString());\r\n\t\tcurrentCount += s;\r\n\r\n\r\n\t}\r\n\r\n\tvoid Reset()\r\n\t{\r\n\t\tcurrentCount = 0;\r\n\t}\r\n}\r\n`\r\n\r\nbut whenever i click on one of the buttons in the array , s variable passed by 3\r\n\r\nam i doing someting wrong ?","Url":"https://github.com/aspnet/Blazor/issues/1402","RelatedDescription":"Closed issue \"for loop only render last value\" (#1402)"}],"ResultType":"GitHubIssue"}},"RunOn":"2018-09-16T05:30:03.2133912Z","RunDurationInMilliseconds":1217}
