I have installed my custom MVC4 NuGet pacakge in ASP.NET MVC project with framework version 4.5.2. After installation completed all dependent assembly entries are placed under the binding redirect tag of the webconfig file. But, I didn't add this entry in my NuGet packages and I don't aware regarding how this entries are added after install my NuGet packages. \r\n\r\n`<dependentAssembly>\r\n        <assemblyIdentity name=\"Compression.Base\" publicKeyToken=\"3d67ed1f87d44c89\" culture=\"neutral\" />\r\n        <bindingRedirect oldVersion=\"0.0.0.0-1.4451.0.4\" newVersion=\"1.4451.0.4\" />\r\n</dependentAssembly>\r\n<dependentAssembly>\r\n        <assemblyIdentity name=\"OfficeChart.Base\" publicKeyToken=\"3d67ed1f87d44c89\" culture=\"neutral\" />\r\n        <bindingRedirect oldVersion=\"0.0.0.0-1.4451.0.4\" newVersion=\"1.4451.0.4\" />\r\n </dependentAssembly>`\r\n\r\nCould you please update the details regarding how this entries are placed in the web config file while install the NuGet packages. \r\n\r\nAlso, Could you please suggest me how can I overwrite this entries from my side through NuGet packages installation like below \r\n\r\n`<dependentAssembly>\r\n        <assemblyIdentity name=\"Compression.Base\" publicKeyToken=\"3d67ed1f87d44c89\" culture=\"neutral\" />\r\n        <bindingRedirect oldVersion=\"0.0.0.0-1.4451.0.4\" newVersion=\"1.4400.0.4\" />\r\n</dependentAssembly>\r\n<dependentAssembly>\r\n        <assemblyIdentity name=\"OfficeChart.Base\" publicKeyToken=\"3d67ed1f87d44c89\" culture=\"neutral\" />\r\n        <bindingRedirect oldVersion=\"0.0.0.0-1.4451.0.4\" newVersion=\"1.4400.0.4\" />\r\n </dependentAssembly>`\r\n\r\nCould you please suggest me regarding this?\r\n\r\nThanks,\r\n\r\nGanesan R.\n\n"},{"Id":"9344763952","Type":"IssuesEvent","CreatedAt":"2019-03-30T00:49:05","Actor":"nkolev92","Repository":"NuGet/Home","Organization":"NuGet","RawContent":null,"RelatedAction":"closed","RelatedUrl":"https://github.com/NuGet/Home/issues/7027","RelatedDescription":"Closed issue \"dotnet new -i, on two private feeds, unauthorized\" (#7027) at NuGet/Home","RelatedBody":"_From @maracuja-juice on May 28, 2018 12:16_\n\nI have a Template package that I published to a private feed.
