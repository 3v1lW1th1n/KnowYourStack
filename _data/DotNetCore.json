This advisory also provides guidance on what developers can do to update their applications correctly.\r\n\r\nMicrosoft is aware of a Denial of Service vulnerability in all public versions of .NET core due to improper processing of XML documents. An attacker who successfully exploited this vulnerability could cause a denial of service against a .NET application. A remote unauthenticated attacker could exploit this vulnerability by issuing specially crafted requests to a .NET Core application.\r\n\r\nThe update addresses the vulnerability by correcting how .NET core handles XML document processing.\r\n\r\nSystem administrators are advised to update their .NET Core runtimes to versions 1.0.9, 1.1.6 and 2.0.5. Developers are advised to update their .NET Core SDK to version 2.1.4 or 1.1.7. These runtime and SDK versions will also address CVE-2018-0786,  https://github.com/dotnet/announcements/issues/51\r\n\r\n### Discussion\r\n\r\nPlease use **** TODO: FILL IN ISSUE LINK *** for discussion of this advisory.\r\n\r\n## Affected Software\r\nThe vulnerability affects any Microsoft .NET Core project if it uses any of affected runtime versions listed below\r\n\r\n Runtime Version | Fixed runtime version\r\n----------------| -------------------------\r\n1.0.0, 1.0.1, 1.0.2, 1.0.3, 1.0.4, 1.0.5, 1.0.7, 1.0.8 | 1.0.9\r\n1.1.0, 1.1.1, 1.1.2, 1.1.4, 1.1.5 | 1.1.6\r\n2.0.0, 2.0.3, 2.0.4 |  2.0.5\r\n\r\n### Advisory FAQ\r\n#### How do I know if I am affected?\r\n\r\nTo check the runtimes installed on a computer you must view the contents of the runtime folder. By default these are\r\n\r\n| Operating System          | Location          |\r\n|---------------------------|-------------------|\r\n| Windows | C:\\Program Files\\dotnet\\shared\\Microsoft.NETCore.App\\ |\r\n| macOS | /usr/local/share/dotnet/shared/Microsoft.NETCore.App/    |\r\n| Supported Linux platforms | /usr/share/dotnet/shared/Microsoft.NETCore.App/   |\r\n\r\nEach runtime version is installed in its own directory, where the directory name is the version number. If you do not have a directory for 1.0.9, 1.1.6 or 2.0.2 then any applications targeting .NET Core will be vulnerable. Downloads for all supported platforms can be acquired from https://www.microsoft.com/net/download/\r\n\r\n#### How do I fix my affected application?\r\nApplications can be fixed by installing the latest runtimes or SDKs. Typically application servers only install a runtime package, developer machines install SDKs. Installers can be downloaded from the [Runtime and SDK download archive](https://github.com/dotnet/core/blob/master/release-notes/download-archive.md). Runtime version 1.1.6 will also install runtime version 1.0.9.\r\n\r\nIf you have built a [self-contained application](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/core/deploying/#self-contained-deployments-scd) you must install the new runtime and SDK, recompile your application and redeploy.\r\n\r\n## Other Information\r\n### Reporting Security Issues\r\n\r\nIf you have found a potential security issue in .NET Core, please email details to secure@microsoft.com. Reports may qualify for the .NET Core Bug Bounty. Details of the .NET Core Bug Bounty including Terms and Conditions are at [https://aka.ms/corebounty](https://aka.ms/corebounty).\r\n\r\n### Support\r\nYou can ask questions about this issue on GitHub in the .NET Core or ASP.NET Core organizations. These are located at https://github.com/dotnet/ and https://github.com/aspnet/. The Announcements repo for each product (https://github.com/dotnet/Announcements and https://github.com/aspnet/Announcements) will contain this bulletin as an issue and will include a link to a discussion issue where you can ask questions.\r\n\r\n### What if the update breaks my application?\r\nAn application can be pinned to a previous version of the runtime by editing the [application.runtime.config](https://github.com/dotnet/cli/blob/ede74b6be1406ba0c086b6d5fc1a5d4eacff1f01/Documentation/specs/runtime-configuration-file.md#appnameruntimeconfigjson) file for that application and editing the framework version and setting `rollForward` to `false`. This should be treated as a temporary measure and the application updated to work with the patched versions of the framework.\r\n\r\nNote that this file is optional, you may need to create it for each application alongside the executable.\r\n\r\n### External Links\r\n\r\n[CVE-2018-0764](https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2018-0764)\r\n\r\n### Revisions\r\n\r\nV1.0 (Jan 9, 2018): Advisory published.\r\n\r\n_Version 1.0_\r\n_Last Updated 2018-01-09_\r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  "},{"Id":"7076401836","Type":"IssuesEvent","CreatedAt":"2018-01-09T18:01:26","Actor":"blowdart","Repository":"dotnet/announcements","Organization":"dotnet","RawContent":null,"RelatedAction":"opened","RelatedUrl":"https://github.com/dotnet/announcements/issues/51","RelatedDescription":"Opened issue \"Microsoft Security Advisory CVE-2018-0786: Security Feature Bypass in X509 Certificate Validation\" (#51) at dotnet/announcements","RelatedBody":"# Microsoft Security Advisory CVE-2018-0786\r\n## Security Feature Bypass in X509 Certificate Validation\r\n### Executive Summary \r\n\r\nMicrosoft is releasing this security advisory to provide information about a vulnerability in the public versions of .NET Core 1.0 and 1.1, and 2.0.

Runtime version 1.1.6 will also install runtime version 1.0.9.\r\n\r\nIf you have built a [self-contained application](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/core/deploying/#self-contained-deployments-scd) you must install the new runtime and SDK, recompile your application and redeploy.\r\n\r\n#### How do I fix my .NET native application? \r\n\r\n.NET native requires that applications be re-processed by the .NET native compiler to incorporate the fixes and the re-processed version needs to be distributed via the Windows Store.\r\n\r\nWe recommend that you update your .NET UWP apps to use the latest minor version of the `Microsoft.NETCore.UniversalWindowsPlatform` NuGet package so that you can build and verify that your app works as expected when updated. If you are using version 6.0.x, you should update to 6.0.6 and if you’re using 5.2.x, you can update to 5.2.4. Of course, you can update to a higher major version too, but we are distributing security updates for all impacted major versions (currently 5.2.x, 5.3.x, 5.4.x and 6.0.x). Additionally, whether or not you update your NuGet packages, all applications submitted to the store after today will be automatically fixed during submission processing.\r\n\r\nIf you do not update your app in the Store, it will automatically be reprocessed and distributed via an application update in the next few weeks. Users who have automatic app updates enabled will get the fix with no intervention on your or their parts. Because updated apps are distributed through the Windows Store, sideloaded apps will not be automatically updated. We recommend that developers who distribute sideloaded apps update the affected NuGet packages, rebuild their applications and distribute them to their users.\r\n\r\nMicrosoft is committed to keeping UWP applications secure and to supporting developers. If you have feedback on the fix distribution process, please let us know at dotnetnative@microsoft.com. \r\n\r\n## Other Information\r\n### Reporting Security Issues\r\n\r\nIf you have found a potential security issue in .NET Core, please email details to secure@microsoft.com. Reports may qualify for the .NET Core Bug Bounty. Details of the .NET Core Bug Bounty including Terms and Conditions are at [https://aka.ms/corebounty](https://aka.ms/corebounty).\r\n\r\n### Support\r\nYou can ask questions about this issue on GitHub in the .NET Core or ASP.NET Core organizations. These are located at https://github.com/dotnet/ and https://github.com/aspnet/. The Announcements repo for each product (https://github.com/dotnet/Announcements and https://github.com/aspnet/Announcements) will contain this bulletin as an issue and will include a link to a discussion issue where you can ask questions.\r\n\r\n### What if the update breaks my application?\r\nAn application can be pinned to a previous version of the runtime by editing the [application.runtime.config](https://github.com/dotnet/cli/blob/ede74b6be1406ba0c086b6d5fc1a5d4eacff1f01/Documentation/specs/runtime-configuration-file.md#appnameruntimeconfigjson) file for that application and editing the framework version and setting `rollForward` to `false`. This should be treated as a temporary measure and the application updated to work with the patched versions of the framework.\r\n\r\nNote that this file is optional, you may need to create it for each application alongside the executable.\r\n\r\n### External Links\r\n\r\n[CVE-2018-0786](https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2018-0786)\r\n\r\n### Revisions\r\n\r\nV1.0 (Jan 9, 2018): Advisory published.\r\n\r\n_Version 1.0_\r\n_Last Updated 2018-01-09_"}],"ResultType":"GitHubEvent"},"CoreCLR":{"Events":[{"Id":"7226124068","Type":"PullRequestEvent","CreatedAt":"2018-02-10T04:58:30","Actor":"jkotas","Repository":"dotnet/coreclr","Organization":"dotnet","RawContent":null,"RelatedAction":"merged","RelatedUrl":"https://github.com/dotnet/coreclr/pull/16269","RelatedDescription":"Merged pull request \"Update BuildTools, CoreClr, CoreFx, PgoData to preview2-02509-01, preview2-26209-08, preview2-26210-01, master-20180209-0035, respectively (master)\" (#16269) at dotnet/coreclr","RelatedBody":"/cc @dotnet/coreclr-auto-update-notify"},{"Id":"7226066043","Type":"PullRequestEvent","CreatedAt":"2018-02-10T04:09:29","Actor":"tannergooding","Repository":"dotnet/coreclr","Organization":"dotnet","RawContent":null,"RelatedAction":"merged","RelatedUrl":"https://github.com/dotnet/coreclr/pull/14897","RelatedDescription":"Merged pull request \"Port #14287 to release/1.1.0\" (#14897) at dotnet/coreclr","RelatedBody":"FYI. @JosephTremoulet"},{"Id":"7226051955","Type":"PullRequestEvent","CreatedAt":"2018-02-10T03:58:09","Actor":"tannergooding","Repository":"dotnet/coreclr","Organization":"dotnet","RawContent":null,"RelatedAction":"merged","RelatedUrl":"https://github.com/dotnet/coreclr/pull/16297","RelatedDescription":"Merged pull request \"Updating emitxarch to check TakesVexPrefix(ins) when adding REX bits.\" (#16297) at dotnet/coreclr","RelatedBody":"This resolves https://github.com/dotnet/coreclr/issues/16286"},{"Id":"7226051952","Type":"IssuesEvent","CreatedAt":"2018-02-10T03:58:09","Actor":"tannergooding","Repository":"dotnet/coreclr","Organization":"dotnet","RawContent":null,"RelatedAction":"closed","RelatedUrl":"https://github.com/dotnet/coreclr/issues/16286","RelatedDescription":"Closed issue \"AddRex*Prefix needs to handle the `prefetch` instructions\" (#16286) at dotnet/coreclr","RelatedBody":"The `prefetch` instructions are SSE instructions but use the actual REX prefix rather than the VEX prefix.\r\n\r\nThe various `emitter::AddRex*Prefix` methods need to be updated to account for this."}],"ResultType":"GitHubEvent"},"CLI":{"Events":[{"Id":"7226001554","Type":"PullRequestEvent","CreatedAt":"2018-02-10T03:17:16","Actor":"wli3","Repository":"dotnet/cli","Organization":"dotnet","RawContent":null,"RelatedAction":"opened","RelatedUrl":"https://github.com/dotnet/cli/pull/8589","RelatedDescription":"Opened pull request \"Support TildeSlash expand\" (#8589) at dotnet/cli","RelatedBody":"https://www.gnu.org/software/bash/manual/html_node/Tilde-Expansion.html\r\n\r\n"},{"Id":"7225826587","Type":"PullRequestEvent","CreatedAt":"2018-02-10T01:21:49","Actor":"danmosemsft","Repository":"dotnet/cli","Organization":"dotnet","RawContent":null,"RelatedAction":"opened","RelatedUrl":"https://github.com/dotnet/cli/pull/8588","RelatedDescription":"Opened pull request \"Port Kernel Version telemetry to preview1\" (#8588) at dotnet/cli","RelatedBody":"Port https://github.com/dotnet/cli/pull/8579 to preview 1.\r\n\r\nPending shiproom approval."},{"Id":"7225818670","Type":"PullRequestEvent","CreatedAt":"2018-02-10T01:17:37","Actor":"johnbeisner","Repository":"dotnet/cli","Organization":"dotnet","RawContent":null,"RelatedAction":"merged","RelatedUrl":"https://github.com/dotnet/cli/pull/8587","RelatedDescription":"Merged pull request \"Do not create a directory with a trailing space\" (#8587) at dotnet/cli","RelatedBody":"Do not create a directory with a trailing space; it cannot be deleted by conventional methods.

No matter what I try, the version retrieved from the above line shows 3.0.0.0.\r\n\r\nCan anyone point out what I'm doing wrong, or point me in the direction of a page that explains some of this stuff more fully?\n\n---\n\n@karelz commented on [Thu Apr 06 2017](https://github.com/dotnet/corefx/issues/18002#issuecomment-292395498)\n\nThe code you wrote inspects assembly version (defined by [AssemblyVersionAttribute](https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/system.reflection.assemblyversionattribute(v=vs.110).aspx)).\r\n\r\nI don't know what the `dotnet publish` command sets in csproj -- @davkean any idea where to direct the question? Does it belong into your area or CLI area?\n\n---\n\n@tarekgh commented on [Fri Apr 07 2017](https://github.com/dotnet/corefx/issues/18002#issuecomment-292578673)\n\nCC @weshaggard @ericstj \r\n\r\n@golfguy0082 net core is not different than the full framework. you can set the assembly version in your assembly by adding the attributes like \r\n\r\n```C#\r\n[assembly: AssemblyVersion(\"1.0.0.0\")]\r\n[assembly: AssemblyFileVersion(\"1.0.0.0\")]\r\n```\r\n\r\nand the way you are calling Assembly class to get the version is correct. The example in the link https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/system.reflection.assembly(v=vs.110).aspx is demonstrating that \n\n---\n\n@weshaggard commented on [Fri Apr 07 2017](https://github.com/dotnet/corefx/issues/18002#issuecomment-292580418)\n\n.NET Core tooling is a little different because we have enabled folks to set the value in msbuild properties directly. @golfguy0082 have a look at https://github.com/dotnet/sdk/issues/2 which is I think the closest set of documentation that I can find on the matter. \n\n---\n\n@tarekgh commented on [Fri Apr 07 2017](https://github.com/dotnet/corefx/issues/18002#issuecomment-292584267)\n\nI'll move this issue to the SDK repo per Wes comment\n\n"},{"Id":"7225513994","Type":"IssuesEvent","CreatedAt":"2018-02-09T23:15:11","Actor":"livarcocc","Repository":"dotnet/sdk","Organization":"dotnet","RawContent":null,"RelatedAction":"closed","RelatedUrl":"https://github.com/dotnet/sdk/issues/1106","RelatedDescription":"Closed issue \"Question: How to remove a package's assembly from a build?\" (#1106) at dotnet/sdk","RelatedBody":"Hi\r\n\r\nI have a weird situation.
