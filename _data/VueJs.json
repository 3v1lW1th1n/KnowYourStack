And Vue is acting as a Front end library. In our Vue code base we dont have any HTML templates. We initialize the data property, have computed and methods. HTML is authored in AEM. The problem is that if an author of AEM uses a non-existent method in HTML templates, then our Vue production build is not able to capture the error. Instead a black page is shown to user. Is there a way to capture these kind of errors in Vue production build. Basically the HTML is out of Vue control.  \r\n\r\n### What does the proposed API look like?\r\nI propose to enable Vue.config.errorHandler to catch errors even in production build.\r\n\r\n<!-- generated by vue-issues.

If it doesn't, open a bash terminal and run ```npm start``` to see the HTML generated from SSR. You can also take a look at the components in the ```src``` folder to see how they are configured.\r\n\r\n### What is expected?\r\nExpected the HTML for the nested async component (called \"SomeComponent\") to be rendered during SSR:\r\n\r\n```html\r\n<div data-server-rendered=\"true\">\r\n  <div class=\"Grid\">\r\n    <div class=\"Grid__left\">Left\r\n      <div class=\"SomeComponent\">Somecomponent with value: first</div>\r\n    </div>\r\n    <div class=\"Grid__right\">Right\r\n      <div class=\"SomeComponent\">Somecomponent with value: second</div>\r\n    </div>\r\n  </div>\r\n</div>\r\n```\r\n\r\n### What is actually happening?\r\nThe HTML for the nested async component (called \"SomeComponent\") is not rendered during SSR. Only the HTML for the outer async component (called \"Grid\" ) is rendered:\r\n\r\n```html\r\n<div data-server-rendered=\"true\">\r\n  <div class=\"Grid\">\r\n    <div class=\"Grid__left\">Left\r\n    </div>\r\n    <div class=\"Grid__right\">Right\r\n    </div>\r\n  </div>\r\n</div>\r\n```\r\n\r\n---\r\nI have an App that is composed of many async components. Some of these components have named slots. I was trying to build a render function that will accept a config object to render these components in various setups (for example, an async component set to a named slot of another async component). I noticed that if I nest async components within another, the HTML for the async component does not render during SSR. The codesandbox is simplified scenario of this\r\n\r\n<!-- generated by vue-issues.

I don't know whether or not we are ok with mutating the route record inside of `History#confirmTransition`. I also don't really know if this will cause problems elsewhere outside of running `npm test`.\r\n\r\nThe apps my team builds here in Bloomberg are thoroughly E2E tested.

To decide which pane should be visble, we use the hash to determine this.\r\n\r\nExample:\r\n /security#tfa opens the pane where the user can enable/disable two factor authentication\r\n /security#audit opens the pane that has a datatable with the most recent security audits\r\n\r\nThe query params are mostly used to drive what data is shown.\r\nFor instance, the datatable at /security#audit has a table that can be filtered or sorted.  \r\nWhenever for instance a table column header is clicked, we set the sort query parameter as follows:\r\n\r\nthis.$router.push({query: Object.assign({}, this.$route.query, {'sort': sortkey})});\r\n\r\nI was under the impression that this method would be intelligent enough ONLY to update the query parameters, and leave the other parts of the route intact (path, params, hash...)\r\n\r\nYet, when we navigate by pushing to the router, ONLY pushing the query, the hash is lost...\r\n\r\nSo on /security#audit, clicking on the table column 'created', we do \r\nthis.$router.push({query: Object.assign({}, this.$route.query, {'sort': 'created'}));\r\n\r\nThe expected result would be /security?sort=created#audit\r\n-->this would keep the 'audit pane' active, and sort the contents in that table by created date.\r\n\r\nHowever, the result is /security?sort=created\r\n\r\nThe has should not be lost in that action.\r\n\r\n### What is expected?\r\nI would not expect the hash to be lost in this case, so the new route would be /security?sort=created#audit\r\n\r\n### What is actually happening?\r\nThe hash is lost; the new route is /security?sort=created\r\n\r\n---\r\nWe obviously try and put all these parameters in the route so a user can copy/paste the url and send it to a collleague to link to the correct information.\r\n\r\n<!-- generated by vue-issues.

This allows the mutation functions to directly update the payload data rather than the state object.\r\n\r\nAs an example see [editTodo() in the todo demo](https://github.com/vuejs/vuex/blob/91f3e69ed9e290cf91f8885c6d5ae2c97fa7ab81/examples/todomvc/store/mutations.js#L17):\r\n\r\n```javascript\r\neditTodo (state, { todo, text = todo.text, done = todo.done }) {\r\n  todo.text = text\r\n  todo.done = done\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nThere are 2 downsides to this.\r\n\r\nThe first is that the function is mutating the payload and not the state. It is not clear here what is being mutated. We now need to traverse all around the app to find out.\r\n\r\nIf the payload was instead passed by value then updating the value would not actually do anything. All mutation functions would need to update the state object. This would make vuex stores more explicit and understandable as well as ensure there is a clear boundary between it and the app. \r\n\r\nThe second is that Vuex plugins cannot log the mutations to a server and replay them back later. Here is a pseudocode example:\r\n\r\n```javascript\r\n// replaying back mutation logs\r\nlet logs = await getLogsFromServer();\r\nfor (log in logs) {\r\n  // any editTodo mutations passed in below will not work\r\n  // as the mutation will update the \"log\" object instead of \r\n  // the actual todo in the state object\r\n  this.store.commit(log.type, log.payload);\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nI'm working on a plugin that does this (similar to [redux-vcr](https://github.com/joshwcomeau/redux-vcr)) and it would be great if there was a systematic guarantee that it would work with all Vuex stores. \r\n\r\n### What does the proposed API look like?\r\nExample - No changes needed\r\n```javascript\r\nmutations: {\r\n  // current: n is passed by reference\r\n  increment (state, n) { \r\n    state.count  = n\r\n  }\r\n}\r\n\r\nmutations: {\r\n  // proposed: n is passed by value\r\n  increment (state, n) { \r\n    state.count  = n\r\n  }\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nExample B - editTodo\r\n\r\n```javascript\r\nmutations: {\r\n  // current - can update payload\r\n  editTodo (state, { todo, text = todo.text, done = todo.done }) {\r\n    todo.text = text\r\n    todo.done = done\r\n  }\r\n}\r\n\r\nmutations: {\r\n  // proposed - with pass by value we \r\n  // must update the state object\r\n  editTodo (state, todo) {\r\n     const index = state.todos.findIndex(t => t.id === todo.id);\r\n     state.todos[index] = todo;\r\n  }\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\n<!-- generated by vue-issues.
