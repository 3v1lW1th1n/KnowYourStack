issue \"Allow releases to be tagged as security-related\" (#5539) at NuGet/NuGetGallery","RelatedBody":"## Summary\r\n\r\nWhen uploading a new release to NuGet.org, the package author should be able to choose to indicate whether the new version contains security fixes and which versions are affected.\r\n\r\n## Details\r\n\r\nTracking vulnerable NuGet packages is currently not an easy task. A lot of projects do not issue CVEs and if they do, they do not correlate the CVEs to their NuGet package. NuGet should support at a gallery layer indicating whether a package version should be avoided due to known vulnerabilities.\r\n\r\nThis proposal would have 3 main changes:\r\n\r\n1. Add new UI elements on the package upload page to indicate a security release and affected versions\r\n2. Change the \"Version History\" page to indicate previous versions that may contain vulnerabilities\r\n3. Add additional info to the API response to include a flag on versions which contain vulnerabilities and which package version they should upgrade to\r\n\r\n## Implementation\r\n\r\nHere are some examples of UI changes that may occur:\r\n\r\n![2018-02-23 11_29_36-nuget gallery _ upload package](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/1313522/36613426-560e2ce8-188e-11e8-860a-5c67f88eb099.png)\r\n\r\n![2018-02-23 11_35_11-nuget gallery _ ca04cb92478e4bb2a064705f9797b92b 1 0 15](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/1313522/36613435-5adfa2ba-188e-11e8-85c1-2bb34056bf06.png)"},{"Id":"7289206066","Type":"IssuesEvent","CreatedAt":"2018-02-23T19:40:16","Actor":"skofman1","Repository":"NuGet/NuGetGallery","Organization":"NuGet","RawContent":null,"RelatedAction":"opened","RelatedUrl":"https://github.com/NuGet/NuGetGallery/issues/5538","RelatedDescription":"Opened issue \"Blog about nuget.org usage and throttling\" (#5538) at NuGet/NuGetGallery","RelatedBody":""},{"Id":"7288692934","Type":"IssuesEvent","CreatedAt":"2018-02-23T17:48:28","Actor":"cristinamanum","Repository":"NuGet/NuGetGallery","Organization":"NuGet","RawContent":null,"RelatedAction":"opened","RelatedUrl":"https://github.com/NuGet/NuGetGallery/issues/5537","RelatedDescription":"Opened issue \"[NuGet Symbol Server] Gallery design\" (#5537) at NuGet/NuGetGallery","RelatedBody":"Document the design Gallery changes to support Symbol Server"}],"ResultType":"GitHubEvent"},"Home":{"Events":[{"Id":"7292737630","Type":"IssuesEvent","CreatedAt":"2018-02-25T05:24:08","Actor":"Tadimsky","Repository":"NuGet/Home","Organization":"NuGet","RawContent":null,"RelatedAction":"opened","RelatedUrl":"https://github.com/NuGet/Home/issues/6609","RelatedDescription":"Opened issue \"CredentialProvider in MSBuild Nuget Restore?\" (#6609) at NuGet/Home","RelatedBody":"## Details about Problem\r\n\r\nI have a project that has Nuget dependencies that are in our private feeds in VSTS. We have an issue where running Nuget restore via `msbuild` from the command line results in a 401 failure as it does not have credentials to access the feed.\r\nWe've been using this guide: https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/vsts/package/nuget/bootstrap-nuget but this seems to only work if running nuget.exe and not Nuget as part of MSBuild.\r\n\r\nIs there something we need to do for this to work correctly? \r\n\r\nNuGet product used (NuGet.exe | VS UI | Package Manager Console | dotnet.exe): msbuild.exe on command line.\r\n\r\nVS version (if appropriate): 15.5.7\r\n\r\nOS version (i.e. win10 v1607 (14393.321)): 17107.1000\r\n\r\n## Detailed repro steps so we can see the same problem\r\n\r\n1.

A year ago, we introduced [scoped API keys](https://blog.nuget.org/20170202/introducing-scoped-api-keys.html) to help our users better manage their API keys. While we recommend the use of scoped API keys, we will continue to support our legacy 'Full access API keys' that were previously granted by the service. Such keys do not expire if you use them at least one every 365 days to push a package.\r\n \r\nWe are making a change to our service such that a newly issued API key cannot be copied after the page is refreshed. While this was always the case for scoped API keys, we were allowing users with 'Full access API keys' to copy them down at any point. We plan to remove this capability in the future, as making this change allows us to migrate all of our APIs keys to use a one-way hash and further protect against malicious use of the key.\r\n\r\n**Starting Feb 5th 2018, the 'Full access API key' cannot be copied from NuGet.org**. While most of the packages pushed to NuGet.org now use a scoped API key and are not impacted by this change, users continuing to use our legacy 'Full access API keys' will need to securely stash the key before this date after which they will not be accessible. Please note that the 'Full access API keys' will continue to work just like they did before. We are only removing the ability to copy them down from NuGet.org.\r\n\r\nIf you have further question, please reach out to us by commenting on the [discussion issue](https://github.com/NuGet/NuGetGallery/issues/5231) or send me an email at [anangaur@microsoft.com](mailto:anangaur@microsoft.com).
