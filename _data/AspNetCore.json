It:\r\n  1. Launches Selenium WebDriver\r\n  2. Launches the server\r\n  3. Instructs WebDriver to open the page on the server that runs the tests in a browser (any browser supported by Selenium WebDriver)\r\n  4. Scrapes the DOM, reading the hidden `<li>` values and write them to the console, until the tests complete\r\n  5. Terminates the browser, server and WebDriver.\r\n* Now, the `run-tests.js` script basically acts as a script that writes TAP output for our functional tests. We can pipe that through any TAP-compatible reporter (we use `faucet` here) to report output.\r\n\r\n**IMPORTANT:** This is not yet integrated into our build, the first pass is just to make it runnable and provide the infrastructure.\r\n\r\nAlso, this mechanism should be able to automate BrowserStack/Sauce Labs/some other browser lab.

The ASP.NET team's development resources are finite, and we think we can deliver more valuable features to ASP.NET developers by focusing elsewhere.\r\n\r\nSo:\r\n\r\n* The `Microsoft.DotNet.Web.Spa.ProjectTemplates` package, containing **Angular**, **React**, and **React+Redux** templates, is **not affected**. This ships in the .NET Core SDK and is officially supported. We continue to invest development effort in this package. We can put *more* time and effort into these SPA templates now the effort isn't so spread out.\r\n* If you have an existing Aurelia/Knockout/Vue project based on our SPA templates, you're not directly affected because these templates are only used to create new projects. You can continue building and shipping your app forever. Obviously we still support and enhance the underlying ASP.NET Core APIs (such as those in JavaScriptServices) that you are using.\r\n* The `Microsoft.AspNetCore.SpaTemplates` package, containing Aurelia, Knockout, and Vue templates, continues to be available, but we'll no longer update it or work on issues related to it.\r\n* We encourage enthusiastic community members to [ship your own `dotnet new` templates](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/core/tools/custom-templates). The `dotnet new` system is extensible for this exact reason. If you want to own the go-to Aurelia/Knockout/Vue project template, now's your chance! You could [fork the ones from `Microsoft.AspNetCore.SpaTemplates`](https://github.com/aspnet/templating/tree/dev/src/Microsoft.AspNetCore.SpaTemplates), or start from scratch depending on what you prefer.\r\n* In the long term, if another JavaScript SPA framework becomes dominant, we will of course consider adding a template for it to the SDK templates package.\r\n\r\nI know this will be irritating to some people, especially those who have worked on PRs for the Aurelia/Knockout/Vue templates. I'm sorry about that! I hope you can understand that our goal is to offer the overall maximum benefit for ASP.NET developers based on the resources available."},{"Id":"7191689127","Type":"IssuesEvent","CreatedAt":"2018-02-02T22:04:23","Actor":"danroth27","Repository":"aspnet/Announcements","Organization":"aspnet","RawContent":null,"RelatedAction":"opened","RelatedUrl":"https://github.com/aspnet/Announcements/issues/288","RelatedDescription":"Opened issue \"ASP.NET Core 2.1 \" (#288) at aspnet/Announcements","RelatedBody":"*This is high-level only and doesn't include all issues, bugs, etc. from every repo, just intended to give a general idea of release scope and direction.*\r\n\r\nThe following high-level features are planned for the ASP.NET Core 2.1 release:\r\n- **SignalR** - Real-time web framework on ASP.NET Core (https://github.com/aspnet/SignalR/issues/394)\r\n- **HTTPS** - On by default and easy to configure (https://github.com/aspnet/Home/issues/2308)\r\n- **GDPR compliance** - Templates updated with new privacy features (https://github.com/aspnet/Security/issues/1561, https://github.com/aspnet/Identity/issues/1341)\r\n- **Web API conventions** - Rich Swagger support without attributes (https://github.com/aspnet/Mvc/issues/6870, https://github.com/aspnet/Mvc/issues/6784)\r\n- **IHttpClientFactory** - HttpClient as a service, handle cross-cutting concerns like caching, retry logic, timeouts and circuit breakers (https://github.com/aspnet/HttpClientFactory/issues/42)\r\n- **ASP.NET Core Module in-proc hosting** - 6x the throughput on IIS!
