The **parent** property is required so that the route can see its siblings. The **title** property is optional - it is useful instead of **name** when you want to name a route having a default child. I personally use **name** in `beforeRouteEnter/beforeRouteUpdate` to update the **document.title** in browser - and I need it on all routes (even with default child), so I had to add **title** property.\r\n\r\nThis closes issue #1149\r\n\r\nThere are non-trivial situations where playing with CSS selectors becomes too inconvenient. Consider the following markup:\r\n```vue\r\n    <div>\r\n      <div class=\"tabs_account\">\r\n        <div class=\"tab_spacer\">&nbsp;</div>\r\n        <template v-for=\"page in $router.currentRoute.parent.children\" v-if=\"page.can_show\">\r\n          <router-link tag=\"div\" active-class=\"tab_active\" inactive-class=\"tab\" v-bind:to=\"page.path\">{{ page.title }}</router-link>\r\n          <div class=\"tab_spacer\">&nbsp;</div>\r\n        </template>\r\n        <div class=\"tab_fill tab_spacer\">&nbsp;</div>\r\n      </div>\r\n      <router-view></router-view>\r\n    </div>\r\n```\r\nYou can achieve the same effect like this\r\n```vue\r\n<router-link :class=\"{'router-link-active': $route.fullPath ==='/' || $route.fullPath === '/a', 'router-link-inactive': $route.fullPath !=='/' && $route.fullPath !== '/a'}\" to=\"/a\">\r\nText\r\n</router-link>\r\n```\r\nbut it looks hacky (you have to keep the PATH strings in sync between HTML and JavaScript code) while the proposed solution feels more elegant.\r\n"},{"Id":"7095954042","Type":"PullRequestEvent","CreatedAt":"2018-01-13T23:06:15","Actor":"posva","Repository":"vuejs/vue-router","Organization":"vuejs","RawContent":null,"RelatedAction":"opened","RelatedUrl":"https://github.com/vuejs/vue-router/pull/1991","RelatedDescription":"Opened pull request \"Adding children and parent to currentRoute\" (#1991) at vuejs/vue-router","RelatedBody":"Closes #1149\r\n\r\n<!--\r\nPlease make sure to read the Pull Request Guidelines:\r\nhttps://github.com/vuejs/vue/blob/dev/.github/CONTRIBUTING.md#pull-request-guidelines\r\n-->\r\n"},{"Id":"7095948805","Type":"PullRequestEvent","CreatedAt":"2018-01-13T23:02:14","Actor":"posva","Repository":"vuejs/vue-router","Organization":"vuejs","RawContent":null,"RelatedAction":"closed","RelatedUrl":"https://github.com/vuejs/vue-router/pull/1941","RelatedDescription":"Closed pull request \"Adding children and parent to currentRoute\" (#1941) at vuejs/vue-router","RelatedBody":"Also adding .vscode (IDE settings file) to .gitignore\r\n\r\n@posva I'd like to have the feature #1650 was trying to add but it looks like there are too many unrelated changes in that PR and it hasn't been updated with your comments for a little while so I decided to try re-work it here.
