A duplicate size definition would look like this:\r\n\r\n```sass\r\n$size-1: 100px\r\n$size-2: 100px\r\n@import \"bulma\"\r\n```\r\n\r\nThis happens because `index()` always grabs the index of the _first_ matching value. Because this is a nuance specific to `index()`, this bug only affects 3 places in the Bulma codebase:\r\n\r\n1. https://github.com/jgthms/bulma/blob/0c43b9e4663ae040d47d2a373ded5ba914b7d10f/sass/base/helpers.sass#L25-L28\r\n1. https://github.com/jgthms/bulma/blob/0c43b9e4663ae040d47d2a373ded5ba914b7d10f/sass/elements/title.sass#L49-L52\r\n1. https://github.com/jgthms/bulma/blob/0c43b9e4663ae040d47d2a373ded5ba914b7d10f/sass/elements/title.sass#L67-L70\r\n### Steps to Reproduce\r\n\r\nI setup an example repository with the compiled CSS where you can see the current behavior:\r\n\r\n- Code: https://github.com/hkgumbs/bulma-size-bug-demo\r\n- Demo: https://hkgumbs.github.io/bulma-size-bug-demo/\r\n- TL;DR\r\n  1. Set variables `size-1` and `size-2` to the same value (i.e. `100px`)\r\n  1. Compile Bulma via the normal means\r\n  1. Compiled CSS **does not** include declarations for `is-size-2`/`is-2`\r\n\r\n### Expected behavior\r\n\r\nBulma would produce declarations for `is-size-1`/`is-1` _and_ `is-size-2`/`is-2`. All of these declarations would be set to the same value (`100px` in this case).\r\n\r\n### Actual behavior\r\n\r\nBulma produces 2 declarations for `is-size-1`/`is-1` and 0 for `is-size-2`/`is-2`: https://github.com/hkgumbs/bulma-size-bug-demo/blob/master/output.css#L378-L382\r\n","Url":"https://github.com/jgthms/bulma/issues/2802","RelatedDescription":"Open issue \"Duplicate sizes causes missing .is-size-* and .title.is-* declarations\" (#2802)"},{"Id":"561440395","IsPullRequest":false,"CreatedAt":"2020-02-07T06:06:18","Actor":"arturplo","Number":"2801","RawContent":null,"Title":"card-header display multiline text","State":"open","Body":"Hi how to display text in two lines in card header ?\r\n```\r\n<div class=\"card\">\r\n        <header class=\"card-header has-background-success\">\r\n        <div class=\"card-header-icon\">\r\n          <figure class=\"image is-64x64\">\r\n            <img class=\"is-rounded\" src=\"https://bulma.io/images/placeholders/96x96.png\" alt=\"Placeholder image\">\r\n          </figure>\r\n        </div>\r\n        <p class=\"card-header-title is-paddingless\">John Doe</p>\r\n        <p class=\"\">@johndoe</p>\r\n        </header>\r\n        <div class=\"card-content\">\r\n          \r\n        </div>\r\n      </div>\r\n```\r\n![Schowek-1](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/8561816/74004891-6bfe8680-4977-11ea-93cd-70264a75b420.jpg)\r\nnot working :( @johndoe should be under John Doe and not right upstairs\r\n\r\n","Url":"https://github.com/jgthms/bulma/issues/2801","RelatedDescription":"Open issue \"card-header display multiline text\" (#2801)"},{"Id":"558481401","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2020-02-06T14:26:32","Actor":"tiagoefmoraes","Number":"2792","RawContent":null,"Title":"Remove unnecessary </a> tag in Button element documentation page","State":"closed","Body":"This is a **documentation fix**.\r\n\r\nRemoving an unnecessary tag in: https://github.com/jgthms/bulma/blob/master/docs/documentation/elements/button.html#L238\r\n\r\n","Url":"https://github.com/jgthms/bulma/pull/2792","RelatedDescription":"Closed or merged PR \"Remove unnecessary </a> tag in Button element documentation page\" (#2792)"},{"Id":"560268442","IsPullRequest":false,"CreatedAt":"2020-02-05T10:51:15","Actor":"SDJeff","Number":"2800","RawContent":null,"Title":"type error .hero .tabs .ul in Stylesheets","State":"closed","Body":"I think in the current version 0.8.0 is an type error.\r\n\r\nInstead of:\r\n\r\n`.hero .tabs ul {\r\n    border-bottom: none;\r\n}`\r\n\r\nit should be:\r\n\r\n`.hero.tabs ul {\r\n    border-bottom: none;\r\n}`\r\n\r\nbecause otherwise the border of the tab items are set to NONE if you use them f.e. in a Card.","Url":"https://github.com/jgthms/bulma/issues/2800","RelatedDescription":"Closed issue \"type error .hero .tabs .ul in Stylesheets\" (#2800)"},{"Id":"559811436","IsPullRequest":false,"CreatedAt":"2020-02-04T15:54:12","Actor":"HarshdipD","Number":"2799","RawContent":null,"Title":"Font awesome icons disappear on new page load","State":"open","Body":"<!-- PLEASE READ THE FOLLOWING INSTRUCTIONS -->\r\n\r\n<!-- Choose one of the following: -->\r\nThis is about **Bulma**.\r\nSpecifically, this is about a bug in Bulma.\r\n<!-- Is it about Bulma or about the Docs? -->\r\n<!-- Is it a bug/feature/question or do you need help? -->\r\n<!-- If it's a bug, is it a browser bug? -->\r\n\r\n### Overview of the problem\r\n\r\n<!-- UNCOMMENT THE APPROPRIATE LINES -->\r\n\r\nThis is about the Bulma **CSS framework**\r\n<!-- This is about the Bulma **Docs** -->\r\n<!-- I'm using Bulma **version** [x.x.x] -->\r\nMy **browser** is:\r\nChrome and Firefox\r\n\r\nI'm using **Ruby on Rails** framework without the Bulma gem, just the external Bulma link in `<head>`.
