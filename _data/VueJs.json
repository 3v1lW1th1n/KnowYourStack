Open the JSFiddle link mentioned as part of this issue.\r\n2. Check and record the heap memory in the browser on initial stage.\r\n3. Click on the \"Register\" button to dynamically register Module B 100 times\r\n4. Now we will see an increase in heap memory on account of registering module 100 times.\r\n5. Click on \"Un-Register\" button to dynamically un-register Module B 100 times\r\n6. Check the heap memory again, at this point will see an jump in memory usage on account of un-registering 100 module. \r\n\r\n### What is expected?\r\nHeap memory generated on step 3 & 5 must be cleared after step 6. (Final stage)\r\n\r\n### What is actually happening?\r\nHeap memory of the browser is not getting cleared.\r\n\r\n---\r\nWe are observing memory leak of Store._vm while using registerModule/unregisterModule extensively.\r\nOn heap profiling we found that the oldVm instance is not getting garbage collected.\r\n\r\nProbable Solution:\r\nDe-reference the oldVm instance on the same function scope where its getting instantiated (i.e. resetStoreVM() )\r\n\r\nThe above can be achieved by adding following code inside resetStoreVM function.\r\n\r\noldVm.$destroy(); \r\noldVm = null; // This is the missing code\r\n\r\nAttached google chrome (V 72.0.3626.96) heap snapshot and file.\r\n![heapsnapshot](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/38841241/52727462-4ac0bf80-2fdb-11e9-91ce-7dd012cba4b5.png)\r\n\r\n[Heap-20190213T220212.heaptimeline.zip](https://github.com/vuejs/vuex/files/2861246/Heap-20190213T220212.heaptimeline.zip)\r\n\r\n<!-- generated by vue-issues.
