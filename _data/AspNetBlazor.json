I modified a couple of the instances where fetch is used to XMLHTTPRequest instead and everything worked in an electron application, but still fails in a regular browser due to \"Cross origin requests are only supported for protocol schemes: http, data, chrome, chrome-extension, https.\" which I suspect can be gotten around by coding in a better way.\r\n\r\nI suppose there may be no way around by-passing the browser security to retrieve a local file, but I'm hoping that maybe the fetch could be changed at-least so Blazor can work for Electron apps without a server(even though I've already read that Electron isn't an intended use for Blazor).\r\n\r\nAttached my PoC of Blazor/Electron with my modification to mono.js. Should be able to run it after doing npm install by doing npm start. It's just the sample Blazor app with the counter and fetch request page(which obviously doesn't work without a web server to fetch the data from).\r\n\r\n[ElectronBlazor.zip](https://github.com/aspnet/Blazor/files/2131825/ElectronBlazor.zip)\r\n","Url":"https://github.com/aspnet/Blazor/issues/1037","RelatedDescription":"Open issue \"Unable to run Blazor without a web server...\" (#1037)"},{"Id":"334106737","IsPullRequest":false,"CreatedAt":"2018-06-25T03:52:56","Actor":"edmundhuang","Number":"1028","RawContent":null,"Title":"call IQueryable<T>.Count() will throw exceptions","State":"closed","Body":"It is easy to reproduce the error.    \r\n1.

The web application, patient case management system, requires data entry of multiple forms and as you can imagine each form can contain 100s of fields.

Full server-side Blazor app with limited client-side payload and lots of communication with server\r\n\r\nWhat I would like to understand, would it be an idea to research the idea of streaming app deployments? If I am correct, this is something comparable to how App-V works.\r\n\r\nWhat I mean, we could quickly bootstrap the user experience based on SEO serverside rendering in combination with scenario 2 little payload on the client; much communication with server.\r\nDuring life-time of the app the primary use cases will get downloaded into the client after which no chatty server communication is required anymore and for these use cases scenario 1 gets active.\r\n\r\nThe user subsequently clicks through additional use cases, which trigger additional payloads coming to the client. Eventually all relevant bits will get transfered over and the webapplication can be even used as a progressive webapp with full offline capabilities.\r\nAdditionally a trade-off analyzer could be implemented that drops downloaded bits if the payload client-side gets too huge. E.g. max 100 MB.\r\nOne interesting twist would be an extension (proprietary Windows?) that would enable switching from a PWA to an Electron application transparently without noticable delays :-)\r\n\r\nWhat do you think?","Url":"https://github.com/aspnet/Blazor/issues/1022","RelatedDescription":"Open issue \"Idea: Streaming app deployment\" (#1022)"},{"Id":"333807443","IsPullRequest":false,"CreatedAt":"2018-06-19T20:02:59","Actor":"nativoplus","Number":"1021","RawContent":null,"Title":"Serverless architecture, confused about how I would use Server side mentioned here with Azure functions , event grid and general server less architecture","State":"closed","Body":"I am tracking this project as it grows to move my company to it once it has reached a level of maturity I can feel comfortable with.
