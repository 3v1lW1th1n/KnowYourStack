I check the `this.User` that was passed from the Controller. \r\n\r\nI also check the current context in `_context` - a Singleton you can see in the `Startup.cs`.\r\n\r\nThere is also the `_caller` which is from this line in `Startup.cs`\r\n\r\n    services.AddTransient<ClaimsPrincipal>(s => s.GetService<IHttpContextAccessor>().HttpContext.User);\r\n\r\nWhen I inspect any of those variables, the `Claims` object **does not** contain the same claims as the JWT that was sent during the request. \r\n\r\n**I have verified the claims do not match by checking the claims at [jwt.io][1].**\r\n\r\nTo be specific, I'll give a scenario:\r\n\r\nI sign into my app with email `user@example.com`. That email is then set as a claim (Sub) as `user.UserName` inside the `CreateUserClaims()` function in the `AuthController.cs`:\r\n\r\n    var newClaims = new[]\r\n\t\t\t{\r\n\t\t\t\tnew Claim(JwtRegisteredClaimNames.Sub, user.UserName),\r\n\t\t\t\tnew Claim(JwtRegisteredClaimNames.Jti, Guid.NewGuid().ToString()),\r\n\t\t\t\tnew Claim(JwtRegisteredClaimNames.NameId, user.Id)\r\n\t\t\t}.Union(userClaims).ToList();\r\n\r\nThen some other properties are set and eventually the token is returned to the client. The client stores it in `localStorage`.\r\n\r\nThe client then makes a request, including the JWT in the header and adds it to the request options like this (Angular service):\r\n\r\n    private headers = new Headers(\r\n\t\t{\r\n\t\t\t'Content-Type': 'application/json',\r\n\t\t\t'Authorization': 'Bearer ' + this.authService.token\r\n\t\t});\r\n\tprivate options = new RequestOptions({ headers: this.headers });\r\n\r\nI check the Header in the Network tab and it contains the JWT - I check it on [jwt.io][1] and it looks good - has the proper email and other claims.\r\n\r\nNow I can logout of the app, sign in as a different user, get a new JWT, and make the request to that **same controller** shown above and the JWT will have the previous email, not the new one that I just signed in as. \r\n\r\nAnd I did go through the same checks, checking the JWT in the Header on the Network tab to ensure the claims contain the new email as the `sub` as well as the other claims. \r\n\r\nSo that means I was issued the proper JWT on the new sign in, but somehow the API is still looking at the old JWT.\r\n\r\nHow crazy is that?\r\n\r\nSomething else I have noticed is that even on that first login (pretend I just started the API with `dotnet run` and then I make my first request to the same controller shown above it will be missing the `nameid` claim. I can go check the JWT that was sent in the Header request and it **does have the `nameid` claim.** So, again, **the api will issue the proper JWT but when I send it back over HTTP in a request the API does not have the same JWT that I sent in the request.**\r\n\r\n**ONE MORE THING**\r\nI log the JWT in the console for simplicity. I went back and found the first one I started using today, at 9am. Its `jti` is the same as the one that is currently in the .net core API. It's now 4:45pm. I have 9 different JTWs in my console between those two times (9am and 4:45pm), all issued from the API. But the API seems to have kept the first one it created this morning - even after I have stopped and started the project numerous times.\r\n\r\n\r\nPlease help me understand what I am doing wrong.

I check the `this.User` that was passed from the Controller. \r\n\r\nI also check the current context in `_context` - a Singleton you can see in the `Startup.cs`.\r\n\r\nThere is also the `_caller` which is from this line in `Startup.cs`\r\n\r\n    services.AddTransient<ClaimsPrincipal>(s => s.GetService<IHttpContextAccessor>().HttpContext.User);\r\n\r\nWhen I inspect any of those variables, the `Claims` object **does not** contain the same claims as the JWT that was sent during the request. \r\n\r\n**I have verified the claims do not match by checking the claims at [jwt.io][1].**\r\n\r\nTo be specific, I'll give a scenario:\r\n\r\nI sign into my app with email `user@example.com`. That email is then set as a claim (Sub) as `user.UserName` inside the `CreateUserClaims()` function in the `AuthController.cs`:\r\n\r\n    var newClaims = new[]\r\n\t\t\t{\r\n\t\t\t\tnew Claim(JwtRegisteredClaimNames.Sub, user.UserName),\r\n\t\t\t\tnew Claim(JwtRegisteredClaimNames.Jti, Guid.NewGuid().ToString()),\r\n\t\t\t\tnew Claim(JwtRegisteredClaimNames.NameId, user.Id)\r\n\t\t\t}.Union(userClaims).ToList();\r\n\r\nThen some other properties are set and eventually the token is returned to the client. The client stores it in `localStorage`.\r\n\r\nThe client then makes a request, including the JWT in the header and adds it to the request options like this (Angular service):\r\n\r\n    private headers = new Headers(\r\n\t\t{\r\n\t\t\t'Content-Type': 'application/json',\r\n\t\t\t'Authorization': 'Bearer ' + this.authService.token\r\n\t\t});\r\n\tprivate options = new RequestOptions({ headers: this.headers });\r\n\r\nI check the Header in the Network tab and it contains the JWT - I check it on [jwt.io][1] and it looks good - has the proper email and other claims.\r\n\r\nNow I can logout of the app, sign in as a different user, get a new JWT, and make the request to that **same controller** shown above and the JWT will have the previous email, not the new one that I just signed in as. \r\n\r\nAnd I did go through the same checks, checking the JWT in the Header on the Network tab to ensure the claims contain the new email as the `sub` as well as the other claims. \r\n\r\nSo that means I was issued the proper JWT on the new sign in, but somehow the API is still looking at the old JWT.\r\n\r\nHow crazy is that?\r\n\r\nSomething else I have noticed is that even on that first login (pretend I just started the API with `dotnet run` and then I make my first request to the same controller shown above it will be missing the `nameid` claim. I can go check the JWT that was sent in the Header request and it **does have the `nameid` claim.** So, again, **the api will issue the proper JWT but when I send it back over HTTP in a request the API does not have the same JWT that I sent in the request.**\r\n\r\n**ONE MORE THING**\r\nI log the JWT in the console for simplicity. I went back and found the first one I started using today, at 9am. Its `jti` is the same as the one that is currently in the .net core API. It's now 4:45pm. I have 9 different JTWs in my console between those two times (9am and 4:45pm), all issued from the API. But the API seems to have kept the first one it created this morning - even after I have stopped and started the project numerous times.\r\n\r\n\r\nPlease help me understand what I am doing wrong. I must not be fully understanding how JWTs are handled.\r\n\r\n\r\n  [1]: http://jwt.io"},{"Id":"6776180290","Type":"IssuesEvent","CreatedAt":"2017-10-27T16:49:49","Actor":"gustyn","Repository":"aspnet/Identity","Organization":"aspnet","RawContent":null,"RelatedAction":"opened","RelatedUrl":"https://github.com/aspnet/Identity/issues/1488","RelatedDescription":"Opened issue \"Authentication Cookie not deleted when using HttpContext.SignOutAsync();\" (#1488) at aspnet/Identity","RelatedBody":"Whenever I call the said function, the cookies are never deleted.

This proposal is to create a design-time directive in the Razor language.  The design time directive indicates that the file contents following the directive will be modified by some process. The design-time directive provides hooks and extension points into a cshtml file to enable actions to take place at design time. These can be trigged manually, by Visual Studio, or other processing.\r\n## Design-Time Directive\r\nThe design-time directive is used to communicate with parsers, file processors, and the Razor Engine.\r\n\r\n- It takes the general form: `@[...]`\r\n- It can take parameters: `@[parser, action, parameters]`\r\n- It can have scope: `@[...]{  ...  }`\r\n\r\nThe design-time directive indicates to a process (external or internal) that an area of the file will/can be modified by the process. The directive has no impact on it's own.\r\n\r\nIt is removed at compile time by the Razor Engine from the resulting html.\r\n## Examples\r\n\r\n### Substitution\r\nThe most trivial use of the directive is to insert a group of characters into the file.\r\nGiven - `@[myText] = \"This is some text to repeat.\"`\r\nUsing - `@[myText]`\r\nProduces => `This is some text to repeat.`\r\nThe directive isn't actually replaced. The text is inserted after the directive.\r\nAny characters can be used - text, tags, code.\r\nIn initial cshtml:\r\n```\r\n  @[myText] \r\n```\r\nAfter the substitution process runs, in cshtml:\r\n```\r\n  @[myText]\r\n  This is some text to repeat.\r\n```\r\nIn html:\r\n```\r\n  This is some text to repeat.\r\n```\r\nChanging the text in the assignment changes the results in all files using the directive when the process runs again. Though the directive doesn't technically have impact on it's own, some features like substitution would be built into the environment.\r\n\r\n### Merging\r\nRazor is especially interesting because it can be a mix of many languages - cs, css, js, html. Setting aside the \"correctness\" of putting css or js in an cshtml file, they provide fair examples. In an html/cshtml file, we can include `<script></script>` and `<style></style>` blocks. For the sake of argument, let's say we have a compelling reason to include content inside them in the file. Writing the code in the page is messy, and can be problematic. Worse, many of us prefer Less and Typescript, which we can't write in-page. The `@[]` directive helps.\r\n\r\nWe can write our css in a Less file - `styles.less`, that compiles into `styles.css`, and our js in `scripts.ts`, that compiles into `scripts.js`. We get full editor and intellisense support. In our `Page.cshml` we can include the results.\r\n```\r\n  @[style, \"~/styles.css\"]\r\n     ... The contents of styles.css are copied into the page here, in a <style> block.\r\n  @[script, \"~/scripts.js]\r\n     ... The contents of scripts.js are copied into the page here in a <script> block.\r\n```\r\nThis happens during design - the file content is modified, triggered manually, by the IDE, or an extension. For example, after Web Essentials compiles a Less file into css, it could also update the pages that reference the css file through design-time directives. Though the end result is much like `@render`, we get a local copy that provides access to the internals, and allows modification if we turn \"auto-update\" off.\r\n\r\nSelectors help keep files small. If we just need a couple of styles or functions, we can only copy them.\r\n```\r\n  @[style, \"~/styles.css\", { .form-controls-block, .nav-link } ]\r\n  @[script, \"~/scripts.js\", { datepicker } ]\r\n```\r\nThis would pull the two styles and single function out of the files, and insert them into the page inside`<style>` and `<script>` blocks. This can be helpful in building small, self-contained, and lightweight components.\r\n\r\n### Templates\r\nHtml Templating is another other possibility. This can be used in regular files or in template/scaffolding engines. An overly simple example is the common label-input-validation set - \r\n  `<label asp-for=\"ModelProperty\"><input asp-for=\"ModelProperty\"></input><...validationstuff...`\r\nThere are many ways to approach this, but one could be (in a cshtml) \r\n```\r\n@[]{\r\n  form-line = \"<label asp-for=\"@[param]\" ... \" \r\n}\r\n\r\n@[form-line, param=\"ModelProperty\"]\r\n   ... Fragment is expanded here, with replacement.\r\n```\r\nTemplates are like advanced, dynamic Snippets, and can be defined in the page or in shared files. They can auto update, or be manually triggered.\r\n\r\n### Targeting\r\nWhen we know we are running a file processor over the file, we can define targets. This can make the processor more efficient, and the file easier to parse. The processor can look for tagged areas to process, or even exclude.\r\n```\r\n  @[fileProcessorName, processingAction, exclude] {\r\n       ... This section is skipped by fileProcessorName when executing processingAction \r\n         - if it is aware of design-time directives.\r\n  }\r\n```\r\n## Discussion Scope\r\nThis proposal isn't about any of the specific examples, but about the concept of being able to provide information to processes that manipulate code files. And if so, is `@[]` a good construct to use? More and more, we run processes against these files - from built-in formatting processes, to refactoring, to analysis processes. A standard way to communicate with these processors might be valuable. \r\n\r\n## Outside the Proposal\r\nThe concept can also extend into other languages.\r\nThough advanced, this could allow things like name refactoring for related items in different technologies. For example, a C# class and Typescript class could have a design-time association. Changing one triggers changes to the other. This is a design-time change - the files are modified directly. The association doesn't exist at compile or run time. This would be a long time coming, but shows possible potential of the overall concept. \r\n"},{"Id":"6784783224","Type":"PullRequestEvent","CreatedAt":"2017-10-30T16:15:29","Actor":"natemcmaster","Repository":"aspnet/Razor","Organization":"aspnet","RawContent":null,"RelatedAction":"merged","RelatedUrl":"https://github.com/aspnet/Razor/pull/1746","RelatedDescription":"Merged pull request \"Skip building the VSIX if the Microsoft.VisualStudio.Component.VSSDK workload is not available\" (#1746) at aspnet/Razor","RelatedBody":"Uses the new \"toolsets\" section of korebuild.json to find a version of MSBuild in Visual Studio that has the required VSIX SDK.\r\n\r\nBehavior: this currently warns if a version of VS with this workload could not be found and skips building the VSIX.

(Typically your Program class) If you don't have this method ```WebApplicationTestFixture<TStartup>``` won't be able to initialize your app in the same way it is done on a normal run. You can configure the WebHostBuilder yourself by overriding CreateWebHostBuilder on ```WebApplicationTestFixture<TStartup>```.\r\n\r\n### The test infrastructure needs to know the content root of the application under test\r\nTo set the content root for your app, ```WebApplicationTestFixture<TStartup>``` first locate your solution file ```(.sln)``` and then make a guess about where project might be. The Content Root of the application is defined by convention as ```<<SolutionFolder>>/<<ProjectAssemblyName>>```. For example, based on the folder structure defined below, the content root of the application is defined as ```c:\\work\\MyApp```. This is important because if not set correctly to the root folder of your application under test all views and static files will not be found.\r\n\r\n```\r\nc:/work/\r\n    MyApp.sln\r\n    MyApp/MyApp.csproj\r\n    MyApp.FunctionalTests/MyApp.FunctionalTests.csproj\r\n```\r\n\r\nThe process for determining the folder to use as the content root when running the tests is the following:\r\n* ```WebApplicationTestFixture<TStartup>``` starts on the bin folder of the test project, in the example above ```c:/work/MyApp.FunctionalTests/MyApp.FunctionalTests/bin/<<Configuration>>/<<Framework>>```\r\n* It navigates to the parent folder until it finds a ```.sln``` file.\r\n* It appends ```<<AssemblyName>>``` to the folder in which it found the ```.sln``` file and set that as the content root.\r\n\r\nIf you happen to be using a different convention for the layout of your projects, you can inherit from WebApplicationTestFixture and pass in the relative path from your solution to the application under test when calling the constructor. For example ```\"/src/MyApp\"```\r\n\r\n```csharp\r\npublic class MyAppTestFixture<TStartup> : WebApplicationTestFixture<TStartup> where TStartup : class\r\n{\r\n    public MyAppTestFixture(string solutionRelativePath)\r\n        : base(\"/src/MyApp\") { }\r\n}\r\n```"},{"Id":"6754805124","Type":"IssuesEvent","CreatedAt":"2017-10-23T21:16:00","Actor":"Eilon","Repository":"aspnet/Announcements","Organization":"aspnet","RawContent":null,"RelatedAction":"opened","RelatedUrl":"https://github.com/aspnet/Announcements/issues/274","RelatedDescription":"Opened issue \"ASP.NET/EF Core 2.0.3 patch pre-release test feed\" (#274) at aspnet/Announcements","RelatedBody":"Hi, we now have a public test feed that you can use to try out the ASP.NET/EF Core 2.0.3 patch!\r\n\r\nYou can test this pre-release patch by adding the following feed to your app's or machine's NuGet.config file:\r\n* `https://dotnet.myget.org/F/aspnet-2-0-2-october2017-patch-public/api/v3/index.json`\r\n   * ![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/202643/31913542-4757d2a0-b7fc-11e7-9bf7-7157bd18a6ca.png)\r\n   * (please ignore the *name* of the feed; it is incorrect 😦)\r\n\r\n## Update your project\r\n1.

The Microsoft.AspNetCore.Authentication.WsFederation 2.0.0-preview1 package is available at https://www.nuget.org/packages/Microsoft.AspNetCore.Authentication.WsFederation/. This is a standalone preview that targets netstandard2.0 and should work with existing ASP.NET Core 2.0.0 applications (.NET Core 2.0 or .NET 4.6.1). A non-preview ASP.NET Core 2.0.0 compatible package will follow once we’ve addressed your feedback.\r\n \r\nThe code is available at https://github.com/aspnet/security/tree/rel/2.0.0-ws-preview1 and issues can be filed at https://github.com/aspnet/security/issues. Please give us a 👍 from the reactions menu on the linked discussion post if you have successfully used this component and are ready for the final release.\r\n \r\nThis component is a port from Microsoft.Owin.Security.WsFederation and uses many of the same mechanics. It has also been updated to integrate with ASP.NET Core 2.0’s authentication model. See the samples below.\r\n \r\nAside from updating the usage pattern to match ASP.NET Core, there are also some functional changes to be aware of.\r\nA.\tThis component no longer checks every form post request for sign-in messages by default. Sign-in callbacks are restricted to the \"/signin-wsfed\" path by default. The CallbackPath can be changed to the application root “/” used by some auth providers if you also enable SkipUnrecognizedRequests to allow sharing that request path with other components.\r\nB.\tThis component no longer allows unsolicited logins by default. That WsFederation protocol feature is susceptible to XSRF attacks. See the AllowUnsolicitedLogins option to opt into that feature if your application requires it.\r\n\r\nSee https://github.com/aspnet/Security/issues/1473 for discussion.\r\n \r\nSamples:\r\n \r\nFor applications only using WsFederation (similar to using OpenIdConnect):\r\n \r\n        public void ConfigureServices(IServiceCollection services)\r\n        {\r\n            services.AddAuthentication(sharedOptions =>\r\n            {\r\n                sharedOptions.DefaultScheme = CookieAuthenticationDefaults.AuthenticationScheme;\r\n                sharedOptions.DefaultSignInScheme = CookieAuthenticationDefaults.AuthenticationScheme;\r\n                sharedOptions.DefaultChallengeScheme = WsFederationDefaults.AuthenticationScheme;\r\n            })\r\n            .AddWsFederation(options =>\r\n            {\r\n                options.Wtrealm = Configuration[\"wsfed:realm\"];\r\n                options.MetadataAddress = Configuration[\"wsfed:metadata\"];\r\n            })\r\n            .AddCookie();\r\n        }\r\n \r\n        public void Configure(IApplicationBuilder app)\r\n        {\r\n           app.UseAuthentication();\r\n \r\n                         // …\r\n        }\r\n \r\nFor applications using WsFederation with Identity:\r\n \r\n            services.AddAuthentication()\r\n                .AddWsFederation(options =>\r\n                {\r\n                    options.Wtrealm = Configuration[\"wsfed:realm\"];\r\n                    options.MetadataAddress = Configuration[\"wsfed:metadata\"];\r\n                });\r\n"}],"ResultType":"GitHubEvent"},"Twitter":{"ResultType":"TwitterTimeline","Tweets":[{"Id":"917884946324250624","CreatedAt":"2017-10-10T22:49:59+00:00","UserScreenname":"aspnet","Text":"The #aspnet Community Standup starts now - https://t.co/4Ioo9jNSN2","Source":"<a href=\"https://about.twitter.com/products/tweetdeck\" rel=\"nofollow\">TweetDeck</a>","RetweetCount":12,"FavoriteCount":9,"RawContent":null},{"Id":"917877107904036865","CreatedAt":"2017-10-10T22:18:50+00:00","UserScreenname":"aspnet","Text":"Join us in a half hour (3:45 PM Pacific) for this week's #aspnet Community Standup at https://t.co/4Ioo9jNSN2","Source":"<a href=\"https://about.twitter.com/products/tweetdeck\" rel=\"nofollow\">TweetDeck</a>","RetweetCount":10,"FavoriteCount":3,"RawContent":null},{"Id":"915262407743647744","CreatedAt":"2017-10-03T17:08:57+00:00","UserScreenname":"aspnet","Text":"We're live at https://t.co/4Ioo9jNSN2 for the exciting #SignalR deep dive.
