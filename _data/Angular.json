I have some \"reader\" page with infinite scroll that loads next chapter when user scrolls near to of a page. When some chapter enters view-port, I change browser URL to this chapter without triggering navigation (using `Location.replaceState`). \r\n\r\nIf users scroll to some next chapter and then reload page or go back/forward in history, they lost scroll position, because saved scroll position (on page with several chapters) is greater then reloaded page length (on page with only \"last\" chapter)\r\n\r\nThe idea was to use `history.state` to save scroll position relative to current chapter top.\r\n\r\n### Problems\r\nSaving position was pretty straightforward, because `Location.replaceState` method already has state property. But restoring this state is a pain.\r\n\r\nThanks to #27198 router already knows something about history state, current design/implementation isn't enough do described use case. I didn't figure out why we need both `NavigationStart.restoredState` and `NavigationExtras.state`, but despite similar description, they are not the same. \r\n\r\nRouter itself lacks public method that behaves like `Location.replaceState` (#24617), and any \"outside\" changes to `history.state` are not available as `NavigationExtras.state` of `Router.getCurrentNavigation()`, but only available as `NavigationStart.restoredState`. There is private `setBrowserUrl` method, that can be used for public implementation.\r\n\r\n`NavigationStart.restoredState` of initial page load can't be reached inside component that is responsible for text rendering (i.e. in the place, which knows chapter top offset, where we need to add saved scroll position), because initial `NavigationStart` is fired before any component (except of `AppComponent`) is created. And there is no way to get this value otherwise, except of catching it in `AppComponent` and saving in some service.\r\n\r\nBuy the way workaround from https://github.com/angular/angular/pull/27198#issuecomment-453789450 to pass `NavigationStart.restoredState` as `NavigationExtras.state` doesn't work (any more?) because of resetting `currentNavigation` [here](https://github.com/angular/angular/blob/7.2.6/packages/router/src/router.ts#L711) in case of \"redirect during NavigationStart\".\r\n\r\nAnd even if we can get `NavigationStart.restoredState` in such hackish way, there is no sense to do this, because of bug. We don't get load any stored state from history in initial navigation (see `null` in [line 951](https://github.com/angular/angular/blob/7.2.6/packages/router/src/router.ts#L951) called from [line 778](https://github.com/angular/angular/blob/7.2.6/packages/router/src/router.ts#L778))\r\n\r\nActually we don't even have a way to get this initial state, because all classes on the way from `Location`, through `LocationStrategy`, `PathLocationStrategy`, `PlatformLocation`, `BrowserPlatformLocation` up to `History` lacks an abstraction to get current state.\r\n\r\nHopefully we still can access `window.history.state` directly. But again, we cann't do it in the component code, because before we create component, router already resets saves `history.state` with `{navigationId:1}`. So I still need to write some hackish way to store this value somewhere before first `ActivationStart` event.\r\n\r\n### Describe the solution you'd like\r\nI'd like to have a way to straightforwardly call something on router to replace current state and than be able to get this state in `Scroll` router event. I want this state to be persistently saved even after page reload to moving back/forward outside of angular application. \r\n\r\nI don't really care how it will be implemented internally, but just fixing problems above should be enough.\r\n\r\nRouter should have it's own `replaceState` (or something) method, that encapsulate any logic around  `Location.replaceState` to handle `navigationId` or any other possible future angular-specific internal structure of `history.state` (#27607) and also to provide state as `NavigationExtras.state` instead of `NavigationStart.restoredState`.\r\n\r\n### Describe alternatives you've considered\r\nThis section is mostly for someone looking for solution for exactly my use case. \r\nWorkaround I came up with consists of two parts. \r\nFirst - I use resolver to get saved data directly from `window.history.state`.\r\nSecond - because of the same reason I can get data on initial page load - I receive wrong data on navigating away to another chapter. What do I mean? Consider following use case:\r\n- Initial page load without history. \r\n- No data in history -> no scrolling to position.\r\n- Scroll a bit, position is saved to history.\r\n- Reload page. \r\n- Router will rewrite history only on ActivationStart, so we get correct data in resolver. \r\n- There is data from resolver -> scroll to saved position.\r\n- Scroll a bit, position is saved to history.\r\n- Navigate to another chapter directly (there is contents feature in my app). \r\n- _Router will rewrite history only on ActivationStart_, so we get **incorrect** data of previous chapter in resolver.\r\n- There is data from resolver -> we scroll to incorrect saved position of previous chapter.\r\n\r\nTo workaround this problem, I save chapter id together with scroll position, so I can check is this data is relevant.\r\nFinal code looks something like this:\r\n\r\nprogress-resolver.service.ts:\r\n```TypeScript\r\nimport { Inject, Injectable, PLATFORM_ID } from '@angular/core';\r\nimport { isPlatformBrowser } from \"@angular/common\";\r\nimport { ActivatedRouteSnapshot, Resolve, RouterStateSnapshot } from \"@angular/router\";\r\n\r\ninterface Progress {\r\n  scroll: number,\r\n  chapterId: number,\r\n}\r\n\r\n@Injectable({\r\n  providedIn: 'root'\r\n})\r\nexport class ProgressResolverService implements Resolve<Progress | null> {\r\n\r\n  constructor(@Inject(PLATFORM_ID) private platformId: Object) {\r\n  }\r\n\r\n  resolve(route: ActivatedRouteSnapshot, state: RouterStateSnapshot): Progress | null {\r\n    if (isPlatformBrowser(this.platformId) && window && window.history && window.history.state && window.history.state.progress) {\r\n      return {\r\n        scroll: window.history.state.scroll,\r\n        chapterId: window.history.state.chapterId,\r\n      };\r\n    }\r\n    return null;\r\n  }\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nchapter-text.component.ts:\r\n```TypeScript\r\nimport { AfterViewInit, Component, ElementRef, Input, OnDestroy, ViewChild } from '@angular/core';\r\nimport { OnScrollService } from \"../on-scroll/on-scroll.service\";\r\nimport { ActivatedRoute } from \"@angular/router\";\r\nimport { Location, ViewportScroller } from \"@angular/common\";\r\nimport { debounceTime, filter, map } from \"rxjs/operators\";\r\nimport { Subscription } from \"rxjs\";\r\n\r\n@Component({\r\n  selector: 'app-chapter-text',\r\n  templateUrl: './chapter-text.component.html',\r\n  styleUrls: ['./chapter-text.component.scss']\r\n})\r\nexport class ChapterTextComponent implements OnDestroy, AfterViewInit {\r\n  @Input() chapter: any;\r\n  private progressSub: Subscription;\r\n  private subscription: Subscription;\r\n  private position: { top: number; height: number };\r\n\r\n  constructor(\r\n    private elem: ElementRef,\r\n    private route: ActivatedRoute,\r\n    private onScroll: OnScrollService,\r\n    private location: Location,\r\n    private viewportScroller: ViewportScroller,\r\n  ) {\r\n  }\r\n\r\n  ngAfterViewInit() {\r\n    this.position = {\r\n      top: this.elem.nativeElement.offsetTop,\r\n      height: this.elem.nativeElement.offsetHeight\r\n    };\r\n    this.subscribe();\r\n  }\r\n\r\n  subscribe() {\r\n    this.subscription = this.onScroll.scroll.pipe(\r\n      filter(scroll => this.position.top < scroll && scroll < this.position.top + this.position.height),\r\n      debounceTime(100),\r\n    ).subscribe(scroll => this.location.replaceState(this.chapter.url, undefined, {\r\n      ...window.history.state,\r\n      scroll,\r\n      chapterId: this.chapter.chapterId\r\n    }));\r\n    \r\n    this.progressSub = this.route.data.pipe(\r\n      map(data => data.progress),\r\n      filter(progress => progress && this.chapter.chapterId == progress.chapterId),\r\n      map(progress => progress.scroll),\r\n    ).subscribe(scroll => this.viewportScroller.scrollToPosition([0, scroll]));\r\n  }\r\n\r\n  ngOnDestroy() {\r\n    this.subscription.unsubscribe();\r\n    this.progressSub.unsubscribe();\r\n  }\r\n}\r\n```\r\n","Url":"https://github.com/angular/angular/issues/28954","RelatedDescription":"Open issue \"Improve router work with `history.state`\" (#28954)"},{"Id":"413838176","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2019-02-24T16:15:40","Actor":"crisbeto","Number":"28952","RawContent":null,"Title":"test(ivy): update root causes for material menu","State":"open","Body":"Updates the root causes for the remaining `MatMenu` tests.

It is possible that contrasting styles/different themes are applied (see primary vs. secondary in material design https://material.io/design/color/the-color-system.html#color-theme-creation). We should be able to apply contrasting styles to material elements in different components. Material components should migrate out of ViewEncapsulation.None to prevent style leaking.\r\n\r\n#### What is the current behavior?\r\n\r\nA number of material elements use ViewEncapsulation.None (example: https://github.com/angular/material2/blob/master/src/lib/form-field/form-field.ts) . It is a known issue that this encapsulation mode leaks styling of the **from** component to the **to** component.
