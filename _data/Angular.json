It also includes a tiny fix: ``only back up the original `prepublishOnly` script and not the overwritten one``\r\n\r\nSee the individual commit messages for more details.\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n**Notes on testing**\r\n\r\nI have added unit tests for all added/modified code except for the `ClusterMaster` class, because:\r\n- It mostly orchestrates other parts (that are independently tested).\r\n- The most important parts of its functionality are covered by integration tests.\r\n- I didn't want to spend too much time on testing it before a first review (in case the implementation changed drastically).\r\n\r\nThe integration tests at [ngcc/test/integration/ngcc_spec.ts](https://github.com/angular/angular/blob/f5bec3ff5/packages/compiler-cli/ngcc/test/integration/ngcc_spec.ts), which are run under bazel, don't play well with spawning multiple processes, so they are only run on one process (which means they don't exercise the `ClusterExecutor`).\r\n\r\nThe integration tests at [integration/ngcc/test.sh](https://github.com/angular/angular/blob/f5bec3ff5/integration/ngcc/test.sh) do run in parallel mode (and only in that mode, since that is the only option with `ivy-ngcc`).\r\n\r\nOther than that, I have manually verified that `ngcc` can successfully build angular.io in parallel mode (with various command-line argument combinations) and that the resulting `node_modules/`are identical to those produced in sync mode with the following exceptions:\r\n- `package.json > __processed_by_ivy_ngcc__` might have properties in different order.\r\n    _This is expected, since now the order is which tests are run/completed is different and non-deterministic._\r\n- Some generated variable names can be different (mostly(/only?) noticed in UMD bundles). E.g. `data_r50` vs `data_r450`.\r\n    _Not sure why that is and whether it is problematic._\r\n\r\n##\r\n**Notes on performance**\r\n\r\nFor processing angular.io, I have observed speed improvement between 1.8x (on my Windows laptop - 7 workers) to 2.6x (on Linux CI - 8 workers). This was a little surprizing, since task processing (which runs on multiple processes) takes up 80%-90% and all workers are busy most of the time (i.e. there are rarely idle workers).\r\n\r\nMore investigation is needed to better understand/improve those numbers, but this can happen after the PR lands.\r\n\r\nFun fact:\r\nThere doesn't seem to be much improvement above 4 workers. Even with up to 20 workers on CI, the duration was the same (if not worse: 29s vs 23s).\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n**TODO**\r\n\r\n- [ ] Get the PR reviewed.\r\n- [ ] Determine whether the differences in variable names (in UMD bundles?) are an issue.\r\n- [ ] Determine whether we need unit tests for `ClusterMaster`.\r\n","Url":"https://github.com/angular/angular/pull/32427","RelatedDescription":"Open PR \"perf(ngcc): add support for parallel execution of tasks\" (#32427)"},{"Id":"487670834","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2019-08-30T21:05:38","Actor":"rkirov","Number":"32425","RawContent":null,"Title":"refactor(benchpress): remove two mutable exports from largetable/util.ts","State":"open","Body":"Mutable exports, i.e. using this pattern\r\n\r\n```\r\nexport let x = 0;\r\nexport function f() {\r\n  x += 1;\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nis problematic to transpile to CommonJS and Goog.module systems, we are\r\nworking on banning it google internal codebase.

This also happens with build --watch, the created bundles are corrupt(!)(!)**_ You have to restart the build / serve task completely.\r\n\r\nSo far the workarounds are (one Of):\r\n- Inline SCSS changes do not cause break\r\n- Disable aot for ng serve\r\n- Disable ivy for ng serve \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n#### Reproduction\r\nGithub Repo: https://github.com/kqadem/ivy-test\r\n\r\nSteps to reproduce:\r\n1. npm start\r\n2. change sth in src/app/app.component.scss, linebreak is enough\r\n3. refresh browser \r\n \r\n#### Expected Behavior\r\nI was expection the usual behaviour --> Run without any issues\r\n\r\n#### Actual Behavior\r\nError at bootstrap / startup / Initializing with following error:\r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/5240450/63797906-4883da00-c909-11e9-9c10-4d90ea23a589.png)\r\n\r\n#### Environment\r\n\r\n- Angular: 8.2.0 (error still happens with 9-next)\r\n- CDK/Material: 8.1.4\r\n- Browser(s): Chrome 76\r\n- Operating System (e.g. Windows, macOS, Ubuntu): So far tested on Windows 7 and Ubuntu 19.04\r\n","Url":"https://github.com/angular/angular/issues/32426","RelatedDescription":"Open issue \"mat-table + ivy + elements + serve + scss = error\" (#32426)"}],"ResultType":"GitHubIssue"},"AngularCli-Issues":{"Issues":[{"Id":"488312891","IsPullRequest":false,"CreatedAt":"2019-09-02T20:39:17","Actor":"Leemonn","Number":"15508","RawContent":null,"Title":"Can't login on Ubuntu while a terminal is running with ng serve","State":"open","Body":"As title says, If my computer goes to log in screen (because of inactivity) while I have a terminal running \"ng serve\" it won't let me log in, authentication will fail all the time.\r\n\r\nUbuntu version: 18.04\r\nAngular: 6\r\nCommand used: \"sudo ng serve\"\r\n\r\nThanks in advance.","Url":"https://github.com/angular/angular-cli/issues/15508","RelatedDescription":"Open issue \"Can't login on Ubuntu while a terminal is running with ng serve\" (#15508)"},{"Id":"488262707","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2019-09-02T16:31:43","Actor":"alan-agius4","Number":"15507","RawContent":null,"Title":"fix(@angular-devkit/build-angular): mangle scripts when differential loading is enabled","State":"open","Body":"Previously scripts.js were not being mangled\r\n\r\nCloses #15489","Url":"https://github.com/angular/angular-cli/pull/15507","RelatedDescription":"Open PR \"fix(@angular-devkit/build-angular): mangle scripts when differential loading is enabled\" (#15507)"},{"Id":"488248038","IsPullRequest":false,"CreatedAt":"2019-09-02T15:46:11","Actor":"slavoroi","Number":"15506","RawContent":null,"Title":"ng serve doesn't support apps that use routes that don't begin with deployUrl","State":"open","Body":"# üêû Bug report\r\nIn case you want to serve your static files with a prefix, and use deployUrl in the serve.options.deployUrl section and route to a route that doesn't begin with this deployUrl the index.html isn't served.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Description\r\nWe want to serve all of our static files in the index.html with a certain prefix (to distinguish micro frontend apps with our proxy), for example:\r\n'user-management'.

The code gets removed correctly if the `vendorChunk` option is turned off.\r\n\r\n\r\n## üî¨ Minimal Reproduction\r\nTo reproduce the issue  and run `ng build --prod`. Once the build is finished, go to the `dist` directory and open the `vendor` bundle.\r\n\r\n1. [Clone this repo](https://github.com/crisbeto/ivy-tree-shaking-bug).\r\n2. Run `npm install`.\r\n3. Run `ng build --prod`.\r\n4. Go into the `dist` directory and open the `vendor` bundle file. It should be called something like `vendor-es5.e7633243d6659fd2e6e7.js`.\r\n5. Prettify the file so it's more readable.\r\n\r\nAt this point try doing a code search for `ng:///`. You should get some code that looks like this:\r\n\r\n```js\r\nObject.defineProperty(t, ie, {\r\nconfigurable: !0,\r\nget: function () {\r\n    return null === i && (i = It().compileNgModule(_p, \"ng:///\" + t.name + \"/ngModuleDef.js\", {\r\n    type: t,\r\n    bootstrap: qt(e.bootstrap || bp).map(gt),\r\n    declarations: r.map(gt),\r\n    imports: qt(e.imports || bp).map(gt).map(Sp),\r\n    exports: qt(e.exports || bp).map(gt).map(Sp),\r\n    emitInline: !0,\r\n    schemas: e.schemas ? qt(e.schemas) : null,\r\n    id: e.id || null\r\n    })), i\r\n}\r\n});\r\n```\r\n\r\nSince the code is mangled it's a little hard to tell, but these `ng:///` strings come from some JIT-specific code in `@angular/core` that is originally here: https://github.com/angular/angular/blob/master/packages/core/src/render3/jit/directive.ts#L108. This code is only relevant in JIT mode and it shouldn't be in the AOT-compiled production bundle. \r\n\r\nTo illustrate the point that the `vendorChunk` option is causing the code to be retained, you can turn off the `vendorChunk` flag in the `angular.json`, run the build again and observe that the code isn't there anymore.\r\n\r\nAlso this project was created by running `ng new` and then changing the `vendorChunk` option in the `angular.json`.\r\n\r\n## üåç Your Environment\r\n<pre><code>\r\n@angular-devkit/architect         0.900.0-next.2\r\n@angular-devkit/build-angular     0.900.0-next.2\r\n@angular-devkit/build-optimizer   0.900.0-next.2\r\n@angular-devkit/build-webpack     0.900.0-next.2\r\n@angular-devkit/core              9.0.0-next.2\r\n@angular-devkit/schematics        9.0.0-next.2\r\n@angular/cli                      9.0.0-next.2\r\n@ngtools/webpack                  9.0.0-next.2\r\n@schematics/angular               9.0.0-next.2\r\n@schematics/update                0.900.0-next.2\r\nrxjs                              6.4.0\r\ntypescript                        3.5.3\r\nwebpack                           4.39.3\r\n\r\n</code></pre>\r\n\r\n","Url":"https://github.com/angular/angular-cli/issues/15505","RelatedDescription":"Open issue \"JIT code not being tree shaken with Ivy and a vendor chunk\" (#15505)"},{"Id":"488175716","IsPullRequest":false,"CreatedAt":"2019-09-02T12:52:28","Actor":"rcarjan","Number":"15504","RawContent":null,"Title":"Libraries / modules not loaded when editing component template","State":"open","Body":"<!--üîÖüîÖüîÖüîÖüîÖüîÖüîÖüîÖüîÖüîÖüîÖüîÖüîÖüîÖüîÖüîÖüîÖüîÖüîÖüîÖüîÖüîÖüîÖüîÖüîÖüîÖüîÖüîÖüîÖüîÖüîÖ\r\n\r\nOh hi there! üòÑ\r\n\r\nTo expedite issue processing please search open and closed issues before submitting a new one.\r\nExisting issues often contain information about workarounds, resolution, or progress updates.\r\n\r\nüîÖüîÖüîÖüîÖüîÖüîÖüîÖüîÖüîÖüîÖüîÖüîÖüîÖüîÖüîÖüîÖüîÖüîÖüîÖüîÖüîÖüîÖüîÖüîÖüîÖüîÖüîÖüîÖüîÖüîÖüîÖüîÖüîÖ-->\r\n\r\n\r\n# üêû Bug report\r\n\r\n### Command (mark with an `x`)\r\n```\r\n- [ ] new\r\n- [ ] build\r\n- [x] serve\r\n- [ ] test\r\n- [ ] e2e\r\n- [ ] generate\r\n- [ ] add\r\n- [ ] update\r\n- [ ] lint\r\n- [ ] xi18n\r\n- [ ] run\r\n- [ ] config\r\n- [ ] help\r\n- [ ] version\r\n- [ ] doc\r\n```\r\n\r\n### Is this a regression?\r\n\r\nNo (not sure?)\r\n\r\n\r\n### Description\r\n\r\nHello,\r\nI am having an issue when editing a component inside my project.

version is `8.9.0`\n-   move all sass (`includePaths`, `importer`, `functions`) options to the `sassOptions` option. The `functions` option can't be used as `Function`, you should use `sassOption` as `Function` to achieve this.\n-   the `data` option was renamed to the `prependData` option\n-   default value of the `sourceMap` option depends on the `devtool` value (`eval`/`false` values don't enable source map generation)\n\n##### Features\n\n-   automatically use the `fibers` package if it is possible ([#&#8203;744](https://togithub.com/webpack-contrib/sass-loader/issues/744)) ([96184e1](https://togithub.com/webpack-contrib/sass-loader/commit/96184e1))\n-   source map generation depends on the `devtool` option ([#&#8203;743](https://togithub.com/webpack-contrib/sass-loader/issues/743)) ([fcea88e](https://togithub.com/webpack-contrib/sass-loader/commit/fcea88e))\n-   validate loader options ([#&#8203;737](https://togithub.com/webpack-contrib/sass-loader/issues/737)) ([7b543fc](https://togithub.com/webpack-contrib/sass-loader/commit/7b543fc))\n-   reworked error handling from `node-sass`/`sass`\n-   improve resolution for `@import` (including support `_index` and `index` files in a directory)\n\n##### Bug Fixes\n\n-   compatibility with `pnp`\n\n##### [7.3.1](https://togithub.com/webpack-contrib/sass-loader/compare/v7.3.0...v7.3.1) (2019-08-20)\n\n##### Bug Fixes\n\n-   minimum `node` version in `package.json` ([#&#8203;733](https://togithub.com/webpack-contrib/sass-loader/issues/733)) ([1175920](https://togithub.com/webpack-contrib/sass-loader/commit/1175920))\n\n</details>\n\n---\n\n### Renovate configuration\n\n:date: **Schedule**: \"after 10pm every weekday,before 4am every weekday,every weekend\" in timezone America/Tijuana.\n\n:vertical_traffic_light: **Automerge**: Disabled by config.
