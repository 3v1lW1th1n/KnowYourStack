I'm also integrating this into an existing (large) codebase so I'm trying to keep all the state local to the components (no Vuex or global Vue data at all).\r\n\r\nEx.\r\n```\r\n<datatable api-endoint=\"/api/v1/orders.json\">\r\n    <datepicker filter-on=\"signupDate\" title=\"Signed Up\"></datepicker>\r\n    <datepicker filter-on=\"lastActiveDate\" title=\"Last Active\"></datepicker>\r\n    // etc\r\n</datatable>\r\n```\r\n\r\nI'd love for this datepicker to be a generic date picker that can emit a \"data-selected\" event with the date the user selected and then wherever it's used in the application the parent can simply listen for the event and take action (in this case re-querying the data with a date filter). Right now I have to tightly couple the datepicker to the datatable component to fire off the datatable's filtering.\r\n\r\nI'm just not sure I've seen a coherent argument for _not_ allowing the parent to listen for the events.\r\n\r\nWhat I've seen as a response seems to be singularly that slots won't necessarily be a single element, but why's that an issue?\r\n\r\n> It can end up rendering anything: text, plain element, multiple nodes... the behavior will be unpredictable.\r\n\r\nand\r\n\r\n> As explained in #4332, it doesn't make sense to add listeners on <slot> because <slot> doesn't always render only a single element.\r\n\r\nIt should be no different than in Javascript with `addEventListener` that can be triggered from any number of child nodes.\r\n\r\n### What does the proposed API look like?\r\nAllow a component with a <slot> to listen to events emitted from that <slot>\r\n\r\n<!-- generated by vue-issues.

When setting it to a value on click, I should get an error during runtime (and preferably also during compilation, since such an error wouldn't show up when the component isn't enabled which can lead to bugs only found at runtime. That is a problem correct usage of TypeScript could solve).\r\n\r\n(2) I also use the property 'test2' in my template, which gives an error, during runtime. Though I would also expect this error during compilation.\r\n\r\n### What is actually happening?\r\n(1) In the first example I would expect to get an error both during runtime and compilation. I get no error at all right now (when setting a value in a click handler, instead calling a method would invoke an error, during runtime, if that method didn't exist on the component).\r\n\r\n(2) In the second example I would expect an error during compilation as well, which I don't get.\r\n\r\n---\r\nThese issues might be related, not sure:\r\n- https://github.com/vuejs/vetur/issues/209\r\n- https://github.com/vuejs/vetur/issues/873\r\n\r\nAutocompletion in IDEs (e.g. Intellij / Webstorm) using TypeScript also isn't that great yet, as it doesn't seem to recognize that the template belongs to the class, but that is probably a different issue.\r\n\r\nThanks in advance!\r\n\r\n<!-- generated by vue-issues.

rows is very slow!","State":"closed","Body":"Hi - I am trying to render a long list of items through a number of fixed cells in a home made grid with around 50 fixed rows.  When I scroll I read out different values from a Vuex store data property with around 5000 rows.   \r\nSo it is important to understand that I do **not** create new cells or rows, _Once created I merely update their content upon scrolling_.\r\n\r\n```javascript\r\n<template>\r\n    <div ref=\"mygridcell\" class='vg-data-cell' v-bind:style='mhstyle'>\r\n            \r\n            <span>{{ thevalue }}</span>\r\n\r\n        </div>\r\n</template>\r\n```\r\n```javascript\r\n\r\n...partial...\r\n\r\nexport default Vue.extend({\r\n    props: ['rowNo', 'colDef', 'rowNoVis'],\r\n    data: () => new MyData(),\r\n    computed: {\r\n        thevalue (): string {\r\n            let row = this.$store.state.rowsPrepared[this.rowNo];\r\n            return row[\"lastName\"];\r\n        },\r\n   \r\n```\r\nI am using a Vuex store and have a property on its state called 'rowsPrepared' that contains the 5000 rows.\r\n\r\n### The problem\r\nWhen I start scrolling and read out the values for the cells through the 'rowsPrepared' Vuex property it is **dreadfully slow**.\r\nHowever, if I read the data from a stand-alone static (non observed) data object containing the 5000 rows it is super fast!  \r\n\r\nWhy is reading from an 'observable' vuex property so slow and is there a way around it?\r\n\r\nWhat I have done is attach the 'rowsPrepared' property _after the store is created_ so it is not observed and indeed, scrolling is super fast.  However, if an item changes its value it is not automatically tracked so I will be forced to do a hacky refresh - stuff that is meant to be done by Vue itself l!!\r\n\r\nAny help much appreciated!\r\n\r\n","Url":"https://github.com/vuejs/vue/issues/8637","RelatedDescription":"Closed issue \"Lookup from a Vuex observed property containing many rows is very slow!\" (#8637)"},{"Id":"349705461","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2018-08-11T04:42:36","Actor":"st-sloth","Number":"8636","RawContent":null,"Title":"fix(types): fix `renderError` type (#8635)","State":"open","Body":"<!--\r\nPlease make sure to read the Pull Request Guidelines:\r\nhttps://github.com/vuejs/vue/blob/dev/.github/CONTRIBUTING.md#pull-request-guidelines\r\n-->\r\n\r\n<!-- PULL REQUEST TEMPLATE -->\r\n<!-- (Update \"[ ]\" to \"[x]\" to check a box) -->\r\n\r\n**What kind of change does this PR introduce?** (check at least one)\r\n\r\n- [x] Bugfix\r\n- [ ] Feature\r\n- [ ] Code style update\r\n- [ ] Refactor\r\n- [ ] Build-related changes\r\n- [ ] Other, please describe:\r\n\r\n**Does this PR introduce a breaking change?** (check one)\r\n\r\n- [ ] Yes\r\n- [x] No\r\n\r\nIf yes, please describe the impact and migration path for existing applications:\r\n\r\n**The PR fulfills these requirements:**\r\n\r\n- [x] It's submitted to the `dev` branch for v2.x (or to a previous version branch), _not_ the `master` branch\r\n- [x] When resolving a specific issue, it's referenced in the PR's title (e.g. `fix #xxx[,#xxx]`, where \"xxx\" is the issue number)\r\n- [x] All tests are passing: https://github.com/vuejs/vue/blob/dev/.github/CONTRIBUTING.md#development-setup\r\n- [x] New/updated tests are included\r\n\r\nIf adding a **new feature**, the PR's description includes:\r\n- [ ] A convincing reason for adding this feature (to avoid wasting your time, it's best to open a suggestion issue first and wait for approval before working on it)\r\n\r\n**Other information:**\r\n","Url":"https://github.com/vuejs/vue/pull/8636","RelatedDescription":"Open PR \"fix(types): fix `renderError` type (#8635)\" (#8636)"},{"Id":"349705358","IsPullRequest":false,"CreatedAt":"2018-08-11T04:40:11","Actor":"st-sloth","Number":"8635","RawContent":null,"Title":"Wrong type of `renderError` option","State":"open","Body":"### Version\r\n2.5.17\r\n\r\n### Reproduction link\r\n[https://github.com/st-sloth/vue-ts-renderError/commit/ff92cd5867333d9bfeec147be040e19e18441355](https://github.com/st-sloth/vue-ts-renderError/commit/ff92cd5867333d9bfeec147be040e19e18441355)\r\n\r\n### Steps to reproduce\r\n1.

This would allow mixed version use of Vue in a complex system. For example, a CMS could use Vue for part of it's gui using an ES6 module, and the website owner could include Vue.js as a direct <script> include without conflicts.\r\n\r\nThis would allow the integration of Vue into larger more complex systems without having constantly battle edge use cases where code would conflict, or micro-manage version differences in a single shared Vue.js instance.\r\n \r\nAlso, a specific use for us is we'd like to implement Vue a piece at a time, where we have many multiple SPA's in administration areas, but don't want the overhead of compiling Vue for each SPA, where an ES6 module could be cached, and loaded on each SPA individually.\r\n\r\n### What does the proposed API look like?\r\n```javascript\r\nimport esvue from './vue.esm.browser.js';\r\nconsole.log(esvue);\r\n```\r\nAdd add an official browser based ES6 build. I found this file in the NPM repo:\r\nhttps://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/vue@2.5.17/dist/vue.esm.browser.js\r\n\r\nFrom here: https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/vue/dist/ \r\n\r\nThis is the official link to the repo from the Vuejs.org installation page:\r\nhttps://vuejs.org/v2/guide/installation.html#Explanation-of-Different-Builds\r\n\r\nAnd it looks like this idea was attempted, or possibly in development. I want to add my support and request this become a standard version of Vue available with the latest updates.\r\n\r\nThanks!\r\n\r\nEdit: We would start implementation tests today if we had a build of the latest version of Vue.js in  vue.esm.browser.js\r\n\r\nNote: Browser version support is not an issue for our administration tools, so using ES6 modules is ideal as it supports our future development needs as well as future proofing our development environment at the same time as allow us to integrate changes slowly in a complex system.\r\n<!-- generated by vue-issues.

Unlike the other issue I found (https://github.com/vuejs/vue-router/issues/954) where it appeared the user wanted to destroy and create a new router in the same application, the issue I am having is completely separate. \r\n\r\nI have a massive application that essentially uses pjax methodologies to be able to run several SPAs (vue being one) that create the full site. When we navigate away from one SPA to another, the SPA needs to destroy itself so it's code does not interfere with the other SPAs. However, because the vue router cannot be destroyed; it's attempting to execute logic for routing even when the SPA that created it is destroyed. The issue compounds when we have more than 1 vue application running, as there are now 2 instances of vue-router (or more) running at a time. \r\n\r\nSpecifically, we are using the hash version of routing. It looks like the router just attaches an event to the window and listens for popstates, but things get weird when more than one event does something with popstate (an understandably oddball behavior).  I would appreciate reconsideration for allowing vue-router to destroy itself when appropriate. Thanks!\r\n\r\n[edited for spelling/grammar]\r\n\r\n<!-- generated by vue-issues.
