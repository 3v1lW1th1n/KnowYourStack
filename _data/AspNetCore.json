(Typically your Program class) If you don't have this method ```WebApplicationTestFixture<TStartup>``` won't be able to initialize your app in the same way it is done on a normal run. You can configure the WebHostBuilder yourself by overriding CreateWebHostBuilder on ```WebApplicationTestFixture<TStartup>```.\r\n\r\n### The test infrastructure needs to know the content root of the application under test\r\nTo set the content root for your app, ```WebApplicationTestFixture<TStartup>``` first locate your solution file ```(.sln)``` and then make a guess about where project might be. The Content Root of the application is defined by convention as ```<<SolutionFolder>>/<<ProjectAssemblyName>>```. For example, based on the folder structure defined below, the content root of the application is defined as ```c:\\work\\MyApp```. This is important because if not set correctly to the root folder of your application under test all views and static files will not be found.\r\n\r\n```\r\nc:/work/\r\n    MyApp.sln\r\n    MyApp/MyApp.csproj\r\n    MyApp.FunctionalTests/MyApp.FunctionalTests.csproj\r\n```\r\n\r\nThe process for determining the folder to use as the content root when running the tests is the following:\r\n* ```WebApplicationTestFixture<TStartup>``` starts on the bin folder of the test project, in the example above ```c:/work/MyApp.FunctionalTests/MyApp.FunctionalTests/bin/<<Configuration>>/<<Framework>>```\r\n* It navigates to the parent folder until it finds a ```.sln``` file.\r\n* It appends ```<<AssemblyName>>``` to the folder in which it found the ```.sln``` file and set that as the content root.\r\n\r\nIf you happen to be using a different convention for the layout of your projects, you can inherit from WebApplicationTestFixture and pass in the relative path from your solution to the application under test when calling the constructor. For example ```\"/src/MyApp\"```\r\n\r\n```csharp\r\npublic class MyAppTestFixture<TStartup> : WebApplicationTestFixture<TStartup> where TStartup : class\r\n{\r\n    public MyAppTestFixture(string solutionRelativePath)\r\n        : base(\"/src/MyApp\") { }\r\n}\r\n```"},{"Id":"6754805124","Type":"IssuesEvent","CreatedAt":"2017-10-23T21:16:00","Actor":"Eilon","Repository":"aspnet/Announcements","Organization":"aspnet","RawContent":null,"RelatedAction":"opened","RelatedUrl":"https://github.com/aspnet/Announcements/issues/274","RelatedDescription":"Opened issue \"ASP.NET/EF Core 2.0.3 patch pre-release test feed\" (#274) at aspnet/Announcements","RelatedBody":"Hi, we now have a public test feed that you can use to try out the ASP.NET/EF Core 2.0.3 patch!\r\n\r\nYou can test this pre-release patch by adding the following feed to your app's or machine's NuGet.config file:\r\n* `https://dotnet.myget.org/F/aspnet-2-0-2-october2017-patch-public/api/v3/index.json`\r\n   * ![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/202643/31913542-4757d2a0-b7fc-11e7-9bf7-7157bd18a6ca.png)\r\n   * (please ignore the *name* of the feed; it is incorrect 😦)\r\n\r\n## Update your project\r\n1.

The Microsoft.AspNetCore.Authentication.WsFederation 2.0.0-preview1 package is available at https://www.nuget.org/packages/Microsoft.AspNetCore.Authentication.WsFederation/. This is a standalone preview that targets netstandard2.0 and should work with existing ASP.NET Core 2.0.0 applications (.NET Core 2.0 or .NET 4.6.1). A non-preview ASP.NET Core 2.0.0 compatible package will follow once we’ve addressed your feedback.\r\n \r\nThe code is available at https://github.com/aspnet/security/tree/rel/2.0.0-ws-preview1 and issues can be filed at https://github.com/aspnet/security/issues. Please give us a 👍 from the reactions menu on the linked discussion post if you have successfully used this component and are ready for the final release.\r\n \r\nThis component is a port from Microsoft.Owin.Security.WsFederation and uses many of the same mechanics. It has also been updated to integrate with ASP.NET Core 2.0’s authentication model. See the samples below.\r\n \r\nAside from updating the usage pattern to match ASP.NET Core, there are also some functional changes to be aware of.\r\nA.\tThis component no longer checks every form post request for sign-in messages by default. Sign-in callbacks are restricted to the \"/signin-wsfed\" path by default. The CallbackPath can be changed to the application root “/” used by some auth providers if you also enable SkipUnrecognizedRequests to allow sharing that request path with other components.\r\nB.\tThis component no longer allows unsolicited logins by default. That WsFederation protocol feature is susceptible to XSRF attacks. See the AllowUnsolicitedLogins option to opt into that feature if your application requires it.\r\n\r\nSee https://github.com/aspnet/Security/issues/1473 for discussion.\r\n \r\nSamples:\r\n \r\nFor applications only using WsFederation (similar to using OpenIdConnect):\r\n \r\n        public void ConfigureServices(IServiceCollection services)\r\n        {\r\n            services.AddAuthentication(sharedOptions =>\r\n            {\r\n                sharedOptions.DefaultScheme = CookieAuthenticationDefaults.AuthenticationScheme;\r\n                sharedOptions.DefaultSignInScheme = CookieAuthenticationDefaults.AuthenticationScheme;\r\n                sharedOptions.DefaultChallengeScheme = WsFederationDefaults.AuthenticationScheme;\r\n            })\r\n            .AddWsFederation(options =>\r\n            {\r\n                options.Wtrealm = Configuration[\"wsfed:realm\"];\r\n                options.MetadataAddress = Configuration[\"wsfed:metadata\"];\r\n            })\r\n            .AddCookie();\r\n        }\r\n \r\n        public void Configure(IApplicationBuilder app)\r\n        {\r\n           app.UseAuthentication();\r\n \r\n                         // …\r\n        }\r\n \r\nFor applications using WsFederation with Identity:\r\n \r\n            services.AddAuthentication()\r\n                .AddWsFederation(options =>\r\n                {\r\n                    options.Wtrealm = Configuration[\"wsfed:realm\"];\r\n                    options.MetadataAddress = Configuration[\"wsfed:metadata\"];\r\n                });\r\n"}],"ResultType":"GitHubEvent"},"Twitter":{"ResultType":"TwitterTimeline","Tweets":[{"Id":"917884946324250624","CreatedAt":"2017-10-10T22:49:59+00:00","UserScreenname":"aspnet","Text":"The #aspnet Community Standup starts now - https://t.co/4Ioo9jNSN2","Source":"<a href=\"https://about.twitter.com/products/tweetdeck\" rel=\"nofollow\">TweetDeck</a>","RetweetCount":13,"FavoriteCount":9,"RawContent":null},{"Id":"917877107904036865","CreatedAt":"2017-10-10T22:18:50+00:00","UserScreenname":"aspnet","Text":"Join us in a half hour (3:45 PM Pacific) for this week's #aspnet Community Standup at https://t.co/4Ioo9jNSN2","Source":"<a href=\"https://about.twitter.com/products/tweetdeck\" rel=\"nofollow\">TweetDeck</a>","RetweetCount":11,"FavoriteCount":3,"RawContent":null},{"Id":"915262407743647744","CreatedAt":"2017-10-03T17:08:57+00:00","UserScreenname":"aspnet","Text":"We're live at https://t.co/4Ioo9jNSN2 for the exciting #SignalR deep dive.
