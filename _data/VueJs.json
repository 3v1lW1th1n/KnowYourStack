The text displayed in the select box will almost always stay as \"Today\", despite the value changing, though it SOMETIMES will actually change to the correct value. Again, as you can see, the actual value is indeed changing even if the select box does not show it.\r\n\r\n### What is expected?\r\nThe options in the select are based on an array of value pairs, (text, val). The text is what should be shown in the select, and the val is what should be actually passed and stored in the data object. I expect the text to change as well as the value when selecting an option.\r\n\r\n### What is actually happening?\r\nThe value changes every time, but the text mostly stays unchanged, BUT the text does very rarely change as expected.\r\n\r\n---\r\nIf this were CONSISTENTLY showing the wrong text with the right value, I would assume that I am just doing something wrong, but since it's infrequent, I'm now not so sure. I would not be surprised if I was doing something wrong. I am going insane, please be my savior.\r\n\r\n<!-- generated by vue-issues.

Create a \"renderless\" component that passes data into the default scoped-slot.\r\n```\r\nrender () {\r\n  return this.$scopedSlots.default(this)\r\n},\r\n```\r\n2. Have a component that uses the \"renderless\" component as root and then populates the scoped-slot with its own template.\r\n3. Have two components with regular slots where one is tunneling the passed content into the second slot. The slots can have different names, it does not affect the issue. Like this:\r\n```\r\n<slot slot=\"slotName\" name=\"slotName\"/>\r\n```\r\n4. Somehow force the \"renderless\" component to update.\r\n\r\n### What is expected?\r\nNo warning should be shown.\r\n\r\n### What is actually happening?\r\nIt triggers the warning:\r\n```\r\nDuplicate presence of slot \"sep\" found in the same render tree - this will likely cause render errors.\r\n\r\nfound in\r\n\r\n---> <MiddleComponent> at /src/components/MiddleComponent.vue\r\n```\r\nIt might also work incorrectly or trigger additional unnecessary re-renders.\r\n\r\n---\r\nThe source code responsible for showing the warning was probably meant for detecting the usage of slots inside v-for loops. However, in this case, it seems to be called incorrectly since the slot is only rendered once. The reason for this might be that the `rendered` flag is not being reset in this situation. Not using a renderless component (doing tunneling outside of a scoped-slot) does not trigger the error. Using scoped-slots instead of regular slots also does not trigger the warning, but that’s because the check is skipped.\r\n\r\nThis is potentially related to #8546.\r\n\r\n<!-- generated by vue-issues.
