If you want to reuse your current email address, I suggest you change the email address of your current NuGet.org account to another email address before creating a new account. \r\n2. Assign packages to the new account: from your package's page, you can \"Manage Owners\" and add the new account as a package owner.

It comes about because we can happily call code that is in indirectly referenced packages, not just in the top level ones.\r\n\r\nDetailed Scenario:\r\n\r\n3 packages: PackA, PackB and PackC (all .net standard 1.4 in my case)\r\n\r\nOne app: App1 (.net framework or .net core)\r\n\r\n1. PackA has no dependencies\r\n\r\n2. PackB v1.0.0 has PackageReference to PackA (doesn't matter if it actually uses it or not)\r\n\r\n3. PackC has PackageReference to PackB (v1.0.0) but directly uses method in PackA. It is unfortunately able to do this even though it doesn't explicitly list PackA as a PackageReference. Maybe the developer uses PackB so adds that and doesn't realise they were then also using PackA (easy to do with internal company packages as you tend to remember what functions exist more than what packages they live in).\r\n\r\n4. App1 has PackageReference to PackC and PackB (v.1.0.0).\r\n\r\n5. Everything works nicely but then...\r\n\r\n6. PackB v1.0.1 is released, which removes the PackageReference to PackA.\r\n\r\n7. App1 updates PackB to v1.0.1\r\n\r\n8. App1 compiles but when it calls PackC which then tries to call PackA, it fails with FileNotFoundException because PackA is not known to be a dependency so does not get included in the build. \r\n\r\nMy thought is that the ideal way to fix this would be a compiler error or warning at step 3, but open to other suggestions. This could be done through some secondary type of DLL reference that couldn't be directly bound to.\r\n\r\nI'm concerned we will hit this a lot with our internal packages as we try to remove indirect packages when we convert from packages.config to PackageReference.\r\n\r\nVS version (if appropriate): 2017.2 and 2017.3\r\n\r\nSample project attached in broken state having updated PackB to 1.0.1\r\n\r\n[IndirectPackageReferences.zip](https://github.com/NuGet/Home/files/1206163/IndirectPackageReferences.zip)\r\n\r\n\r\n"},{"Id":"6587284777","Type":"IssueCommentEvent","CreatedAt":"2017-09-13T20:28:57","Actor":"mungojam","Repository":"NuGet/Home","Organization":"NuGet","RawContent":null,"RelatedAction":"created","RelatedUrl":"https://github.com/NuGet/Home/issues/5715#issuecomment-329287471","RelatedDescription":"Commented on issue \"There is no warning when using code from indirect package reference leading to potential runtime errors\" (#5715) at NuGet/Home","RelatedBody":"Moved to https://github.com/dotnet/roslyn/issues/22095 as I think it should be fixed at compiler level"},{"Id":"6587216703","Type":"IssueCommentEvent","CreatedAt":"2017-09-13T20:12:59","Actor":"natidea","Repository":"NuGet/Home","Organization":"NuGet","RawContent":null,"RelatedAction":"created","RelatedUrl":"https://github.com/NuGet/Home/issues/5868#issuecomment-329283346","RelatedDescription":"Commented on issue \"automatic nuget restore in visual studio for custom project system\" (#5868) at NuGet/Home","RelatedBody":"@zivkan it may be easier to use a bare bones Project System like the examples in VSProjectSystem because the .NET project system probably does a lot more that what you need. However if you want to get nominate/restore working, you can do so on an instance of VS that has the .NET project system installed by leveraging **Capabilities** to MEF import our assemblies. \r\n\r\nI've been experimenting with this and got restore and dependencies tree working on a barebones CPS project. Review [this diff to NuGetizer](https://github.com/NuGet/NuGet.Build.Packaging/compare/dev...natidea:packageRef) for examples of the changes needed. To summarize the steps you will need to replicate this:\r\n\r\n1. Add the _PackageReferences_ and _DependenciesTree_ capabilities to your project, and copy [these rules from .NET Project system](https://github.com/NuGet/NuGet.Build.Packaging/compare/dev...natidea:packageRef#diff-e418ff90840f18d695d653aa56e9ca98)\r\n2. You will also need a modified version of .NET Project System that leverages this capability. You could try building this branch: [packRefCapability](https://github.com/natidea/roslyn-project-system/tree/packRefCapability), and unzipping the ProjectSystem.vsix to `%VSINSTALLDIR%Common7\\IDE\\Extensions\\<extension>`\r\n3. Projects created with your project-system will also need to reference the Sdk (or a subset of it). I do this [here](https://github.com/NuGet/NuGet.Build.Packaging/compare/dev...natidea:packageRef#diff-2b7d1b66f423104d6e9a34343698307bL2), except using a stripped down version of the Sdk that only references the file [Microsoft.PackageDependencyResolution.targets](https://github.com/dotnet/sdk/blob/master/src/Tasks/Microsoft.NET.Build.Tasks/build/Microsoft.PackageDependencyResolution.targets). (You can create your own SDK by copying `%VSINSTALLDIR%MSBuild\\Sdks\\Microsoft.NET.Sdk` and removing unneeded targets)\r\n\r\nEventually we hope to provide a formal way to do this on top of CPS (tracked by https://github.com/dotnet/project-system/issues/2491 and https://github.com/dotnet/project-system/issues/1984)."}],"ResultType":"GitHubEvent"},"Announcements":{"Events":[{"Id":"6588714208","Type":"MemberEvent","CreatedAt":"2017-09-14T05:18:07","Actor":"anangaur","Repository":"NuGet/Announcements","Organization":"NuGet","RawContent":null,"RelatedAction":"added","RelatedUrl":null,"RelatedDescription":null,"RelatedBody":null},{"Id":"6587474662","Type":"MemberEvent","CreatedAt":"2017-09-13T21:13:24","Actor":"anangaur","Repository":"NuGet/Announcements","Organization":"NuGet","RawContent":null,"RelatedAction":"added","RelatedUrl":null,"RelatedDescription":null,"RelatedBody":null},{"Id":"6587412097","Type":"MemberEvent","CreatedAt":"2017-09-13T20:58:44","Actor":"anangaur","Repository":"NuGet/Announcements","Organization":"NuGet","RawContent":null,"RelatedAction":"added","RelatedUrl":null,"RelatedDescription":null,"RelatedBody":null},{"Id":"6581243956","Type":"IssuesEvent","CreatedAt":"2017-09-12T17:38:11","Actor":"anangaur","Repository":"NuGet/Announcements","Organization":"NuGet","RawContent":null,"RelatedAction":"opened","RelatedUrl":"https://github.com/NuGet/Announcements/issues/4","RelatedDescription":"Opened
