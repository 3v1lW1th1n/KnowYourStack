For each customer, we have a different set of styles that need to be applied for branding the application.\r\n\r\nThe branding mainly lives in SCSS variables. We have a base SCSS file where we define default values for all variables (styles, shadows, borders, ...). Then, we have a SCSS file for each customer where we override the default values.\r\n\r\nConsider the following project structure:\r\n```\r\n- angular.json\r\n- package.json\r\n- ...\r\n- src\r\n  - variables.scss\r\n  - branding\r\n    - _branding.scss\r\n    - customer_a\r\n        - _branding.scss\r\n    - customer_b\r\n        - _branding.scss\r\n```\r\n\r\n`src/branding/_branding.scss` defines default values for variables:\r\n\r\n```scss\r\n$color-primary: #ff7f50;\r\n$color-secondary: #7fffd4;\r\n$logo-url: url(\"/assets/logo.png\");\r\n```\r\n\r\nThe customer-specific stylesheet, for example `src/branding/customer_a/_branding.scss`, imports the default variables and overrides them:\r\n\r\n```scss\r\n@import \"../_branding.scss\";\r\n$color-primary: #7b68ee;\r\n$logo-url: url(\"/assets/customer_a.png\");\r\n```\r\n\r\nThe customer-specific styles get included by setting the `stylePreprocessorOptions.includePaths`-property in `angular.json` for each customer:\r\n\r\n```json\r\n\r\n{\r\n  ...\r\n  \"build\": {\r\n    \"configurations\": {\r\n      \"customer_a\": {\r\n        \"stylePreprocessorOptions\": {\r\n          \"includePaths\": [\r\n            \"src/branding/customer_a\"\r\n          ]\r\n        }\r\n      },\r\n      \"customer_b\": {\r\n        \"stylePreprocessorOptions\": {\r\n          \"includePaths\": [\r\n            \"src/branding/customer_b\"\r\n          ]\r\n        }\r\n      }\r\n    }\r\n  }\r\n}\r\n\r\n```\r\n\r\nThis allows us to import and use the styles in the component-specific scss files, e.g. `app.component.scss`, like this:\r\n\r\n```scss\r\n\r\n@import \"_branding\" // <- This statements imports whichever file has been included using stylePreprocessorOptions.includePaths\r\n\r\n.logo {\r\n  background-image: $logo-url;\r\n}\r\n\r\n```\r\n\r\nWhile is approach technically works, it requires us to build the whole application once for each customer.\r\n\r\nCurrently we are building our (quite complex) application over 10 times for each release, and every time all the application logic, components, dependencies (which are the same for every customer) are needlessly getting compiled and bundled over and over again. This takes a very long time, especially on our CD pipeline.\r\n\r\nI think there could be a better approach to this. All we __really__ need to build multiple times are the styles. I think a way that allows us to bundle styles only - perhaps by setting a flag in the angular cli - would be a great addition and allow for more sophisticated branding and white-labelling capabilities.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Describe the solution you'd like\r\nI think having an optional flag (such as `--onlyStyles`) for the `ng build` command would be a great experience.\r\n\r\nThis way we could build the whole application once and then build only styles for each customer configuration. Of course this would be feasible only if building all styles - including those referenced by angular components - would significantly improve build duration.\r\n\r\n### Describe alternatives you've considered\r\n\r\nWe have considered and tested the following alternatives:\r\n\r\n#### CSS custom properties (variables) + lazy loading\r\n\r\nOne alternative we considered is using CSS variables instead of Sass variables. This way we could have a stylesheet per customer defining CSS variables which override the defaults. We could then easily include each stylesheet as a lazy loaded stylesheet and have them built and emitted in a __single__ build.\r\n\r\nAll we then need to do is add some initialization logic that lazily loads the correct stylesheet.\r\n\r\nThe problem we have with this approach is that we heavily rely on Sass functions to modify colors and the like (think `mix()`, `lighten()` etc.). For obvious reasons, CSS custom properties cannot be passed into Sass functions as arguments.\r\n\r\nWhile this approach might work perfectly for applications that are not dependent on Sass functions, it is infeasible for those who want to heavily leverage Sass' capabilities.\r\n\r\n#### Build styles independently from angular's toolchain\r\n\r\nFor this approach, we would build the scss styles using any external tools, e.g. webpack or gulp. We could setup a task that, for each customer, fetches all Sass-files in the project folder, prepends the customer-specific styles and builds the resulting CSS. This way, the angular project would only need to be bundled once.\r\n\r\nHowever, this approach has some drawbacks: We cannot make use of great features like view encapsulation. It also introduces additional build-tools, polluting the otherwise very tidy angular-cli workflow. \r\n\r\n____\r\n\r\nI hope I was able to describe the problem and possible solution sufficiently. If there is any additional information I can provide please let me know.

One thing that is missing from the new Library guide, and not supported out of the box (but generally required by most library authors) in the Angular CLI or ng-packagr, is shipping assets or theme SCSS files with your library. This issue (https://github.com/angular/angular-cli/issues/11071) and many other linked/closed issues with hundreds of 👍  indicate that this is a major need and at minimum that the docs to work around this are not available.\r\n\r\nIt appears that the general guidance for SCSS is to use the `scss-bundle` package similar to [what Angular Material does](https://github.com/angular/components/blob/aaa656dbab41fee298244cc25351da8f44e9f614/tools/BUILD.bazel#L16-L24). For assets, it appears that manually copying them via npm scripts is the most common approach.\r\n\r\nI can understand some hesitation to include details about library-specific implementation that could cause some kind of support burden.\r\n\r\nHowever, the other perspective is that library authors see the docs and get started and then get completely stuck on assets and scss files (like many hundreds have already run into), etc with no references for how to proceed. They will then continue to open duplicate issues in the Angular CLI GitHub.\r\n\r\nPerhaps there is some kind of happy medium between providing them with some starting points on how to handle this without providing them a fully supported solution that doesn’t exist yet. Even telling/reminding people that you can just use regular command line copy commands to move assets via NPM scripts would help people rather than them having to dig through a lot of closed GitHub issues to find examples that work.\r\n\r\n## 🔬 Minimal Reproduction\r\n\r\n### What's the affected URL?**\r\n- https://next.angular.io/guide/creating-libraries\r\n- https://angular.io/guide/creating-libraries\r\n\r\n@jbogarthyde I haven't had time to write up some proposed copy for this, but I wanted to at least create the issue.","Url":"https://github.com/angular/angular/issues/33141","RelatedDescription":"Open issue \"docs: Creating Libraries Guide should include guidance on CSS/assets\" (#33141)"},{"Id":"506533671","IsPullRequest":false,"CreatedAt":"2019-10-14T09:16:35","Actor":"rajashekarreddy2222","Number":"33138","RawContent":null,"Title":"httpinterceptor not working lazy modules","State":"open","Body":"<!--🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅\r\n\r\nOh hi there! 😄\r\n\r\nTo expedite issue processing please search open and closed issues before submitting a new one.\r\nExisting issues often contain information about workarounds, resolution, or progress updates.\r\n\r\n🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅-->\r\n\r\n\r\n# 🐞 bug report\r\n\r\n### Affected Package\r\n<!-- Can you pin-point one or more @angular/* packages as the source of the bug? -->\r\n<!-- ✍️edit: --> The issue is caused by package @angular/....\r\n\r\n\r\n### Is this a regression?\r\n\r\n<!-- Did this behavior use to work in the previous version? -->\r\n<!-- ✍️--> Yes, the previous version in which this bug was not present was: ....\r\n\r\n\r\n### Description\r\n\r\n<!-- ✍️--> A clear and concise description of the problem...\r\n\r\n\r\n## 🔬 Minimal Reproduction\r\n<!--\r\nPlease create and share minimal reproduction of the issue starting with this template: https://stackblitz.com/fork/angular-issue-repro2\r\n-->\r\n<!-- ✍️--> https://stackblitz.com/...\r\n\r\n<!--\r\nIf StackBlitz is not suitable for reproduction of your issue, please create a minimal GitHub repository with the reproduction of the issue.\r\nA good way to make a minimal reproduction is to create a new app via `ng new repro-app` and add the minimum possible code to show the problem. \r\nShare the link to the repo below along with step-by-step instructions to reproduce the problem, as well as expected and actual behavior.\r\n\r\nIssues that don't have enough info and can't be reproduced will be closed.\r\n\r\nYou can read more about issue submission guidelines here: https://github.com/angular/angular/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md#-submitting-an-issue\r\n-->\r\n\r\n## 🔥 Exception or Error\r\n<pre><code>\r\n<!-- If the issue is accompanied by an exception or an error, please share it below: -->\r\n<!-- ✍️-->\r\n\r\n</code></pre>\r\n\r\n\r\n## 🌍  Your Environment\r\n\r\n**Angular Version:**\r\n<pre><code>\r\n<!-- run `ng version` and paste output below -->\r\n<!-- ✍️-->\r\nAngular: 8.2.7\r\n... animations, common, compiler, compiler-cli, core, forms\r\n... platform-browser, platform-browser-dynamic, router\r\n... service-worker\r\n\r\nPackage                           Version\r\n-----------------------------------------------------------\r\n@angular-devkit/architect         0.800.6\r\n@angular-devkit/build-angular     0.800.6\r\n@angular-devkit/build-optimizer   0.800.6\r\n@angular-devkit/build-webpack     0.800.6\r\n@angular-devkit/core              8.3.5\r\n@angular-devkit/schematics        8.3.5\r\n@angular/cdk                      8.2.0\r\n@angular/cli                      8.3.5\r\n@angular/fire                     5.2.1\r\n@angular/language-service         8.0.0\r\n@angular/material                 8.2.0\r\n@angular/pwa                      0.803.5\r\n@ngtools/webpack                  8.0.6\r\n@schematics/angular               8.3.5\r\n@schematics/update                0.803.5\r\nrxjs                              6.5.2\r\ntypescript                        3.4.5\r\nwebpack                           4.30.0\r\n\r\n</code></pre>\r\n\r\n**Anything else relevant?**\r\n<!-- ✍️Is this a browser specific issue?

Such directives should not\r\nbe registered in an NgModule, but can still contain decorators for\r\ninputs, outputs, queries, etc. The information from these decorators and\r\nthe `@Directive()` decorator itself needs to be registered with the\r\ncentral `MetadataRegistry` so that other areas of the compiler can\r\nrequest information about a given directive, an example of which is the\r\ntemplate type checker that needs to know about the inputs and outputs of\r\ndirectives.\r\n\r\nPrior to this change, however, abstract directives would only register\r\nthemselves with the `MetadataRegistry` as being an abstract directive,\r\nwithout all of its other metadata like inputs and outputs. This meant\r\nthat the template type checker was unable to resolve the inputs and\r\noutputs of these abstract directives, therefore failing to check them\r\ncorrectly. The typical error would be that some property does not exist\r\non a DOM element, whereas said property should have been bound to the\r\nabstract directive's input.\r\n\r\nThis commit fixes the problem by always registering the metadata of a\r\ndirective or component with the `MetadataRegistry`. Tests have been\r\nadded to ensure abstract directives are handled correctly in the\r\ntemplate type checker, together with tests to verify the form of\r\nabstract directives in declaration files.\r\n\r\nFixes #30080","Url":"https://github.com/angular/angular/pull/33131","RelatedDescription":"Open PR \"fix(ivy): support abstract directives in template type checking\" (#33131)"},{"Id":"506320616","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2019-10-13T12:43:38","Actor":"JoostK","Number":"33130","RawContent":null,"Title":"fix(ivy): ignore non-property bindings to inputs in template type checker","State":"open","Body":"Prior to this change, the template type checker would incorrectly bind\r\nnon-property bindings such as `[class.strong]`, `[style.color]` and\r\n`[attr.enabled]` to directive inputs of the same name.

Can't say whether it worked in a former CLI-version.\r\n\r\n### Description\r\nI'm working on a project that includes several different frontends based on Angular 8. Each frontend is a separate Angular 8 project with its own folder substructure. Their root folders are all located in the same main folder.\r\n\r\n    theproject\r\n        |___ frontend1\r\n        |___ frontend2\r\n        ...\r\n\r\nTo avoid duplicate code and to optimize code refactoring we've come to the decision to put repetitive code into a \"base\" folder and import it via the paths option set in `tsconfig.json`. \r\n\r\n    theproject\r\n        |___ frontend1/\r\n        |___ frontend2/\r\n        ...\r\n        |___ base-ui/\r\n\r\nWe started with a simple class representing collections of constants that are used throughout the entire frontend landscape. This class is located inside the file `constants.ts` which is to be found in the folder `base-ui/constants`\r\n\r\n    theproject\r\n        |___ frontend1/\r\n        |___ frontend2/\r\n        ...\r\n        |___ base-ui/constants/constants.ts\r\n\r\n\r\nThis is our `tsconfig.json`\r\n\r\n\r\n    {\r\n      \"compileOnSave\": false,\r\n      \"compilerOptions\": {\r\n        \"baseUrl\": \"./\",\r\n        \"outDir\": \"./dist/out-tsc\",\r\n        \"sourceMap\": true,\r\n        \"declaration\": false,\r\n        \"module\": \"es2015\",\r\n        \"moduleResolution\": \"node\",\r\n        \"emitDecoratorMetadata\": true,\r\n        \"experimentalDecorators\": true,\r\n        \"importHelpers\": true,\r\n        \"target\": \"es5\",\r\n        \"typeRoots\": [\r\n          \"node_modules/@types\"\r\n        ],\r\n        \"lib\": [\r\n          \"es2018\",\r\n          \"dom\"\r\n        ],\r\n        \"types\": [\r\n          \"hammerjs\",\r\n          \"jasmine\"\r\n        ],\r\n        \"paths\": {\r\n          \"@shared/*\": [\r\n            \"../base-ui/*\"\r\n          ]\r\n        }\r\n      }\r\n    }\r\n\r\n\r\nAnd this is the very simple content of `constants.ts`\r\n\r\n    export class BaseServerConstants {\r\n        public static readonly LOGOUT_URL = 'server/logout';\r\n        public static readonly LOGIN_URL = 'server/login';\r\n    }\r\n\r\nHere is how we import/use it\r\n\r\n    import { BaseServerConstants } from '@shared/constants/constants';\r\n\r\n    ...\r\n\r\n    performLogout(): void {\r\n        window.location.href = BaseServerConstants.LOGOUT_URL;\r\n    }\r\n\r\nThis works like a charm as long as we just code or build the projects with `ng build` or `ng build --prod`.\r\n\r\nBut using `ng serve` inside the console of IntelliJ or VS Code always leads to the same error message which says:\r\n\r\n    ERROR in /Users/developer/theproject/base-ui/constants/constants.ts\r\n    Module not found: Error: Can't resolve 'tslib' in '/Users/developer/theproject/base-ui/constants'\r\n\r\nWhy does this happen? Why am I actually able to use this paths option successfully with `ng build` and compile/transpile an entire application which works as expected afterwards?\r\n\r\nBut when this code is supposed to run by `ng serve` it won't compile?! Why is `ng serve` clinging to expecting entire modules only that get imported by the paths option? \r\n\r\nThis seems to be a bug from my point of view.\r\n\r\n\r\n## 🔬 Minimal Reproduction\r\nJust create a folder structure similar to mine and import an external class as I did to your dummy project(s) as explained above. Then use `ng serve` in order to run your code locally.\r\n\r\n\r\n## 🌍 Your Environment\r\n<pre><code>\r\nAngular CLI: 8.3.0\r\nNode: 10.15.0\r\nOS: darwin x64\r\nAngular: 8.2.3\r\n... animations, common, compiler, compiler-cli, core, forms\r\n... language-service, platform-browser, platform-browser-dynamic\r\n... router\r\n\r\nPackage                           Version\r\n-----------------------------------------------------------\r\n@angular-devkit/architect         0.803.0\r\n@angular-devkit/build-angular     0.803.0\r\n@angular-devkit/build-optimizer   0.803.0\r\n@angular-devkit/build-webpack     0.803.0\r\n@angular-devkit/core              8.3.0\r\n@angular-devkit/schematics        8.3.0\r\n@angular/cdk                      8.1.4\r\n@angular/cli                      8.3.0\r\n@angular/material                 8.1.4\r\n@ngtools/webpack                  8.3.0\r\n@schematics/angular               8.3.0\r\n@schematics/update                0.803.0\r\nrxjs                              6.5.2\r\ntypescript                        3.5.3\r\nwebpack                           4.39.2\r\n</code></pre>\r\n\r\n**Anything else relevant?**\r\nThis problem appears across all platforms.\r\n","Url":"https://github.com/angular/angular-cli/issues/15820","RelatedDescription":"Open issue \"Angular CLI 8. “ng serve” fails when using “paths” in tsconfig.json\" (#15820)"},{"Id":"505888712","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2019-10-11T15:05:01","Actor":"clydin","Number":"15817","RawContent":null,"Title":"fix(@angular-devkit/build-angular): avoid attempting to directly copy directories","State":"closed","Body":"Fixes #15816","Url":"https://github.com/angular/angular-cli/pull/15817","RelatedDescription":"Closed or merged PR \"fix(@angular-devkit/build-angular): avoid attempting to directly copy directories\" (#15817)"},{"Id":"505687134","IsPullRequest":false,"CreatedAt":"2019-10-11T07:30:53","Actor":"Toso82","Number":"15814","RawContent":null,"Title":"Error missing dependence on ng build --prod","State":"open","Body":"\r\n# 🐞 Bug report\r\n\r\n### Command (mark with an `x`)\r\n<!-- Can you pin-point the command or commands that are effected by this bug? -->\r\n<!-- ✍️edit: -->\r\n```\r\n- [ ] new\r\n- [x] build\r\n- [ ] serve\r\n- [ ] test\r\n- [ ] e2e\r\n- [ ] generate\r\n- [ ] add\r\n- [ ] update\r\n- [ ] lint\r\n- [ ] xi18n\r\n- [ ] run\r\n- [ ] config\r\n- [ ] help\r\n- [ ] version\r\n- [ ] doc\r\n```\r\n\r\n### Is this a regression?\r\n\r\n<!-- Did this behavior use to work in the previous version? -->\r\n<!-- ✍️--> Yes, the previous version in which this bug was not present was: ....\r\nI think YES\r\n\r\n\r\n### Description\r\n\r\n<!-- ✍️--> A clear and concise description of the problem...\r\n\r\nWhen use:\r\n\r\n``` powershell\r\n  ng build --prod \r\n```\r\n\r\n\r\n## 🔬 Minimal Reproduction\r\n<!--\r\nSimple steps to reproduce this bug.\r\n\r\nPlease include: commands run (including args), packages added, related code changes.\r\n\r\nIf reproduction steps are not enough for reproduction of your issue, please create a minimal GitHub repository with the reproduction of the issue. \r\nA good way to make a minimal reproduction is to create a new app via `ng new repro-app` and add the minimum possible code to show the problem. \r\nShare the link to the repo below along with step-by-step instructions to reproduce the problem, as well as expected and actual behavior.\r\n\r\nIssues that don't have enough info and can't be reproduced will be closed.\r\n\r\nYou can read more about issue submission guidelines here: https://github.com/angular/angular-cli/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md#-submitting-an-issue\r\n-->\r\n\r\nIt is difficult to reproduce.

I don't want to have to manually trigger it the first time because that would require an additional layer of event handling and/or some spaghetti code, it should just be triggered like every other change event since the value is changing from being absent to being present.\r\n\r\n#### Implementation Considerations\r\n\r\nThis could be a flag that defaults to `false` to prevent breaking existing applications, but I don't think many existing applications would break from this change unless their event handling is very fragile.","Url":"https://github.com/angular/components/issues/17398","RelatedDescription":"Open issue \"Fire change events upon initialization\" (#17398)"},{"Id":"506920845","IsPullRequest":false,"CreatedAt":"2019-10-14T23:25:11","Actor":"mertdeg2","Number":"17397","RawContent":null,"Title":"mat-chip-grid sometimes adds aria-required=false without no role","State":"open","Body":"#### Bug, feature request, or proposal:\r\nBug\r\n\r\n#### What is the expected behavior?\r\naria-required should only be used when we have valid role attribute.\r\n\r\n#### What is the current behavior?\r\nI am using mdc-chips backed mat-chip-grid implementation. mat-chip-grid component is adding aria-required=false without a role when grid has rows.\r\n\r\n#### What are the steps to reproduce?\r\n1.

For example, `ngx-infinite-scroll` is one of the commonly used plugins (87k weekly downloads) that allow loading contents as soon as user reaches to the bottom of the page. When we set `fullscreen` on `mat-sidenav-container` , `ngx-infinite-scroll` no longer works. As reported here\r\n\r\nhttps://stackoverflow.com/questions/50377502/angular-material-and-ngx-infinite-scroll?rq=1\r\n\r\nand\r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/orizens/ngx-infinite-scroll/issues/182\r\n\r\nWhat if we apply the below styles of `fullscreen` mode **only** when the side nav is opened:\r\n\r\n```\r\n  top: 0!important;\r\n  left: 0!important;\r\n  right: 0!important;\r\n  bottom: 0!important;\r\n  position: absolute!important;\r\n```\r\n\r\nThis way it wont affect the other portion of the application. Because when the nav bar is open user wont be scrolling the page contents, so if the scroll events are blocked it wont be a issue.","Url":"https://github.com/angular/components/issues/17380","RelatedDescription":"Open issue \"Side Nav  - fullscreen should make the side nav full screen only when its open\" (#17380)"},{"Id":"506080301","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2019-10-11T22:18:32","Actor":"mmalerba","Number":"17379","RawContent":null,"Title":"feat(material/menu/testing): finish implementing harness","State":"open","Body":"currently blocked on https://github.com/angular/components/pull/17365","Url":"https://github.com/angular/components/pull/17379","RelatedDescription":"Open PR \"feat(material/menu/testing): finish implementing harness\" (#17379)"},{"Id":"505990009","IsPullRequest":false,"CreatedAt":"2019-10-11T21:49:53","Actor":"SadhuSa","Number":"17374","RawContent":null,"Title":"W3C Errors for Angular material components","State":"closed","Body":"\r\nHi,\r\n\r\nIn my project,we are using angular material component.\r\nWhen running the W3C Nu Validation check during testing many errors were found on webpage.\r\nTo run the W3C Nu Validation Check:\r\n\r\n1.
