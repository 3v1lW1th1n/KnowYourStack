This issue was resolved earlier this year, with the [May 2018 Preview of Quality Rollup](https://blogs.msdn.microsoft.com/dotnet/2018/05/15/net-framework-may-2018-preview-of-quality-rollup/). We recently learned that some applications continue to experience this issue. The changes made to .NET Framework 4.7.1 were also integrated into .NET Framework 4.6 and later servicing releases. As a result, this advisory applies to .NET Framework 4.6 and later versions. \r\n\r\nThis advisory is provided so that developers can correctly diagnose this issue and be aware of our guidance. We will continue to update this issue as we have new information to share.\r\n\r\n## Discussion\r\n\r\nPlease share your thoughts on this change and see what others are saying at:\r\n\r\n* [microsoft/dotnet #832](https://github.com/Microsoft/dotnet/issues/832)\r\n\r\n## Guidance\r\n\r\nThis guidance only applies to customers that have experienced this issue.\r\n\r\nWe intend to release an update for .NET Framework 4.6 and later releases that resolves this issue within the next month. When that happens, **you must deploy the .NET Framework update for this issue to all .NET Framework 4.6+ machines that communicate via serialized objects**. After doing that, cross-machine serialization will work as expected. \r\n \r\nPlease consult your software vendor to understand if this impacts the software you are using.\r\n\r\n## Technical Context\r\n\r\nIn the [May 2018 Preview of Quality Rollup](https://blogs.msdn.microsoft.com/dotnet/2018/05/15/net-framework-may-2018-preview-of-quality-rollup/), we made a change to the internal type CultureAwareComparer to implement ISerializable. We made the change in order to address [issue with serializing/deserializing a CultureAwareComparer](https://github.com/Microsoft/dotnet/blob/master/releases/net471/KnownIssues/521954%20-%20BCL%20CultureAwareComparer%20with%20ignore%20casing%20on%20serialized%20on%20previous%20versions%20of%20.NET%20do%20not%20correctly%20deserialize%20on%20.NET%204.7.1.md).\r\n\r\nThe issue reported was that a type that contains an instance of CultureAwareComparer was not able to correctly serialize and deserialize across different versions of the .NET Framework. There are a few types in .NET Framework that do this, the most commonly impacted one being the Dictionary<TKey, TValue> type.\r\n \r\nThe change to implement the ISerializable interface had unintended side effects when exchanging this type across different machines. We have had a small number of reports from customers who have been affected.\r\n\r\nA common, but not unique way, of exchanging objects across machines is to use WCF in conjunction with a serializer. One of the common serializers being DataContractSerializer. The side-effect of the change prevented data serialized on systems where the type implements ISerializable to correctly deserialize of systems where the type does NOT implement ISerializable. The same is true of the opposite case, that systems where the type does not implement ISerializable will not correctly deserialize data from systems where the type does implement ISerializable.\r\n\r\nWe have an updated fix that we intend to release within the next month that will remove the implementation of the ISerializable interface on the type and use a different internal mechanism for ensuring the cross-version serialization continues to work as expected. This change addresses the break experienced with WCF.\r\n\r\nThe upcoming fix will remove the implementation of the ISerializable interface on the type and use a different mechanism for ensuring the cross-version serialization of that type continues to work. This change addresses the break experienced with WCF.\r\n\r\n## Symptoms\r\n\r\nAn application that is affected by this issue will most likely crash when trying to deserialize an object. It may print or log an error message similar to the following one:\r\n\r\n```\r\nThe formatter threw an exception while trying to deserialize the message: \r\nThere was an error while trying to deserialize parameter . The InnerException message was ''EndElement' 'Comparer' from namespace '' is not expected. Expecting element '_compareInfo'.'.  Please see InnerException for more details.\r\n```"},{"Id":"8098941971","Type":"IssuesEvent","CreatedAt":"2018-08-11T01:05:59","Actor":"richlander","Repository":"dotnet/announcements","Organization":"dotnet","RawContent":null,"RelatedAction":"opened","RelatedUrl":"https://github.com/dotnet/announcements/issues/80","RelatedDescription":"Opened issue \"Improving Performance of ARM32 Docker Images with .NET Core Package Cache\" (#80) at dotnet/announcements","RelatedBody":"# Improving Performance of ARM32 Docker Images with .NET Core Package Cache\r\n\r\n.NET Core SDK distributions include a compressed copy of NuGet packages for .NET Core, ASP.NET Core and EF Core. These packages are decompressed upon installation of the .NET Core SDK. The packages are not currently included in ARM32 distributions due to the time and space cost to decompress the packages. The packages will be included in [.NET Core ARM32 Docker images](https://hub.docker.com/r/microsoft/dotnet/), where these costs can be paid as part of image creation.\r\n\r\nThese NuGet packages include content for two purposes:\r\n\r\n- Reference assemblies for .NET Core, for code compilation.\r\n- Pre-compiled assemblies (compiled with [crossgen](https://github.com/dotnet/coreclr/blob/master/Documentation/building/crossgen.md)) for .NET Core, for use in self-contained applications.\r\n\r\nIn both cases, the presence of these packages avoid the need to access remote NuGet feeds for .NET Core assemblies as part of package restore.\r\n\r\nThis change only affects [.NET Core 2.1 SDK ARM32 Docker images](https://hub.docker.com/r/microsoft/dotnet/). This change will be made in August 2018.\r\n\r\n## Discussion\r\n\r\nPlease share your thoughts on this change and see what others are saying at:\r\n\r\n* [dotnet/dotnet-docker #653](https://github.com/dotnet/dotnet-docker/issues/653)\r\n\r\n## .NET Core SDK NugetFallbackFolder\r\n\r\nThe .NET Core SDK includes a compressed copy of all NuGet package, in LZMA format. It exists at the following version-specific location:\r\n\r\n```\r\nroot@3778032bc43d:/# ls -l /usr/share/dotnet/sdk/2.1.302/*.lzma\r\n-rw-r--r-- 1 1004 sudo 35995936 Jul  2 22:51 /usr/share/dotnet/sdk/2.1.302/nuGetPackagesArchive.lzma\r\n```\r\n\r\nThis file is decompressed to the following location: `/usr/share/dotnet/sdk/NuGetFallbackFolder/`\r\n\r\nA package restore for a .NET Core assembly will restore the assembly from the NuGetFallbackFolder location and copy it to the user NuGet cache. At that point, regular NuGet behavior is used.\r\n\r\n## Impact of this change\r\n\r\nThere should be no functional difference in behavior after this change. .NET SDK commands should complete faster and require fewer package restore network requests.\r\n\r\nThe following examples demonstrates the benefit of this change. The improvement can be observed with package restore. Build times (assuming no restore) are not affected.\r\n\r\n### .NET Core 2.1 SDK image after this change\r\n\r\n> The change has already been made in the `microsoft/dotnet-nightly` repo, as you can see in the example below.

Debian Jessie is no longer a supported operating system for .NET Core. Docker users need to switch to Debian Stretch-based (AKA Debian 9) images to stay in support.\r\n\r\n## Discussion\r\n\r\nPlease share your thoughts on this change and see what others are saying at:\r\n\r\n* [dotnet/dotnet-docker #560](https://github.com/dotnet/dotnet-docker/issues/647)\r\n\r\n## Context\r\n\r\nJessie-based images are currently provided for .NET Core 1.0, 1.1 and 2.0. .NET Core 1.0 and 1.1 expose multi-arch tags, such as `1.0-runtime` and `1.1-sdk`, that support Debian Jessie. When pulled for a Linux Docker daemon (on Linux or Windows), these tags pull Jessie-based images. .NET Core 2.0 supports Jessie, but it is not the default. .NET Core 2.0 multi-arch tags, such as `2.0-runtime` and `2.0-sdk`, pull Debian Stretch-based images, when pulled for a Linux Docker daemon. We made a conscious decision with .NET Core 2.0 to move off of Jessie as the default to avoid this problem, based the Jessie 2018 EOL date. .NET Core 2.1 does not support Jessie, only Stretch.\r\n\r\nWe recently posted about our policy for underlying operating system dependencies with Docker:\r\n\r\n> For each major and minor .NET version, we may take a new major operating system version dependency. As I mentioned earlier, we adopted Debian 9 as the base image for .NET Core 2.0. We stayed with Debian 9 for .NET Core 2.1, since Debian 10 (AKA “Buster”) has not been released. Debian 9 will remain the default base image for .NET Core 2.1 for the life of .NET Core 2.1. **Once we adopt an underlying operating system major version, we will not change it for the life of that given .NET release.**\r\n\r\nSource: https://blogs.msdn.microsoft.com/dotnet/2018/06/18/staying-up-to-date-with-net-container-images/\r\n\r\n## Plan\r\n\r\nWe will continue to re-build .NET Core 1.0 and 1.1 multi-arch tags on top of Jessie for the remaining [supported lifetime of .NET Core 1.0 and 1.1](https://github.com/dotnet/core/blob/master/microsoft-support.md). We will also provide a Stretch-based image for .NET Core 1.1. This tag will look like the following: `1.1-runtime-stretch` or `1.1.9-sdk-stretch`. This is same format that Jessie has used.\r\n\r\nWe will produce Jessie-based images for NET Core 2.0 until October 2018, which is when [.NET Core 2.0 support ends](https://github.com/dotnet/core/blob/master/microsoft-support.md). .NET Core 2.0 multi-arch tags support Debian Stretch, not Jessie, as described above.\r\n\r\nIn summary, .NET Core is no longer supported on Debian Jessie, with Docker or otherwise. We will produce Docker images for Jessie until .NET Core 1.0, 1.1 and 2.0 support ends, respectively, to avoid breaking applications.

We have received multiple customer reports of applications that fail to start or don't run correctly after installing the July 2018 update. These reports are specific to applications that initialize a COM component and run with restricted permissions.\r\n\r\nWe have stopped distributing the .NET Framework July 2018 updates on Windows Update and are actively working on fixing and re-shipping this month's updates. If you installed the July 2018 update and have not yet seen any negative behavior, we recommend that you leave your systems as-is but closely monitor them and ensure that you apply upcoming .NET Framework updates.\r\n\r\nAs a team, we regret that this release was shipped with this flaw. This release was tested using our regular and extensive testing process. We discovered while investigating this issue that we have a test hole for the specific combination of COM activation and restricted permissions, including impersonation.

These system calls can fail if the required process inspection permissions are not present. This causes an “access denied\" error.\r\n\r\n## Workaround\r\n\r\nTemporarily uninstall the [July 2018 Security and Quality Rollup updates for .NET Framework](https://portal.msrc.microsoft.com/en-US/security-guidance/advisory/CVE-2018-8356) to restore functionality until a new update has been released to correct this problem. \r\n\r\n## Symptoms\r\n\r\nA COM component fails to load because of “access denied,” “class not registered,” or “internal failure occurred for unknown reasons” errors. \r\n\r\nThe most commonly reported failure results in the following error message:\r\n\r\n```console\r\nException type: System.UnauthorizedAccessException\r\nMessage: Access is denied.

You must update your projects using the following instructions to address both types of dependency.\r\n\r\n### <a name=\"project-format\"></a>.NET Core Project formats\r\n\r\n.NET Core has two different project file formats, depending on what software created the project.\r\n\r\n1. `project.json` is the format used in .NET Core 1.0 and Microsoft Visual Studio 2015.\r\n2. `csproj` is the format used in .NET Core 1.1, .NET Core 2.0 and Microsoft Visual Studio 2017.\r\n\r\n#### Direct dependencies\r\n\r\nDirect dependencies are discoverable by examining your `csproj` file or your `project.json` file. They can be fixed by [editing the project file](#direct-dependencies) or using NuGet to update the dependency.\r\n\r\n The `System.Private.ServiceModel` package is not meant to be directly depended on and will not appear in your direct dependency list.\r\n\r\n#### Transitive dependencies\r\n\r\nTransitive dependencies occur when you add a package to your project that in turn relies on another package. For example, if Contoso publishes a package `Contoso.Utility` which, in turn, depends on `Contoso.Internals` and you add the `Contoso.Utility` package to your project now your project has a direct dependency on `Contoso.Utility` and, because `Contoso.Utility` depends 'Contoso.Internals', your application gains a transitive dependency on the `Contoso.Internals` package.\r\n\r\nTransitive dependencies are reviewable in three ways, depending on your [project format](#project-format):\r\n\r\n* In the Visual Studio Solution Explorer window, which supports searching.\r\n* By examining the `project.assets.json` file contained in the obj directory of your project for `csproj` based projects *OR*.\r\n* By examining the `project.lock.json` file contained in the root directory of your project for `project.json` based projects.\r\n\r\nThe `project.assets.json` and `project.lock.json` files are the authoritative list of all packages used by your project, containing both direct and transitive dependencies.\r\n\r\n#### <a name=\"direct-dependencies-vs2017\"></a>Fixing direct dependencies in a csproj based project / Visual Studio 2017\r\n\r\nOpen *projectname.csproj* in your editor. If you're using Visual Studio, right-click the project and choose **Edit projectname.csproj** from the context menu, where projectname is the name of your project. Look for `PackageReference` elements. The following shows an example project file:\r\n\r\n```xml\r\n<Project Sdk=\"Microsoft.NET.Sdk.Web\">\r\n  <PropertyGroup>\r\n    <TargetFramework>netcoreapp2.0</TargetFramework>\r\n  </PropertyGroup>\r\n  <ItemGroup>\r\n    <PackageReference Include=\"System.ServiceModel.Http\" Version=\"4.4.0\" />\r\n  </ItemGroup>\r\n</Project>\r\n```\r\n\r\nThe preceding example has a reference to the [vulnerable package](#affected-software), as seen by the single `PackageReference` element. The name of the package is in the `Include` attribute.\r\nThe package version number is in the `Version` attribute. The previous example shows a single direct dependency on `System.ServiceModel.Http` version 4.4.0.\r\n\r\nTo update the version to the secure package, change the version number to the updated package version as listed on the table [previously](#affected-software).\r\nIn this example, update `System.ServiceModel.Http` to the appropriate [fixed package number](#affected-software) for your major version. Save the *csproj* file. The example *csproj* now looks as follows:\r\n\r\n```xml\r\n<Project Sdk=\"Microsoft.NET.Sdk.Web\">\r\n  <PropertyGroup>\r\n    <TargetFramework>netcoreapp2.0</TargetFramework>\r\n  </PropertyGroup>\r\n  <ItemGroup>\r\n    <PackageReference Include=\"System.ServiceModel.Http\" Version=\"4.4.3\" />\r\n  </ItemGroup>\r\n</Project>\r\n```\r\n\r\nIf you're using Visual Studio and you save your updated *csproj* file, Visual Studio will restore the new package version.\r\nYou can see the restore results by opening the **Output** window (Ctrl+Alt+O) and changing the **Show output from** drop-down list to **Package Manager**.\r\n\r\nIf you're not using Visual Studio, open a command line and change to your project directory. Execute the `dotnet restore` command to restore the updated dependencies.\r\n\r\nNow recompile your application. If after recompilation you see a *Dependency conflict warning*, you must update your other direct dependencies to versions that take a dependency on the updated package.\r\n\r\n#### <a name=\"direct-dependencies-vs2015\"></a> Fixing Direct Dependencies in project.json based project / Visual Studio 2015\r\n\r\nOpen your `project.json` file in your editor. Look for the dependencies section. Below is an example dependencies section:\r\n\r\n``` json\r\n    \"dependencies\": {\r\n      \"Microsoft.NETCore.App\": {\r\n        \"version\": \"1.0.1\",\r\n        \"type\": \"platform\"\r\n      },\r\n     \"Microsoft.AspNetCore.Mvc.Core\": \"1.0.6\",\r\n     \"System.ServiceModel.Http\" : \"4.0.0\"\r\n    }\r\n```\r\n\r\nThis example has three direct dependencies: `Microsoft.NETCore.App`, `Microsoft.AspNetCore.Mvc.Core` and `System.ServiceModel.Http`.\r\n\r\n`Microsoft.NetCore.App` is the platform the application targets, you should ignore this. The other packages expose their version to the right of the package name. In our example, our non-platform packages are version 1.0.1.\r\n\r\nReview your direct dependencies for any instance of the packages and versions listed above. In the example above, there is a direct dependency on a vulnerable package, `System.ServiceModel.Http` version 4.4.0.\r\n\r\nTo update to the fixed package, change the version number to be the appropriate package for your release. In the example, this would be updating `System.ServiceModel.Http` to 4.4.3.\r\n\r\nAfter updating the vulnerable package versions, save your `project.json` file.\r\n\r\nThe dependencies section in our example `project.json` would now look as follows:\r\n\r\n```json\r\n  \"dependencies\": {\r\n    \"Microsoft.NETCore.App\": {\r\n      \"version\": \"1.0.1\",\r\n      \"type\": \"platform\"\r\n    },\r\n    \"Microsoft.AspNetCore.Mvc.Core\": \"1.0.6\",\r\n    \"System.ServiceModel.Http \": \"4.4.3\"\r\n  }\r\n```\r\n\r\nIf you are using Visual Studio and save your updated `project.json` file, Visual Studio will restore the new package version. You can see the restore results by opening the Output Window (Ctrl+Alt+O) and changing the Show output from drop-down list to Package Manager.\r\n\r\nIf you are not using Visual Studio, open a command line and change to your project directory. Execute the `dotnet restore` command to restore your new dependency.\r\n\r\nAfter you have addressed all of your direct dependencies, you must also review your transitive dependencies.\r\n\r\nAfter you've addressed all of your direct dependencies, you must review your transitive dependencies.\r\n\r\n#### Discovering and fixing transitive dependencies\r\n\r\nThere are two ways to view transitive dependencies. You can either [use Visual Studio’s Solution Explorer](#vs-solution-explorer), or you can review [the `project.assets.json` file](#project-assets-json) or the [the `project.lock.json` file](#project-lock-json).\r\n\r\n##### <a name=\"vs-solution-explorer\"></a>Using Visual Studio Solution Explorer\r\n\r\nTo use Solution Explorer, open the project in Visual Studio, and then press Ctrl+; to activate the search in Solution Explorer. Search for the [vulnerable package](#affected-software) and make a note of the version numbers of any results you find.\r\n\r\nFor example, searching for `Microsoft.AspNetCore.Mvc.Core` in an example project that contains a package that takes a dependency on `Microsoft.AspNetCore.Mvc` shows the following results in Visual Studio 2017:\r\n\r\n![Screenshot of search results in Visual Studio 2017](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/796298/25858816/8ecdc2b4-3491-11e7-9363-746804bb9832.png)\r\n\r\nThe search results appear as a tree. In the previous results, you can see that a reference to `Microsoft.AspNetCore.Mvc.Core` version 1.1.2 is discovered.\r\n\r\nUnder the Dependencies node is a NuGet node. Under the NuGet node is the list of packages you have directly taken a dependency on and their versions.\r\nIn screenshot, the application takes a direct dependency on `Microsoft.AspNetCore.Mvc`. `Microsoft.AspNetCore.Mvc` in turn has leaf nodes that list its dependencies and their versions.\r\nThe `Microsoft.AspNetCore.Mvc` package takes a dependency on a version of `Microsoft.AspNetCore.Mvc.ApiExplorer`, that in turn takes a dependency on a version of `Microsoft.AspNetCore.Mvc.Core`.\r\n\r\n##### <a name=\"project-assets-json\"></a> Manually reviewing project.assets.json (csproj/VS2017)\r\n\r\nOpen the *project.assets.json* file from your project’s obj directory in your editor. We suggest you use an editor that understands JSON and allows you to collapse and expand nodes to review this file.\r\nVisual Studio and Visual Studio Code provide JSON friendly editing.\r\n\r\nSearch the *project.assets.json* file for the [vulnerable package](#affected-software), using the format `packagename/` for each of the package names from the preceding table. If you find the assembly name in your search:\r\n\r\n* Examine the line on which they are found, the version number is after the `/`.\r\n* Compare to the [vulnerable versions table](#affected-software).\r\n\r\nFor example, a search result that shows `System.ServiceModel.Http/4.3.0` is a reference to version 4.3.0 of `System.ServiceModel.Http`.\r\n\r\nIf your *project.assets.json* file includes references to the [vulnerable package](#affected-software), then you need to fix the transitive dependencies.\r\n\r\nIf you have not found any reference to any vulnerable packages, this means either\r\n\r\n* None of your direct dependencies depend on any vulnerable packages, or\r\n* You have already fixed the problem by updating the direct dependencies.\r\n\r\nIf your transitive dependency review found references to the [vulnerable package](#affected-software), you must add a direct dependency to the updated package to your *csproj* file to override the transitive dependency.\r\n\r\nOpen *projectname.csproj* in your editor. If you're using Visual Studio, right-click the project and choose **Edit projectname.csproj** from the context menu, where projectname is the name of your project.\r\nLook for `PackageReference` nodes, for example:\r\n\r\n```xml\r\n<Project Sdk=\"Microsoft.NET.Sdk.\">\r\n  <PropertyGroup>\r\n    <TargetFramework>net461</TargetFramework>\r\n  </PropertyGroup>\r\n  <ItemGroup>\r\n    <PackageReference Include=\"ThirdParty.NotUpdatedYet\" Version=\"2.0.0\" />\r\n  </ItemGroup>\r\n</Project>\r\n```\r\n\r\nYou must add a direct dependency to the updated version of the [vulnerable package](#affected-software) by adding it to the *csproj* file.\r\nYou do this by adding a new line to the dependencies section, referencing the fixed version.\r\nFor example, if your search showed a transitive reference to a vulnerable `System.ServiceModel.Http` version, you'd add a reference to the [fixed package number](#affected-software).\r\n\r\n```xml\r\n<Project Sdk=\"Microsoft.NET.Sdk.Web\">\r\n  <PropertyGroup>\r\n    <TargetFramework>net461</TargetFramework>\r\n  </PropertyGroup>\r\n  <ItemGroup>\r\n    <PackageReference Include=\"System.ServiceModel.Http\" Version=\"4.3.2\" />\r\n    <PackageReference Include=\"ThirdParty.NotUpdatedYet\" Version=\"2.0.0\" />\r\n  </ItemGroup>\r\n</Project>\r\n```\r\n\r\nAfter you've added the direct dependency reference, save your *csproj* file.\r\n\r\nIf you're using Visual Studio, save your updated *csproj* file and Visual Studio will restore the new package versions.\r\nYou can see the restore results by opening the **Output** window (Ctrl+Alt+O) and changing the **Show output from** drop-down list to **Package Manager**.\r\n\r\nIf you're not using Visual Studio, open a command line and change to your project directory. Execute the `dotnet restore` command to restore the new dependencies.\r\n\r\n##### <a name=\"project-lock-json\"></a> Manually reviewing project.lock.json (project.json/VS2015)\r\n\r\nOpen the `project.lock.json` file in your editor. We suggest you use an editor that understands json and allows you to collapse and expand nodes to review this file; both Visual Studio and Visual Studio Code provide this functionality.\r\n\r\nIf you are using Visual Studio the `project.lock.json` file is “under” the `project.json` file. Click the right pointing triangle, ▷, to the left of the `project.json` file to expand the solution tree to expose the `project.lock.json` file. The following image shows a project with the `project.json` file expanded to show the `project.lock.json` file.\r\n\r\n![project lock json](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/796298/25858179/f6e01200-348f-11e7-8a77-7176d8dd3f03.png)\r\n\r\nSearch the `project.lock.json` file for the vulnerable packages, using the format `packagename/`, using each of the package names from the table above. If you find any vulnerable assembly name in your search examine the line on which they are found, the version number is after the `/` and compare to the vulnerable versions table above. For example a search result that shows `System.ServiceModel.Http/4.0.1` is a reference to v4.0.1 of `System.ServiceModel.Http`.   If your `project.lock.json` file includes references to any of the package versions shown above then you will need to fix the transitive dependencies.\r\n\r\nIf you have not found any reference to a vulnerable version of `System.ServiceModel.Http` this means none of your direct dependencies depend on any vulnerable packages or you have already fixed the problem by updating the direct dependencies.\r\n\r\nIf your transitive dependency review found references to any of the vulnerable packages you must add a direct dependency to the updated package to your `project.json` file to override the transitive dependency. Open your `project.json` and find the dependencies section. For example:\r\n\r\n``` json\r\n  \"dependencies\": {\r\n    \"Microsoft.NETCore.App\": {\r\n      \"version\": \"1.0.1\",\r\n      \"type\": \"platform\"\r\n    },\r\n    \"Microsoft.AspNetCore.Mvc\": \"1.0.0\"\r\n  }\r\n```\r\n\r\nFor each of the vulnerable packages your search returned you must add a direct dependency to the updated version by adding it to the `project.json` file. You do this by adding a new line to the dependencies section, referring the fixed version. For example, if your search showed a transitive reference to the vulnerable `System.ServiceModel.Http` version 1.0.0 you would add a reference to the appropriate fixed version, 1.0.6. Edit the `project.json` file as follows:\r\n\r\n``` json\r\n  \"dependencies\": {\r\n    \"Microsoft.NETCore.App\": {\r\n      \"version\": \"1.0.1\",\r\n      \"type\": \"platform\"\r\n    },\r\n    \"System.ServiceModel.Http\": \"4.1.2\",\r\n    \"Microsoft.AspNetCore.Mvc\": \"1.0.0\"\r\n  }\r\n```\r\n\r\nAfter you have added direct dependencies to the fixed packages, save your `project.json` file.\r\n\r\nIf you are using Visual Studio save your updated `project.json` file and Visual Studio will restore the new package versions. You can see the restore results by opening the Output Window (Ctrl+Alt+O) and changing the Show output from drop-down list to Package Manager.\r\n\r\nIf you are not using Visual Studio open a command line and change to your project directory. Execute the `dotnet restore` command to restore your new dependencies.\r\n\r\n#### Rebuilding your application\r\n\r\nFinally you must rebuild your application, test, and redeploy.\r\n\r\n## Other Information\r\n\r\n### Reporting Security Issues\r\n\r\nIf you have found a potential security issue in .NET Core, please email details to secure@microsoft.com.

There appears* to be a discrepancy for the table entry for the _days in months_ for lunar months 6 and 7 of the lunar year which started in the Gregorian year 1962 when compared with two other sources.
