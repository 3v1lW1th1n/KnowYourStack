Now whenever I use a strong element inside a .card with a .has-background-black the text within the strong text is hardly readable. Even when I add the  .has-text-white class to the card the strong text will remain dark grey.

The goal was to stretch the divs to take up the complete hero body.  I found this article about how to do this with flexbox:\r\nhttps://css-tricks.com/boxes-fill-height-dont-squish/\r\n\r\nI created an example to illustrate.  The hero body has four divs.  The first and second divs do not have any modifiers, so they are sized normally to fit their content.  The third and fourth divs have a modifier class \"is-max-height,\" which divides all of the remaining vertical space between them, increasing their height.  The fourth also has a modifier class \"is-vertically-centered\" which makes the content centered vertically in the div.\r\nhttps://codepen.io/RobJacobson/pen/QWWJPWK\r\n\r\nThis seems like a common use-case.  Are there any existing modifiers in Bulma that allow this?  (I.e., am I reinventing the wheel?)  If not, I'd propose adding classes like these, along with supporting documentation/examples on the website.  I think this would  be quite useful.\r\n\r\nAlso, I'd like to suggest creating a layout control for full-page content that isn't a hero.  It seems to be a common practice to use a hero for full-page content, such as in the linked tutorial (which is excellent).  However, this seems to me like \"overloading\" the hero class when it's used as a general layout tool for full-page layouts.  It works, but it seems weird -- using a hero for something that doesn't have traditional \"hero\" content.\r\nhttps://scrimba.com/p/pV5eHk/cvrwyfR","Url":"https://github.com/jgthms/bulma/issues/2704","RelatedDescription":"Open issue \"[Feature Request] Classes to fill available vertical space\" (#2704)"},{"Id":"522790030","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2019-11-16T16:26:03","Actor":"afwn90cj93201nixr2e1re","Number":"2701","RawContent":null,"Title":"Add placeholders for extending in other frameworks.","State":"closed","Body":"Add placeholders for extending in other frameworks.\r\nFor example in buefy.\r\n\r\n<!-- PLEASE READ THE FOLLOWING INSTRUCTIONS -->\r\n<!-- DO NOT REBUILD THE CSS OUTPUT IN YOUR PR -->\r\n\r\n<!-- Choose one of the following: -->\r\nThis is a **new feature | improvement | bugfix | documentation fix**.\r\n<!-- New feature?

In your `mystyles.scss`, create a custom color map, e.g.\r\n```scss\r\n// Import default variables\r\n@import \"../node_modules/bulma/sass/utilities/initial-variables.sass\";\r\n\r\n// In this example, the color map for `.is-primary` will be replaced\r\n$custom-colors: (\"primary\": ($red, $white, $yellow, $green));\r\n\r\n// Import other Bulma code including derived-variables.sass\r\n// to merge the $custom-colors map to the regular $colors map\r\n@import \"../node_modules/bulma/sass/utilities/_all.sass\";\r\n@import \"../node_modules/bulma/sass/base/_all.sass\";\r\n@import \"../node_modules/bulma/sass/elements/button.sass\";\r\n```\r\n2. Create a [`mypage.html` file according to the documentation](https://github.com/jgthms/bulma/blob/d4c7731792e1a62d89d784544f7a50d7a6cfcd6d/docs/_includes/snippets/mypage.html) and make sure it contains a primary button:\r\n```html\r\n<a class=\"button is-primary\">Primary</a>\r\n```\r\n\r\n\r\n### Expected behavior\r\n\r\nWhen hovering, the `Primary` button, I expect the `background-color` to change from `$red` to `$green`, as this is the supposed color for `$primary-dark` in the `$custom-colors` map (which is merged into the `$colors` map).\r\n\r\n\r\n### Actual behavior\r\n\r\nWhen hovering, the background color changes to a 2.5% darker shade of `$red`. Currently, it's not possible to change this colour via SASS/CSS variables.\r\n\r\n\r\nI'd also like take the opportunity to thank you very much for your work on Bulma! :)","Url":"https://github.com/jgthms/bulma/issues/2702","RelatedDescription":"Open issue \"`$primary-dark` not used as `.button.is-primary:hover` color \" (#2702)"},{"Id":"522391940","IsPullRequest":false,"CreatedAt":"2019-11-13T18:19:18","Actor":"dlemper","Number":"2700","RawContent":null,"Title":"Change colors according prefers-color-scheme media query","State":"open","Body":"### Overview of the problem\r\n\r\n<!-- UNCOMMENT THE APPROPRIATE LINES -->\r\n\r\nThis is about the Bulma **CSS framework**\r\n<!-- This is about the Bulma **Docs** -->\r\nI'm using Bulma **version** 0.8.0\r\nMy **browser** is: Firefox/Chromium\r\n<!-- This is a **Sass** issue: I'm using version [x.x.x] -->\r\nI am sure this issue is **not a duplicate** as #2342 is about theming in general in my opinion\r\n\r\n### Description\r\n\r\nI would like to switch between a dark theme and the standard light theme automatically based on ‚Äû prefers-color-scheme‚Äú media query.
