Enabling CheckOnce can give a pretty big performance boost over the default strategy, as such on the project I work on our guidance is to use OnPush and only fallback to the default strategy if it proves unreasonable. The issue is that (at least from what I can glean from the docs and typings) ChangeDetectionStrategy has to be set on each component, this results in `changeDetection: ChangeDetectionStrategy.OnPush;` being added to the declaration for almost every component in our system and also means developers have to explicitly remember to opt into it.\r\n\r\n### Describe the solution you'd like\r\nThere is a similar property in the component declaration called `encapsulation?: ViewEncapsulation`. This can be set on a component by component level but crucially can also be given a default value when calling `bootstrapModule` by passing the `CompilerOptions` property `defaultEncapsulation?: ViewEncapsulation;`. I would propose a similar solution for this. Something like `defaultChangeDetectionStrategy?: ChangeDetectionStrategy` which behaves in a similar way. \r\n\r\n### Describe alternatives you've considered\r\nYou could specify it at a module level but I think it would be a weird thing to declare for a module and would still need to be repeated for different parts of the system, furthermore which strategy should a component declared under multiple modules use (just seems to add complexity).\r\n\r\n### Tangential thoughts\r\nIn general I think there should be more of a push towards onPush (😉). I would personally consider renaming `ChangeDetectionStrategy.Default` to something more descriptive, its not particularly clear to the user what thats doing and in my opinion steers them towards it being the defacto value. I would also like to see the documentation around it guiding first time users more towards using onPush in almost all cases (mentioning it in the Getting started guide for instance).","Url":"https://github.com/angular/angular/issues/32834","RelatedDescription":"Open issue \"[Proposal] Ability to set a default ChangeDetectionStrategy at a module/application level\"

But in Angular `8.2.5` not. I also tried the latest versoin `8.2.7`. \r\n\r\nUpdate: It's a old known issue. See the second post here.\r\n\r\n### Description\r\n\r\nI get the error: `ERROR in (1,1): Directive AnyComponent, Expected 0 arguments, but got 1.`\r\n\r\nThe first problem is: There is no file path and no line number / member name in the error message. You have to find out successively. This should be improved. But back to this issue...\r\n\r\nIt's about the `HostListener`.

Create new angular project:\r\n`ng new hello`\r\n\r\n2. Create new component:\r\n`ng g c hello`\r\n\r\n3. At the bottom of your **app.component.html** paste this line: (inject the newly created component):\r\n`<app-hello></app-hello>`\r\n\r\n4. Edit the **hello** component:\r\n- css file:\r\n`.demo{ background-image: url(\"/assets/hello.jpg\"); }`\r\n- html file:\r\n`<p class=\"demo\">hello works!</p>`\r\n\r\n5. Paste this script to your package.json:\r\n```\r\n  \"scripts\": {\r\n    \"prod\": \"ng build --prod --base-href=./ --deploy-url=/myapp/\",\r\n    ...\r\n  },...\r\n```\r\n\r\n6. Run this command:\r\n`npm run prod`\r\n\r\n7. Search in the dist/ folder (search in text) the value: \"/assets/hello.jpg\"\r\n\r\n### Result:\r\n- Angular v7 (Result ok) - The search result is located in this line (notice the **myapp**):\r\n`{background-image:url(/myapp/assets/hello.jpg)`\r\n\r\n- Angular v8 (Result Bug) - The search result is located in this line (missing **myapp**):\r\n`{background-image:url(/assets/hello.jpg)`\r\n\r\n\r\n###Conclusion:\r\nIt looks like the build flag `--deploy-url` stop working.

Keep reading...\r\n\r\n### Description\r\n\r\nAn Angular workspace (see [docs](https://angular.io/guide/file-structure#multiple-projects)) creates projects with one tsconfig.json file in the root and more tsconfig.json files for each project which extends the root config json. That's ok. But the names of the tsconfig files in the projects are not valid names to work with e.g. vscode.\r\n\r\nIn a project there are two tsconfig files.\r\n\r\n- tsconfig.spec.json\r\n- tsconfig.app.json\r\n\r\nThe problem is that the IDE (or other tools) can't detect this file, because of the special name.\r\nThe valid name should be `tsconfig.json` like the root file.\r\n\r\nFor example: \r\nIf you add an `exclude` in the `tsconfig.app.json` to exclude other apps in the project folder except itself and the shared-lib, it will not work for e.g. the auto import of vscode. Because the tsconfig.app.json is not load. If I rename it to tsconfig.json it works.\r\nBackground: In my case I do not want to get suggestions about imports of other apps in the project folder. Only fromthe shared-folder. This should be a default configuration of Angular workspace, but it's another issue.\r\n\r\n## 🔬 Minimal Reproduction\r\nJust greate a worksapce.\r\n\r\n```text\r\nng new my-workspace --createApplication=\"false\"\r\nng generate application app1\r\nng generate application app2\r\n```\r\n\r\nor simple greate a project without angular to see the problem.\r\n\r\n```text\r\nauto-import-issue\r\n|= projects\r\n|  |= app1\r\n|  |  |- main.ts\r\n|  |  |- page.ts\r\n|  |  \\- tsconfig.app.json\r\n|  \\= app2\r\n|     |- main.ts\r\n|     |- page.ts\r\n|     \\- tsconfig.app.json\r\n\\- tsconfig.json\r\n```\r\n\r\n## 🌍 Your Environment\r\n<pre><code>\r\nAngular CLI: 8.3.5\r\nNode: 10.15.3\r\nOS: win32 x64\r\nAngular: 8.2.7\r\n... animations, common, compiler, compiler-cli, core, forms\r\n... language-service, platform-browser, platform-browser-dynamic\r\n... router\r\n\r\nPackage                            Version\r\n------------------------------------------------------------\r\n@angular-devkit/architect          0.801.3\r\n@angular-devkit/build-angular      0.803.5\r\n@angular-devkit/build-ng-packagr   0.803.5\r\n@angular-devkit/build-optimizer    0.803.5\r\n@angular-devkit/build-webpack      0.803.5\r\n@angular-devkit/core               8.1.3\r\n@angular-devkit/schematics         8.1.3\r\n@angular/cli                       8.3.5\r\n@ngtools/webpack                   8.3.5\r\n@schematics/angular                8.3.5\r\n@schematics/update                 0.803.5\r\nng-packagr                         5.5.1\r\nrxjs                               6.4.0\r\ntypescript                         3.5.3\r\nwebpack                            4.39.2\r\n</code></pre>\r\n\r\n## Other informations\r\n\r\nMaybe the enviroment like vscode or typescript should wildcard the tsconfig.*.json.\r\nBut in this case we have two tsconfig.json files in a project. For spec and app. This is a conflict. \r\nThe IDE (vscode) should grab the angular.json? You can't expect it. But the Angular team could request it. ... I'm not sure If I understood the intention of the Angular team about these tsconfig files. Maybe it is intended that the tsconfig files are invalid names to prevent loading from other tools like vscode and only Angular should handle it. \r\n\r\nI need the tsconfig sometimes for declaring paths. But at this moment I just want to ignore all other apps in the project folder to prevent auto import etc. from other projects but the shared-lib folder.\r\n\r\n\r\n","Url":"https://github.com/angular/angular-cli/issues/15662","RelatedDescription":"Open issue \"(bug) Angular workspace multiple tsconfig.json files with invalid names.\" (#15662)"},{"Id":"497247860","IsPullRequest":false,"CreatedAt":"2019-09-24T08:14:06","Actor":"jponeill","Number":"15655","RawContent":null,"Title":"Unicode character codes in SCSS converted in 9.0.0-next.3","State":"closed","Body":"<!--🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅\r\n\r\nOh hi there! 😄\r\n\r\nTo expedite issue processing please search open and closed issues before submitting a new one.\r\nExisting issues often contain information about workarounds, resolution, or progress updates.\r\n\r\n🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅-->\r\n\r\n\r\n# 🐞 Bug report\r\n\r\n### Command (mark with an `x`)\r\n<!-- Can you pin-point the command or commands that are effected by this bug? -->\r\n<!-- ✍️edit: -->\r\n```\r\n- [ ] new\r\n- [x] build\r\n- [ ] serve\r\n- [ ] test\r\n- [ ] e2e\r\n- [ ] generate\r\n- [ ] add\r\n- [ ] update\r\n- [ ] lint\r\n- [ ] xi18n\r\n- [ ] run\r\n- [ ] config\r\n- [ ] help\r\n- [ ] version\r\n- [ ] doc\r\n```\r\n\r\n### Is this a regression?\r\nYes.\r\n<!-- Did this behavior use to work in the previous version? -->\r\n<!-- ✍️--> Yes, the previous version in which this bug was not present was: ....\r\n\r\n\r\n### Description\r\n\r\nRunning ng build --configuration production  with the following in styles.scss ...\r\n\r\na.current-open:after {\r\n  content: \"\\f107\";\r\n  font-family: \"FontAwesome\";\r\n  font-weight: bold;\r\n}\r\n\r\n... turns into \r\n@charset \"UTF-8\";a.current-open:after{content:\"\";font-family:FontAwesome;font-weight:700}\r\n\r\n...which doesn't render correctly in the browser (Safari, Chrome & IE)\r\n\r\n<!-- ✍️--> A clear and concise description of the problem...\r\n\r\n\r\n## 🔬 Minimal Reproduction\r\n<!--\r\nSimple steps to reproduce this bug.\r\nPlease include: commands run (including args), packages added, related code changes.\r\n\r\nIf reproduction steps are not enough for reproduction of your issue, please create a minimal GitHub repository with the reproduction of the issue. \r\nA good way to make a minimal reproduction is to create a new app via `ng new repro-app` and add the minimum possible code to show the problem. \r\nShare the link to the repo below along with step-by-step instructions to reproduce the problem, as well as expected and actual behavior.\r\n\r\nIssues that don't have enough info and can't be reproduced will be closed.\r\n\r\nYou can read more about issue submission guidelines here: https://github.com/angular/angular-cli/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md#-submitting-an-issue\r\n-->\r\n1) ng new w/ no routing and SCSS\r\n2) Change angular-cli to @9.0.0-next.3\r\n3) Change angular version to @9.0.0-next.7\r\n4) rm -rf node_modules\r\n5) rm package.json\r\n6) npm install\r\n7) Add this to styles.scss\r\n\r\na.current-open:after {\r\n  content: \"\\f107\";\r\n  font-family: \"FontAwesome\";\r\n  font-weight: bold;\r\n}\r\n\r\n8) build using ng-build --configuration production\r\n\r\n... resulting .css is changed from content: \"\\f107\"; to content:\"\";\r\n## 🔥 Exception or Error\r\n<pre><code>\r\n<!-- If the issue is accompanied by an exception or an error, please share it below: -->\r\n<!-- ✍️-->\r\n\r\n</code></pre>\r\n\r\n\r\n## 🌍 Your Environment\r\n<pre>\r\n<code>\r\n<!-- run `ng version` and paste output below -->\r\n<!-- ✍️-->\r\nAngular CLI: 9.0.0-next.5\r\nNode: 12.3.1\r\nOS: darwin x64\r\nAngular: 9.0.0-next.7\r\n... animations, common, compiler, compiler-cli, core, forms\r\n... language-service, platform-browser, platform-browser-dynamic\r\n... router\r\n\r\nPackage                           Version\r\n-----------------------------------------------------------\r\n@angular-devkit/architect         0.900.0-next.5\r\n@angular-devkit/build-angular     0.900.0-next.5\r\n@angular-devkit/build-optimizer   0.900.0-next.5\r\n@angular-devkit/build-webpack     0.900.0-next.5\r\n@angular-devkit/core              9.0.0-next.5\r\n@angular-devkit/schematics        9.0.0-next.5\r\n@angular/cdk                      8.2.0\r\n@angular/cli                      9.0.0-next.5\r\n@angular/material                 8.2.0\r\n@ngtools/webpack                  9.0.0-next.5\r\n@nguniversal/express-engine       8.1.1\r\n@schematics/angular               9.0.0-next.5\r\n@schematics/update                0.900.0-next.5\r\nrxjs                              6.5.3\r\ntypescript                        3.5.3\r\nwebpack                           4.40.2\r\n</code></pre>\r\n\r\n**Anything else relevant?**\r\n<!-- ✍️Is this a browser specific issue?

This is, because `raw-loader` was removed with #10567 or, respectively, https://github.com/angular/angular-cli/commit/dfb08b95b73f3e75d0f2cd0c61f336dc86d0769a#diff-fdb0776b9f2db468444818966705634c\r\n\r\n\r\n## 🔬 Minimal Reproduction\r\n- This issue is rather obvious and imho doesn't need to be reproduced, just look at the change in https://github.com/angular/angular-cli/commit/dfb08b95b73f3e75d0f2cd0c61f336dc86d0769a#diff-fdb0776b9f2db468444818966705634cL310 ... the raw-loader has been removed for `.html` files. \r\n\r\nThe suggested alternative of using `directTemplateLoading` doesn't work ... I'm not sure why but my guess is that `directTemplateLoading` is supposed to work only for Angular related stuff. Any js files unrelated to Angular (like e.g. AngularJS files) seem to be loaded in a different way.\r\n\r\nThe workaround to add `raw-loader!` in front of every `.html`-require is extremely unpleasant.\r\n","Url":"https://github.com/angular/angular-cli/issues/15653","RelatedDescription":"Closed issue \"Regression: raw-loader is missing\" (#15653)"},{"Id":"496457308","IsPullRequest":false,"CreatedAt":"2019-09-21T16:07:33","Actor":"meDeepakJain","Number":"15644","RawContent":null,"Title":"\"ng serve\" shows compilation successful but browser does not show angular app","State":"closed","Body":"I am using AWS EC2 ubuntu server, have installed a fresh angular app, run the `ng serve` command on putty from my Windows 7 PC.\r\n**Result on CLI (in putty):** Compilation is successful.\r\n**Problem:** URL is not accessible via browser whether I type it manually with ip and port 8080 as I used in my app or use `-o` with my command.
