Using \r\n```        <img *cdkDragPreview src=\"https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/4/40/Star_Wars_Phantom_Menace_poster.jpg\">``` works when dragging elements from the second container, but I'd like the preview to be dynamic depending on where you're dropping it. \r\n\r\nFor example, if you grab an item from the first container and drag it over the second, I'd like the preview to be the image. But it you drag that same item over the third, it should switch back to the regular preview.\r\n\r\n#### What troubleshooting steps have you tried?\r\n\r\nI've tried to manually do it using cdkDragDropEntered and cdkDragDropExited events but it did not work as expected. Especially with the differences in the width of the previews.\r\n\r\n#### Reproduction\r\n\r\nhttps://stackblitz.com/edit/angular-suzb2h\r\n\r\n#### Environment\r\n\r\n- Angular: latest \r\n- CDK/Material: latest\r\n- Browser(s): All\r\n- Operating System (e.g. Windows, macOS, Ubuntu): All\r\n","Url":"https://github.com/angular/components/issues/16769","RelatedDescription":"Open issue \"Drag&Drop Drop List Dynamic Preview\" (#16769)"},{"Id":"480337597","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2019-08-13T19:51:11","Actor":"andrewseguin","Number":"16768","RawContent":null,"Title":"feat(material-experimental/mdc-button): use MDC classnames in CSS","State":"open","Body":"Alternatively we can use the `mat-mdc-` prefix for the component names but that would be more verbose without any additional gain","Url":"https://github.com/angular/components/pull/16768","RelatedDescription":"Open PR \"feat(material-experimental/mdc-button): use MDC classnames in CSS\" (#16768)"},{"Id":"480332838","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2019-08-13T19:40:03","Actor":"andrewseguin","Number":"16766","RawContent":null,"Title":"feat(material-experimental/mdc-button): support disabled FAB","State":"open","Body":"","Url":"https://github.com/angular/components/pull/16766","RelatedDescription":"Open PR \"feat(material-experimental/mdc-button): support disabled FAB\" (#16766)"},{"Id":"480265125","IsPullRequest":false,"CreatedAt":"2019-08-13T17:24:40","Actor":"Dileep-raja","Number":"16765","RawContent":null,"Title":"Angular Material unit testing search filter data?","State":"closed","Body":"applyFilter(filterValue: string) {\r\n    console.log(\"filter data\"+filterValue)\r\n    this.dataSource.filter = filterValue.trim().toLocaleLowerCase();\r\n    if (this.paginator) {\r\n      this.dataSource.paginator.firstPage();\r\n    }\r\n  }\r\n\r\nAny help how to write unit test for this function?","Url":"https://github.com/angular/components/issues/16765","RelatedDescription":"Closed issue \"Angular Material unit testing search filter data?\" (#16765)"},{"Id":"480224813","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2019-08-13T17:19:47","Actor":"devversion","Number":"16763","RawContent":null,"Title":"build: update to angular v8.2.2","State":"closed","Body":"* Updates to Angular v8.2.2\r\n* Updates the bazel tooling to the latest version (as discussed in https://github.com/angular/components/pull/16678)","Url":"https://github.com/angular/components/pull/16763","RelatedDescription":"Closed or merged PR \"build: update to angular v8.2.2\" (#16763)"},{"Id":"480230484","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2019-08-13T17:18:18","Actor":"devversion","Number":"16764","RawContent":null,"Title":"build: fix bazel not available if cache could not be restored","State":"closed","Body":"Currently the `setup_bazel_binary` script always runs before\r\nthe node modules are installed.
