Please describe:\r\n\r\n\r\n## What is the current behavior?\r\n<!-- Please describe the current behavior that you are modifying, or link to a relevant issue. -->\r\n\r\nCurrently you are able to e.g. provide a string, that is not a serialized JSON and want to send it to a Server that expects 'application/json' Content-Type. The HttpClient would not serialize that string and thus send an invalid JSON string and parsing will fail on the server side.\r\nEven though HttpClient knows it needs to send JSON, it doesn't make sure that the data already has been serialized. It just assumes that this is the case for a string.\r\n\r\nRelating Issue Number: #31973\r\n\r\n\r\n## What is the new behavior?\r\nIf Content-Type is explicitly set to 'application/json', the HttpClient will check the body, if it is a string, if it is already parsed JSON and otherwise parse it.\r\n\r\n## Does this PR introduce a breaking change?\r\n\r\n- [ ] Yes\r\n- [ x ] No, because if people have already provided parsed JSON, then it won't get parsed again.\r\n\r\n\r\n<!-- If this PR contains a breaking change, please describe the impact and migration path for existing applications below. -->\r\n\r\n## Other Notes\r\nWe already tried to solve this issue in #31974, but the discussions lead to a non-breaking solution being a better choice here, which was the motivation for this PR.","Url":"https://github.com/angular/angular/pull/31991","RelatedDescription":"Open PR \"feat(common): serialize to JSON if explicitly set in Content-Type and‚Ä¶\" (#31991)"},{"Id":"476490206","IsPullRequest":false,"CreatedAt":"2019-08-03T21:17:02","Actor":"LanderBeeuwsaert","Number":"31990","RawContent":null,"Title":"IVY issue?: Can't resolve all parameters for Pipe: (?)","State":"open","Body":"### Is this a regression?\r\n\r\nThis is in IVY upgrade issue.\r\nAngular version is: 9.0.0-next.0\r\n\r\n### Description\r\n\r\nDuring the same update as described here:\r\nhttps://github.com/angular/angular/issues/31981\r\n\r\nI have a second issue where a pipe gives the following error:\r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/1098243/62416965-ba3b7180-b644-11e9-9c12-ef2754824622.png)\r\n\r\nbecause of this source code:\r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/1098243/62416971-ca535100-b644-11e9-9190-fc24ae6452e0.png)\r\n","Url":"https://github.com/angular/angular/issues/31990","RelatedDescription":"Open issue \"IVY issue?: Can't resolve all parameters for Pipe: (?)\" (#31990)"},{"Id":"476489404","IsPullRequest":false,"CreatedAt":"2019-08-03T21:05:47","Actor":"fjoalland","Number":"31989","RawContent":null,"Title":"Can't build an angular library that depends on another angular linked library (symlink) ","State":"open","Body":"I can't build an angular library (let's call this library **libA**), if I linked another angular library (**libB** ) to it with the command 'npm link'.\r\n\r\nIf you want to reproduce my error, just clone this [repository-git]( https://github.com/fjoalland/multiple-angular-lib/tree/master), and follow the steps in the readme. You will have the same error as me.\r\n\r\n**Context**\r\n\r\nI created several independent angular libraries in different folders:\r\n- /home/user/lib1\r\n- /home/user/lib2\r\n- /home/user/lib3\r\n\r\nThe lib2 and lib3 libraries need the lib1 as a dependency.\r\n\r\nSo here are the steps of what I am doing to link and add the lib1 to the lib2/lib3:\r\n\r\n1. I install the dependencies of the lib1 (npm install) and build the lib1 (ng build)\r\n2. I navigate to the dist folder and link the lib1 with the command 'npm link'\r\n3. I navigate to the lib2 or lib3\r\n4. I install my dependencies with npm (npm install)\r\n5. I add the lib1 with the command 'npm link lib1'\r\n6. I add the lib1 as a module in the lib2/lib3 as bellow:\r\n```\r\n// Example of the lib3.module.ts \r\n\r\nimport { Lib1Module } from '@libs/lib1';\r\n\r\n@NgModule({\r\n  declarations: [Lib3Component],\r\n  imports: [\r\n    Lib1Module\r\n  ],\r\n  exports: [Lib3Component]\r\n})\r\nexport class Lib3Module { }\r\n```\r\n7 . I try to build the lib2/lib3 with the command 'ng build'\r\nHowever, I get a build issue (bellow, you can see the error message).\r\n\r\n`ERROR: : Unexpected value 'Lib1Module in /home/user/Documents/multiple-angular-lib/lib1/dist/libs/lib1/libs-lib1.d.ts' imported by the module 'Lib2Module in /home/user/Documents/multiple-angular-lib/lib2/projects/libs/lib2/src/lib/lib2.module.ts'. Please add a @NgModule annotation.`\r\n\r\nThe most weird part is, if I deploy my lib1 on the official repository of npm and install it in lib2 and lib3, it will work. So there is a problem with the symlink.\r\n\r\n**What I tried**\r\n\r\nI tried to follow the solutions proposed here:\r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/angular/angular-cli/issues/10665\r\n\r\n**How to reproduce my problem**\r\n\r\nI've reproduced an example here:\r\n- ¬†https://github.com/fjoalland/multiple-angular-lib/tree/master\r\n\r\nJust follow the steps and you should have the same error as me.\r\n\r\n**Error message**\r\n\r\nBellow, the full error I got when I try to build the lib2 with a symlink of the lib1\r\n`\r\n[root@user lib2]# ng build Building Angular Package ------------------------------------------------------------------------------ Building entry point '@libs/lib2' ------------------------------------------------------------------------------ Compiling TypeScript sources through ngc ERROR: : Unexpected value 'Lib1Module in /home/user/Documents/multiple-angular-lib/lib1/dist/libs/lib1/libs-lib1.d.ts' imported by the module 'Lib2Module in /home/user/Documents/multiple-angular-lib/lib2/projects/libs/lib2/src/lib/lib2.module.ts'.
