(That obviously includes the enclosing ````table```` element, which contains the ````tbody````, itself containing the dynamic content)\r\n\r\n### For manually generated components\r\n\r\nDevelopers could use lazy content for parts of the document that are dynamic, at their own risk, thus avoiding the cost of rebuilding the whole render tree when they only need to update a small part of a document.\r\n\r\n## Going furher\r\n\r\n### For manually generated components\r\n\r\nIt might be even better if lazy fragments could be forcefully re-rendered, thus blurring the lines with components even more.\r\nI am not sure how this would be best achieved, however. Maybe by calling a method based on the string ID ?\r\n\r\n### For components\r\n\r\nIt would be great if there was a way to indicate that an element should be treated as lazy, even tough it contains fragments of C#. (Maybe something like a ````blazor-lazy```` attribute ?)\r\nThis would allow more flexibility in the design of pages/components, without having to resort to manually built render trees.\r\n","Url":"https://github.com/aspnet/Blazor/issues/788","RelatedDescription":"Closed issue \"Proposal: Optimize render tree build & diff with lazy RenderFragments\" (#788)"},{"Id":"321253443","IsPullRequest":false,"CreatedAt":"2018-05-08T17:44:29","Actor":"csnewman","Number":"793","RawContent":null,"Title":"Circularly dependent layouts cause lockups","State":"closed","Body":"Layouts that are circularly dependent are not handled gracefully and instead causes a browser lockup.\r\n\r\n### Example 1\r\n**SomeLayout**\r\n```\r\n@inherits BlazorLayoutComponent\r\n@layout SomeLayout\r\n```\r\n\r\n### Example 2\r\n**LayoutA**\r\n```\r\n@inherits BlazorLayoutComponent\r\n@layout LayoutB\r\n```\r\n\r\n**LayoutB**\r\n```\r\n@inherits BlazorLayoutComponent\r\n@layout LayoutA\r\n```\r\n\r\n### Example 3\r\n**SomeLayout**\r\n```\r\n@inherits BlazorLayoutComponent\r\n```\r\n\r\n**_ViewImports**\r\n```\r\n@layout SomeLayout\r\n```","Url":"https://github.com/aspnet/Blazor/issues/793","RelatedDescription":"Closed issue \"Circularly dependent layouts cause lockups\" (#793)"},{"Id":"321254772","IsPullRequest":false,"CreatedAt":"2018-05-08T17:38:47","Actor":"dlr1","Number":"794","RawContent":null,"Title":"Adding event-handler in .cshtml crashes Visual studio ","State":"closed","Body":"I am using latest CI builds. when you try to type event-handler for any event in .cshtml, VS crashes.","Url":"https://github.com/aspnet/Blazor/issues/794","RelatedDescription":"Closed issue \"Adding event-handler in .cshtml crashes Visual studio \" (#794)"},{"Id":"321252269","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2018-05-08T16:12:18","Actor":"attilah","Number":"792","RawContent":null,"Title":"convert marshalled members to camelCase","State":"open","Body":"Convert the member names to camelCase for interfaces/class/types getting marshalled to C# side.\r\n\r\n\r\nAs @SteveSandersonMS asked in https://github.com/aspnet/Blazor/issues/774\r\n\r\n\r\nI've  coordinated with @galvesribiero and he is updating his PR: https://github.com/aspnet/Blazor/pull/771","Url":"https://github.com/aspnet/Blazor/pull/792","RelatedDescription":"Open PR \"convert marshalled members to camelCase\" (#792)"},{"Id":"320617599","IsPullRequest":false,"CreatedAt":"2018-05-08T15:32:12","Actor":"thesobercoder","Number":"780","RawContent":null,"Title":"[Feature Request] Provide a way to restrict the usage of tags inside a parent component","State":"closed","Body":"As point-of-view from a library authoring it is necessary as an author to limit the usage of tag that can be authored inside a parent component.\r\n\r\nA trivial example would be \r\n\r\n```\r\n<MyAwesomeDropdown>\r\n    <Item Value=\"1\" Text=\"A\" />\r\n    <Item Value=\"2\" Text=\"B\" />\r\n    <SomeOtherNotValidTag /> <!-- Should be Invalid -->\r\n    <div>Hello World</div> <!-- Should be Invalid -->\r\n</MyAwesomeDropdown>\r\n```\r\n\r\nSince we are in the awesome sugary strongly typed C# land, the type system gives the author confidence on shipping the library with hard set rules and also lets the consumer adopt the library easily without fiddling around at run-time to find out what went wrong.","Url":"https://github.com/aspnet/Blazor/issues/780","RelatedDescription":"Closed issue \"[Feature Request] Provide a way to restrict the usage of tags inside a parent component\" (#780)"},{"Id":"320711280","IsPullRequest":false,"CreatedAt":"2018-05-08T15:31:24","Actor":"simonziegler","Number":"781","RawContent":null,"Title":"Https","State":"closed","Body":"Hi,\r\n\r\nAs I experiment, I would like to see if I can enforce Https communication between the Blazor Client and Server.

(Original #238)\r\n* Rebased on latest dev branch\r\n\r\n# [WIP] Prerendering (#24)\r\n\r\n## How does it work\r\nWhen ever a request comes in that would result in returning the content of `index.html`, the prerendering kicks in and replaces the `app` tag with the prerendered content.\r\n\r\n### In detail\r\n1. Call `app.UseBlazorPrerendering<TEntryComponent>(\"app\", configure => {});` in the server project. `TEntryComponent` will be the component to get prerendered and inserted into the `app` tag.\r\n2. `UseBlazorPrerendering` attaches the `BlazorPrerenderingMiddleware` to the `ISpaBuilder`, to intercept requests to `index.html`.\r\n3. If a request is satisfied by `index.html`. The `index.html` is parsed with `AngleSharp`, and modified to contain the prerendered content. This implementation is almost 100% the same as the one in `IndexHtmlFileProvider`.\r\n4. To Prerender the content there is a new implementation of `Renderer`. This implementation for the most part is identical to the one in `BrowserRenderer.ts`. But it only supports the initial creation, since update on the serverside does not make sense. Also when encountering a `Component` it goes into recursion, which is different from the Browser version.\r\n\r\n## What is in this PR\r\n### Microsoft.AspNetCore.Blazor.Server.Rendering project\r\nContains all things related to prerendering\r\n* `PreRenderer` implementation of `Renderer` (needs cleanup)\r\n\r\n### PrerenderingApp sample\r\n* input component\r\n* list component (foreach)\r\n* input element\r\n* 2 bound input elements\r\n* FetchDataComponent using a service making a HttpRequest on the client while using the data directly when prerendering.\r\n\r\n## Current Limitations\r\n* After the page is returned to the browser, it is static until the browser catches up with bootstrapping and rerendering the page. It would be nice to actually have some kind of way to map the elements to components. Maybe a custom data tag containing the component id.\r\n* Services used for controllers and prerendering must be specified two times for DI.\r\n* Routing not yet tested. It probably doesn't work.\r\n* `IUriHelper` implementation `PreUriHelper` of method `GetBaseUriPrefix` harcoded to match server url.\r\n* **Missing Tests** If this is the way to go, i will write them.\r\n* ~~It only works with the `app` tag. There should be some way to define the entry component. Also it would be nice to have different services (which also means different references) on server vs client side.~~\r\n~~As of now i can only imaging 3 projects.~~\r\n  * ~~One containing the Components~~\r\n  * ~~One for bootstrapping in Browser~~\r\n  * ~~One for bootstrapping in Server~~\r\n* ~~No way to supply services to prerendering. It would be nice to be able to supply different services while prerendering. This would allow to reuse server services to prerender the content without issuing http calls on the server side.~~\r\n\r\n## What now?\r\nI know the issue #24 is not yet assigned to any version. And maybe this implementation is going completely haywire. I just did what i thought might be the general idea.
