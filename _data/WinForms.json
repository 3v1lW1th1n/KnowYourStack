So I can use the columns .IndexOfKey, because I believe that you remember more (name) than Interger to return it!<br><br>* I using Google Translate for creat this text!\n#### Zheng Li [MSFT] on 1/22/2020, 11:00 AM: \n\n<p>Dear customer, thankk for your response.</p>\n<p>For the issue, could you please provide more details for use? such as your repro reproduce steps/Gif/Video etc.</p>\n<p>There have some confused that about the “The issue generated when application is runing”,what’s meaning? it’s that calling the columns(Name) in running? how to implement it?</p>\n<p>Will be appreciate if you also can provide your project for us to investigate the issuein future?</p>\n<p>Thanks<br>\nZheng</p>\n\n#### Zheng Li [MSFT] on 2/5/2020, 04:25 PM: \n\n<p>Thanks for your response, Ciould you please provide reproduce steps &amp; project for us tp investigate the issue in tthe future.</p>\n<p>Thanks<br>\nZheng</p>\n\n#### Visual Studio Feedback System on 2/12/2020, 08:17 PM: \n\nWe will close this report in 14 days because we don’t have enough information to investigate further.

However designer does not generate ‘<a target='_blank' href=\"http://columnHeader1.Name\">columnHeader1.Name</a> =”columnHeader1”; line in InitializeComponent in designer.cs. As a result, runtime does not have this value and uses an empty string as a key in the columns collection.</p>\n<p>And we provide the workaround for now, please refer it, and we are investigate it for now, will give you a response once have ny process.</p>\n<p><strong>Workaround</strong><br>\nSo when I do this:<br>\npublic Form1()<br>\n{<br>\nInitializeComponent();<br>\n<a target='_blank' href=\"http://columnHeader1.Name\">columnHeader1.Name</a> = “columnHeader1”;<br>\n<a target='_blank' href=\"http://columnHeader2.Name\">columnHeader2.Name</a> = “columnHeader2”;<br>\n}</p>\n<pre><code>    private void button1_Click(object sender, EventArgs e)\n    {\n        Text = &quot;IndexofKey &quot; + listView1.Columns.IndexOfKey(&quot;columnHeader1&quot;);\n    }\n</code></pre>\n<p>This code works as expected and returns 0.</p>\n<p>Thanks<br>\nZheng</p>\n\n\n---\n### Original Solutions\n(no solutions)","Url":"https://github.com/dotnet/winforms/issues/2867","RelatedDescription":"Closed issue \"`ListView.IndexOfKey()` returns incorrect value\" (#2867)"},{"Id":"567784198","IsPullRequest":false,"CreatedAt":"2020-02-19T19:14:35","Actor":"filipnavara","Number":"2886","RawContent":null,"Title":"Runtime crash due to localization and the way designer serializes keyboard shortcuts","State":"open","Body":"* .NET Core Version: 3.1.2\r\n\r\n* Have you experienced this same bug with .NET Framework?: No\r\n\r\n**Problem description:**\r\n\r\nSteps to reproduce:\r\n- Create a blank .NET Framework WinForms application with a Form.\r\n- Set the Form to `Localizable = true` in the designer.\r\n- Add context menu with single item.\r\n- Set the `ShortcutKeys` on the item to `Control+C`.\r\n- Observe that the application works just fine on .NET Framework 4.8.\r\n- Switch locale at startup to German by `System.Threading.Thread.CurrentThread.CurrentUICulture = new System.Globalization.CultureInfo(\"de-DE\");`\r\n- Observe that the application still starts just fine on .NET Framework 4.8.\r\n- Change the application to target `netcoreapp31` and it immediately crashes on startup.\r\n\r\nThe reason for the crash is that the .resx file contains the shortcut key serialized as\r\n```\r\n  <data name=\"booToolStripMenuItem.ShortcutKeys\" type=\"System.Windows.Forms.Keys, System.Windows.Forms\">\r\n    <value>Ctrl+C</value>\r\n  </data>\r\n```\r\n\r\nNotice that the serialized value starts with `Ctrl`, not `Control`. It is produced and consumed by `KeysConverter` class that is [locale dependent](https://github.com/dotnet/winforms/blob/df89eb965dd59fd15341972e3a6ce33e51a86317/src/System.Windows.Forms/src/System/Windows/Forms/KeysConverter.cs#L44-L66). While the value `Control` would work in any locale due to the fallback to names in the `Keys` enum the value `Ctrl` is taken from a dictionary that contains localized names. On .NET Core 3.1 in the German localization the name for `Control` key is `Strg`. Thus the value `Ctrl+C` in the resource file is invalid and causes conversion error at runtime.\r\n\r\nNotably we migrated a large project from .NET Framework to .NET Core where we hit this issue. The .NET Framework also has similar issue in code but the localizations may differ which would explain why the problem is not hit.\r\n\r\nManually fixing the value in the .resx file to `Control+C` makes the application work in any locale but any further editing in the designer breaks it again.\r\n\r\n**Expected behavior:**\r\n\r\nNo crash. The resources generated by the designer should be locale independent.\r\n\r\n**Minimal repro:**\r\n\r\nHere's the sample app created using the steps above. It is multi-targeting both .NET Framework and .NET Core so it can run in both variation from inside Visual Studio.\r\n\r\n[WindowsFormsApp2.zip](https://github.com/dotnet/winforms/files/4226867/WindowsFormsApp2.zip)\r\n","Url":"https://github.com/dotnet/winforms/issues/2886","RelatedDescription":"Open issue \"Runtime crash due to localization and the way designer serializes keyboard shortcuts\" (#2886)"},{"Id":"567554245","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2020-02-19T13:16:48","Actor":"dotnet-maestro[bot]","Number":"2885","RawContent":null,"Title":"[master] Update dependencies from dotnet/arcade","State":"closed","Body":"This pull request updates the following dependencies\r\n\r\n[marker]: <> (Begin:4d0c844d-0758-4fc5-c1ad-08d6354da8a8)\r\n## From https://github.com/dotnet/arcade\r\n- **Subscription**: 4d0c844d-0758-4fc5-c1ad-08d6354da8a8\r\n- **Build**: 20200218.1\r\n- **Date Produced**: 2/18/2020 2:20 PM\r\n- **Commit**: b40d0c89c230189b4c6aeb32c0a43218b4bc3359\r\n- **Branch**: refs/heads/master\r\n- **Updates**:\r\n  -

The issues does not fit into a requirement or an improvement. This is because the app developer is not blocked by the lack of accessible name. The standard way to associate an accessible name with a control is as follows:\r\n- is to place a label (a control with `Text` property) in front of this control in the tab order. Then `AccessibleObject.Name` will read it;\r\n- the next option for app developer is to actually set `myControl1.AccessibleName = \"descriptive name\"'.\r\nAs suggested in #2820, 'AccessibleName' is a synonym of 'ControlType'. 'ControlType = Slider'; 'AccessibleName = TrackBar'. This is not helpful, as the name should not contain 'ControlType'.  We are providing names for controls that are not exposed to the developer, 'TrackBar' does not fit this case. \r\n\r\nOn the opposite side, app developer may forget to set 'AccessibleName' or place a Label in front of a control. Anyway, an app developer can set some accessible name as an empty string if it is necessary for him. The explanation can be found in #2382.\r\n\r\nBut there are several issues with default accessible names that are synonymous to control types.\r\n1. It does not produce accessible applications by default. Consider the following UI:\r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/23213980/74722923-c5559800-524a-11ea-9cde-1dc568b24326.png)\r\nLooking at the image above, do you know what value to enter into this control? What will it be used for?\r\nIt seems that an AT user will not know what to do with control of type 'Spinner' that is named '\"Numeric\"' because this name does not explain what value the number in the control represents.\r\nSuch a name does not solve the problem that Accessible Name property is designed to solve, it does not explain business logic behind this control. This solution will not improve applications of accessibility of WinForms controls.\r\n\r\n2. An application developer has a smaller chance to fix the above mentioned accessibility issue in this application because we suppressed Accessibility Insights (AI) error report.\r\nThe suggestion here is that this is an application developer responsibility to provide meaningful 'AccessibleName' and responsibility of AI tool to teach the developer how to write accessible applications. Role of the WinForms developer is to provide public API that allows app developer to set a meaningful accessible name. We provide hard-coded accessible names only for UI elements that don't expose public APIs to the app developers.\r\nApplication developers should to make applications accessible. We are not enforcing keyboard shortcuts or taborder either, because these depend on the business logic.\r\n\r\nTaking into account above considerations, we have two points here:\r\n- **AccesibleName** is for application specific naming which will provide the information about the business purpose of the control.\r\n- **AccessibleDescription** is also is application specific description and is not related to the control implementation.\r\n- **AccessibleControlType** is for providing WinForms control type.\r\n\r\nLike in the following example: 'Age NumericUpDown' where\r\n- 'Age' is an 'AccessibleName' which should be provided by application developer and is not WinForms developer responsibility (it seems that by default an empty accessible name should be provided for both 'Numeric' and 'Domain' 'UpDown' controls)\r\n- 'NumericUpDown' is the localized control type that is the WinForms developer responsibility as they provide the set of control types and thereby should provide localized accessible control types for each available control.\r\n\r\nSo it seems that we need to start the work here to ensure that WinForms controls API does not provide accessible names as these should be application-related business-specific accessible names and should not copy the control type name or its part to accessible name (keep it blank). And on the other hand WinForms developers need to provide meaningful localized control types for all controls.  \r\n\r\nAnd the result of this work should be like follows (application developers will implement accessible names in their application):\r\n|Before the fix | Control types and default empty accessible names | Controls in the custom application |\r\n|-|-|-|\r\n| \"\" TextBox (altready OK) | \"\" TextBox | \"First name\" TextBox (example) |\r\n| \"\" CombBox (altready OK) | \"\" CombBox | \"Occupation\" ComboBox (example) |\r\n| \"Numeric\" Spinner (issue) | \"\" Numeric UpDown | \"Age\" Numeric UpDown (example) |\r\n| \"Domain\" Spinner (issue) | \"\" Domain UpDown | \"Rating\" Domain UpDown (example) |\r\n| \"Property Grid\" pane (issue) | \"\" Property Grid | \"Skills\" Property Grid (example) |\r\n\r\n**Proposed changes and expected behavior:**\r\n- Need to show error by AI if application developer does not provide business specific accessible name. So we need to make Accessible names empty for the controls exposed to developers.\r\n- Accessible names of the controls which are not public should not be empty.\r\n\r\n**Minimal repro:**\r\n- Create the app with WinForms controls and ensure that by default Accessible names are empty and localized control types show the control type specific names.\r\n- Accessible names can be set via control API (AccessibleName property) or by adding the label before the control.\r\n- Control child elements should not have default accessible names or accessible names which contain control type names.","Url":"https://github.com/dotnet/winforms/issues/2870","RelatedDescription":"Open issue \"AccessibleName default values for WinForms Controls\" (#2870)"},{"Id":"565785591","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2020-02-18T03:56:40","Actor":"gpetrou","Number":"2860","RawContent":null,"Title":"Add NIM enum to Interop Shell32","State":"closed","Body":"## Proposed changes\r\n\r\n- Add NIM enum to Interop Shell32.\r\n- Remove NIM constants and replace their usages with the above enum values.\r\n\r\n###### Microsoft Reviewers: [Open in CodeFlow](http://wpcp.azurewebsites.net/CodeFlowProtocolProxy2.php?pullrequest=https://github.com/dotnet/winforms/pull/2860)","Url":"https://github.com/dotnet/winforms/pull/2860","RelatedDescription":"Closed or merged PR \"Add NIM enum to Interop Shell32\" (#2860)"},{"Id":"566142956","IsPullRequest":false,"CreatedAt":"2020-02-18T03:48:42","Actor":"vsfeedback","Number":"2866","RawContent":null,"Title":"Problema com ListView","State":"closed","Body":"_This issue has been moved from [a ticket on Developer Community](https://developercommunity.visualstudio.com/content/problem/887266/problema-com-listview.html)._\n\n---\nBom dia á todos, o que ocorre é o seguinte, quando inserimos um controle **ListView em um Form VB**, acontece que eu declaro em **Design as colunas deste ListView e sempre coloco na propriedade (Name) das colunas** um nome realtivo á esta coluna, até aí tudo bem em _Design_!\n\nMas o problema suge no momento em **Execução**, sendo que em execução todas as propriedades (Name) das colunas se torna uma **string vazia**, então o que acontece acredito seja um problema no VB, pois em **Design o mesmo mantém os campos das colunas da ListView (Name)** só que em execução perdemos estes campos!\n\nEntão fiz o teste de adicionar na programação todos os campos das colunas (Name) e os mesmos colocando na programação se mantém em todo o processo da execução, então vejo que o problema é manter o mesmo que foi feito em Design também em execução!\n\nEspero que tenham compreendido a minha explicação e que isso realmente seja um porblema que possa ser corrigido em uma atualização futura!\n\nGrato,\nRenato\n\n---\n### Original Comments\n\n#### Visual Studio Feedback System on 1/17/2020, 07:42 PM: \n\n<p>We have directed your feedback to the appropriate engineering team for further evaluation.

However designer does not generate ‘<a target='_blank' href=\"http://columnHeader1.Name\">columnHeader1.Name</a> =”columnHeader1”; line in InitializeComponent in designer.cs.

Typically now, you start with the default WinForms template, which runs everything on the GUI thread. I believe most people usually run with this instead of spawning other threads for work. Especially in the Enterprise realm, where we develop WinForms apps quickly for internal use only.\r\n\r\n**How it would coincide with the VS Designer, etc.**\r\nThis has a direct correlation with the VS Designer because it is intended to be used with Forms.\r\n\r\nMy suggestion is to have this be its own extension package, similar to:\r\nhttps://github.com/dotnet/extensions/tree/master/src/Hosting/WindowsServices","Url":"https://github.com/dotnet/winforms/issues/2861","RelatedDescription":"Open issue \"Add a generic host lifetime for Windows Forms\" (#2861)"},{"Id":"565779212","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2020-02-15T17:04:25","Actor":"jnm2","Number":"2859","RawContent":null,"Title":"[Reference] Add FileDialog.ClientGuid","State":"open","Body":"DO NOT MERGE\r\n\r\nReference implementation for proposal https://github.com/dotnet/winforms/issues/2858\n\n###### Microsoft Reviewers: [Open in CodeFlow](http://wpcp.azurewebsites.net/CodeFlowProtocolProxy2.php?pullrequest=https://github.com/dotnet/winforms/pull/2859)","Url":"https://github.com/dotnet/winforms/pull/2859","RelatedDescription":"Open PR \"[Reference] Add FileDialog.ClientGuid\" (#2859)"},{"Id":"565778777","IsPullRequest":false,"CreatedAt":"2020-02-15T17:01:34","Actor":"jnm2","Number":"2858","RawContent":null,"Title":"Proposal to expose FileDialog.ClientGuid","State":"open","Body":"### What it is\r\n\r\nFrom docs: [`IFileDialog::SetClientGuid`](\r\nhttps://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/win32/api/shobjidl_core/nf-shobjidl_core-ifiledialog-setclientguid) enables a calling application to associate a GUID with a dialog's persisted state. A dialog's state can include factors such as the last visited folder and the position and size of the dialog. Typically, this state is persisted based on the name of the executable file. By specifying a GUID, an application can have different persisted states for different versions of the dialog within the same application (for example, an import dialog and an open dialog).\r\n\r\nExposing `IFileDialog::SetClientGuid` is in line with one of the aims which the [contributing guide](https://github.com/dotnet/winforms/blob/master/Documentation/contributing.md) calls out for .NET 5.0 and beyond:\r\n\r\n> [U]pdate implementations to deliver all aspects of modern Windows UI, including missings properties or actions\r\n\r\n### API proposal\r\n\r\nDraft implementation: https://github.com/dotnet/winforms/pull/2859\r\n\r\n```diff\r\nnamespace System.Windows.Forms\r\n{\r\n    public abstract partial class FileDialog : CommonDialog\r\n    {\r\n        // Public instance properties\r\n        public bool AddExtension { get; set; }\r\n        public virtual bool CheckFileExists { get; set; }\r\n        public bool CheckPathExists { get; set; }\r\n+       public System.Guid? ClientGuid { get; set; }\r\n        public string DefaultExt { get; set; }\r\n        public bool DereferenceLinks { get; set; }\r\n        public string FileName { get; set; }\r\n        public string[] FileNames { get; }\r\n        public string Filter { get; set; }\r\n        public int FilterIndex { get; set; }\r\n        public string InitialDirectory { get; set; }\r\n        public bool RestoreDirectory { get; set; }\r\n        public bool ShowHelp { get; set; }\r\n        public bool SupportMultiDottedExtensions { get; set; }\r\n        public bool Title { get; set; }\r\n        public bool ValidateNames { get; set; }\r\n    }\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\n### Lack of alternatives\r\n\r\nWe were recently in a situation where the use case fit the SetClientGuid concept perfectly. In our plugin for an application which is not published by us, our file dialogs needed to track and open to a last-used import directory without affecting the initial directory of the existing file dialogs across the base application. The base application doesn't set the initial directory when it shows a file dialog. Windows shares the state of all dialogs which have no client GUID across the whole app. The only way to keep our dialogs from overwriting the last-used directory for all the dialogs across the base application was to use SetClientGuid.\r\n\r\nBecause Windows Forms does not expose this capability, nor does it even provide a hook we could use to obtain the object instance to make COM calls on, I ended up taking a few hours and implementing our own file dialog library with a ClientGuid property.\r\n\r\n📝 If we were in a situation where we had control over the code in the base application that showed file dialogs, one alternative would be to save and restore FileDialog.InitialDirectory to two separate storage locations. This feels more like a hack than idiomatic use of the Windows file dialog feature.\r\n\r\n### Template questions\r\n\r\n> Will this feature affect UI controls?\r\n\r\n**Yes**, Windows saves and restores initial directory and dialog screen position with the application name as the key. This feature would enable opting in to using an arbitrary GUID as the key instead of the application name.\r\n\r\n> Will VS Designer need to support the feature? If yes, describe how you expect it to funсtion.\r\n\r\n**No**, `[Browsable(false)]` should be fine. On the other hand, the property grid's default behavior for a property of type `System.Guid?` might be desirable. We could even be fancy and add an editor button that sets the property to `Guid.NewGuid()`.\r\n\r\n> What impact will it have on accessibility?\r\n\r\n**None.**\r\n\r\n> Will this feature need to be localized or be localizable?\r\n\r\nJust the SRDescriptionAttribute on the new property, I think? At runtime, **no**.","Url":"https://github.com/dotnet/winforms/issues/2858","RelatedDescription":"Open issue \"Proposal to expose FileDialog.ClientGuid\" (#2858)"},{"Id":"565745232","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2020-02-15T13:16:39","Actor":"dotnet-maestro[bot]","Number":"2857","RawContent":null,"Title":"[master] Update dependencies from dotnet/arcade","State":"closed","Body":"This pull request updates the following dependencies\r\n\r\n[marker]: <> (Begin:4d0c844d-0758-4fc5-c1ad-08d6354da8a8)\r\n## From https://github.com/dotnet/arcade\r\n- **Subscription**: 4d0c844d-0758-4fc5-c1ad-08d6354da8a8\r\n- **Build**: 20200214.5\r\n- **Date Produced**: 2/15/2020 3:39 AM\r\n- **Commit**: 16fbdca79f86f36434b80f2bb898861759ec754b\r\n- **Branch**: refs/heads/master\r\n- **Updates**:\r\n  - **Microsoft.DotNet.XUnitExtensions** -> 5.0.0-beta.20114.5\r\n  - **Microsoft.DotNet.Arcade.Sdk** -> 5.0.0-beta.20114.5\r\n  - **Microsoft.DotNet.GenFacades** -> 5.0.0-beta.20114.5\r\n  - **Microsoft.DotNet.Helix.Sdk** -> 5.0.0-beta.20114.5\r\n  - **Microsoft.DotNet.RemoteExecutor** -> 5.0.0-beta.20114.5\r\n\r\n[marker]: <> (End:4d0c844d-0758-4fc5-c1ad-08d6354da8a8)\r\n\r\n\n\n###### Microsoft Reviewers: [Open in CodeFlow](http://wpcp.azurewebsites.net/CodeFlowProtocolProxy2.php?pullrequest=https://github.com/dotnet/winforms/pull/2857)","Url":"https://github.com/dotnet/winforms/pull/2857","RelatedDescription":"Closed or merged PR \"[master] Update dependencies from dotnet/arcade\" (#2857)"}],"ResultType":"GitHubIssue"}},"RunOn":"2020-02-20T05:30:55.7310009Z","RunDurationInMilliseconds":956}
