We are providing similar functionality on .NET Core by releasing the dotnet-svcutil.xmlserializer NuGet package. It pre-generates c# serialization code for the types used by WCF Service Contract in the client applications that can be serialized using the XmlSerializer to improve the startup performance of Xml Serialization when serializing or de-serializing objects of those types using XmlSerializer. \r\nYou can start using the tool today by following the instructions. \r\n## Discussion \r\nPlease share with us any thoughts of questions that you may have at: \r\n\r\n- dotnet/wcf [#2927](https://github.com/dotnet/wcf/issues/2927)\r\n## Details \r\nWhen to use XmlSerializer with WCF in an app to serialize contract data types, it will generate an XmlSerializer during runtime to do the serialization. You can improve the startup performance of Xml serialization by simply adding the reference of dotnet-svcutil.xmlserializer NuGet package to your project. This tool will generate the serialization code and compile it into an assembly next to your output assembly at build time in advance. This assembly can then be deployed and ran with your application. \r\n\r\nPlease create an issue with your feedback at [dotnet/wcf](https://github.com/dotnet/wcf/issues). We are actively looking to improve the tool and your input is a valuable part of the process.
