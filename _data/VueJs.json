Hence, Vue.js parses the _noscript_ tag and whatever is found within it.\r\n\r\n---\r\nWe found this issue as we are using Vue.js not in SPA mode but sprinkling it on top of existing HTML. When turning off the JS the page still renders HTML. The goal is to have lazy loading images and without JS we still want to see the images. Hence an image tag in a _noscript_ element.\r\n\r\nThis sounds like an edge case but in fact this is common usage for big e-commerce systems and cms' like Sitecore and Adobe AEM.\r\n\r\n<!-- generated by vue-issues.

I have created an application with a large number of components and modules and therefore a large number of namespaced getters. Every time such a getter is invoked the makeLocalGetters function is called iterating trough all the getters in the store just to create the gettersProxy object. This is overkill for ssr performance and is being flagged as a CPU consuming process in the node profiler. \r\nI have managed to double the number of requests per second my ssr app can handle just by using memoization on the gettersProxy object creation. I think this is really impacting performance.\r\n\r\n### What is expected?\r\nNamespaced getters invokation not to be inefficient with large numbers of getters/modules\r\n\r\n### What is actually happening?\r\nA lot of hits to makeLocalGetters making performance go down\r\n\r\n<!-- generated by vue-issues.

Plugins _alter_ an existing store / module, modules provide some completed state based functionality. \r\n\r\nTherefore it can often be the case where a reusable and freely distributed module is desirable (e.g. to include in multiple projects or multiple component libraries). \r\n\r\nAt the moment Vuex's documentation strikes a surprising balance of brevity and coverage (although in my opinion plugins could use some more expansion). However, the mention of how to make and distribute vuex modules is completely absent. \r\n\r\nSince Vue and the Vue ecosystem has lowered the barrier to entry to web development, not using Vue has complete coverage of the nuances of JavaScript and the many core libraries that help it work on the web (e.g. Babel)\r\n\r\nThus it would be relevant and beneficial to provide a complete example (even if it is minimal) of how to make a truly reusable module.\r\n\r\n\r\n### What does the proposed API look like?\r\nI would consider something simplistic (e.g. the counter app). However, I would suggest 2  modifications:\r\n\r\n1. an async / await version (as this can cause trouble with bundling)\r\n2. a typescript variant\r\n\r\n```js\r\n// reusable module\r\n\r\nconst state = () => ({\r\n  count: 0,\r\n  delay: 500\r\n})\r\n\r\nconst getters = {\r\n\r\n}\r\n\r\nconst actions = {\r\n  async updateCount({state, commit}, byHowMuch) {\r\n    let newCount = await setTimeout( () => state.count   byHowMuch, state.delay)\r\n    commit('setCount', newCount)\r\n  }\r\n}\r\n\r\nconst mutations = {\r\n  setCount(state, amount) {\r\n    state.count = amount\r\n  }\r\n}\r\n\r\n\r\nexport {namespaced:true, state, mutations, actions, getters}\r\n```\r\n\r\n\r\nthen provide the configuration file for how to use rollup and deploy to npm / yarn \r\n\r\n\r\nthen provide how to incorporate with nuxt\r\n\r\n\r\n```\r\n// <nuxt-project>/store/AsyncCountModule/index.js\r\nimport AsyncCountModule from 'AsyncCountModule'\r\n\r\nexport AsyncCountModule //<-- this doesnt work \r\n```\r\n\r\n<!-- generated by vue-issues.

This would prevent unintended reading or manipulation of state which should be done through getters or actions/mutations respectively. As far as I know, there is no good way to achieve this today in Vuex.\r\n\r\n### What does the proposed API look like?\r\nThe API could look something like this:\r\n\r\nA store:\r\n```javascript\r\n{\r\n  state() {\r\n    return {\r\n      somethingPublic: ''\r\n    };\r\n  },\r\n\r\n  privateState() {\r\n    return {\r\n      somethingPrivate: []\r\n    };\r\n  },\r\n\r\n  getters: {\r\n    filtered: (state, getters, privateState) => privateState.somethingPrivate.filter(...)\r\n  }\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nIn a component:\r\n```javascript\r\n// works:\r\nthis.$store.state.somethingPublic\r\nthis.$store.getters.filtered\r\n// doesn't work:\r\nthis.$store.state.somethingPrivate\r\nthis.$store.privateState.somethingPrivate\r\n```\r\n\r\nThanks.\r\n\r\n<!-- generated by vue-issues.
