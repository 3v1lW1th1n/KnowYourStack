Then these pages gets compiled at runtime and we can add pages to a running website on the fly.\r\n\r\nAs web developers, we might think this is not the best practice to write inline code but from another point of view, this is really an awesome way of adding new plugins and APIs to an existing web app (if the app was designed for it). For example, if we need to design a wordpress like system where plugins can be added without a site restart.  If we were using MongoDb/Elastic search/Redis, we can use them without needing to recompile the app. The plugins would be able to add collections in database and call other APIs etc.\r\n\r\nNow, the issue is, .net core only support adding razor pages this way, we cannot added C# classes like this.  If there was common code between razor pages and we put it in classes, the classes have to be compiled into a DLL and deployed to the web app which requires a new publish.\r\n\r\nBut let's say if it is possible for .net to find classes on the fly, it can be an absolute pleasure to make systems where other components can be added just by copying a folder (containing pages and classes). \r\n\r\nif .net core could detect new classes added to a running app and compile them into a \"virtual DLL\", the razor pages then use the virtual DLL to get the classes they need.\r\n\r\nOr it could be a folder based approach where each class can be placed in a separate physical file, and can be found at runtime by it's namespace (which will be according to the folder structure e.g. ProjectNamespace.Pages.Test.HelperClass.cs )?\r\n\r\nUltimately, this approach could enable us to create a .net core app just by compiling Program.cs and Startup.cs into a DLL and rest is added on the fly.\r\n\r\nI am not sure if you guys would like the idea or it is possible to implement it in .net core. But this is just a thought."},{"Id":"7141601805","Type":"IssuesEvent","CreatedAt":"2018-01-24T01:32:28","Actor":"javiercn","Repository":"aspnet/Mvc","Organization":"aspnet","RawContent":null,"RelatedAction":"closed","RelatedUrl":"https://github.com/aspnet/Mvc/issues/7271","RelatedDescription":"Closed issue \"Support for covariant ViewDataDictionary<TModel>\" (#7271) at aspnet/Mvc","RelatedBody":"I really don't know how to properly name this issue, so I'm going to explain what I'm doing.\r\n\r\nI have a razor page\r\nIndex.cshtml \r\n```razor\r\n@model AnimalModel\r\n```\r\n\r\n```csharp\r\npublic abstract class AnimalModel : PageModel\r\n{\r\n}\r\n\r\ninternal class CatModel : PageModel\r\n{\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nAt runtime I have an IPageApplicationModelConvention that I'm using to substitute the abstract version of the model with the derived version\r\n\r\n```csharp\r\nprivate class AnimalModelConvention : IPageApplicationModelConvention\r\n{\r\n    public void Apply(PageApplicationModel model)\r\n    {\r\n        if (model.ModelType == typeof(AnimalModel))\r\n        {\r\n            model.ModelType = typeof(CatModel).GetTypeInfo();\r\n        }\r\n    }\r\n}\r\n```\r\nWith these changes, everything works properly (the right type gets instantiated and assigned for the model, etc.) up until something on the view requires contextualization.\r\n\r\nThe issue is that for the view, the HtmlHelpers the type of the View data is ViewData<AnimalModel> while at runtime, the type of the model is ViewData<CatModel>. When we try to contextualize the view, we try to cast ViewDataDictionary<CatModel> to ViewDataDictionary<AnimalModel> which obviously fails as there is no inheritance relationship between the two of them.\r\n\r\nThis instance of the problem will be an issue for each wrapping type that the view uses (only at the top level of the page) (By wrapping type I mean any type that has the model as a generic argument, the only instance I can think of at the moment is ViewDataDictionary<TModel>)\r\n\r\nWhat I'm proposing is that we handle this specific case and support \"covariance\" for the view data dictionary. This implies that first we try to cast ViewDataDictionary{<TRuntime> to ViewDataDictionary<TModel>, if that casting fails, we check if TRuntime extends TModel and if that's the case, we create a new ViewDataDictionary<TModel>(ViewDataDictionary,ViewDataDictionary.Model) and we use that new view data dictionary to provide context to other components.\r\n\r\nA more realistic example (based on identity as  a library)\r\n```razor\r\n@page\r\n@model LoginModel\r\n```\r\n\r\n```csharp\r\npublic abstract class LoginModel : PageModel\r\n{\r\n    // Define the input model and other elements of the contract with the view.\r\n}\r\n\r\ninternal class LoginModel<TUser> : LoginModel where TUser : IdentityUser\r\n{\r\n    public LoginModel(\r\n        UserManager<TUser> userManager,\r\n        SignInManager<TUser> signInManager)\r\n    {\r\n    }\r\n\r\n    // Provide implementations for OnGet, OnPost, etc.\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nWhen plugged into MVC I define a contention in the form\r\n```csharp\r\nprivate class IdentityUIModelConvention<TUser> : IPageApplicationModelConvention where TUser : IdentityUser\r\n{\r\n    public void Apply(PageApplicationModel model)\r\n    {\r\n        if (model.ModelType == typeof(LoginModel))\r\n        {\r\n            model.ModelType = typeof(LoginModel<>).MakeGenericType(typeof(TUser)).GetTypeInfo();\r\n        }\r\n    }\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nIn terms of user scenarios, I require this to allow customizing the user without requiring the scaffolding of all the views that aren't changing. For example, if i'm adding additional properites to the user, I might only want to customize the registration and user profile pages and leave any other page untouched.\r\n\r\nThe change doesn't seem very complicated either, a naive implementation can be seen here:\r\nhttps://github.com/aspnet/Mvc/commit/10ec000987a2620997af33bd0303cf4c37005650#diff-bb87a648158c4f18c421ea59d5a1b120R66\r\n\r\nI'm sure there are more places to chase this conversion down, but I don't expect it to be that many.\r\n\r\n"},{"Id":"7141601797","Type":"PullRequestEvent","CreatedAt":"2018-01-24T01:32:28","Actor":"javiercn","Repository":"aspnet/Mvc","Organization":"aspnet","RawContent":null,"RelatedAction":"merged","RelatedUrl":"https://github.com/aspnet/Mvc/pull/7284","RelatedDescription":"Merged

was an unhandled exception. It seems like `OnStarting` was not being called.\r\nI then added a `try/catch` around the `await _next(context)` call to explicitly catch unhandled exceptions and set the header then. However, if I re-threw the exception, then the header that I set there would not be applied either.\r\nI then changed from re-throwing the exception to just returning, but now I don't get any of the default exception handling done in  FrameOfT.cs `ProcessRequestsAsync`. This means that I don't get the default exception logging to Application Insights either as `ReportApplicationError` is no longer being called.\r\n\r\nIs there a good way for me to be able to set a custom header on a response, even if it is due to an unhandled server error?

This advisory also provides guidance on what developers can do to update their applications correctly.\r\n\r\nMicrosoft is aware of an elevation of privilege vulnerability exists when a ASP.NET Core web application, created using vulnerable project templates, fails to properly sanitize web requests. An attacker who successfully exploited this vulnerability could perform content injection attacks and run script in the security context of the logged-on user.\r\n\r\nTo exploit the vulnerability, an attacker could send a specially crafted email, containing a malicious link, to a user. Alternatively, an attacker could use a chat client to social engineer a user into clicking the malicious link. However, in all cases to exploit this vulnerability a user must click a maliciously crafted link from an attacker.\r\n\r\nThe security update addresses the vulnerability by correcting the ASP.NET Core project templates.\r\n\r\nDevelopers who have generated applications from the vulnerable templates should change their code using the following instructions. They should also change their code to address a further vulnerability,  [CVE-2018-0783](https://github.com/aspnet/Announcements/issues/284), which is in the same templates. Finally installing the latest .NET Core SDK, version 2.1.4, from https://www.microsoft.com/net/download/ will update the templates to correct the issue for any new applications created.\r\n\r\n### Discussion\r\n\r\nPlease use **** TODO: FILL IN ISSUE LINK *** for discussion of this advisory.\r\n\r\n### Mitigation Factors\r\nASP.NET Core applications which are not created using the ASP.NET Core 2.0 Individual Authentication templates are not vulnerable to this issue.\r\n\r\n## Affected Software\r\nThe vulnerabilities affect any Microsoft .NET Core project if it uses any of affected runtime versions listed below and have generated applications using Individual Authentication with usernames and passwords stored within the application. Applications which use Azure Active Directory, or Azure Active Directory B2C are not affected.\r\n\r\nVulnerable .NET SDK Version | Fixed SDK Version\r\n----------------| -------------------------\r\n2.0.0, 2.0.2, 2.0.3, 2.1.2, 2.1.3 |  2.1.4\r\n\r\n### Advisory FAQ\r\n#### How do I know if I am affected?\r\n\r\nYour application will be affected if you generated it using the ASP.NET 2.0 Web Application template or the ASP.NET 2.0 Web Application (Model/View/Controller) template from a vulnerable SDK version where you have selected individual authentication where user accounts are stored in-app.\r\n\r\nTo check the runtimes installed on a computer you must view the contents of the runtime folder. By default these are\r\n\r\n| Operating System          | Location          |\r\n|---------------------------|-------------------|\r\n| Windows | C:\\Program Files\\dotnet\\sdk\\ |\r\n| macOS | /usr/local/share/dotnet/sdk/    |\r\n| Supported Linux platforms | /usr/share/dotnet/sdk/   |\r\n\r\nEach SDK version is installed in its own directory, where the directory name is the version number. If you do not have a directory for 2.1.4 then any applications generated for ASP.NET Core 2.0 using Individual Authentication may be vulnerable.. Downloads for all supported platforms can be acquired from https://www.microsoft.com/net/download/\r\n\r\n#### How do I fix my affected application?\r\nApplications can be fixed by changing the code created during application generation using the following instructions.\r\n\r\n#### For ASP.NET Core 2.0 Web Application (Razor Pages)\r\n\r\n1. Open `Pages\\Account\\Manage\\EnableAuthenticator.cshtml.cs` find the `OnPostAsync()` method and search for the following line\r\n\r\n```\r\n<div id=\"qrCodeData\" data-url=\"@Html.Raw(Model.AuthenticatorUri)\"></div>\r\n```\r\n\r\nReplace this line with the following code, removing the call to `Html.Raw()`\r\n\r\n```C#\r\n<div id=\"qrCodeData\" data-url=\"@Model.AuthenticatorUri\"></div>\r\n```\r\n\r\n2. Open the `Pages\\Account\\Manage\\EnableAuthenticator.cshtml.cs` and search for the following line, inside the `OnGetAsync()` method;\r\n\r\n```C#\r\nawait LoadSharedKeyAndQrCodeUriAsync(user);\r\n```\r\n\r\nRemove the code shown below which follows the call to `LoadSharedKeyAndQrCodeUriAsync(user);`\r\n\r\n```C#\r\nif (string.IsNullOrEmpty(SharedKey))\t\t\r\n{\t\t\r\n    await _userManager.ResetAuthenticatorKeyAsync(user);\t\t\r\n    await LoadSharedKeyAndQrCodeUriAsync(user);\t\t\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nThe `OnGetAsync()` method should now look like\r\n\r\n```C#\r\npublic async Task<IActionResult> OnGetAsync()\r\n{\r\n    var user = await _userManager.GetUserAsync(User);\r\n    if (user == null)\r\n    {\r\n        throw new ApplicationException($\"Unable to load user with ID '{_userManager.GetUserId(User)}'.\");\r\n    }\r\n\r\n    await LoadSharedKeyAndQrCodeUriAsync(user);\r\n\r\n    return Page();\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\n3. Still in the `Pages\\Account\\Manage\\EnableAuthenticator.cshtml.cs` file  and search for the `LoadSharedKeyAndQrCodeUriAsync(ApplicationUser user) function` and replace it with \r\n\r\n```C#\r\nprivate async Task LoadSharedKeyAndQrCodeUriAsync(ApplicationUser user)\r\n{\r\n    // Load the authenticator key & QR code URI to display on the form\r\n    var unformattedKey = await _userManager.GetAuthenticatorKeyAsync(user);\r\n    if (string.IsNullOrEmpty(unformattedKey))\r\n    {\r\n        await _userManager.ResetAuthenticatorKeyAsync(user);\r\n        unformattedKey = await _userManager.GetAuthenticatorKeyAsync(user);\r\n     }\r\n\r\n    SharedKey = FormatKey(unformattedKey);\r\n    AuthenticatorUri = GenerateQrCodeUri(user.Email, unformattedKey);\r\n }\r\n```\r\n\r\n4. Recompile your application and test you can generate 2fa recovery codes correctly, then redeploy your application.\r\n\r\n#### For ASP.NET Core 2.0 Web Application (Model/View/Controller)\r\n\r\n1. Open the `Controllers\\ManageController.cs` file and find the declaration for `private const string AuthenticatorUriFormat`. Add the following new const declaration below it;\r\n\r\n```C#\r\nprivate const string RecoveryCodesKey = nameof(RecoveryCodesKey);\r\n```\r\n\r\n2. Still in `Controllers\\ManageController.cs` file and find the `EnableAuthenticator()` function. Replace its contents with\r\n\r\n```C#\r\n[HttpGet]\r\npublic async Task<IActionResult> EnableAuthenticator()\r\n{\r\n    var user = await _userManager.GetUserAsync(User);\r\n    if (user == null)\r\n    {\r\n        throw new ApplicationException($\"Unable to load user with ID '{_userManager.GetUserId(User)}'.\");\r\n    }\r\n\r\n    var model = new EnableAuthenticatorViewModel();\r\n    await LoadSharedKeyAndQrCodeUriAsync(user, model);\r\n\r\n    return View(model);\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\n3. Still in `Controllers\\ManageController.cs` file and find the `EnableAuthenticator(EnableAuthenticatorViewModel model)` method. Replace its contents with\r\n\r\n```C#\r\n[HttpPost]\r\n[ValidateAntiForgeryToken]\r\npublic async Task<IActionResult> EnableAuthenticator(EnableAuthenticatorViewModel model)\r\n{\r\n    var user = await _userManager.GetUserAsync(User);\r\n    if (user == null)\r\n    {\r\n        throw new ApplicationException($\"Unable to load user with ID '{_userManager.GetUserId(User)}'.\");\r\n    }\r\n\r\n    if (!ModelState.IsValid)\r\n    {\r\n        await LoadSharedKeyAndQrCodeUriAsync(user, model);\r\n        return View(model);\r\n     }\r\n\r\n    // Strip spaces and hypens\r\n    var verificationCode = model.Code.Replace(\" \", string.Empty).Replace(\"-\", string.Empty);\r\n\r\n    var is2faTokenValid = await _userManager.VerifyTwoFactorTokenAsync(\r\n        user, _userManager.Options.Tokens.AuthenticatorTokenProvider, verificationCode);\r\n\r\n    if (!is2faTokenValid)\r\n    {\r\n        ModelState.AddModelError(\"Code\", \"Verification code is invalid.\");\r\n        await LoadSharedKeyAndQrCodeUriAsync(user, model);\r\n        return View(model);\r\n    }\r\n\r\n    await _userManager.SetTwoFactorEnabledAsync(user, true);\r\n    _logger.LogInformation(\"User with ID {UserId} has enabled 2FA with an authenticator app.\", user.Id);\r\n    var recoveryCodes = await _userManager.GenerateNewTwoFactorRecoveryCodesAsync(user, 10);\r\n    TempData[RecoveryCodesKey] = recoveryCodes.ToArray();\r\n\r\n    return RedirectToAction(nameof(ShowRecoveryCodes));\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\n4. Still in `Controllers\\ManageController.cs` file create the following method after `EnableAuthenticator(EnableAuthenticatorViewModel model)`;\r\n\r\n```C#\r\n[HttpGet]\r\npublic IActionResult ShowRecoveryCodes()\r\n{\r\n    var recoveryCodes = (string[])TempData[RecoveryCodesKey];\r\n    if (recoveryCodes == null)\r\n    {\r\n        return RedirectToAction(nameof(TwoFactorAuthentication));\r\n    }\r\n\r\n    var model = new ShowRecoveryCodesViewModel { RecoveryCodes = recoveryCodes };\r\n    return View(model);\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\n5. Still in `Controllers\\ManageController.cs` file create the following method after the `GenerateQrCodeUri(string email, string unformattedKey)` method\r\n\r\n```C#\r\nprivate async Task LoadSharedKeyAndQrCodeUriAsync(ApplicationUser user, EnableAuthenticatorViewModel model)\r\n{\r\n    var unformattedKey = await _userManager.GetAuthenticatorKeyAsync(user);\r\n    if (string.IsNullOrEmpty(unformattedKey))\r\n    {\r\n        await _userManager.ResetAuthenticatorKeyAsync(user);\r\n        unformattedKey = await _userManager.GetAuthenticatorKeyAsync(user);\r\n    }\r\n\r\n    model.SharedKey = FormatKey(unformattedKey);\r\n    model.AuthenticatorUri = GenerateQrCodeUri(user.Email, unformattedKey);\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\n6.

This advisory also provides guidance on what developers can do to update their applications correctly.\r\n\r\nMicrosoft is aware of a Cross Site Request Forgery vulnerability in the individual authentication templates for ASP.NET Core 2.0. An attacker who successfully exploited this vulnerability could change the recovery codes associated with the victim's user account without his/her consent. As a result, a victim of this attack may be permanently locked out of his/her account after loosing access to his/her 2FA device, as the initial recovery codes would be no longer valid.\r\n\r\nThe security update addresses the vulnerability by correcting the ASP.NET Core project templates.\r\n\r\nDevelopers who have generated applications from the vulnerable templates should change their code using the following instructions. They should also change their code to address a further vulnerability,  CVE-2018-0784, which is in the same templates.  ***** TODO: ADD LINK TO OTHER ISSUE ***** \r\n\r\nYou should also install the latest .NET Core SDK, version 2.1.4, from https://www.microsoft.com/net/download/ as will update the templates to correct the issue for any _new_ applications created after its installation. Existing applications must be manually updated using the instructions below.\r\n\r\n### Discussion\r\n\r\nPlease use **** TODO: FILL IN ISSUE LINK *** for discussion of this advisory.\r\n\r\n### Mitigation Factors\r\nASP.NET Core applications which are not created using the ASP.NET Core 2.0 Individual Authentication templates are not vulnerable to this issue.\r\n\r\n## Affected Software\r\nThe vulnerabilities affect any Microsoft .NET Core project if it uses any of affected runtime versions listed below and have generated applications using Individual Authentication with usernames and passwords stored within the application. Applications which use Azure Active Directory, or Azure Active Directory B2C are not affected.\r\n\r\nVulnerable .NET SDK Version | Fixed SDK Version\r\n----------------| -------------------------\r\n2.0.0, 2.0.2, 2.0.3, 2.1.2, 2.1.3 |  2.1.4\r\n\r\n### Advisory FAQ\r\n#### How do I know if I am affected?\r\n\r\nYour application will be affected if you generated it using the ASP.NET 2.0 Web Application template or the ASP.NET 2.0 Web Application (Model/View/Controller) template from a vulnerable SDK version where you have selected individual authentication where user accounts are stored in-app.\r\n\r\nTo check the runtimes installed on a computer you must view the contents of the runtime folder. By default these are\r\n\r\n| Operating System          | Location          |\r\n|---------------------------|-------------------|\r\n| Windows | C:\\Program Files\\dotnet\\sdk\\ |\r\n| macOS | /usr/local/share/dotnet/sdk/    |\r\n| Supported Linux platforms | /usr/share/dotnet/sdk/   |\r\n\r\nEach SDK version is installed in its own directory, where the directory name is the version number. If you do not have a directory for 2.1.4 then any applications generated for ASP.NET Core 2.0 using Individual Authentication may be vulnerable.. Downloads for all supported platforms can be acquired from https://www.microsoft.com/net/download/\r\n\r\n#### How do I fix my affected application?\r\nApplications can be fixed by changing the code created during application generation using the following instructions.\r\n\r\n#### For ASP.NET Core 2.0 Web Application (Razor Pages)\r\n\r\n1. Open `Pages\\Account\\Manage\\EnableAuthenticator.cshtml.cs` find the `OnPostAsync()` method. The last line of this file should be\r\n\r\n```C#\r\nreturn RedirectToPage(\"./GenerateRecoveryCodes\");\r\n```\r\n\r\nReplace this line with the following code\r\n\r\n```C#\r\nvar recoveryCodes = await _userManager.GenerateNewTwoFactorRecoveryCodesAsync(user, 10);\r\nTempData[\"RecoveryCodes\"] = recoveryCodes.ToArray();\r\nreturn RedirectToPage(\"./ShowRecoveryCodes\");\r\n```\r\n\r\n2. Open the `Pages\\Account\\Manage\\GenerateRecoveryCodes.cshtml` and replace its contents with \r\n\r\n```C#\r\n@page\r\n@model GenerateRecoveryCodesModel\r\n@{\r\n    ViewData[\"Title\"] = \"Generate two-factor authentication (2FA) recovery codes\";\r\n    ViewData[\"ActivePage\"] = \"TwoFactorAuthentication\";\r\n}\r\n\r\n<h4>@ViewData[\"Title\"]</h4>\r\n<div class=\"alert alert-warning\" role=\"alert\">\r\n    <p>\r\n        <span class=\"glyphicon glyphicon-warning-sign\"></span>\r\n        <strong>This action generates new recovery codes.</strong>\r\n    </p>\r\n    <p>\r\n        If you lose your device and don't have the recovery codes you will lose access to your account.\r\n    </p>\r\n    <p>\r\n        Generating new recovery codes does not change the keys used in authenticator apps. If you wish to change the key\r\n        used in an authenticator app you should <a asp-action=\"ResetAuthenticatorWarning\">reset your authenticator keys.</a>\r\n    </p>\r\n</div>\r\n\r\n<div>\r\n    <form method=\"post\" class=\"form-group\">\r\n        <button class=\"btn btn-danger\" type=\"submit\">Generate Recovery Codes</button>\r\n    </form>\r\n</div>\r\n```\r\n3.
