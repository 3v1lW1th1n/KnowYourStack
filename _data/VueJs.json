Create a simple component that shows the amount of times it's been rendered:\r\n\r\n    ```js\r\n    Vue.component('times-rendered', {\r\n        created() {\r\n          this.timesRendered = 0\r\n        },\r\n        render(h) {        \r\n          return h('div', `Times rendered: ${++this.timesRendered}`)\r\n        }\r\n    });\r\n    ```\r\n\r\n2. Use this component twice. Once with content in the default slot, once without. After the component is mounted, trigger any update to its data:\r\n\r\n    ```html\r\n    <template>\r\n        <div>\r\n          <div>{{ updateTrigger }}</div>\r\n          <times-rendered></times-rendered>\r\n          <times-rendered>\r\n            Any content in the default slot causes a re-render. Why?\r\n          </times-rendered>\r\n        </div>\r\n    </template>\r\n\r\n    <script>\r\n    export default {\r\n        data: () => ({ updateTrigger: false }),\r\n        \r\n        async mounted() {\r\n          await this.$nextTick()\r\n          \r\n          this.updateTrigger = true\r\n        },\r\n    };\r\n    </script>\r\n    ```\r\n\r\n### What is expected?\r\nI would expect each instance of the component to only render once.\r\n\r\n### What is actually happening?\r\nThe component with content in the slot renders twice.\r\n\r\n---\r\nI'm not actually sure whether this is a bug or a feature request. Maybe this is expected behavior currently. If it is, then I guess this would be better classified as a feature request.\r\n\r\n<!-- generated by vue-issues.

But right now it can (accidentally) be circumvented with closures, by adding a function to the state.\r\n\r\n```javascript\r\n// Create a closure\r\nconst myFunctionFactory = () => {\r\n\tconst myValues = {\r\n\t\tfoo: 0,\r\n\t};\r\n\r\n\treturn () => {\r\n\t\tmyValues.foo  = 1;\r\n\t\treturn myValues.foo;\r\n\t};\r\n};\r\n\r\n// Get the function inside the closure\r\nconst myFunction = myFunctionFactory();\r\n\r\n// Add the function to the state\r\nVue.set( state, 'myFunction', myFunction );\r\n\r\n// New each time the function is called, a different result is returned\r\nstate.myFunction(); // => 1;\r\nstate.myFunction(); // => 2;\r\nstate.myFunction(); // => 3;\r\nstate.myFunction(); // => 4;\r\n```\r\n\r\nThis can introduce really subtle bugs and also makes time travel unusable. There also seems to be no way to prevent this, except for not allowing functions in state at all.\r\n\r\nIt would be great to hear other peoples opinions on the subject.\r\n\r\n### What does the proposed API look like?\r\nIn my opinion adding functions to the state should be discouraged in docs.\r\n\r\nIn dev mode it would be great if an error could be thrown if a function is discovered in the state - at least if strict mode is enabled or something like that.\r\n\r\n<!-- generated by vue-issues.

Having a way to check if the namespace path is already occupied would allow the code to either, register to a different namespace (ick!), unregister and re-register the existing namespace or avoid registration of the namespace altogether. \r\n\r\nThis condition can be easily reproduced by dynamically registering a namespaced module and issuing a hotreload or attempting to register that module more than once to the same path. \r\n\r\nEnd users would not see errors on hot-load or, if for some reason, the code attempts multiple registrations in the same session.\r\n\r\nThe only workaround at this point is to check the private member _modulesNamespaceMap. Building a dependency on that private access isn't ideal. I can find no other way to determine if the namespace is already occupied. \r\n\r\n### What does the proposed API look like?\r\nOption A: Provide a boolean method that returns the state of a given namespace:\r\n\r\n    this.$store.isNamespaceRegistered(\"nested/name/space\")\r\n\r\nOption B: Exit from registerModule and provide a false return code from registerModule when the namespace already exists. \r\n\r\n    if (this.$store.registerModule(\"existing/namespace\", myModule) === false) {\r\n       this.$store.unregisterModule(\"existing/namespace\")\r\n       this.$store.registerModule(\"existing/namespace\", myModule)\r\n    }\r\n\r\nI personally like Option A better as it is minimally intrusive on the existing API and gives the developer the means by which to handle the issue with the greatest flexibility.\r\n\r\n<!-- generated by vue-issues.
