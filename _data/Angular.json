One of the last 'problems' that is really blocking seems to be ['ngx-toastr'](https://github.com/scttcper/ngx-toastr).\r\n\r\nThey dynamically add the [toastr component](https://github.com/scttcper/ngx-toastr/blob/master/src/lib/toastr/toast.component.ts) on runtime in the DOM.\r\n\r\n[Link to code that is responsible for this](https://github.com/scttcper/ngx-toastr/blob/db3e8fefe79dd66f2610b057a762bb0e668ab417/src/lib/portal/dom-portal-host.ts#L32)\r\n\r\nWhen switching to Ivy this code doesn't work anymore:\r\n\r\n```\r\nERROR DOMException: Failed to execute 'createElement' on 'Document': The tag name provided ('') is not a valid name. at DefaultDomRenderer2.createElement\r\n```\r\n\r\nAfter some debugging I found out that it's because the code that's responsible for retrieving the selector of a component in Ivy doesn't work: [Link](https://github.com/angular/angular/blob/c845a7b887d1a85a89acfe5c62b8829079130af3/packages/core/src/render3/component_ref.ts#L124)\r\n\r\nIn case of the toast component (see link above) it's ['', 'toast-component', '']. As a result the tag name becomes ''. And that explains the error above.\r\n\r\nI cloned ngx-toastr, changed the component name from `[toast-component]` to `toast-component` (removed the brackets). And everything seems to be working. This of course changes the result from a div with as attribute 'toast-component' to a custom component with as selector 'toast-component'.\r\n\r\nTL;DR: Dynamically generating components on runtime with Ivy doesn't work when using attribute notation.\r\n\r\n## üî¨ Minimal Reproduction\r\n\r\nUse ngx-toastr with Ivy enabled.\r\nIf more time, I'll create a stackblitz.\r\n\r\n## üî• Exception or Error\r\n\r\n```\r\nERROR DOMException: Failed to execute 'createElement' on 'Document': The tag name provided ('') is not a valid name. \r\nat DefaultDomRenderer2.createElement (http://localhost:4200/vendor.js:82322:25) \r\nat elementCreate (http://localhost:4200/vendor.js:53703:32) \r\nat ComponentFactory$1.create (http://localhost:4200/vendor.js:67815:13) \r\nat DomPortalHost.attachComponentPortal (http://localhost:4200/vendor.js:94547:41) \r\nat DomPortalHost.attach (http://localhost:4200/vendor.js:94505:21) at OverlayRef.attach (http://localhost:4200/vendor.js:94629:33) \r\nat ToastrService._buildNotification (http://localhost:4200/vendor.js:94955:35) \r\nat ToastrService._preBuildNotification (http://localhost:4200/vendor.js:94921:21) \r\nat ToastrService.success\r\n```\r\n\r\n## üåç  Your Environment\r\n\r\n**Angular Version:**\r\n<pre><code>\r\nAngular CLI: 8.2.0-next.1\r\nNode: 12.6.0\r\nOS: win32 x64\r\nAngular:\r\n...\r\n\r\nPackage                      Version\r\n------------------------------------------------------\r\n@angular-devkit/architect    0.802.0-next.1\r\n@angular-devkit/core         8.2.0-next.1\r\n@angular-devkit/schematics   8.2.0-next.1\r\n@schematics/angular          8.2.0-next.1\r\n@schematics/update           0.802.0-next.1\r\nrxjs                         6.4.0\r\n\r\n</code></pre>\r\n\r\n**Anything else relevant?**\r\nCauses https://github.com/scttcper/ngx-toastr/issues/686\r\n","Url":"https://github.com/angular/angular/issues/31785","RelatedDescription":"Open issue \"Regression Ivy with ComponentFactory\" (#31785)"},{"Id":"471234932","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2019-07-22T18:10:40","Actor":"alexeagle","Number":"31783","RawContent":null,"Title":"fix(zone.js): don't rely on global node typings outside of node/ dire‚Ä¶","State":"open","Body":"‚Ä¶ctory\r\n","Url":"https://github.com/angular/angular/pull/31783","RelatedDescription":"Open PR \"fix(zone.js): don't rely on global node typings outside of node/ dire‚Ä¶\" (#31783)"},{"Id":"471212816","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2019-07-22T17:27:57","Actor":"ayazhafiz","Number":"31782","RawContent":null,"Title":"feat(ivy): pass information about used directive selectors on elements","State":"open","Body":"Extend indexing API interface to provide information about used\r\ndirectives' selectors on template elements.

It seems as if the WTF extension is somehow breaking the System.js module loader and preventing it from loading Angular 2 app.\n\n1) WTF monkey patches the XMLHttpRequest object. \n2) Angular, through zone.js then monkey patches the XMLHttpRequest again.\n3) system.js sends of a request to load the code code.\n  3.a) WTF sees the response, but when it tries to forward the request on, it fails\n  3.b) the syntem.js does not see the response.\n\nSo it seems like the WTF and zone.js do not like each other when monkeypatching.\n\nZone.js way of monkey patching:\n- https://github.com/angular/zone.js/blob/08c7084046f9c9ab8b25d739bbb398be8476cdfe/lib/patch/event-target.js\n- https://github.com/angular/zone.js/blob/d8a7457cb5aefdde8ebaab9e72383d90321defd0/lib/utils.js#L87\n\nWTF monkey patching code:\n- https://github.com/google/tracing-framework/blob/661b2031b13e0535403c169d769123d659649720/src/wtf/trace/providers/xhrprovider.js#L75\n\nIf you click the gear on the WTF HUD that's on the page and go to Providers at the bottom you can uncheck the XMLHttpRequest provider. Then the page works great. So it's definitely this causing a problem.\n\nXHR lives here:\nhttps://github.com/google/tracing-framework/blob/master/src/wtf/trace/providers/xhrprovider.js#L103\n\nI actually swap out the entire XMLHttpRequest object with that version.\n\nIt subclasses BaseEventTarget, which adds the addEventListener/removeEventListener methods:\nhttps://github.com/google/tracing-framework/blob/master/src/wtf/trace/eventtarget.js#L431\n\nI'm not seeing anything that stands out as a possible problem.\nIt's possible patchProperty in zone.js is also messing with things (if you're using the on\\* properties instead of addEventListener).\n\n1) WTF creates a new XHR implementation and replaces the global one.\n2) Zone.js patches only EventTarget (not the XHR) since it assumes that XHR inherits from EventTarget\n  2a) as a result zone does not patch the WTF-XHR.\n\nSo the above is definitely a problem, but it should manifest as a broken VMTurn detection not as broken XHR.

(Original on Stackoverflow)](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/57121368/why-did-the-breakpoints-in-vs19-stop-working-after-angular-8-update)\r\n\r\n**Summarization:**\r\nI just updated my angular webproject yesterday from version 7.2.15 to 8.1.2 with the angular cli and the ng update command. But now if I try to debug my typescript code, all of a sudden the breakpoints won't work anymore in visual studio community 2019?\r\n\r\nSo when I activate a breakpoint, then the breakpoint turns white and shows a label text that says something like: Breakpoint set but not yet bound.\r\n\r\n\r\n**What I've already tried:**\r\nWhen using google I found out that other users had a similiar issue and they resolved the problem by setting inside of tsconfig.json. \r\n\r\n```\r\n\"sourceMap\": true\r\n``` \r\n\r\nUnlucky for me this didn't change anything since my tsconfig.json already had the property sourceMap set to true but the breakpoints still wouldn't get hit.\r\n\r\nMy guess is that the angular update somewhat overwrote some setting in some file, which I'm totally not aware of.\r\n\r\n\r\n**Show some code:**\r\nLooking in to the comparison of my commits, I noticed that in tsconfig.json and package.json files a lot of other stuff has also changed like:\r\n\r\n*tsconfig.json*\r\n```\r\n+ \"downlevelIteration\": true,\r\n- \"module\": \"es2015\",\r\n+ \"module\": \"esnext\",\r\n- \"target\": \"es5\",\r\n+ \"target\": \"es2015\",\r\n```\r\n\r\n*package.json:*\r\n```\r\n- \"@angular-devkit/build-angular\": \"^0.12.4\",\r\n+ \"@angular-devkit/build-angular\": \"~0.801.1\",\r\n- \"codelyzer\": \"~4.5.0\",\r\n+ \"codelyzer\": \"^5.0.1\",\r\n- \"zone.js\": \"~0.8.29\"\r\n+ \"zone.js\": \"~0.9.1\"\r\n- \"typescript\": \"3.1.6\"\r\n+ \"typescript\": \"3.4.5\"\r\n```\r\n\r\n\r\n*tslint.json:*\r\n```\r\n- \"use-input-property-decorator\": true,\r\n- \"use-output-property-decorator\": true,\r\n- \"use-host-property-decorator\": true,\r\n+ \"no-inputs-metadata-property\": true,\r\n+ \"no-outputs-metadata-property\": true,\r\n+ \"no-host-metadata-property\": true,\r\n```\r\n\r\n**Expected Result/Behaviour:** Expected would be that the breakpoints would hit so I could see what was going on in my code. But as said the breakpoints just go white and won't get bound.\r\n\r\n**The final question:** So my question in the end would be: How to get the breakpoints working again in VS2019 after the angular 8 update?\r\n\r\n**(21.07.2019) Edit 1:** Meanwhile I also tried to delete the 'node_modules' folder inside the ClientApp folder and reinstall it again with npm install. Unfortunately the breakpoints still won't get hit. \r\n\r\n**(22.07.2019) Edit 2:** \"This can't be the solution?\" : Seems like reverting angular to version 7.2.15 has fixed the breakpoint issue and I can look in to my breakpoints again. Allthough I'm not quite satisfied with the approach because it would have been great to Update to the current Version.

causing the error, but I only get it when I navigate to this specific component, and only when I've run ng build --prod.  \r\nHere are my imports for that component, but nothing really changed within this component from the time it worked to the time it didn't.  \r\n\r\n```\r\nimport { Component, OnInit } from '@angular/core';\r\nimport { GENERAL_REF } from '../../dbReferences';\r\nimport {

Let's call this application `tenant` and the library `shared-lib`.\r\nA component in the `tenant` wants to import a stylesheet of a component from `shared-lib`. This particular stylesheet imports a CSS like so:\r\n```\r\n@import 'colors'; // the lib's ng-package.json styleIncludePaths is already configured.\r\n```\r\nThis will compile just fine in the library.\r\n\r\nNow there is a component in `tenant` that wants to import this particular stylesheet.\r\nThis used to work before by doing this:\r\n\r\n1. Import the stylesheet explicitly,  in `projects/tenant/components/tenant-util.component.ts`\r\n```\r\n  styleUrls: [\r\n    '../../../../shared-lib/src/lib/components/util.component.scss',\r\n    './tenant-util.component.scss'\r\n  ]\r\n...\r\n```\r\n2. Configure `stylePreprocessorOptions` in the `tenant` project settings.\r\n```\r\n\"projects\": {\r\n    \"tenant\": {\r\n           ...\r\n           \"stylePreprocessorOptions\": {\r\n              \"includePaths\": [\r\n                \"projects/shared-lib/src/lib/stylesheets\"\r\n              ]\r\n            },\r\n```\r\n\r\n\r\n## üî¨ Minimal Reproduction\r\nClone this repo: https://github.com/jonathanlie/angular-demo\r\n\r\n1. To demonstrate the working version, inside the cloned repo:\r\n```\r\ngit checkout angular-cli-8.0.3\r\nnpm install\r\nng build shared-lib\r\nng serve --aot tenant\r\n```\r\n\r\n2. To demonstrate the non-working version\r\n```\r\ngit checkout master\r\nsudo rm -r ./node_modules\r\nnpm install\r\nng build shared-lib\r\nng serve --aot tenant\r\n```\r\n\r\nThere will be an error when serving the `tenant` app as described in the section below.\r\n\r\n## üî• Exception or Error\r\n<pre><code>\r\n10% building 3/3 modules 0 active‚Ñπ ÔΩ¢wdsÔΩ£: Project is running at http://localhost:4200/webpack-dev-server/\r\n‚Ñπ ÔΩ¢wdsÔΩ£: webpack output is served from /\r\n‚Ñπ ÔΩ¢wdsÔΩ£: 404s will fallback to //index.html\r\n\r\nchunk {main} main.js, main.js.map (main) 2.07 kB [initial] [rendered]\r\nchunk {polyfills} polyfills.js, polyfills.js.map (polyfills) 712 bytes [initial] [rendered]\r\nchunk {runtime} runtime.js, runtime.js.map (runtime) 6.09 kB [entry] [rendered]\r\nchunk {styles} styles.js, styles.js.map (styles) 17 kB [initial] [rendered]\r\nchunk {vendor} vendor.js, vendor.js.map (vendor) 341 kB [initial] [rendered]\r\nDate: 2019-07-19T06:18:00.166Z - Hash: d82cd3d8b42ac99436fa - Time: 1565ms\r\n\r\nERROR in Module build failed (from /angular-demo/node_modules/sass-loader/lib/loader.js):\r\n\r\n@import 'colors';\r\n       ^\r\n      Can't find stylesheet to import.\r\n  ‚ï∑\r\n1 ‚îÇ @import 'colors';\r\n  ‚îÇ         ^^^^^^^^\r\n  ‚ïµ\r\n  stdin 1:9  root stylesheet\r\n      in /angular-demo/projects/shared-lib/src/lib/components/util.component.scss (line 1, column 9)\r\n</code></pre>\r\n\r\n## üåç Your Environment\r\n<pre><code>\r\nAngular CLI: 8.1.2\r\nNode: 12.3.1\r\nOS: darwin x64\r\nAngular: 8.1.2\r\n... animations, cli, common, compiler, compiler-cli, core, forms\r\n... language-service, platform-browser, platform-browser-dynamic\r\n... router\r\n\r\nPackage                            Version\r\n------------------------------------------------------------\r\n@angular-devkit/architect          0.801.2\r\n@angular-devkit/build-angular      0.801.2\r\n@angular-devkit/build-ng-packagr   0.801.2\r\n@angular-devkit/build-optimizer    0.801.2\r\n@angular-devkit/build-webpack      0.801.2\r\n@angular-devkit/core               8.1.2\r\n@angular-devkit/schematics         8.1.2\r\n@ngtools/json-schema               1.1.0\r\n@ngtools/webpack                   8.1.2\r\n@schematics/angular                8.1.2\r\n@schematics/update                 0.801.2\r\nng-packagr                         5.3.0\r\nrxjs                               6.4.0\r\ntypescript                         3.4.5\r\nwebpack                            4.35.2\r\n</code></pre>\r\n","Url":"https://github.com/angular/angular-cli/issues/15126","RelatedDescription":"Closed issue \"application stylePreprocessorOptions cannot detect paths from a library\" (#15126)"},{"Id":"470234626","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2019-07-19T09:40:43","Actor":"alan-agius4","Number":"15128","RawContent":null,"Title":"fix(@schematics/angular): add differential loading profiling file to gi‚Ä¶","State":"open","Body":"\r\nWhen differential loading enabled we will have different profiling files for every build target\r\n\r\nEx:\r\n```\r\nchrome-profiler-events-es2015.json\r\nspeed-measure-plugin-es2015.json\r\nchrome-profiler-events-es5.json\r\nspeed-measure-plugin-es5.json\r\n```","Url":"https://github.com/angular/angular-cli/pull/15128","RelatedDescription":"Open PR \"fix(@schematics/angular): add differential loading profiling file to gi‚Ä¶\" (#15128)"},{"Id":"470228837","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2019-07-19T09:27:53","Actor":"alan-agius4","Number":"15127","RawContent":null,"Title":"feat(@angular-devkit/build-angular): add bundle budget for component styles","State":"open","Body":"\r\nIt‚Äôs very easy to inadvertently import toplevel css in component styles.
