[IntelliSense](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/visualstudio/ide/using-intellisense?view=vs-2019) files for .NET Core 3.0 and 3.1, in following 10 Visual Studio supported languages: \r\n- Brazilian Portuguese\r\n- Chinese (simplified)\r\n- Chinese (traditional)\r\n- French\r\n- German\r\n- Italian\r\n- Japanese\r\n- Korean\t\r\n- Russian\r\n- Spanish\r\n\r\nThe files (in zip archives) are available for download from [**Download localized .NET Core IntelliSense files**](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/download/dotnet-core/intellisense).\r\n\r\n * [Checksums for 3.0 zip files](https://dotnetcli.blob.core.windows.net/dotnet/checksums/3.0.0-intellisense-sha.txt)\r\n * [Checksums for 3.1 zip files](https://dotnetcli.blob.core.windows.net/dotnet/checksums/3.1.0-intellisense-sha.txt)\r\n\r\nYou can see [the .NET Core Guide](https://aka.ms/dotnet-core-intellisense) for instructions on how to use these files with Visual Studio.\r\n\r\nBy default, when you're developing .NET Core projects, the SDK only includes the English version of the IntelliSense files. But now you can enhance your localized Visual Studio development experience by adding the localized IntelliSense files from the download site into your local development environment.\r\n\r\nLastly, with this release we have made the localized IntelliSense available as zip archives that does require you to manually extract and copy the files to respective SDK install folders. But we plan to make this experience better in future releases.\r\n\r\n## Discussion\r\nTo discuss this issue, please comment on the corresponding issue at [dotnet/core #4032](https://github.com/dotnet/core/issues/4032).\r\n"},{"Id":"11059014848","Type":"IssuesEvent","CreatedAt":"2019-12-10T22:29:30","Actor":"TaraOverfield","Repository":"dotnet/announcements","Organization":"dotnet","RawContent":null,"RelatedAction":"opened","RelatedUrl":"https://github.com/dotnet/announcements/issues/145","RelatedDescription":"Opened issue \"December 2019 .NET Updates\" (#145) at dotnet/announcements","RelatedBody":"The following .NET updates were released on November 2019.

This means some folks will lose their Collaborator badge and the ability to interact with the CI system.*\r\n\r\nOver the years, we’ve added a bunch of folks as collaborators with read permissions to our public repos. The rationale was that we wanted to be able to assign issues to community members because GitHub only allowed assigning issues to users with an explicit permission grant for the repository. However, they changed this in [June 2019](https://github.blog/2019-06-25-assign-issues-to-issue-commenters/). Now, we can assign issues to all users with explicit permissions as well as to users that have commented on the specific issue.\r\n\r\nAlso, we recently started to audit and tighten the permissions for our organizations. As a result, it became clear that large number of repo-specific permission grants are hard to review and audit. Internally, our goal is to grant all permissions via teams instead.\r\n\r\nHence, we plan to remove all collaborators from public repos that only have read permissions (folks with triage permissions will remain). The full list of affected repos is listed below.\r\n\r\nThis shouldn’t impact your ability to work with us, but losing explicit read-only has the following implications:\r\n\r\n-   **You’ll lose the contributor badge**. We understand that this is visually appealing and for some people it might have been a badge of honor. But given that GitHub also shows a Contributor bade for folks whose PRs got merged, we don’t think it this will be a major take back.    \r\n    ![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/5169960/70491508-43acf580-1ab6-11ea-94df-74ea2dde98b4.png)\r\n\r\n\r\n-   **You lose the ability to interact with the CI system**. As a collaborator, you can use comments to [send commands to the CI system](https://github.com/dotnet/runtime/blob/master/docs/project/pullrequest-builds.md). While this can be useful at times, we generally don’t expect (or desire) contributors to do that. Of course, anyone can still access the CI logs.\r\n\r\n| Public Repo                | \\#collaborators with read |\r\n|----------------------------|---------------------------|\r\n| arcade                     | 1                         |\r\n| BenchmarkDotNet            | 11                        |\r\n| cli                        | 2                         |\r\n| command-line-api           | 14                        |\r\n| coreclr                    | 18                        |\r\n| corefx                     | 180                       |\r\n| corefxlab                  | 4                         |\r\n| corert                     | 7                         |\r\n| core-sdk                   | 1                         |\r\n| docs                       | 3                         |\r\n| interactive-window         | 1                         |\r\n| machinelearning            | 1                         |\r\n| machinelearning-samples    | 1                         |\r\n| msbuild-language-service   | 1                         |\r\n| runtime                    | 128                       |\r\n| spark                      | 5                         |\r\n| standard                   | 1                         |\r\n| windowsdesktop             | 1                         |\r\n| winforms-datavisualization | 1                         |\r\n| Grand Total                | 381                       |\r\n\r\n### Discussion\r\n\r\nTo discuss this, please comment on the corresponding issue at https://github.com/dotnet/runtime/issues/718."},{"Id":"11003471296","Type":"IssuesEvent","CreatedAt":"2019-12-03T20:36:30","Actor":"MichaelSimons","Repository":"dotnet/announcements","Organization":"dotnet","RawContent":null,"RelatedAction":"opened","RelatedUrl":"https://github.com/dotnet/announcements/issues/143","RelatedDescription":"Opened issue \".NET Core `latest` Docker tags updated to 3.1\" (#143) at dotnet/announcements","RelatedBody":"# .NET Core `latest` Docker tags updated to 3.1\r\n\r\nThe `latest` tags for the [dotnet/core](https://hub.docker.com/_/microsoft-dotnet-core) repos have been updated to reference [.NET Core 3.1](https://devblogs.microsoft.com/dotnet/announcing-net-core-3-1/).\r\n\r\n## Discussion\r\n \r\nYou can share your thoughts on this change or see what others are saying at:\r\n \r\n* [dotnet/dotnet-docker#1337](https://github.com/dotnet/dotnet-docker/issues/1511)\r\n\r\n## Details\r\n\r\n* [dotnet-docker#1509](https://github.com/dotnet/dotnet-docker/pull/1509)\r\n\r\nThe `latest` tags for the [dotnet/core](https://hub.docker.com/_/microsoft-dotnet-core) repos are always intended to reference the latest supported version of .NET Core.

https://github.com/dotnet/corefx/issues/42192\r\n\r\n### Summary\r\nOn RHEL 8, some time zones (specifically `Africa/Casablanca`) stop supporting daylight savings transitions because of a change in the tzdata files.\r\n\r\n### Customer Impact\r\nApplications getting time zone information on RedHat 8 (and potentially other Unix distros if using the same tzdata version) stop working with daylight savings time for `Africa/Casablanca` time zone.\r\n\r\nThis change allows `TimeZoneInfo` to work correctly for all the daylight savings transitions in the tzdata file, and it skips the \"future\" daylight savings template if we can't support it.\r\n\r\n### Regression?\r\nFor a user it is a regression when updating to RHEL 8 because of the change in the tzdata in the OS. Our code didn't regress here - we never supported this format before now and were always throwing an exception. This is the first time we've hit it in the real-world.\r\n\r\n### Testing\r\nI ran all the TimeZoneInfo tests on RHEL 8. They failed for `Africa/Casablanca` before this change, and now pass afterward.\r\n\r\n### Risk\r\n**Low**: The change is isolated to a non-supported format that would cause DST to completely stop working before. Now we are allowing the other DST information to work, while skipping the unsupported future dates.\r\n\r\ncc: @danmosemsft @tarekgh @ericstj \r\n\r\n____\r\n\r\n\r\nIsDaylightSavingTime_CasablancaMultiYearDaylightSavings fails on rhel.8\r\n\r\nWhen parsing the tzdata POSIX string that contains an 'n' Julian date, we are currently throwing an exception, and then falling back to a TimeZoneInfo without DST enabled. However, this is a mistake because there are other DST transitions that were read from the tzdata file that are valid and usable. We shouldn't be throwing that information away.\r\n\r\nSo instead, we now skip the POSIX string if we detect an unsupported 'n' Julian date, and just use the last transition as the AdjustmentRule for all the DateTimes in the future. This way we can still make DST determinations correctly for some DateTimes.\r\n\r\nFix https://github.com/dotnet/corefx/issues/42192","Url":"https://github.com/dotnet/coreclr/pull/27969","RelatedDescription":"Open PR \"[release/3.1] Stop throwing exception in TimeZoneInfo POSIX parsing\" (#27969)"},{"Id":"535533061","IsPullRequest":false,"CreatedAt":"2019-12-10T14:47:07","Actor":"NMSAzulX","Number":"27968","RawContent":null,"Title":"How do I write code that allows a method to use Calli instructions at run time?

In my opinion, FromIDictionaryToCaseInsensitiveDictionaryTest should work because the type is CaseInsensitiveDictionary and implements IDictionary.  If I do NOT have the first conversion operator, the first test method fails with this exact same error message, \r\n\r\nWith this evidence, it seems to me that something is missing when the runtime is looking for the appropriate operator.  FromIDictionaryToCaseInsensitiveDictionaryTest should work either from the Dictionary operator or automatically work because it implements the IDictionary interface.

The issue also exists in master/5.0. https://github.com/dotnet/runtime/pull/784 fixes it in master, and this PR ports the fix to 3.0.\r\n\r\nIn addition to the fix described above, this PR also also has a deserialization fix for an `InvalidCastException` thrown when a dictionary element type has a converter that returns a type different from the declared type, e.g. when you're deserializing `Dictionary<string, MyClass>`, where\r\n\r\n```c#\r\nprivate interface IClass { }\r\n\r\nprivate class MyClass : IClass { }\r\n\r\nprivate class MyFactory : JsonConverterFactory\r\n{\r\n    public override bool CanConvert(Type typeToConvert)\r\n    {\r\n        return typeToConvert == typeof(IClass) || typeToConvert == typeof(MyClass);\r\n    }\r\n\r\n    public override JsonConverter CreateConverter(Type typeToConvert, JsonSerializerOptions options)\r\n    {\r\n        return new MyStuffConverter();\r\n    }\r\n}\r\n\r\nprivate class MyStuffConverter : JsonConverter<IClass>\r\n{\r\n    public override IClass Read(ref Utf8JsonReader reader, Type typeToConvert, JsonSerializerOptions options)\r\n    {\r\n        return new MyClass();\r\n    }\r\n\r\n    public override void Write(Utf8JsonWriter writer, IClass value, JsonSerializerOptions options)\r\n    {\r\n        writer.WriteNumberValue(1);\r\n    }\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nIn this case, the read method of the converter for `typeof(MyClass)` returns a type `IClass` (not the declared type, `MyClass`) which causes an `InvalidCastException` later in the deserialization flow.\r\n\r\n## Customer Impact\r\n\r\nThe ability to serialize nested concurrent dictionaries is restored: https://github.com/dotnet/runtime/issues/670. \r\n\r\nThe deserialization scenario is an edge case, but the fix defends against leaking exceptions were it to occur.\r\n\r\n## Regression\r\n\r\nNo. The serialization change's tests are wide-ranging and covers various permutations of nested dictionaries, so a regression is unlikely.\r\n\r\nThe deserialization change adds more support without rescinding support.

{encodingBytes.Length}:\"\"{encodingAsStr}\"\" vs {encoderBytes.Count}:\"\"{encoderAsStr}\"\"\");\r\n```\r\n\r\nThis prints when it (probably) shouldn't.\r\n\r\nThis behavior is quite sensitive to the value of `destBufferSize`, happening for this particular string at values 2, 4, 5, 8, 10, 20, 40 ,& 41 (note that 42 is the size the destination buffer needs to be for a single `Convert` call to be sufficient).","Url":"https://github.com/dotnet/corefx/issues/42751","RelatedDescription":"Closed issue \"Calling Latin1 / iso-8859-1 Encoder Convert method iteratively produces different results than Encoding GetBytes on \"naughty\" string\" (#42751)"},{"Id":"530463719","IsPullRequest":false,"CreatedAt":"2019-11-30T20:58:46","Actor":"kevin-montrose","Number":"42750","RawContent":null,"Title":"UTF7 Encoder Convert method fails to make progress on \"naughty\" string","State":"closed","Body":"I noticed some odd behavior with UTF7's [`Encoder`](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/api/system.text.encoder?view=netcore-3.0), and failing to make progress on a [\"naughty\" string](https://github.com/minimaxir/big-list-of-naughty-strings).\r\n\r\nNamely, adapting the example code provided for [`Convert`](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/api/system.text.encoder.convert?view=netcore-3.0) will spin forever (failing to set `completed == true`) on `@\"00˙Ɩ$-\"`.\r\n\r\nUTF7 is sufficiently weird that maybe this is expected, and I just don't understand it?\r\n\r\nI have a [repository with a repro](https://github.com/kevin-montrose/Latin1Repro/blob/master/Latin1Repro/Program.cs#L19) (it also has some Latin1 stuff that I'll report in a separate issue, as it's probably unrelated).\r\n\r\nA smaller version of what's in the repo:\r\n\r\n```csharp\r\nvar destBufferSize = 16;\r\nvar encoding = System.Text.Encoding.UTF7;\r\nvar text = @\"00˙Ɩ$-\";\r\n\r\nvar encoder = encoding.GetEncoder();\r\n\r\nvar chars = text.ToCharArray();\r\n\r\nvar sourceSpan = chars.AsSpan();\r\nvar destSpan = new byte[destBufferSize].AsSpan();\r\nvar encoderBytes = new List<byte>();\r\n\r\nvar completed = false;\r\n\r\nwhile (!completed)\r\n{\r\n    var flush = sourceSpan.Length == 0;\r\n    encoder.Convert(sourceSpan, destSpan, flush, out var charsConsumed, out var bytesProduced, out completed);\r\n    encoderBytes.AddRange(destSpan.Slice(0, bytesProduced).ToArray());\r\n\r\n    sourceSpan = sourceSpan.Slice(charsConsumed);\r\n\r\n    if (charsConsumed == 0 && bytesProduced == 0 && flush)\r\n    {\r\n        Console.WriteLine($@\"Encoding Convert failure for destBufferSize={destBufferSize}, stopped making progress\");\r\n        return;\r\n    }\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nWill print, when it (probably) shouldn't.","Url":"https://github.com/dotnet/corefx/issues/42750","RelatedDescription":"Closed issue \"UTF7 Encoder Convert method fails to make progress on \"naughty\" string\" (#42750)"},{"Id":"530147717","IsPullRequest":false,"CreatedAt":"2019-11-29T04:14:37","Actor":"oliverjanik","Number":"42749","RawContent":null,"Title":"Include System.Linq.Async from https://github.com/dotnet/reactive into corefx","State":"open","Body":"I am very happy we have the new `IAsyncEnumerable` and some c# sugar to go with it in .net core 3.\r\n\r\nI think it would be even better if it had batteries included just like `IEnumerable`.\r\n\r\n👍 ","Url":"https://github.com/dotnet/corefx/issues/42749","RelatedDescription":"Open issue \"Include System.Linq.Async from https://github.com/dotnet/reactive into corefx\" (#42749)"},{"Id":"529960264","IsPullRequest":false,"CreatedAt":"2019-11-28T19:06:35","Actor":"sulemanb","Number":"42748","RawContent":null,"Title":"Error: GSSAPI operation failed with error -

Originally since the C++ signature uses `const&` (we just want to pass the struct by pointer/reference from C++ to C# as a view over read-only memory) we used `in` instead of `ref` for the `I420AVideoFrame` parameter, but this yields an error during the .NET Native build (and works with JIT):\r\n```\r\nerror : ILT0021: Could not resolve method 'EETypeRva:0x--------'\r\n```\r\n\r\nThis seems to be the error defined in `RuntimeTypeHandle.cs`, which is worryingly marked as \"last resort\" in comment, although I would expect there should be some metadata available for that method:\r\nhttps://github.com/dotnet/corert/blob/e2c4bc3d7889f951c231d7f131d6a7e20c034fb6/src/System.Private.CoreLib/src/System/RuntimeTypeHandle.cs#L134\r\n\r\nNote that we had to manually define the `MonoPInvokeCallback` attribute which seems to be required for working with Unity's IL2CPP, so we copied a definition from the Mono project:\r\n```cs\r\n[AttributeUsage(AttributeTargets.Method)]\r\nsealed class MonoPInvokeCallbackAttribute : Attribute\r\n{\r\n    public MonoPInvokeCallbackAttribute(Type t) { }\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nIs there any reason `ref` works and not `in` in this context? I assume that by using `ref` we expose ourselves to bugs where the C# code inadvertently modifying the struct would produce some side effect on the C++ side which the C++ compiler did not intend to see (since the parameter is `const&` there), which could lead to bugs, so the current workaround with `ref` is not ideal.","Url":"https://github.com/dotnet/corert/issues/7917","RelatedDescription":"Closed issue \"Build error for reverse P/Invoke with ref struct parameter (ref vs. in)\" (#7917)"},{"Id":"538560233","IsPullRequest":false,"CreatedAt":"2019-12-16T18:08:01","Actor":"lifecoder-phoenix","Number":"7919","RawContent":null,"Title":"Native dll with async","State":"closed","Body":"Hello,\r\nI'm actually wondering how dll compiled to native would behave if I expose an async task and call it from a C++ program.

This has worked ok up till now, but there is a problem I think with `FieldInfo.SetValue`.  This takes an object so boxes the float32.  Currently this fails as the address passed to `SetValue` is an address to a float64 and RhBox does not expect that and the value is corrupted (a 64bit float is interpreted as a 32 bit float I think).  In other words the following test fails\r\n```\r\n    internal static void TestBoxSingle()\r\n    {\r\n        StartTest(\"Test box single\");\r\n        var fi = typeof(ClassWithFloat).GetField(\"F\");\r\n        fi.SetValue(null, 1.1f);\r\n\r\n        PrintLine(ClassWithFloat.F.ToString());\r\n        EndTest(1.1f == ClassWithFloat.F);\r\n    }\r\n}\r\n\r\npublic class ClassWithFloat\r\n{\r\n    public static float F;\r\n}\r\n``` \r\nAnd it prints -1.0842022E-19.   In the Wasm backend the evaluation stack can have a `StackEntry` type of `FloatConstantEntry`, but this I'm not sure is sufficient to solve this problem as the enum for StackValueKind is \r\n```\r\n    internal enum StackValueKind\r\n    {\r\n        /// <summary>An unknow type.</summary>\r\n        Unknown,\r\n        /// <summary>Any signed or unsigned integer values that can be represented as a 32-bit entity.</summary>\r\n        Int32,\r\n        /// <summary>Any signed or unsigned integer values that can be represented as a 64-bit entity.</summary>\r\n        Int64,\r\n        /// <summary>Underlying platform pointer type represented as an integer of the appropriate size.</summary>\r\n        NativeInt,\r\n        /// <summary>Any float value.</summary>\r\n        Float,\r\n        /// <summary>A managed pointer.</summary>\r\n        ByRef,\r\n        /// <summary>An object reference.</summary>\r\n        ObjRef,\r\n        /// <summary>A value type which is not any of the primitive one.</summary>\r\n        ValueType\r\n    }\r\n```\r\nIt does not distinguish between 32 and 64 bit floats, so its impossible, I think, to load the constant correctly from\r\n```\r\n  IL_0023:  ldc.r4     1.1\r\n  IL_0028:  box        [System.Runtime]System.Single\r\n```\r\nThe 1.1 is loaded with the `FloatConstantEntry` and it can't be passed correctly to the box/RhBox as its unknown whether to trunc the float or not.  \r\n\r\nMy question is, is my thinking correct and I need to add a new `StackEntry` type so that its known if the value was 32 or 64 bits?

This is not the case with the files that are following traditional `644` permission, but all subdirectories within `/var/tmp/.net` also follow `700`. Folders created manually result in default permission of `755`.\r\n\r\n`700` access means that if two or more distinct users try to run one or more `PublishSingleFile=true` applications, everybody but the first guy will receive a fatal error:\r\n\r\n```\r\nFailure processing application bundle.\r\nFailed to create directory [/var/tmp/.net/<project>/] for extracting bundled files\r\nA fatal error was encountered. Could not extract contents of the bundle\r\n```\r\n\r\nThis is a severe problem since it makes running `PublishSingleFile=true` apps impossible if we consider two or more distinct users on the operating system, and it's even more severe considering that `/var/tmp` is preserved across reboots, since if one user creates `/var/tmp/.net` folder with that `700` permission, then no other user will have access to it until it's deleted. This is what `dotnet` is currently doing.\r\n\r\nTo make it worse, we also need to realize that `.net` is a special subdirectory that everybody should have write access to, as otherwise we could have the same problem if other user will try to run some other app, as `dotnet` won't be able to access the directory. Similar case is with `<project>`, just for running two or more versions of the same project.\r\n\r\nPotential solution to the problem:\r\n- Make `/var/tmp/.net` folder follow `777` permission. like `/tmp` and `/var/tmp` does, since it's an extension of temporary directory, just for `dotnet`.\r\n- Make `/var/tmp/.net/<project>` folder follow `777` permission as well, since you may have a case where two or more users run different versions of the same software, leading to them both needing access to `/var/tmp/.net/<project>`.\r\n- Up to your own judgment, make `/var/tmp/.net/<project>/<version>` at least `755` so other users can re-use already extracted structures. `755` should be enough in this case considering that we won't need to do any manual modifications inside after extraction (as I read from the design docs), so read access for other users is more than enough.\r\n\r\nAlternative solution to the problem:\r\n- Make use of other solutions available on unixes, such as making use of the groups or ACLs, probably overkill for this use case but you're deciding here.\r\n\r\nReproduction steps:\r\n- Publish `PublishSingleFile=true` application.\r\n- `adduser testuser1` and `adduser testuser2`.\r\n- Run your software as `testuser1`, then as `testuser2`. Second user will not be able to run the application, unless he is the first user, `root` or has some special permission to access those `700` directories created by `testuser1`.\r\n\r\nIn any case thank you for your time looking into this problem.\r\n\r\n```\r\n.NET Core SDK (reflecting any global.json):\r\n Version:   3.1.100\r\n Commit:    cd82f021f4\r\n\r\nRuntime Environment:\r\n OS Name:     debian\r\n OS Version:\r\n OS Platform: Linux\r\n RID:         debian-x64\r\n Base Path:   /usr/share/dotnet/sdk/3.1.100/\r\n\r\nHost (useful for support):\r\n  Version: 3.1.0\r\n  Commit:  157910edee\r\n```","Url":"https://github.com/dotnet/sdk/issues/4066","RelatedDescription":"Open issue \"Possibility of access denied when running PublishSingleFile=true app on Unix\" (#4066)"},{"Id":"538585009","IsPullRequest":false,"CreatedAt":"2019-12-16T18:41:48","Actor":"assyadh","Number":"4065","RawContent":null,"Title":".NET Core 3.1 \"+dependencies\" tags missing.","State":"open","Body":"Hi,\r\n\r\nWhen building .NET Core 3.1 from source, we used to have tags containing the dependencies required.

This means some folks will lose their Collaborator badge and the ability to interact with the CI system.*\r\n\r\nOver the years, we’ve added a bunch of folks as collaborators with read permissions to our public repos. The rationale was that we wanted to be able to assign issues to community members because GitHub only allowed assigning issues to users with an explicit permission grant for the repository. However, they changed this in [June 2019](https://github.blog/2019-06-25-assign-issues-to-issue-commenters/). Now, we can assign issues to all users with explicit permissions as well as to users that have commented on the specific issue.\r\n\r\nAlso, we recently started to audit and tighten the permissions for our organizations. As a result, it became clear that large number of repo-specific permission grants are hard to review and audit. Internally, our goal is to grant all permissions via teams instead.\r\n\r\nHence, we plan to remove all collaborators from public repos that only have read permissions (folks with triage permissions will remain). The full list of affected repos is listed below.\r\n\r\nThis shouldn’t impact your ability to work with us, but losing explicit read-only has the following implications:\r\n\r\n-   **You’ll lose the collaborator badge**. We understand that this is visually appealing and for some people it might have been a badge of honor. But given that GitHub also shows a Contributor bade for folks whose PRs got merged, we don’t think it this will be a major take back.    \r\n    ![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/5169960/70491508-43acf580-1ab6-11ea-94df-74ea2dde98b4.png)\r\n\r\n-   ~~**You lose the ability to interact with the CI system**. As a collaborator, you can use comments to [send commands to the CI system](https://github.com/dotnet/runtime/blob/master/docs/project/pullrequest-builds.md). While this can be useful at times, we generally don’t expect (or desire) contributors to do that. Of course, anyone can still access the CI logs.~~\r\n\r\n- **You might lose the ability to interact with the CI system**. Based on your feedback we have decided to give externals access to interact with the CI system *on a case by case basis*. If you believe you need to have that ability, please [leave a comment like Kevin's](https://github.com/dotnet/runtime/issues/718#issuecomment-563717478).\r\n\r\n| Public Repo                | \\#collaborators with read |\r\n|----------------------------|---------------------------|\r\n| arcade                     | 1                         |\r\n| BenchmarkDotNet            | 11                        |\r\n| cli                        | 2                         |\r\n| command-line-api           | 14                        |\r\n| coreclr                    | 18                        |\r\n| corefx                     | 180                       |\r\n| corefxlab                  | 4                         |\r\n| corert                     | 7                         |\r\n| core-sdk                   | 1                         |\r\n| docs                       | 3                         |\r\n| interactive-window         | 1                         |\r\n| machinelearning            | 1                         |\r\n| machinelearning-samples    | 1                         |\r\n| msbuild-language-service   | 1                         |\r\n| runtime                    | 128                       |\r\n| spark                      | 5                         |\r\n| standard                   | 1                         |\r\n| windowsdesktop             | 1                         |\r\n| winforms-datavisualization | 1                         |\r\n| Grand Total                | 381                       |\r\n\r\n### Discussion\r\n\r\nTo discuss this, please comment on the corresponding issue at https://github.com/dotnet/runtime/issues/718.","Url":"https://github.com/dotnet/announcements/issues/144","RelatedDescription":"Open issue \"Removal of read-collaborator access\" (#144)"},{"Id":"532249858","IsPullRequest":false,"CreatedAt":"2019-12-03T20:36:29","Actor":"MichaelSimons","Number":"143","RawContent":null,"Title":".NET Core `latest` Docker tags updated to 3.1","State":"open","Body":"# .NET Core `latest` Docker tags updated to 3.1\r\n\r\nThe `latest` tags for the [dotnet/core](https://hub.docker.com/_/microsoft-dotnet-core) repos have been updated to reference [.NET Core 3.1](https://devblogs.microsoft.com/dotnet/announcing-net-core-3-1/).\r\n\r\n## Discussion\r\n \r\nYou can share your thoughts on this change or see what others are saying at:\r\n \r\n* [dotnet/dotnet-docker#1337](https://github.com/dotnet/dotnet-docker/issues/1511)\r\n\r\n## Details\r\n\r\n* [dotnet-docker#1509](https://github.com/dotnet/dotnet-docker/pull/1509)\r\n\r\nThe `latest` tags for the [dotnet/core](https://hub.docker.com/_/microsoft-dotnet-core) repos are always intended to reference the latest supported version of .NET Core.

That means that .NET Core manifest tags are no longer usable on those Windows versions.\r\n\r\nIf you pull a manifest tag on one of the Windows versions described, you may get one of the following error messages:\r\n\r\n* `a Windows version 10.0.18362-based image is incompatible with a 10.0.17134 host`\r\n* `no matching manifest for windows/amd64 in the manifest list entries`\r\n* `no matching manifest for unknown in the manifest list entries`\r\n\r\nIf you need to still use Nano Server, version 1803 images (even though it is no longer supported), you will need to use tags that include the Nano Server version (these are non-manifest tags), for example `mcr.microsoft.com/dotnet/core/runtime:3.0-nanoserver-1803`.","Url":"https://github.com/dotnet/announcements/issues/140","RelatedDescription":"Open issue \"Windows Server, version 1803 no longer supported by .NET Core\" (#140)"},{"Id":"522994983","IsPullRequest":false,"CreatedAt":"2019-11-14T17:15:08","Actor":"leecow","Number":"139","RawContent":null,"Title":".NET Core 3.1.0 Preview 3","State":"open","Body":".NET Core 3.1.0 Preview 3 is available and https://github.com/dotnet/core/issues/3809 has been opened for discussion.\r\n\r\n[Release Notes](https://github.com/dotnet/core/blob/master/release-notes/3.1/preview/3.1.0-preview3.md)\r\n[Download](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/download/dotnet-core/3.1)\r\n\r\n**Blog posts**\r\n\r\n[.NET Core](https://devblogs.microsoft.com/dotnet/announcing-net-core-3-1-preview-3/)\r\n[ASP.NET Core](https://devblogs.microsoft.com/aspnet/asp-net-core-updates-in-net-core-3-1-preview-3/)\r\n\r\nPlease report any issues you find with .NET Core 3.1 Preview 3, either responding to this issue, creating a new issue or creating a new issue in one of the following repos:\r\n\r\n* [aspnet/Home](https://github.com/aspnet/Home) - for ASP.NET Core questions\r\n* [aspnet/EntityFrameworkCore](https://github.com/aspnet/EntityFrameworkCore) - for Entity Framework Core questions\r\n* [dotnet/cli](https://github.com/dotnet/cli/issues) - for CLI tools and questions\r\n* [dotnet/corefx](https://github.com/dotnet/corefx/issues) - for API issues and questions\r\n* [dotnet/coreclr](https://github.com/dotnet/coreclr/issues) - for runtime issues\r\n* [dotnet/core-setup](https://github.com/dotnet/core-setup/issues) - for installer issues\r\n* [dotnet/winforms](https://github.com/dotnet/winforms/issues) - for Winforms issues\r\n* [dotnet/wpf](https://github.com/dotnet/wpf/issues) - for WPF issues\r\n* [nuget/home](https://github.com/nuget/home/issues) - for NuGet questions and issues\r\n","Url":"https://github.com/dotnet/announcements/issues/139","RelatedDescription":"Open issue \".NET Core 3.1.0 Preview 3\" (#139)"},{"Id":"522864668","IsPullRequest":false,"CreatedAt":"2019-11-14T13:37:28","Actor":"TaraOverfield","Number":"138","RawContent":null,"Title":"November 2019 .NET Updates","State":"open","Body":"The following .NET updates were released on November 2019.

Our planning has reached a point where we have a schedule for the coreclr, corefx and core-setupmoves into dotnet/runtime that we want to share out with the community.\r\n\r\n### November 13th\r\nWe’ll move all changes from the original repositories into dotnet/runtime up to 5PM PST on November 13th. We’ll try to help as many pull requests as possible get merged by then. At that point, if there’s any pull requests still open we’ll have to close them. If you’d still like to continue those pull requests, we’d encourage you to bring them to dotnet/runtime in a new pull request.\r\n\r\nThe repositories themselves will be effectively archived at this point. The state of the “master” branch will be recorded with a tag, named “master-archive”, but the branch itself will be deleted. The default branch for the repositories will be named “archive” and it will be a single commit with a README.md and CONTRIBUTING.md file pointing to our dotnet/runtime repository.\r\n\r\nThe repositories will remain active for servicing changes to .NET Core 3.1 and earlier hence we will not be using the GitHub archive capability. \r\n\r\n### November 22nd\r\nThe dotnet/runtime repository will be made public and available for community contribution. Even though the repository will be created on November 13th it will take several days to get it back into a working order: fixing up our build scripts, recreating our Azure Dev Ops build definitions, etc … Until those tasks are completed it will not be possible to accept pull request and hence the repository will remain private. Once we are in a state that pull requests can be merged again the repository will be made public.\r\n\r\nOur expectation is that will occur on November 22nd. If it is ready sooner it will be made public sooner. If the work takes longer than we planned then we will add an update to this announcement with a new expected date.\r\n\r\n### December 1st-2nd\r\nAll issues, open and closed, will be migrated from corefx, coreclr and core-setup into dotnet/runtime. This will be using GitHub’s existing issue transfer feature in a bulk migration. This means all of the existing issue links will continue to function via redirects.\r\n\r\nThis does mean though that labels will not transfer with the issues. Labels will be re-applied as a post processing step by our engineering team once the issue migration completes.\r\n\r\nEven though our issues won’t be fully migrated until this time we’d like the community to begin filing issues on dotnet/runtime as soon as it’s public rather than continuing to file issues on the original repositories.\r\n\r\n### Migrating Commits\r\nThe dotnet/runtime repository will be a new commit history from the original repositories. We are using this consolidation as an opportunity to clean up our history with the goal of having a cleaner, smaller history as a starting point. This means commits will be rewritten in the following ways as they are migrated to dotnet/runtime:\r\n\r\n1. Author information, contributor information, changed file list and time stamps from the original commit will be preserved.\r\n1. Links to issues, pull requests or commits in the repository using GitHub short links will be rewritten so they continue to point the original repository. \r\n1. Every commit will be appended with a link to the original commit it was mapped from.\r\n\r\nThe actual contents of the commit though will be updated to match the new directory layout of the dotnet/runtime repository.","Url":"https://github.com/dotnet/announcements/issues/133","RelatedDescription":"Open issue \"Repository Consolidation Timeline\" (#133)"},{"Id":"513963125","IsPullRequest":false,"CreatedAt":"2019-10-29T14:32:55","Actor":"mthalman","Number":"132","RawContent":null,"Title":"Release of Alpine 3.10 Docker images","State":"open","Body":"# .NET Core Alpine Docker images updated to Alpine 3.10\r\n\r\nDocker images for .NET Core have been released that support Alpine 3.10.

With [.NET Standard 2.0](https://devblogs.microsoft.com/dotnet/announcing-net-standard-2-0/), we tried to make it much more viable to share code between .NET Framework, .NET Core, and Xamarin which resulted in approximately 38K .NET Frameworks APIs being available in .NET Core 2.0. We also built the [Windows Compatibility Pack](https://devblogs.microsoft.com/dotnet/announcing-the-windows-compatibility-pack-for-net-core/) which made another 21K .NET Framework APIs available to .NET Core, resulting in almost 60K additional APIs. And in .NET Core 3.0 we added WPF and WinForms, which increased the number of .NET Framework APIs ported to .NET Core to over 120k, which is more than half of all .NET Framework APIs.\r\n\r\nIt’s also worth pointing out that we added about 62K APIs to .NET Core that don’t exist in .NET Framework. If we compare their total number of APIs, .NET Core has about 80% of the API surface of .NET Framework.\r\n\r\n<p align=\"center\">\r\n<img src=\"https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/5169960/66777114-f8db7c80-ee7c-11e9-9161-acfe1c491586.png\" width=\"600\" align=\"center\">\r\n</p>\r\n\r\nWe announced that the [future of .NET](https://devblogs.microsoft.com/dotnet/net-core-is-the-future-of-net/) will be based on .NET Core. And at Build 2019, [Scott Hunter stated](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZlO1utbB2GQ&t=54m20s) that AppDomains, remoting, Web Forms, WCF server, and Windows Workflow won’t be ported to .NET Core.\r\n\r\nWith .NET Core 3.0, we’re at the point where we’ve ported all technologies that are required for modern workloads, be that desktop apps, mobile apps, console apps, web sites, or cloud services. That’s not to say that we don’t have any gaps or opportunities for new technologies, but we generally believe we won’t be finding them in the .NET Framework code base anymore. Moving forward, we’re focusing our resources on incorporating new technologies.\r\n\r\nSimultaneously, we’re looking into releasing more of the [.NET Framework code base under the MIT license](https://github.com/microsoft/referencesource) on GitHub to allow the community to create OSS projects for technologies we’re not intending to bring to .NET Core. For example, there already are community projects for [CoreWF](https://github.com/UiPath/corewf) and [CoreWCF](https://github.com/CoreWCF/CoreWCF).\r\n\r\nWe’d like to thank everyone who filed issues with requests for APIs being ported.

While this is still work in progress, we'd like to give you an update on where we are.\r\n\r\nSo far, we've identified the following repos:\r\n\r\n* dotnet/**runtime**\r\n\t- Will contain [coreclr](https://github.com/dotnet/coreclr), [corefx](https://github.com/dotnet/corefx), [core-setup](https://github.com/dotnet/core-setup), [aspnet/Extensions](https://github.com/aspnet/Extensions), and some of [mono/mono](https://github.com/mono/mono)\r\n* [dotnet/**sdk**](https://github.com/dotnet/sdk)\r\n\t- Will contain [toolset](https://github.com/dotnet/toolset), [sdk](https://github.com/dotnet/sdk), [cli](https://github.com/dotnet/cli)\r\n* dotnet/**installer**\r\n\t- Renamed from [core-sdk](https://github.com/dotnet/core-sdk)\r\n* dotnet/**aspnetcore**\r\n\t- Moved from [aspnet/AspNetCore](https://github.com/aspnet/AspNetCore) and will also contain [aspnet/AspNetCore-Tooling](https://github.com/aspnet/AspNetCore-Tooling)\r\n* dotnet/**efcore**\r\n\t- Moved from [aspnet/EntityFrameworkCore](https://github.com/aspnet/EntityFrameworkCore)\r\n* [dotnet/**winforms**](https://github.com/dotnet/winforms)\r\n\t- Unchanged, but listed for clarity \r\n* [dotnet/**wpf**](https://github.com/dotnet/wpf)\r\n\t- Unchanged, but listed for clarity\r\n\r\n### Name changes\r\n\r\nYou might notice that we changed our mind on naming from our [earlier announcement][ann]. Based on your feedback, we decided to go with **dotnet/runtime** instead of **dotnet/platform** and **dotnet/sdk** instead of **dotnet/cli**.\r\n\r\nSeveral people pointed out that the previous names weren't relatable to how we talk about the product, for example on download pages. So, we decided to match the product distributions as the primary design point for the new names. We generally refer to the bits you need to run your app as *the runtime* and the bits you need to build apps as *the SDK*. This also matches the naming chosen by other platforms.\r\n\r\n### New repos can't be used for .NET Core 3.x or earlier\r\n\r\nThe consolidated repositories are going to be about .NET 5 and going forward. It will not be possible to build .NET Core 3.1 or earlier from these repositories. As such, only the master branch from each of the repositories will be brought forward. There will be no porting of the individual release branches in the source repositories.\r\n\r\n### Personal names and email addresses\r\n\r\nSince we're planning on rebasing the history in the merged repositories, we can map your name and email address to new values as well. We primarily do this to support our friends in the LGBTQ+ community who have changed their names to reflect their identities. However, anybody is welcome to use this to change their email and name.\r\n\r\nWhatever your reason might be: we value your contributions and we hope this small gesture makes your life a little bit better. So if you changed your name/email – or simply prefer us to use different values – please [submit a request](mailto:dotnet@microsoft.com&subject=.NET%20repo%20consolidation%3A%20request%20for%20name%20change&body=Hey%2C%20%0A%0AI%E2%80%99d%20like%20to%20change%20my%20email%2Fdisplay%20name%20in%20the%20consolidated%20repo%20from%20%0A%0A%20%20%20%20%20%20%20%20My%20Old%20Name%20%3Cold.me%40example.org%3E%20%0A%0Ato%20%0A%0A%20%20%20%20%20%20%20%20My%20New%20Name%20%3Cnew.me%40example.org%3E%20%0A%0AThanks%21%20%0A).\r\n\r\n### More is coming\r\n\r\nWe'll share more updates in the upcoming months.

However, this separation has led to a variety of complications for contributors and maintainers alike.  For example:\r\n- **Confusion about where issues should be opened.**  It’s not always clear in which repo an issue should be reported, complicated by the fact that some implementations actually span repositories (e.g. a type might be exposed through a reference assembly and have its tests in corefx but actually be implemented in System.Private.CoreLib in coreclr).\r\n- **Difficulty sharing source.**  System.Private.CoreLib is intricately connected to the rest of the runtime, and thus has lived with the runtime code.  That, however, means that although corefx has been intended as the place to share as much core library code as possible across any underlying runtime, we’ve needed to keep a significant body of code in System.Private.CoreLib, which then has meant it’s needed to be “mirrored” to each runtime repo (coreclr, corert, mono) that needs to consume it as source; similarly, corefx has similarly required access to much of that source, for example to use the same interop DllImports that are employed elsewhere in the runtimes.  The automatic mirror that shares this source needs to be maintained, and even when it has been, it’s often led to lag.  It’s also complicated developer processes, where to validate a change in one repo generally requires manually mirroring the code to other local repos in order to validate the change and ensure merging into one repo won’t break the others.\r\n- **PRs spanning multiple repos.**  Because the runtime, CoreLib, and the core libraries are all intricately linked, changing runtime behaviors, adding new APIs, or changing various build processes (e.g. improving static analysis) often requires multiple PRs carefully staged across time and multiple repos.  For example, to add a new method to a type like Dictionary<>, a developer must first make the source changes in her local coreclr repo and the test and reference assembly changes in her local corefx repo.  When satisfied with the fix, the developer must submit a PR to coreclr as well as a PR to corefx, the latter of which will fail.  Eventually the coreclr PR will be merged, and the changes will mirror to the other runtimes that also require the update.  Eventually those mirror PRs will be merged, and builds will be created containing the fix for each runtime.  At some point later those builds will be consumed into the corefx repo, after which point the original corefx PR can be re-validated and eventually merged.  That’s the best case; things get more complicated in situations where there are bidirectional dependencies.\r\n- **Building an installable runtime.** Self-hosting a custom built .NET requires intricate knowledge of how all the repos work and interact.  A developer can’t just clone a single repo, make a desired change, and easily produce an installer.\r\n- **Consistency.**  One goal we had for more fine-grained repos was to enable isolation and independence for teams working within each repo’s confines, but this has led to non-trivial duplication of effort on things like build systems and CI, and then the resulting lack of consistency as each system ends up diverging from the others.\r\n\r\nThe issues go beyond the runtime.  For example, the ASP.NET maintainers and community did a great job in the past year or so consolidating from ~55 repos down to ~5 repos, but that’s still more repos than is desirable, leading to similar issues as cited above for the runtime.  On top of that, these ASP.NET repositories are in the aspnet GitHub org, which adds an additional set of issues, for example:\r\n- **Complications moving issues between repos.**  If a developer opens an issue in aspnet/aspnetcore and it’s determined that the cause of the issue is actually in dotnet/corefx, there is no GitHub mechanism to enable easily moving that issue across the aspnet to dotnet organizational boundary.\r\n- **Permissions.** Each organization’s permissions end up needing to be managed and maintained separately.\r\n\r\nThe issues extend into tooling as well.  For example, we currently have multiple repositories that all logically make up the dotnet CLI, but actually creating a working installer spans multiple repos.\r\n\r\n### Plan\r\n\r\nTo address these issues, we’re planning to make some changes to our repository structure:\r\n- **dotnet/platform.**  We plan to combine dotnet/coreclr, dotnet/corefx, dotnet/corert, dotnet/core-setup, and the relevant portions of mono/mono into a new dotnet/platform repo.  Everything needed to build and produce the Microsoft.NETCore.App shared framework will be in this repo.  We will no longer suffer from the complications of source mirroring.  Features like changing runtime behavior or adding an API will no longer require a complicated dance across multiple repos.  Etc.\r\n- **dotnet/aspnetcore.**  We plan to move the existing aspnet/aspnetcore repository into the dotnet organization.  Along with that, we aim to combine a variety of the other aspnet repositories into aspnetcore, such as aspnet/blazor.  Whether repos like entityframeworkcore remain separate or combined remains an open question.  A goal is that, just as dotnet/platform will be responsible for the creation of Microsoft.NETCore.App, dotnet/aspnetcore will be responsible for the creation of Microsoft.AspNETCore.App.\r\n- **dotnet/cli.**  We plan to combine dotnet/toolset and dotnet/sdk into the dotnet/cli repo.\r\n\r\n### FAQ\r\n\r\n#### Why are we merging repos?\r\n\r\nWe believe we can significantly improve several aspects of .NET on GitHub by combining repos, benefiting both maintainers and contributors.  These improvements will manifest in a variety of ways, such as in better issue management, much easier models of contribution, and easier and faster ways to build and install the resulting bits.\r\n\r\n####  What will happen to the aspnet org?\r\n\r\nThe aspnet org as a separate entity is legacy and artificial.  In time we hope to absorb it into the dotnet org and sunset the aspnet org.\r\n\r\n#### Will the coreclr and corefx repos go away?\r\n\r\nWith the help of GitHub, we plan to migrate all issues from these repos to the new dotnet/platform repo, and then lock down creation of additional issues, such that the repos will no longer be used for issue management.  We will also inhibit the creation of PRs to the master branch, which will effectively become an archive for read-only review of history.  In this sense, these repos will be archived, and no active development will happen with them.  However, we plan to continue servicing previous .NET Core releases out of these repos, so the various release branches (e.g. release/2.1, release/3.0, etc.) will continue to see (limited) activity.\r\n\r\n#### Will the mono repo go away?\r\n\r\nNo. mono/mono contains the source for the full mono stack and will continue to live on happily.  We will simply be moving the managed source associated with System.Private.CoreLib and copying the relatively small amount of source that makes up the native mono runtime to dotnet/platform.  We may choose to then use some mirroring technology to keep the runtime copy in sync (this will, however, not suffer from the same mirroring issues we currently experience, as we would not be mirroring between two components required to build the same binaries), or we may choose to let them diverge and manually sync only those changes deemed relevant to both implementations.\r\n\r\n#### Will the corert repo go away?\r\n\r\nYes.  We plan to retire/archive the corert repo.  Some of the technology in the corert repo will be migrated to the master branch of dotnet/platform, where it will be productized as part of .NET.  Other portions of the corert repo will be migrated to feature branches of dotnet/platform, where the experimentation can continue.  In this way, we will use feature branches to continue experimenting with the corert technology, while making it easier to share portions with its shipping counterpart and also graduate functionality into master if/when it’s ready.\r\n\r\n#### Does this mean there will be a single repo for all of .NET?\r\n\r\nNo.  We will be reducing the number of repos that contribute to .NET, but currently we do not believe that going all the way down to one is the right answer.\r\n\r\n#### Doesn’t this mean that issue and PR tracking will now be overwhelming?\r\n\r\nIt is already the case that the vast majority of issues in a given repo are not relevant to any individual developer, and with several thousand open issues in each repo and on the order of a hundred open PRs in each, we already need systems (e.g. labels) to successfully manage issues and PRs.  As such, we don’t believe the merging will have a significant impact on this aspect of developer productivity.  If it turns out to have an unexpectedly large negative impact, we will work with the community to find ways to mitigate the problem.  However, there are already a multitude of successful open source projects on GitHub with at least an order of magnitude more issues.\r\n\r\n#### What will happen to existing issues?\r\n\r\nWith the help of GitHub functionality, we plan to migrate all issues from old repos (e.g. dotnet/coreclr, dotnet/corefx) to the new repos (e.g. dotnet/platform).  We may also use this as a forcing function to revisit stale issues and either close those that are no longer relevant or reinvigorate those that are demanding of more immediate attention.\r\n\r\n#### What about git history?\r\n\r\nIn general, we plan to keep history, such that history from each constituent repo will be a part of the new repo.  However, we have made some mistakes in the past (e.g. large binaries, multitudes of automated PRs for flowing bits and source between repos, etc.), and we plan to rewrite history to correct those mistakes wherever possible and impactful.  Some rough calculations suggest this could end up significantly reducing the size of the repos as well as the time it takes to clone, which should not only help developers approaching the project but also CI.  This will end up meaning that SHAs may be different in the new repo than they were in the old repo; as previously mentioned, however, any references to the old SHAs in the old repos will continue to work, as those repos will remain accessible.\r\n\r\n#### Will I still show up in the contributor list due to previous contributions?\r\n\r\nYes.  We plan to merge all such history.\r\n\r\n#### Will this break debugging with SourceLink?\r\n\r\nNo.  The existing repos will continue to be accessible, and commit SHAs there will remain unchanged.\r\n\r\n#### Might plans change?\r\n\r\nSure.  Part of the goal of posting this announcement is to hear from you, hear about additional benefits you're excited about, and hear about additional concerns we may not have considered.  We will include such ideas in our planning and course correct as necessary.\r\n\r\n## Discussion\r\n\r\nTo discuss these plans, please comment on the corresponding issue at https://github.com/dotnet/coreclr/issues/26175.\r\n","Url":"https://github.com/dotnet/announcements/issues/119","RelatedDescription":"Open issue \"Consolidating .NET GitHub repos\" (#119)"},{"Id":"470434872","IsPullRequest":false,"CreatedAt":"2019-07-19T16:54:02","Actor":"richlander","Number":"118","RawContent":null,"Title":".NET Core master branches have switched to \"5.0\"","State":"open","Body":"# .NET Core master branches have switched to \"5.0\"\r\n\r\nVarious .NET Core repos have switched their `master` branches to \"5.0\", and will use 3.x branches for 3.0 and 3.1 projects.

Please consider that to be an open invitation!\r\n\r\nNotably, [dotnet/core-sdk](https://github.com/dotnet/core-sdk) is not yet producing 5.0 builds. We expect that the dotnet/core-sdk master branch will continue as a 3.0 branch for 2-3 months while we finish up the .NET Core 3.0 project.\r\n\r\nAt present, there is no developer experience for 5.0.

Every person who started a scenario successfully finished it.\r\n    - We feel this validates that we picked the right scope for a 60 minute study of people from various backgrounds\r\n* Overall people liked the new API\r\n    - Key value prop for most people was the fact that \"it's now built in\"\r\n    - Very few mentioned perf and the ones that did thought that it probably wouldn't make a difference in their scenarios.\r\n    - Most people said they would prefer `System.Text.Json` for new APIs, but would stick to JSON.NET in code that already uses it.\r\n    - **[Action]** None, this is in line with what we expected.\r\n* Virtually everyone tried to google for sample code in the documentation\r\n    - Everyone found our blog post and online documentation\r\n    - People new to .NET were confused that JSON.NET and `System.Text.Json` weren't the same thing\r\n    - Everyone complained that the current docs are lacking, especially sample code.\r\n    - **[Action]** Docs are work in progress. We plan on shipping with a fully documented API surface and sample code.\r\n* Virtually everyone found the key type relatively quickly\r\n    - Some people were confused when types were static, rather than something that one can new up\r\n    - **[Action]** None. This is by-design as we try to reduce the number of allocations.\r\n* Virtually everyone had trouble selecting the correct method on\r\n  `JsonSerializer`\r\n    - We chose a very complicated naming convention\r\n    - **[Action]** We simplified it by using names that people in the study told us were looking for.\r\n* Most of our error messages were well received because they told people what\r\n  the problem is & how they can fix them.\r\n    - One error message was unclear because we reported an unexpected character when we could have reported that we didn't expect a comment.\r\n    - **[Action]** We've reworded the error message.\r\n    - We had one error message that was generated by a lower layer and provided an action item that doesn't make sense when people receive it when using the higher layer component.\r\n    - **[Action]** We've reworded the error message to be more generic so it makes sense for both kind of consumers.\r\n* Virtually everyone used the new Roslyn completion feature which will also show\r\n  types from namespaces not imported yet.\r\n    - However, virtually nobody realized that they were doing it.\r\n    - This caused confusion when people found other APIs that happen to include Json in them, specifically the old data contract serialization.\r\n    - **[Action]** Talk to the Roslyn IDE team to see if this something more people will run into. This could prove to be especially problematic for technologies that share type names (e.g. `UserControl` in WinForms and WPF) and both are referenced by the project.\r\n* Optional parameters and `async`/`await` are usability cliffs\r\n    - Many were confused by optional parameters and tried to pass them in, even though they didn't have to.\r\n    - **[Action]** Talk to the Roslyn IDE team to see if we can visualize them better in VS.\r\n    - **[Action]** Try to avoid heavy use of optional parameters for mainline APIs.\r\n    - Async is a very steep cliff. People have no idea what to do in their code to make async work. While IntelliSense shows the usage by prefixing it with await, people didn't notice that.\r\n    - **[Action]** Unclear; this is a broader issue.\r\n* Virtually nobody used F1 to get help for APIs\r\n    - *Surprise*. I expected more people to use <kbd>F1</kbd>.\r\n* Virtually everyone used F12 to explore the API (\"metadata view\")\r\n    - *Surprise*. I expected most people to explore the type via the\r\n      IntelliSense completion\r\n* Nobody used Object Browser to explorer the APIs\r\n    - *Surprise*. I expected at least some people to.\r\n\r\n## Discussion\r\n\r\nFor a discussion, please go to https://github.com/dotnet/corefx/issues/39304.","Url":"https://github.com/dotnet/announcements/issues/117","RelatedDescription":"Open issue \"System.Text.Json usability study results\" (#117)"}],"ResultType":"GitHubIssue"},"Twitter":{"ResultType":"TwitterTimeline","Tweets":[{"Id":"1208378586459070464","CreatedAt":"2019-12-21T13:28:00+00:00","UserScreenname":"dotnet","Text":"Are you familiar with Expression Bodied Members in C#? \n\nIf you have a few minutes, @gotheap and @mairacw would lov… https://t.co/kjr8nkthh3","Source":"<a href=\"https://about.twitter.com/products/tweetdeck\" rel=\"nofollow\">TweetDeck</a>","RetweetCount":81,"FavoriteCount":25,"RawContent":null},{"Id":"1208132464595603457","CreatedAt":"2019-12-20T21:10:00+00:00","UserScreenname":"dotnet","Text":"Windows Server Core container images are now &gt;40% smaller.\n\nHere's what you need to know to take advantage of the i… https://t.co/uk7spzdxI6","Source":"<a href=\"https://prod2.sprinklr.com\" rel=\"nofollow\">Sprinklr Publisher</a>","RetweetCount":94,"FavoriteCount":34,"RawContent":null},{"Id":"1207763534546964490","CreatedAt":"2019-12-19T20:44:00+00:00","UserScreenname":"dotnet","Text":"#dotNETconf is coming January 14.
