As a result, we only set\r\nup query logic for containers after directives on the node were created.\r\nHowever, this assumption didn't take into account the case where a directive\r\non a template node could create views in its constructor.\r\n\r\nThis commit fixes query logic to work with views created in constructors.\r\nIn that case, we need to create a query container before the new view is\r\nrendered so query results in the view aren't lost. But since the query container\r\nis created before directives have completed processing, we also have to ensure\r\nthat query results gathered later on the template node are inserted before that\r\nquery container. Otherwise, query results in embedded views will clobber query\r\nresults on template nodes.\r\n\r\nThis splice mode may be slightly slower than the normal matching for queries on\r\ncontainers, but we should only fall back to this strategy in the edge case where\r\nviews are created in constructors. (We should encourage developers to create\r\nviews in ngOnInit instead).","Url":"https://github.com/angular/angular/pull/29983","RelatedDescription":"Open PR \"fix(ivy): ensure views created in constructors dont break queries\" (#29983)"},{"Id":"435028086","IsPullRequest":false,"CreatedAt":"2019-04-19T02:35:18","Actor":"TuanWorkMail","Number":"29982","RawContent":null,"Title":"Testing page \"Sample app\"(testing.zip) is wrong","State":"open","Body":"<!--🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅\r\n\r\nOh hi there! 😄\r\n\r\nTo expedite issue processing please search open and closed issues before submitting a new one.\r\nExisting issues often contain information about workarounds, resolution, or progress updates.\r\n\r\n🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅-->\r\n\r\n# 📚 Docs or angular.io bug report\r\n\r\n### Description\r\n\r\n<!-- ✍️edit:--> On the Testing page the link \"download example\"(Sample app) will download a file named testing.zip which is nearly identical to the file specs.testing.zip from the link \"download example\"(Tests). \r\nIt suppose to download a project without any test in it like in \"Sample app\" link but it download a complete project with all the tests instead.\r\n\r\n\r\n## 🔬 Minimal Reproduction\r\n\r\n### What's the affected URL?**\r\n<!-- ✍️edit:--> https://angular.io/guide/testing\r\n\r\n### Reproduction Steps**\r\n<!-- If applicable please list the steps to take to reproduce the issue -->\r\n<!-- ✍️edit:-->\r\nClick on both \"download example\" link and go to src\\app\\demo of both, both contain demo.spec.ts and demo.testbed.spec.ts \r\n### Expected vs Actual Behavior**\r\n<!-- If applicable please describe the difference between the expected and actual behavior after following the repro steps. -->\r\n<!-- ✍️edit:-->\r\ntesting.zip should not contain any *.spec.ts\r\n\r\n### Anything else relevant?\r\n<!-- ✍️Please provide additional info if necessary. -->\r\nIf we go to \"Sample App\" and click the download button next to PROJECT, we will get a clean project without any *.spec.ts, which is the outcome that we want from the \"download example\" link","Url":"https://github.com/angular/angular/issues/29982","RelatedDescription":"Open issue \"Testing page \"Sample app\"(testing.zip) is wrong\" (#29982)"},{"Id":"435013819","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2019-04-19T01:07:38","Actor":"AndrewKushnir","Number":"29981","RawContent":null,"Title":"fix(ivy): allow TestBed.createComponent to create components in isolation","State":"open","Body":"Prior to this change, components created via TestBed.createComponent in the same test were placed into the same root context, which caused problems in conjunction with fixture.autoDetectChanges usage in the same test.

Running `npm run build:ssr && npm run serve:ssr` directly after the previous command results in it building the workspace project instead of `projects/foo` which was specified as the `--clientProject`.\r\n\r\nI changed the following line:\r\n\r\n```\r\n\"build:client-and-server-bundles\": \"ng build --prod && ng run foo:server:production\"\r\n```\r\n\r\nTo:\r\n\r\n```\r\n\"build:client-and-server-bundles\": \"ng build foo --prod && ng run foo:server:production\"\r\n```\r\n\r\nAnd it builds the correct project, **this should be default behaviour shouldn't it?**\r\n\r\n2. In the `foo` project I'm importing things from `shared`, but these imports doesn't work when I run `npm run build:ssr && npm run serve:ssr`. All I get is:\r\n\r\n```\r\nprojects/foo/src/app/app.component.ts(3,34): error TS2307: Cannot find module 'shared'.\r\n```\r\n\r\nThis is strange to me since the library works great when just serving the `foo` project normally.\r\n\r\n## 🔬 Minimal Reproduction\r\n\r\nRepo found here: https://github.com/chrillewoodz/universal-library-repro\r\n\r\n```\r\n$ ng new workspace\r\n$ cd workspace\r\n$ ng

`projects/foo/src/app/app.component.ts`.\r\n\r\nChange `package.json` line 14 to:\r\n\r\n`\"build:client-and-server-bundles\": \"ng build foo --prod && ng run foo:server:production\"`\r\n\r\nRun `npm

workspace.json","State":"open","Body":"# Rename angular.json to workspace.json\r\n\r\n## Description\r\n\r\nThe Angular CLI/ Angular Devkit is a generic tool which is extensible to do almost anything. Having the workspace information stored in `angular.json` is a misnomer as it is possible to have non-Angular projects and builders defined there. \r\n\r\n## Describe the solution you'd like\r\n\r\nWith the new Workspace API, storage of the workspace configuration is abstracted. It would be great to support a more agnostic config file such as `workspace.json` or `projects.json`. \r\n\r\nCurrently, folks can already build node apps or web-components apps in an Angular CLI workspace, but the naming of the configuration file deters folks from doing it.\r\n\r\nOne of the best things about the Angular community is how well we collaborate with other communities. Having the CLI to be more generic and used in those communities will reinforce this.\r\n\r\nThe `angular.json` file could be supported for backward compatibility. This would improve the experience for doing things outside of Angular within a workspace.\r\n\r\n## Describe alternatives you've considered\r\n\r\nAn alternative could be creating a separate CLI altogether such as the NestJS CLI but it would be great to have 1 agnostic CLI since the Angular CLI is capable of doing both.","Url":"https://github.com/angular/angular-cli/issues/14204","RelatedDescription":"Open issue \"feat: Rename angular.json to workspace.json\" (#14204)"},{"Id":"434154672","IsPullRequest":false,"CreatedAt":"2019-04-17T08:25:34","Actor":"DmitriyIvanko","Number":"14200","RawContent":null,"Title":"Simple bug: Can't resolve '\\app-test\\src\\styles.sass' in '\\app-test'","State":"open","Body":"<!--🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅\r\n\r\nOh hi there! 😄\r\n\r\nTo expedite issue processing please search open and closed issues before submitting a new one.\r\nExisting issues often contain information about workarounds, resolution, or progress updates.\r\n\r\n🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅-->\r\n\r\n\r\n# 🐞 Bug report\r\n\r\n### Command (mark with an `x`)\r\n<!-- Can you pin-point the command or commands that are effected by this bug? -->\r\n<!-- ✍️edit: -->\r\n```\r\n- [ x ] new\r\n```\r\n\r\n### Description\r\n\r\n<!-- ✍️--> \r\nWhen creating a new project, select the option \"Sass [http://sass-lang.com]\".
