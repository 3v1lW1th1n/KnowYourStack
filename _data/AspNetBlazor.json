Maybe it comes from Mono making `System.Net.WebSockets` available, a separate package/api using JavaScript interop or a new API for Blazor.\r\n\r\nIs there any projection on this already?","Url":"https://github.com/aspnet/Blazor/issues/1135","RelatedDescription":"Closed issue \"WebSockets support\" (#1135)"},{"Id":"341248672","IsPullRequest":false,"CreatedAt":"2018-07-14T16:34:49","Actor":"Lupusa87","Number":"1134","RawContent":null,"Title":"Improve js interop with dynamic content execution","State":"open","Body":"My experimental [project](http://lupusablazordemos.azurewebsites.net/) is working **very slow** right now.\r\n\r\nSo I think about optimization strategies and hope will achieve better performance. This strategies are different but I think this one is interesting not only for my project.\r\n\r\nI am using **canvas** and manipulating it via js interop, it means I do heavy operations with interop, many calls, passing parameters, maintain large code etc.\r\n\r\nLet's imagine I have **30 js registered function** (draw line, rect, arc etc) and mixing them (as will be required from projects logic) and let's say I **100 times** call, pass parameters, receive results from/to js. And it is repeating on every redraw (one second or less interval for smooth clock)!\r\n\r\nThis 30 js functions are like underlying level to access html5 canvas, it can be also referenced nuget package.\r\n\r\nAll this actions: call, passing params, return results have **time cost** and **probably is one reason for slow performance**.\r\n\r\nSo this question popups logically - can we reduce calls amount? For example collect all js functions and **call one time all this commands**.\r\n\r\nI think it is possible, because js allows us (with many ways) to **evalute code** (execute string containing js script).\r\n\r\nSo I can use string builder, collect all necessary js logic and call it one time. Please note that in most case **I don't need results from js**, if I need only to pass in another js function.\r\n\r\nAs I mentioned there is **many ways** to execute dynamic js scripts, first option is **evil()** function but I don't want now to go in details with way is better.\r\nI did **small research** and there can be found optimal way to do this (technique not matters for now).\r\nThere are security, debuging, preformance issues but let's forget about them for now.\r\n\r\nI try to **model theoretical structure** to improve js interop, it to become more dynamic and interoperable. Because as it seems we can't escape from js for next months/years and we need to find ways to use it in efficient way.\r\n\r\nWe can make parallel to **sql queries**, where we can build any query and then server will execute it.\r\n\r\nOk, I think it sounds good, less js functions, less calls, more flexibility and custom approach.\r\nNo one denies me to do it myself, maybe not perfectly but to try :)\r\n\r\n**Why I open this issue?**\r\n First I want to hear what people think about this;\r\n Second I think this improvement  (if it has sense) not should do all developers separately, we can say that someone will implement it and share as nuget package, but I think it's better to do blazor itself because we expect **more competentive people** in blazor team, **built-in feature** will be better and community always can contribute any improvement.\r\n\r\nI will be happy if you think about this and measure does it have perspective or not, is this no sense or **real way for some improvement**.\r\n\r\nHope text is understandable, for now it is **only theoretical** but if there will be interes or I will do it myself I will share my code and results about performance.\r\n\r\nThank you, **waiting for your activity** :)\r\n\r\nI know there are many open issues and many things to think and to do, but IMHO this issue can be useful too.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n","Url":"https://github.com/aspnet/Blazor/issues/1134","RelatedDescription":"Open issue \"Improve js interop with dynamic content execution\" (#1134)"},{"Id":"341244787","IsPullRequest":false,"CreatedAt":"2018-07-14T15:37:33","Actor":"Lupusa87","Number":"1133","RawContent":null,"Title":"How To Force The Browser To Reload Cached Files","State":"open","Body":"I published updated [project](http://lupusablazordemos.azurewebsites.net) to azure.\r\nWhen I navigate to site Chrome was showing old version, Firefox got error.

I talk with that person on FB and chat with him if his demo is published under Debug.\r\n\r\nWe both realize the code is compiled under Release and later on I open the dll and able to see the path of his developer machine. \r\n\r\nI think the path can be either relative but not absolute or should not expose the machine path of developer in first place, This could be a lead to some hack.\r\n\r\nI was thinking for another scenario last week, If someone made a blazor app and user use it, user can easily figure out some endpoint which never should be exposed in first place.\r\n\r\nFor example Facebook.com have a secret admin panel at admin.facebook.com user will never know the ajax endpoint since they are not seeing anything without login, in Blazor I can figure out what kind of html admin.faceook.com have ( I am saying that admin.facebook.com is part of same app or I should better say facebook.com/admin) and what ajax endpoint they might have. Is this not a security issues.\r\n\r\nI am not a security expert but this thing make me worried (I am really new to WASM). Is this thing can lead to some trouble, for a common person who didn't prepare himself for DDOS, exposing ajax endpoint could cause a lot of trouble.\r\n\r\nFrom this thread 2 thing need to be checked.\r\n\r\n1.
