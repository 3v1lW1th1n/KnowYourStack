Given this broke your build, I expect you were getting your VS SDK reference assemblies from the VS installation instead of nuget. May I take this time to suggest that you revise your build authoring to acquire all your VS SDK dependencies from nuget instead to make yourself more resilient to changes on the build agent and ensure build reproducibility?\r\n```"},{"Id":"8074458494","Type":"IssuesEvent","CreatedAt":"2018-08-06T23:25:39","Actor":"nkolev92","Repository":"NuGet/Home","Organization":"NuGet","RawContent":null,"RelatedAction":"closed","RelatedUrl":"https://github.com/NuGet/Home/issues/6662","RelatedDescription":"Closed issue \"Multi-targeted project fails to restore with a conditional NoWarn property group\" (#6662) at NuGet/Home","RelatedBody":"Using VS2017 15.6.0, and [the attached solution](https://github.com/NuGet/Home/files/1801280/20180311-nuget-nowarn-restore-failure.zip):\r\n\r\n- Run git clean -fdx on the zipped repo (no restored graph must be present)\r\n- Open VS2017 for the solution\r\n- Notice the background restore does not start\r\n- Try building, the error `Error occurred while restoring NuGet packages: The operation failed as details for project RestoreFailure could not be loaded.` appears at the beginning.\r\n\r\nCommenting out this:\r\n```xml\r\n<PropertyGroup Condition=\" '$(TargetFramework)' == 'net46'\">\r\n  <NoWarn>$(NoWarn);68</NoWarn>\r\n</PropertyGroup>\r\n```\r\nor removing the condition makes the restore work properly.\r\n\r\nAlso note that the CLI restore does not have any issue restoring this project."}],"ResultType":"GitHubEvent"},"Announcements":{"Events":[{"Id":"8059595751","Type":"IssuesEvent","CreatedAt":"2018-08-02T22:42:29","Actor":"anangaur","Repository":"NuGet/Announcements","Organization":"NuGet","RawContent":null,"RelatedAction":"opened","RelatedUrl":"https://github.com/NuGet/Announcements/issues/30","RelatedDescription":"Opened issue \"Show source repository information for packages on nuget.org\" (#30) at NuGet/Announcements","RelatedBody":"The spec to **Show source repository information for packages on nuget.org** , is ready for **review**:\r\n\r\n|Spec wiki|Discussion issue|\r\n|:----------|:------------------|\r\n|[Show source repository information for packages on nuget.org](https://github.com/NuGet/Home/wiki/Show-source-repository-information-for-packages-on-nuget.org) | https://github.com/NuGet/NuGetGallery/issues/4941 |\r\n\r\n**Note**: This is a short term feature to just light up the repository information on nuget.org using the `<repository>`  metadata in the nuspec.
