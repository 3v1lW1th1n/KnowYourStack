If the downstream user still uses a lower TypeScript version, normal Bazel targets using the `ng_module` rule are still compiled with the expected TypeScript version (assuming they set the `node_modules` attribute properly).\r\n\r\nBut, if they build the previous Bazel targets by specifying them within a `ng_package` rule, the TypeScript version from the Angular `workspace` is being used for the replayed ESM5 compilation. \r\n\r\n**Why is this?** \r\n\r\nThis is because we resolve the replay compiler to `ngc_wrapped` or `tsc_wrapped` Bazel executables which are defined as part of the `angular` workspace. This means that the compilers are different if the downstream user uses `ngc-wrapped` from the `@npm` repository because the replayed compilation would use the compiler with `@ngdeps//typescript`.\r\n\r\n**How can we fix it**\r\n\r\nIn order to fix this, we should just use the compiler that is defined in the `@angular//BUILD.bazel` file. This target by defaults to the \"@npm\" workspace which is working for downstream users. This is similar to how it is handled for `tsc-wrapped`. `tsc-wrapped` works as expected for downstream users.\r\n\r\n**Future things to explore**\r\nNote that in general the way we use the \"replay_compiler\" is not perfect because ideally we would completely respect the `compiler` option from the base `ng_module`, but this is not possible in a hermetic way, unless we somehow accept the `compiler` as an attribute that builds all transitive deps. This is something we should explore in the future. For now, we just fix this in a reasonable way that is also used for `tsc_wrapped` from the TypeScript rules (as mentioned above)","Url":"https://github.com/angular/angular/pull/28053","RelatedDescription":"Open PR \"fix(bazel): replay compilation uses wrong compiler for building esm5\" (#28053)"},{"Id":"397923467","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2019-01-10T21:38:59","Actor":"kara","Number":"28048","RawContent":null,"Title":"fix(ivy): markForCheck should not schedule a tick","State":"closed","Body":"WIP: Not ready for review\r\n\r\nPreviously, we had the logic to schedule a change detection tick\r\ninside markViewDirty().

Be unable to know that the asset outside of budget range as the \"any\" budget type will catch the bundle. \r\n\r\n\r\n### The log given by the failure\r\nN/A\r\n\r\n### Desired functionality\r\nI would like to set a budget **specifically** for image assets in my `ng build`. Ideally, I can configure this per image type (as each image type has different compressability.\r\n\r\ne.g\r\n```\r\n{\r\n  ...\r\n  \"configurations\": {\r\n    \"production\": {\r\n      ...\r\n      budgets: [\r\n         {\"type\": \"asset:jpg\", \"maximumWarning\": \"150kb\", \"maximumError\": \"300kb\"},\r\n         {\"type\": \"asset:svg\", \"maximumWarning\": \"15kb\", \"maximumError\": \"30kb\"},\r\n         {\"type\": \"asset:png\", \"maximumWarning\": \"150kb\", \"maximumError\": \"300kb\"},\r\n       ]\r\n    }\r\n  }\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nThe use case here is automation around enforcing filesize requirements for assets to prevent absurd image sizes from being included. While `\"type\": \"any\"` meets this requirement, there are niches of asset types that should have stricter requirements (e.g. `svg`).\r\n\r\n### Mention any other details that might be useful\r\nI'm trying to create budgets for the assets we use on the `Daffodil` project: \r\nhttps://github.com/graycoreio/daffodil\r\n\r\nSpecifically, the PR in question:\r\nhttps://github.com/graycoreio/daffodil/pull/171\r\n","Url":"https://github.com/angular/angular-cli/issues/13393","RelatedDescription":"Open issue \"Proposal: Asset Budgets potentially w/ subtypes\" (#13393)"},{"Id":"397555676","IsPullRequest":false,"CreatedAt":"2019-01-09T20:47:09","Actor":"Jun711","Number":"13392","RawContent":null,"Title":"ng generate universal (after adding pwa) update main.ts incorrectly causing syntax error","State":"open","Body":"<!--\r\nIF YOU DON'T FILL OUT THE FOLLOWING INFORMATION YOUR ISSUE MIGHT BE CLOSED WITHOUT INVESTIGATING\r\n-->\r\n### Bug Report or Feature Request (mark with an `x`)\r\n```\r\n- [x] bug report -> please search issues before submitting\r\n- [ ] feature request\r\n```\r\n\r\n### Command (mark with an `x`)\r\n```\r\n- [ ] new\r\n- [ ] build\r\n- [ ] serve\r\n- [ ] test\r\n- [ ] e2e\r\n- [x] generate\r\n- [ ] add\r\n- [ ] update\r\n- [ ] lint\r\n- [ ] xi18n\r\n- [ ] run\r\n- [ ] config\r\n- [ ] help\r\n- [ ] version\r\n- [ ] doc\r\n```\r\n\r\n### Versions\r\n<!--\r\nOutput from: `node --version`, `npm --version` and `ng --version`.\r\n  Windows (7/8/10).

Note the comment, it should never be imported.\r\n\r\nBy doing this I can keep imports in my routes simple:\r\n```\r\n{\r\n  path: 'lazy',\r\n  loadChildren: 'lazy-component#LazyComponentModule',\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\n### Mention any other details that might be useful\r\nI am very sorry for intentional duplicate, but as I said, I would like to bring the new workaround to your attention, since it feels like the real solution is not far.\r\n\r\nDuplicate of #6373","Url":"https://github.com/angular/angular-cli/issues/13386","RelatedDescription":"Closed issue \"Lazy load libraries with router - bring new workaround to the attention\" (#13386)"},{"Id":"397244053","IsPullRequest":false,"CreatedAt":"2019-01-09T10:11:02","Actor":"c00","Number":"13385","RawContent":null,"Title":"Wiki: stories universal rendering: Cannot find name 'AppServerModuleNgFactory' not 'LAZY_MODULE_MAP'","State":"closed","Body":"<!--\r\nIF YOU DON'T FILL OUT THE FOLLOWING INFORMATION YOUR ISSUE MIGHT BE CLOSED WITHOUT INVESTIGATING\r\n-->\r\n### Bug Report or Feature Request (mark with an `x`)\r\n```\r\n- [x ] bug report -> please search issues before submitting\r\n- [ ] feature request\r\n```\r\n\r\n### Versions\r\n<!--\r\nOutput from: `node --version`, `npm --version` and `ng --version`.\r\n  Windows (7/8/10).

So my stackblitz simulates this with having option1 as a variable in OnInit I put a setTimeout for 2 seconds to change the string and there error comes up.\r\n\r\nI guess I am wondering if this is truly a bug or if I need to do something different to not allow this to happen. I did get this to work by manually calling a change detection after the localize variable we have gets populated (and take the pipe out of the equation) but this is a workaround to the problem I feel like.\r\n\r\nAny thoughts?\r\n","Url":"https://github.com/angular/material2/issues/14793","RelatedDescription":"Open issue \"Dynamic change in label of mat-option gives ExpressionChangedAfterItHasBeenCheckedError\" (#14793)"},{"Id":"398064051","IsPullRequest":false,"CreatedAt":"2019-01-10T23:36:42","Actor":"jelbourn","Number":"14792","RawContent":null,"Title":"MatFormField documentation should prefer outline/fill style","State":"open","Body":"In the most recent Material Design update, the \"standard\" / \"legacy\" style is now omitted from the spec with only the outline and fill styles remaining.

I'd see several possible ways of doing this, for example:\r\n1. using the `MatDialogRef` and a to be created method (e.g. `setDefaultResult(...)`) to be able to set this value comfortably from within the dialog.\r\n2. using the MatDialogConfig to be able to set the value from the code opening the dialog\r\n\r\n#### What is the use-case or motivation for this proposal?\r\nWe have some generic dialogs which also provide a \"cancel\" button that returns specific data. Currently everywhere the dialog is opened, we need to make a check whether the result is undefined or not. Providing a default value for those cases would definitely be better.\r\n","Url":"https://github.com/angular/material2/issues/14780","RelatedDescription":"Open issue \"(dialog) feature request: default result value for closing with esc or via backdrop click\" (#14780)"},{"Id":"397715419","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2019-01-10T08:11:48","Actor":"crisbeto","Number":"14778","RawContent":null,"Title":"fix(tabs): better handling of animationDuration without units","State":"open","Body":"Based off of the discussions on #13428.
