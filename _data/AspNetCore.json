Consider a basic kestrel web server, exposing http and https endpoints, within a SF node.\r\n\r\nWe'd like to add support for using a generic host within Service Fabric ASP.NET Core 3.0 apps. The advantages of using a generic host are:\r\n* Use a single configuration instance, DI container, and web pipeline across multiple SF endpoints (eg 1 endpoint for http, 1 endpoint for https, perhaps another for gRPC) in a host\r\n* WebHostBuilder is deprecated, so we want to avoid investing in that if possible\r\n\r\nThe current ASP.NET Core hosting model within SF is mostly dictated by this project:\r\nhttps://github.com/microsoft/service-fabric-aspnetcore\r\nWhich is documented here:\r\nhttps://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/service-fabric/service-fabric-reliable-services-communication-aspnetcore\r\n\r\nIf you follow the documentation literally (see https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/service-fabric/service-fabric-reliable-services-communication-aspnetcore#kestrel-in-reliable-services), you end up with separate kestrel pipelines, DI containers, etc per endpoint. It's possible to work around this, but it's not trivial and many developers struggle with it, per Stack Overflow.\r\n\r\nIn order to implement a better, generic host-based hosting model for Service Fabric, it would be great to be able to re-use much of `GenericWebHostBuilder` and `GenericWebHostService` without copying + maintaining all the classes. Also note that `ISupportsStartup` and `ISupportsUseDefaultServiceProvider` are internal, so they can't be implemented. \r\n\r\n### Describe the solution you'd like\r\nI'd like to see a separation + make public of the portions of GenericHost that should be re-used in scenarios like this.\r\n\r\nIf it's helpful I can provide an implementation of a ServiceFabric host builder, with details on what the sticking points are.","Url":"https://github.com/aspnet/AspNetCore/issues/11884","RelatedDescription":"Open issue \"Support re-using GenericWebHostBuilder and GenericWebHostService\" (#11884)"},{"Id":"464015171","IsPullRequest":false,"CreatedAt":"2019-07-04T01:18:00","Actor":"danroth27","Number":"11883","RawContent":null,"Title":"Layout generated by Identity scaffolder conflicts with the layout in Blazor Server Apps","State":"open","Body":"The Identity scaffolder generates a layout if it doesn't detect one in the project.

(The secondary errors are also repeated for every place the ViewComponent is used in code, which can be overwhelming.)\r\n\r\nA solution would seem to be to compile the generated property with the @ glyph just like a user would when making their own class and as they had to do to pass the parameter into Invoke/InvokeAsync in the first place. This should probably just be done always (I'm surprised it isn't the default behavior for generated code) just to be safe and forward compatibility.\r\n\r\nIf the @ glyph can't be used for some reason, one or more _ characters would also work and then could be translated between the generated class and the Razor code, similar to the PascalCase/CamelCase -> kebob-case translation that is

So i am going to put it here in hopes of getting an answer.\r\n\r\nThe issue is the understanding of how remember me is supposed to work.    My problem is that its not doing what we would expect it to do.   \r\n\r\nManagement expects when a user logs in and clicks remember me that they will then not be required to type their login and password again for a month.  Whether or not they will still have to type in the 2fa code is up for debate.\r\n\r\nWhat is actually happening is that i can close the browser reboot and come back for about an hour and 15 minutes and then i will be forced to type my password again.

VS 2019 is about to be released in around early 2019\r\n2. ASP.NET Core 1.0/1.1 is not going to be supported anymore, based on [this page](https://github.com/dotnet/core/blob/master/microsoft-support.md).\r\n3. Creating new ASP.NET Core 1.0/1.1 will always install the .NET Core 1.0/1.1 web tooling, and this is not necessary when previous reason has reached the unsupported period and it's quite near or might be the same time of VS 2019 release.\r\n4. Based on the problem mentioned above, VS 2017 has no \"built in\" tooling when creating new ASP.NET Core 1.0/1.1 project, but the external tooling may help. Therefore for those that still need to maintain ASP.NET Core 1.0/1.1 projects, we could use VS 2017 as long as the VS 2017 is still in support lifecycle or in mainstream support lifecycle.\r\n\r\nI

For example, if Contoso publishes a package `Contoso.Utility` which, in turn, depends on `Contoso.Internals` and you add the `Contoso.Utility` package to your project now your project has a direct dependency on `Contoso.Utility` and, because `Contoso.Utility` depends 'Contoso.Internals', your application gains a transitive dependency on the `Contoso.Internals` package.\r\n\r\nTransitive dependencies are reviewable in two ways:\r\n\r\n* In the Visual Studio Solution Explorer window, which supports searching.\r\n* By examining the `project.assets.json` file contained in the obj directory of your project for `csproj` based projects\r\n\r\nThe `project.assets.json` files are the authoritative list of all packages used by your project, containing both direct and transitive dependencies.\r\n\r\nThere are two ways to view transitive dependencies. You can either [use Visual Studio’s Solution Explorer](#vs-solution-explorer), or you can review [the `project.assets.json` file](#project-assets-json)).\r\n\r\n##### <a name=\"vs-solution-explorer\"></a>Using Visual Studio Solution Explorer\r\n\r\nTo use Solution Explorer, open the project in Visual Studio, and then press Ctrl+; to activate the search in Solution Explorer. Search for the [vulnerable package](#affected-software) and make a note of the version numbers of any results you find.\r\n\r\nFor example, searching for `Microsoft.AspNetCore.Mvc.Core` in an example project that contains a package that takes a dependency on `Microsoft.AspNetCore.Mvc` shows the following results in Visual Studio 2017:\r\n\r\n![Screenshot of search results in Visual Studio 2017](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/796298/25858816/8ecdc2b4-3491-11e7-9363-746804bb9832.png)\r\n\r\nThe search results appear as a tree. In the previous results, you can see that a reference to `Microsoft.AspNetCore.Mvc.Core` version 1.1.2 is discovered.\r\n\r\nUnder the Dependencies node is a NuGet node. Under the NuGet node is the list of packages you have directly taken a dependency on and their versions.\r\nIn screenshot, the application takes a direct dependency on `Microsoft.AspNetCore.Mvc`. `Microsoft.AspNetCore.Mvc` in turn has leaf nodes that list its dependencies and their versions.\r\nThe `Microsoft.AspNetCore.Mvc` package takes a dependency on a version of `Microsoft.AspNetCore.Mvc.ApiExplorer`, that in turn takes a dependency on a version of `Microsoft.AspNetCore.Mvc.Core`.\r\n\r\n##### <a name=\"project-assets-json\"></a> Manually reviewing project.assets.json\r\n\r\nOpen the *project.assets.json* file from your project’s obj directory in your editor. We suggest you use an editor that understands JSON and allows you to collapse and expand nodes to review this file.\r\nVisual Studio and Visual Studio Code provide JSON friendly editing.\r\n\r\nSearch the *project.assets.json* file for the [vulnerable package](#affected-software), using the format `packagename/` for each of the package names from the preceding table. If you find the assembly name in your search:\r\n\r\n* Examine the line on which they are found, the version number is after the `/`.\r\n* Compare to the [vulnerable versions table](#affected-software).\r\n\r\nFor example, a search result that shows `System.IO.Pipelines/4.5.0` is a reference to version 4.5.0 of `System.IO.Pipelines`.\r\n\r\nIf your *project.assets.json* file includes references to the [vulnerable package](#affected-software), then you need to fix the transitive dependencies.\r\n\r\nIf you have not found any reference to any vulnerable packages, this means either\r\n\r\n* None of your direct dependencies depend on any vulnerable packages, or\r\n* You have already fixed the problem by updating the direct dependencies.\r\n\r\n### <a name=\"how-fix\"></a>How do I fix the issue?\r\n\r\n#### <a name=\"fixing-direct-dependencies\"></a>Fixing direct dependencies\r\n\r\nOpen *projectname.csproj* in your editor. If you're using Visual Studio, right-click the project and choose **Edit projectname.csproj** from the context menu, where projectname is the name of your project. Look for `PackageReference` elements. The following shows an example project file:\r\n\r\n```xml\r\n<Project Sdk=\"Microsoft.NET.Sdk.Web\">\r\n  <PropertyGroup>\r\n    <TargetFramework>netcoreapp2.1</TargetFramework>\r\n  </PropertyGroup>\r\n  <ItemGroup>\r\n    <PackageReference Include=\"Microsoft.AspNetCore.SignalR.Protocols.MessagePack\" Version=\"1.0.0\" />\r\n  </ItemGroup>\r\n</Project>\r\n```\r\n\r\nThe preceding example has a reference to the [vulnerable package](#affected-software), as seen by the single `PackageReference` element. The name of the package is in the `Include` attribute.\r\nThe package version number is in the `Version` attribute. The previous example shows a single direct dependency on `System.IO.Pipelines` version 4.5.0\r\n\r\nTo update the version to the secure package, change the version number to the updated package version as listed on the table [previously](#affected-software).\r\nIn this example, update `System.IO.Pipelines` to the appropriate [fixed package number](#affected-software) for your major version. Save the *csproj* file. The example *csproj* now looks as follows:\r\n\r\n```xml\r\n<Project Sdk=\"Microsoft.NET.Sdk.Web\">\r\n  <PropertyGroup>\r\n    <TargetFramework>netcoreapp2.1</TargetFramework>\r\n  </PropertyGroup>\r\n  <ItemGroup>\r\n    <PackageReference Include=\"Microsoft.AspNetCore.SignalR.Protocols.MessagePack\" Version=\"1.0.11\" />\r\n  </ItemGroup>\r\n</Project>\r\n```\r\n\r\nIf you're using Visual Studio and you save your updated *csproj* file, Visual Studio will restore the new package version.\r\nYou can see the restore results by opening the **Output** window (Ctrl+Alt+O) and changing the **Show output from** drop-down list to **Package Manager**.\r\n\r\nIf you're not using Visual Studio, open a command line and change to your project directory. Execute the `dotnet restore` command to restore the updated dependencies.\r\n\r\nNow recompile your application. If after recompilation you see a *Dependency conflict warning*, you must update your other direct dependencies to versions that take a dependency on the updated package.\r\n\r\n#### <a name=\"transitive-dependencies\"></a>Fixing transitive dependencies\r\n\r\nIf your transitive dependency review found references to the [vulnerable package](#affected-software), you must add a direct dependency to the updated package to your *csproj* file to override the transitive dependency.\r\n\r\nOpen *projectname.csproj* in your editor. If you're using Visual Studio, right-click the project and choose **Edit projectname.csproj** from the context menu, where projectname is the name of your project.\r\nLook for `PackageReference` nodes, for example:\r\n\r\n```xml\r\n<Project Sdk=\"Microsoft.NET.Sdk.\">\r\n  <PropertyGroup>\r\n    <TargetFramework>net461</TargetFramework>\r\n  </PropertyGroup>\r\n  <ItemGroup>\r\n    <PackageReference Include=\"ThirdParty.NotUpdatedYet\" Version=\"2.0.0\" />\r\n  </ItemGroup>\r\n</Project>\r\n```\r\n\r\nYou must add a direct dependency to the updated version of the [vulnerable package](#affected-software) by adding it to the *csproj* file.\r\nYou do this by adding a new line to the dependencies section, referencing the fixed version.\r\nFor example, if your search showed a transitive reference to a vulnerable `System.ServiceModel.Http` version, you'd add a reference to the [fixed package number](#affected-software).\r\n\r\n```xml\r\n<Project Sdk=\"Microsoft.NET.Sdk.Web\">\r\n  <PropertyGroup>\r\n    <TargetFramework>net461</TargetFramework>\r\n  </PropertyGroup>\r\n  <ItemGroup>\r\n    <PackageReference Include=\"Microsoft.AspNetCore.SignalR.Protocols.MessagePack\" Version=\"1.0.11\" />\r\n    <PackageReference Include=\"ThirdParty.NotUpdatedYet\" Version=\"2.0.0\" />\r\n  </ItemGroup>\r\n</Project>\r\n```\r\n\r\nAfter you've added the direct dependency reference, save your *csproj* file.\r\n\r\nIf you're using Visual Studio, save your updated *csproj* file and Visual Studio will restore the new package versions.\r\nYou can see the restore results by opening the **Output** window (Ctrl+Alt+O) and changing the **Show output from** drop-down list to **Package Manager**.\r\n\r\nIf you're not using Visual Studio, open a command line and change to your project directory. Execute the `dotnet restore` command to restore the new dependencies.\r\n\r\n##### Rebuilding your application\r\n\r\nFinally, you must rebuild your application, test, and redeploy.\r\n\r\n## Other Information\r\n\r\n### Reporting Security Issues\r\n\r\nIf you have found a potential security issue in .NET Core, please email details to secure@microsoft.com.

This behavior can be disabled by setting `MvcOptions.SuppressAsyncSuffixInActionNames` to `false` as part of the application startup:\r\n\r\n```C#\r\nservices.AddMvc(options =>\r\n{\r\n   options.SuppressAsyncSuffixInActionNames = false; \r\n});\r\n```\r\n","Url":"https://github.com/aspnet/Announcements/issues/351","RelatedDescription":"Open issue \"Async suffix for controller action names will be trimmed by default\" (#351)"},{"Id":"426009751","IsPullRequest":false,"CreatedAt":"2019-03-27T14:57:05","Actor":"scottaddie","Number":"350","RawContent":null,"Title":"For contributors: moved ASP.NET 4.x docs to new GitHub repo","State":"open","Body":"In an effort to reduce the GitHub repo size and to reduce docset build times, the [ASP.NET 4.x product documentation](https://docs.microsoft.com/aspnet/overview) has migrated from the [aspnet/Docs repo](https://github.com/aspnet/Docs) to the [aspnet/AspNetDocs repo](https://github.com/aspnet/AspNetDocs).\r\n\r\nTo continue making contributions to ASP.NET 4.x documentation, create a local clone of the aspnet/AspNetDocs repo.
