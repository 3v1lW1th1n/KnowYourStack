I'm the author of the OverlayScrollbars Library.\r\nThe library is written in vanilla Javascript and I'm currently providing a Vue wrapper Component for it.\r\nI ran into a issue with the class attribute recently and I need some guidance of someone who has better understanding of the overall structure of Vue.\r\n\r\nThe setup (minimal example):\r\nIn Vue I'm rendering a div:\r\n<div class=\"my-host\"></div>\r\n\r\nThen I'm initializing the library in the mounted hook\r\n```js\r\nmounted() {\r\n    myLibrary(this.$el);\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nThe library is adding internally classes to the already rendered div, so the virtual node still looks like this:\r\n```html\r\n<div class=\"my-host\"></div>\r\n```\r\nBut the real DOM element might look like this:\r\n```html\r\n<div class=\"my-host my-host-option-a my-host-option-b xyz\"></div>\r\n```\r\n\r\nThis leads to no problems, as long as the class attribute is set only once / is static, but as soon as you change it from the outside, vue overwrites the class names set by the library internally, because vue has no clue about it.\r\n\r\nMy question is now, how can I access the class string inside the virtual DOM node? I've written a method which is able to merge all class names correctly, but in order to do that, I need access to the class names which were set by vue. (e.g. which are inside the virtual DOM)\r\n\r\nAre there some best practices to do that? - Or is there a different way to handle my problem?

Also there is optional `onComplete` callback for `router.push`, but there is no way to set it from `<router-link>`.\r\nNavigation with error (because of JS error in one of the guards or hooks) can be catched in global `onError` hook. Also there is optional `onAbort` callback for `router.push` (which will be called for both navigation with error and aborted navigation), but there is no way to set it from `<router-link>`.\r\nWhen it comes to aborted navigations, the only place where it can be catched – `onAbort` callback for `router.push`. However, as mentioned before, it is not possible to set it from `<router-link>`. Moreover, there is no global hook to catch aborted navigations at all.\r\n\r\n### Use case\r\n\r\nIn our application we would like to simply display loading indicator in the root App component while navigation is in progress. Also, we would like to have this functionality be generic, so it can be applied to different applications. The easiest way to achieve it is by creating separate ES module like this `navigation-state-plugin.js`:\r\n``` js\r\nimport Vue from 'vue';\r\n\r\nexport const state = Vue.observable({ navigating: false });\r\n\r\nexport default router => {\r\n  // When navigation initiated – update state and proceed\r\n  router.beforeEach((to, from, next) {\r\n    state.navigating = true;\r\n    next();\r\n  });\r\n\r\n  // When navigation successfully finished – update state accordingly\r\n  router.afterEach(() => {\r\n    state.navigating = false;\r\n  });\r\n\r\n  // When navigation failed –also update state\r\n  router.onError(error => {\r\n    state.navigating = false;\r\n  });\r\n};\r\n```\r\n\r\nIn this way in can be applied in the `main.js`:\r\n```js\r\nimport VueRouter from 'vue-router';\r\nimport applyPlugin from './navigation-state-plugin.js`;\r\n\r\n// do other initializations\r\n\r\nconst router = new VueRouter(...);\r\napplyPlugin(router);\r\n\r\n// init application\r\n```\r\n\r\nAlso state from this file can be imported in App.vue and used to display loading indicator when `state.navigating` is `true`.\r\n\r\nHowever, when navigation is aborted there is no way to track it in a global manner, which leads to loading indicator to stay visible on a screen.\r\n\r\nAs possible solution, [it was suggested](https://github.com/vuejs/vue-router/issues/3027#issuecomment-599474646) to _\"use `router.push` or the v-slot api and get the promise returned from `navigate`\"_ (which is currently not available because #3042 has no PR). However this solution would require to create wrappers around vue-router API, which should always be used throughout entire application instead of native `vue-router` api. Even though it is easy to do for `router.push`, it is cumbersome to do for `<router-link>` because wrapper should be able to support the same rendering scenarios (without slot content, with slot content, with scoped slot content, etc.)\r\nIt is also not suitable for us, because we have shared set of router components, which are re-used in different vue applications. And not all applications will have `navigation-state-plugin.js`. So we need to have possibility to use native `router.push` and `<router-link>` with an option to globally manage navigation state.\r\n\r\n### What does the proposed API look like?\r\nMost obvious would be to introduce global `onAbort` hook:\r\n```js\r\n  router.onAbort(function callback(abortedRoute, reason) { ... });\r\n```\r\nwhere `reason` can be one of the errors from #3047\r\n\r\nIt may be possible to call existing `onError` or `afterEach` hooks also for aborted navigations, but that would be a breaking change, and probably would make API more confusing.\r\n\r\n<!-- generated by vue-issues.

The check in push state wheter push state can be used, checks for `window.history && 'pushState' in window.history`, but office.js resets the fields on window.history, not window.history itself (see https://stackoverflow.com/a/42703406/). I propose we check if Office.js is available in the context, and if so, we disable the push state.\r\n\r\n### What does the proposed API look like?\r\nWe would add a check at this position:\r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/vuejs/vue-router/blob/c0d3376f4e3527bd761bd325873366ed74f5736b/src/util/push-state.js#L17\r\n\r\nThe additional check could look like this:\r\n\r\n```const officeJsLoaded = window.Office && window.Office.context;```\r\n\r\nso the whole function might look like this:\r\n\r\n```\r\nexport const supportsPushState =\r\n  inBrowser &&\r\n  (function () {\r\n    const ua = window.navigator.userAgent\r\n    const officeJsLoaded = window.Office && window.Office.context\r\n\r\n    if (\r\n      officeJsLoaded ||\r\n      ((ua.indexOf('Android 2.') !== -1 || ua.indexOf('Android 4.0') !== -1) &&\r\n      ua.indexOf('Mobile Safari') !== -1 &&\r\n      ua.indexOf('Chrome') === -1 &&\r\n      ua.indexOf('Windows Phone') === -1)\r\n    ) {\r\n      return false\r\n    }\r\n\r\n    return window.history && 'pushState' in window.history\r\n  })()\r\n```\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAlternatively, we could check if `window.history.pushState` is null, but I am not sure of the implications of this.

It is impossible to clean up its popstate listener.\r\n\r\n#### Basepath bug\r\n\r\nIf you have multiple vue applications, each using vue-router, they must all share the same base path, even if you ensure only one of them is active at a time by destroying / remounting when navigating between them. Otherwise they will all attempt to ensure that every route starts with their base path.\r\n\r\nSame goes for if you have one vue-router and one react-router. The vue-router will force all urls to start with its base path within the react-owned pages, even if you have destroyed the vue application before navigating to the react application.\r\n\r\n### What is expected?\r\nI think the best solution is to call `window.addEventListener('popstate', handler)` when `const intance = new Vue({router})` is called, instead of when `new VueRouter()` is called. And then call `window.removeEventListener('popstate', handler)` when `instance.$destroy()` is called.\r\n\r\nAlternatively, it could be cleaned up like so:\r\n\r\n```js\r\n// Alternative solution (not my preferred one, but works)\r\n\r\nconst router = new VueRouter({...})\r\n// later, to clean up event listeners:\r\nrouter.detach()\r\n// later, to reattach event listeners\r\nrouter.attach()\r\n```\r\n\r\n### What is actually happening?\r\nwindow.addEventListener is called during `new VueRouter()`, and there is no way to ever remove that event listener.\r\n\r\n---\r\nSee related https://github.com/single-spa/single-spa/issues/488. I am a maintainer of single-spa, which has dozens of organizations using one or more instances of vue-router. For us, cleaning up the event listener when the application is unmounted is important to being able to have isolated apps on the same page.\r\n\r\n<!-- generated by vue-issues.

We run into some errors because at the SSR side some components are created, which on the client side are created after the initial mount. This in turn causes hydration errors. In the provided example I have a MainLayout (which is async loaded in the router), which in turn  loads (also async) an EssentialLink component.

Child components that are also async are created after the App.vue mounted() hook which causes issues for us. \r\n\r\n---\r\nServer and client side are waiting for router.onReady() which in the documentation says that async components are resolved before this hook is called: https://router.vuejs.org/api/#router-onready. \r\n\r\nIt seems to me that the router.onReady() should only be fired when all async child components are also resolved and created.\r\n\r\n<!-- generated by vue-issues.

That probably led me to a misleading conception.\r\n\r\n<!-- generated by vue-issues.
