Since WinForms is part of the shared framework, the code base should begin preparing for this transition. The following steps will help ensure that if a \"safe\" BinaryFormatter-compatible serializer is introduced in place of the original BinaryFormatter type, WinForms will be able to drop its dependency on the legacy type and move on to the new type with minimal friction.\r\n\r\n1. Consider all usages of BinaryFormatter already in the code. Is it _absolutely mandatory_ that each of these usages be present? Is there a critical business or customer scenario that this fulfills that cannot be addressed by some other technology? Consider that some types (like `Delegate`) which are serializable in Full Framework are not serializable in Core, so this might affect some call sites which were kept for \"back compat\" reasons but which were not fully tested. If a call site does not need to exist, remove it.\r\n\r\n2. Of the remaining usages, ensure that a type-limiting `SerializationBinder` is _always_ present. Do not allow any code path which might bypass setting the `SerializationBinder` on the serializer instance. (This guidance only applies to call sites where `Deserialize` is called.)\r\n\r\nIf there are any places where these requirements cannot be met then we can work through them on a case-by-case basis.
