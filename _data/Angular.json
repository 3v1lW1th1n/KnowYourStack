For my print document that runs into multiple pages I need automatically to avoid printing the date and title in the header.

No provider for NgControl. I have already imported FormsModule and ReactiveFormsModule to app.module.ts file which is the remedy for this error (as normal). But it haven't fixed this time.\r\n\r\nThe problem seems to be with the Angular Elements where when we create angular element we have to pass the component to entryComponents and that leads to angular compiles it factory even that it's not on the template, and because it's not part of any form and doesn't have any From directive on it -> which gives the error **No Provider For NgControl**\r\n\r\nLater on i have added @Optional() decorator for this. But that leads to ValueAccessor to be null and all other form input actions break.\r\n\r\nIf i use this without angular elements (as a normal element), that seems to work.

I understand now that when a parent component is configured with OnPush ChangeDetectionStrategy, its child components inherit that strategy (see f.e. https://github.com/angular/angular/issues/22461).\r\n\r\nHowever, I noticed that when I trigger change detection in the parent component (f.e. by clicking a button), change detection also runs for the child component.

To accomplish this, ngcc\r\ntraverses the full import graph of the entry-points it encounters, for\r\nwhich it uses a dependency host to find all module imports. Since\r\nimports look different in the various bundle formats ngcc supports, a\r\nspecific dependency host is used depending on the information provided\r\nin an entry-points `package.json` file. If there's not enough\r\ninformation in the `package.json` file for ngcc to be able to determine\r\nwhich dependency host to use, ngcc would fail with an error.\r\n\r\nIf, however, the entry-point is not compiled by Angular, it is not\r\nnecessary to process any of its dependencies. None of them can have\r\nbeen compiled by Angular so ngcc does not need to know about them.\r\nTherefore, this commit changes the behavior to avoid recursing into\r\ndependencies of entry-points that are not compiled by Angular.\r\n\r\nIn particular, this fixes an issue for packages that have dependencies\r\non the `date-fns` package. This package has various secondary\r\nentry-points that have a `package.json` file only containing a `typings`\r\nfield, without providing additional fields for ngcc to know which\r\ndependency host to use. By not needing a dependency host at all, the\r\nerror is avoided.\r\n\r\nFixes #32302\r\n","Url":"https://github.com/angular/angular/pull/32303","RelatedDescription":"Closed or merged PR \"fix(ngcc): do not analyze dependencies for non Angular entry-points\" (#32303)"},{"Id":"485331644","IsPullRequest":false,"CreatedAt":"2019-08-26T16:46:33","Actor":"kapunahelewong","Number":"32320","RawContent":null,"Title":"Port Accessibility example and add docregions","State":"open","Body":"<!--üîÖüîÖüîÖüîÖüîÖüîÖüîÖüîÖüîÖüîÖüîÖüîÖüîÖüîÖüîÖüîÖüîÖüîÖüîÖüîÖüîÖüîÖüîÖüîÖüîÖüîÖüîÖüîÖüîÖüîÖüîÖ\r\n\r\nOh hi there! üòÑ\r\n\r\nTo expedite issue processing please search open and closed issues before submitting a new one.\r\nExisting issues often contain information about workarounds, resolution, or progress updates.\r\n\r\nüîÖüîÖüîÖüîÖüîÖüîÖüîÖüîÖüîÖüîÖüîÖüîÖüîÖüîÖüîÖüîÖüîÖüîÖüîÖüîÖüîÖüîÖüîÖüîÖüîÖüîÖüîÖüîÖüîÖüîÖüîÖüîÖüîÖ-->\r\n\r\n# üìö Docs or angular.io bug report\r\n\r\n### Description\r\n\r\nCurrently, the Accessibility snippets are all inline, rather than using the code examples from an app inside of aio.

Either build or ng serve with Ivy turned on\r\n2. See that the 'classesInMySchool' property didn't make it through to the child component, so 'it didn't work' is displayed\r\n3. Switch off ivy in tsconfig.app.json\r\n4. Repeat step 2 and see that it works normally - 'child works' is displayed\r\n\r\n## üî• Exception or Error\r\nNone\r\n\r\n\r\n## üåç  Your Environment\r\n\r\n**Angular Version:**\r\n<pre><code>\r\nAngular CLI: 8.3.0\r\nNode: 10.15.1\r\nOS: win32 x64\r\nAngular: 8.2.3\r\n... animations, common, compiler, compiler-cli, core, forms\r\n... language-service, platform-browser, platform-browser-dynamic\r\n... router\r\n\r\nPackage                           Version\r\n-----------------------------------------------------------\r\n@angular-devkit/architect         0.803.0\r\n@angular-devkit/build-angular     0.803.0\r\n@angular-devkit/build-optimizer   0.803.0\r\n@angular-devkit/build-webpack     0.803.0\r\n@angular-devkit/core              8.3.0\r\n@angular-devkit/schematics        8.3.0\r\n@angular/cli                      8.3.0\r\n@ngtools/webpack                  8.3.0\r\n@schematics/angular               8.3.0\r\n@schematics/update                0.803.0\r\nrxjs                              6.4.0\r\ntypescript                        3.5.3\r\nwebpack                           4.39.2\r\n\r\n</code></pre>\r\n\r\n**Anything else relevant?**\r\n\r\nWe are working on educational software for schools, so as you can imagine there are rather a lot of properties beginning with the word 'class' and changing them all as a workaround is unfeasible.","Url":"https://github.com/angular/angular/issues/32310","RelatedDescription":"Open issue \"[ivy] If an @Input *begins* with the word 'class' it is treated as a CSS class\" (#32310)"},{"Id":"484862540","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2019-08-24T21:09:49","Actor":"AndrewKushnir","Number":"32309","RawContent":null,"Title":"fix(ivy): handle expressions in i18n attributes properly","State":"open","Body":"Prior to this commit, complex expressions (that require additional statements to be generated) were handled incorrectly in case they were used in attributes annotated with i18n flags.

This commit updated the logic to use the `convertPropertyBinding` function, which contains the necessary code to append extra statements.

The \"module\" should have pre-configured reference to the \"component\",  to facilitate lazy loading the component.\r\n3. a corresponding route mapping in the \"app routing module\" should be generated with a path referring to the  [component-name].\r\n\r\nNote: Hope this should provide some productivity improvement, when it comes to coding/dev work. \r\n* \r\n### Describe alternatives you've considered\r\nNone.","Url":"https://github.com/angular/angular-cli/issues/15442","RelatedDescription":"Open issue \"support lazy loading for ng components by default.\" (#15442)"},{"Id":"484780483","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2019-08-24T05:20:15","Actor":"renovate-bot","Number":"15434","RawContent":null,"Title":"build: update @angular/animations to version","State":"open","Body":"This PR contains the following updates:\n\n| Package | Type | Update | Change |\n|---|---|---|---|\n| [@angular/animations](https://togithub.com/angular/animations-builds) | dependencies | digest | [`e989846` -> `91090e2`](https://renovatebot.com/diffs/npm/angular%2fanimations-builds//) |\n| [@angular/common](https://togithub.com/angular/common-builds) | dependencies | digest | [`4245170` -> `8f97d82`](https://renovatebot.com/diffs/npm/angular%2fcommon-builds//) |\n| [@angular/compiler](https://togithub.com/angular/compiler-builds) | dependencies | digest | [`ea55e76` -> `c9440a8`](https://renovatebot.com/diffs/npm/angular%2fcompiler-builds//) |\n| [@angular/compiler-cli](https://togithub.com/angular/compiler-cli-builds) | dependencies | digest | [`441cb41` -> `3bce7ac`](https://renovatebot.com/diffs/npm/angular%2fcompiler-cli-builds//) |\n| [@angular/core](https://togithub.com/angular/core-builds) | dependencies | digest | [`4a4bf86` -> `a640a94`](https://renovatebot.com/diffs/npm/angular%2fcore-builds//) |\n| [@angular/forms](https://togithub.com/angular/forms-builds) | dependencies | digest | [`192389b` -> `3d74b0f`](https://renovatebot.com/diffs/npm/angular%2fforms-builds//) |\n| [@angular/language-service](https://togithub.com/angular/language-service-builds) | dependencies | digest | [`4b27fa6` -> `6a966a1`](https://renovatebot.com/diffs/npm/angular%2flanguage-service-builds//) |\n| [@angular/platform-browser](https://togithub.com/angular/platform-browser-builds) | dependencies | digest | [`27f7393` -> `0645deb`](https://renovatebot.com/diffs/npm/angular%2fplatform-browser-builds//) |\n| [@angular/platform-browser-dynamic](https://togithub.com/angular/platform-browser-dynamic-builds) | dependencies | digest | [`21c6bf2` -> `436c90a`](https://renovatebot.com/diffs/npm/angular%2fplatform-browser-dynamic-builds//) |\n| [@angular/router](https://togithub.com/angular/router-builds) | dependencies | digest | [`ca6b7de` -> `cf9d6ab`](https://renovatebot.com/diffs/npm/angular%2frouter-builds//) |\n\n:abcd: If you wish to disable git hash updates, add `\":disableDigestUpdates\"` to the extends array in your config.\n\n---\n\n### Renovate configuration\n\n:date: **Schedule**: \"after 10pm every weekday,before 4am every weekday,every weekend\" in timezone America/Tijuana.\n\n:vertical_traffic_light: **Automerge**: Disabled by config.

In one particular component, the component is using require.ensure(...) to import JS scripts needed for the component.\r\n\r\nExample:\r\n\r\n```\r\nrequire.ensure([], require => {\r\n\tconst TweenLite = require('../../../../../assets/external-js/TweenLite.min');\r\n\tlet confettiCannon = require('../../../../../assets/external-js/confetti');\r\n\tthis.confettiCannon = confettiCannon = new confettiCannon.ConfettiCannon();\r\n\tconfettiCannon.start();\r\n});\r\n```\r\n\r\nTweenLite.min.js is a GSAP plugin used for simple transitions. confetti.js is a custom script that loads a canvas animation. When confettiCannon.start() is run eventually it will try to use the TweenLite plugin - which is resulting in an error because TweenLite is `undefined`.\r\n\r\nWith my previous Angular application this code works fine, and since when running the confetti.js TweenLite is listed as undefined my hunch was that the plugin is not being attached to the window.\r\n\r\nBelow is a sample of the differences between the code that is returned by Webpack from my two applications:\r\n\r\n_Working Application (custom webpack config)_\r\n\r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/36479149/63606218-d2f9d000-c5cf-11e9-954f-f68349402feb.png)\r\n\r\n_Failing Application (using Angular CLI)_\r\n\r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/36479149/63606251-ead15400-c5cf-11e9-8716-5cf39cd59cb9.png)\r\n\r\nThe difference between the two scripts is that the working sample wraps the imported script with a `function(global) { ... }`. I'm guessing that with this Webpack is able to attach the script globally.\r\n\r\nSo my question is, is it possible to dynamically import a JS file and somehow make it available globally?\r\n\r\nI don't know if there's any CLI configuration or Webpack loader that could help with this scenario.\r\n\r\n## üåç Your Environment\r\n<pre><code>\r\n<!-- run `ng version` and paste output below

These changes work around the issue by deferring the setting of the description.\r\n\r\nFixes #16719.","Url":"https://github.com/angular/components/pull/16870","RelatedDescription":"Open PR \"fix(tooltip): avoid adding same aria description as trigger's aria-label\" (#16870)"},{"Id":"484790891","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2019-08-24T07:52:39","Actor":"crisbeto","Number":"16869","RawContent":null,"Title":"fix(tabs): unnecessarily adding pagination when changing to new list of tabs with same labels","State":"open","Body":"These changes fix an issue where swapping out the list of tabs to one with the same labels causes the header to add a pagination when it doesn't have to.
