Currently developer has to rewrite existing array of 5 props into object just for adding 1 new prop with default value.\r\n\r\nWhat I would like to propose is using mixed array of strings and object for detailed props. I've already tested code below and it works just fine.\r\n\r\n\r\n### What does the proposed API look like?\r\nin vuejs repo there is a file *vue/src/core/util/options.js* with _normalizeProps_ function, which has to be slightly modified\r\n\r\n```javascript\r\nfunction normalizeProps (options: Object, vm: ?Component) {\r\n  const props = options.props\r\n\r\n  if (!props) return\r\n  \r\n  const res = {}\r\n  let i, val, name\r\n  \r\n  if (Array.isArray(props)) {\r\n    i = props.length\r\n    \r\n    while (i--) {\r\n      val = props[i]\r\n      \r\n      if (typeof val === 'string') {\r\n        name = camelize(val)\r\n        res[name] = { type: null }\r\n      } else if (isPlainObject(val)) {\r\n        // this is new piece of code\r\n        for (var key in val) {\r\n            let objVal = val[key];\r\n            name = camelize(key);\r\n            res[name] = isPlainObject(objVal) ?\r\n              objVal : {\r\n                type: objVal\r\n              };\r\n          }\r\n      } else if (process.env.NODE_ENV !== 'production') {\r\n        warn('props must be strings when using array syntax.')\r\n      }\r\n    }\r\n  } else if (isPlainObject(props)) {\r\n    for (const key in props) {\r\n      val = props[key]\r\n      name = camelize(key)\r\n      res[name] = isPlainObject(val)\r\n        ? val\r\n        : { type: val }\r\n    }\r\n  } else if (process.env.NODE_ENV !== 'production') {\r\n    warn(\r\n      `Invalid value for option \"props\": expected an Array or an Object, `  \r\n      `but got ${toRawType(props)}.`,\r\n      vm\r\n    )\r\n  }\r\n  \r\n  options.props = res\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nAnd now we can use this syntax:\r\n```javascript\r\n    export default {\r\n        name: 'ChildComponent',\r\n        props: [\r\n            'first-property',\r\n            'second-property',\r\n            'third-property',\r\n            {\r\n                forth: { type: String, default: 'I am forth prop!' },\r\n                fifth: { type: String, default: 'I am fifth prop!' } \r\n            }\r\n        ]\r\n    }\r\n```\r\n\r\n<!-- generated by vue-issues.

Also most of our site ist static and it would be stupid to ship our entire app for only some parts of our page being interactive.\r\n\r\nInstead we **partially hydrate** the page (with our own plugin https://github.com/spring-media/vue-plugin-moisturizer). For this we need to map SSR'd HTML to the corresponding VUE components, so we need to put some `data-attribute` in the HTML match them. \r\n\r\nWe use the `name` setting of a component for this,  so if I have component like this:\r\n\r\n```js\r\n{\r\n  name: 'my-component'\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nthe html would read\r\n\r\n```html\r\n<div data-hydration-name=\"my-component\">...</div>\r\n```\r\n\r\n\r\nbut this does not work for 3rd party components. Anything we get without that ID we cannot hydrate. It would be great if we could find the component from a component's instance / vnode.\r\n\r\nThere is a `cid` property, but this is not the same on the server and on the client,  because we have a different number and oder of components on the client and server so we cannot use this.\r\n\r\nThere is a similiar issue for this here: https://github.com/vuejs/vue/issues/7213 but one of your members suggested to create a new issue because the old one would just not show up under your pile of issues.\r\n\r\n### What does the proposed API look like?\r\n```js\r\nthis.$vnode.cuuid // hash based on the filename and path\r\n```\r\n\r\n<!-- generated by vue-issues.

Much like in a database, if you add an object to an array in the store, you want to get it's id so that you can reference it again. When looking up how to do this, I found that you cannot, and I also found that someone else had the exact same inquiry on stackoverflow: https://stackoverflow.com/questions/42404925/return-value-from-vuex-mutation-id-for-newly-created-object#42406872\r\nThe response to the question on stack overflow was to use vuex actions, but I don't think that one should have to use an asynchronous action to achieve a synchronous task.\r\nTo carry on with the database example, one might use postgresql's \"RETURNING\" as an analogy.

That means the convenience is unavailable for computed properties that rely on Vuex state and methods that dispatch Vuex actions, which is a big limitation.\r\n\r\n- It requires tight coupling of components to Vuex modules, which I've found doesn't scale well to large apps. Instead, I've found it very useful to _never_ use the `mapXXX` helpers directly in my components, but in a [state helpers file](https://github.com/chrisvfritz/vue-enterprise-boilerplate/blob/master/src/state/helpers.js), which describes the public interfaces for all Vuex modules. From this file, I'll import the concerns I care about into individual components. For example:\r\n  ```js\r\n  import {\r\n    authComputed,\r\n    notificationsComputed,\r\n    notificationsMethods,\r\n    searchMethods,\r\n  } from '@state/helpers'\r\n\r\n  // ...\r\n\r\n  computed: {\r\n    ...authComputed,\r\n    ...notificationsComputed,\r\n  },\r\n  methods: {\r\n    ...notificationsMethods,\r\n    ...searchMethods,\r\n  },\r\n  ```\r\n  This prevents verbose and duplicated `mapXXX` code in components, replaced by a nice list of the global concerns this component cares about. But the benefit _really_ comes in when adding new state/getters/actions or when refactoring a Vuex module. For example, if I add a new `userLoggedIn` getter to `authComputed`, it will automatically be available in any component using `authComputed`. Or, if I rename some state or split it out into additional modules, the state helpers file allows the refactor to be done in two steps: first on the Vuex side, while updating the state helpers for compatibility, _then_ in my components (if I actually want the public interface to change as well).\r\n\r\nFor these reasons, I feel like the `mapXXX` helpers should stay and the scoped slot pattern should actually be avoided.
