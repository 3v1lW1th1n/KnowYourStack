It does work without Ivy, but with Ivy (Angular 9 rc 11) it fails with:\r\n```\r\n(If you are sure no ngcc process is running then you should delete the lockfile at /drone/src/github.com/Rush/angular-app/node_modules/@angular/compiler-cli/ngcc/__ngcc_lock_file__.)\r\n```\r\n\r\n### Describe the solution you'd like\r\nThis line should allow overwriting the lock file location:\r\nhttps://github.com/angular/angular/blob/d15cf60c4969c4da081d0efdbc818abfd3fe43eb/packages/compiler-cli/ngcc/src/execution/lock_file.ts#L20\r\nPerhaps like so:\r\n```\r\n lockFilePath = process.env.ANGULAR_NGCC_LOCK_FILE_PATH || \r\n      this.fs.resolve(require.resolve('@angular/compiler-cli/ngcc'), '../__ngcc_lock_file__');\r\n```\r\n\r\nI think this is safe cause all simultaneous compiles are happening in Webpack so they're not conflicting with each other. @petebacondarwin @AndrewKushnir \r\n\r\nNot having this would cause my builds running 10x more slowly due to a lot of parallelism.\r\n\r\n### Describe alternatives you've considered\r\nDisabling the lock file with a config option.\r\n","Url":"https://github.com/angular/angular/issues/35000","RelatedDescription":"Open issue \"Allow specifying custom NGCC lockfile location (cannot build in parallel with Ivy)\" (#35000)"},{"Id":"555904561","IsPullRequest":false,"CreatedAt":"2020-01-27T23:55:57","Actor":"andrewseguin","Number":"34999","RawContent":null,"Title":"Animations metadata is not inherited to sub-classed components","State":"open","Body":"In Ivy, the `@Component({...})` metadata is inherited from a parent class.

If these compiler options are no longer needed by the current CLI, I would expect the migration to remove them without error.\r\n\r\nThe error was made more confusing because the error message references an angular configuration option that is not actually present in my tsConfig file: `\"flatModuleIndex\"`.\r\n\r\n## 🔬 Minimal Reproduction\r\n<!--\r\nSimple steps to reproduce this bug.\r\n\r\nPlease include: commands run (including args), packages added, related code changes.\r\n\r\nIf reproduction steps are not enough for reproduction of your issue, please create a minimal GitHub repository with the reproduction of the issue. \r\nA good way to make a minimal reproduction is to create a new app via `ng new repro-app` and add the minimum possible code to show the problem. \r\nShare the link to the repo below along with step-by-step instructions to reproduce the problem, as well as expected and actual behavior.\r\n\r\nIssues that don't have enough info and can't be reproduced will be closed.\r\n\r\nYou can read more about issue submission guidelines here: https://github.com/angular/angular-cli/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md#-submitting-an-issue\r\n-->\r\n\r\nA reproduction repo can be found here: https://gitlab.com/service-work/is-loading/tree/angular-update-issue\r\n\r\nFrom the repo root, run\r\n\r\n1. `yarn install`\r\n2. `yarn ng update @angular/core --force --migrate-only --from=8`\r\n\r\n## 🔥 Exception or Error\r\n<pre><code>TypeScript project \"lib/tsconfig.lib.json\" has configuration errors.

function `async` will not make it wait for the asynchronous call to `compileComponents()`.\r\n\r\nThe code should be changed to this (added `await`):\r\n```JavaScript\r\n  beforeEach(async(() => {\r\n    await TestBed.configureTestingModule({\r\n      declarations: [ MyComponent ]\r\n    })\r\n    .compileComponents();\r\n  }));\r\n```\r\n\r\nSource code:

Migrating the entire code base to Angular is not technically viable at this point in time. As a solution I have dual bootstrap the AngularJS application with the Angular ngUpgrade module so the application can be migrated over time. \r\n\r\nAt this initial stage of the project I am using the existing webpack.config to build the app. My webpack.config handles the transpilation of the Typescript and Angular by way of the ts-loader. Everything compiles and loads and I can proceed with Angular while maintaining existing AngularJS code.\r\n\r\nAt present I do not get the full benefit of the Angular CLI, but will in future as more legacy code is migrated and the CLI is used to it's full capability. At present thou it should be possible for me to use the lint and test commands against all new Angular code even thou it isn't being built or served by the Angular CLI.\r\n\r\n#### The actual feature request\r\n\r\nThe issue comes into play when I attempt to use `ng test` to test new Angular components. `ng test`, or more specifically the angular-devkit/build-angular:karma plugin. Out of the box it doesn't support native ES6 imports for html files within Angular components. Running `ng test` on files written like:\r\n\r\n```\r\nimport {Component} from '@angular/core';\r\n\r\nimport template from './my-component.component.html';\r\n\r\n@Component({\r\n    selector: 'my-component',\r\n    template\r\n})\r\npublic class MyComponent {\r\n```\r\n\r\nresults in:\r\n\r\n```\r\nERROR in ./src/app/my-component/my-component.component.html 1:0\r\nModule parse failed: Unexpected token (1:0)\r\nYou may need an appropriate loader to handle this file type, currently no loaders are configured to process this file. See https://webpack.js.org/concepts#loaders\r\n```\r\n\r\nI cannot use the Angular CLI to build at this time, so using templateUrl is out as it results distribution  making requests to the server for the templates. I assume this is because I don't have a full AOT configuration provided natively by the Angular CLI.\r\n\r\n### Describe the solution you'd like\r\n\r\nI would like the `\\.html$` files to be handled by the webpack config generated by @angular-devkit/build-angular/plugins/karma`. This can be achieved simply by adding (or something similar):\r\n\r\n```\r\nwebpackConfig.module.rules.push({\r\n    test: /\\.html$/,\r\n    use: [{loader: 'raw-loader'}]\r\n});\r\n```\r\n\r\nI was thinking `raw-loader` only because you already have it as a dependency; otherwise `html-loader` would also work with the additional configuration option for `caseSensitive: true`. It's a little insane that the plugin supports imports of every other typical file type but not html:\r\n\r\n```\r\n[\r\n  {\r\n    test: /\\.(eot|svg|cur|jpg|png|webp|gif|otf|ttf|woff|woff2|ani)$/,\r\n    loader: 'file-loader',\r\n    options: { name: '[name].[ext]' }\r\n  },\r\n  {\r\n    test: /[\\/\\\\]@angular[\\/\\\\]core[\\/\\\\].+\\.js$/,\r\n    parser: { system: true }\r\n  },\r\n  { test: /[\\/\\\\]hot[\\/\\\\]emitter\\.js$/, parser: { node: [Object] } },\r\n  {\r\n    test: /[\\/\\\\]webpack-dev-server[\\/\\\\]client[\\/\\\\]utils[\\/\\\\]createSocketUrl\\.js$/,\r\n    parser: { node: [Object] }\r\n  },\r\n  { test: /\\.js$/, exclude: /(ngfactory|ngstyle)\\.js$/ },\r\n  {\r\n    test: /\\.js$/,\r\n    exclude: /(ngfactory|ngstyle)\\.js$/,\r\n    enforce: 'pre'\r\n  },\r\n  { exclude: [], test: /\\.css$/, use: [ [Object], [Object] ] },\r\n  {\r\n    exclude: [],\r\n    test: /\\.scss$|\\.sass$/,\r\n    use: [ [Object], [Object], [Object] ]\r\n  },\r\n  {\r\n    exclude: [],\r\n    test: /\\.less$/,\r\n    use: [ [Object], [Object], [Object] ]\r\n  },\r\n  {\r\n    exclude: [],\r\n    test: /\\.styl$/,\r\n    use: [ [Object], [Object], [Object] ]\r\n  },\r\n  {\r\n    test: /\\.tsx?$/,\r\n    loader: '/<omitted>/node_modules/@angular-devkit/build-angular/node_modules/@ngtools/webpack/src/index.js'\r\n  },\r\n  {\r\n    test: /\\.(jsx?|tsx?)$/,\r\n    loader: '/<omitted>/node_modules/coverage-istanbul-loader/lib/index.js',\r\n    options: { esModules: true },\r\n    enforce: 'post',\r\n    exclude: [ /\\.(e2e|spec)\\.ts$/, /node_modules/ ],\r\n    include: '<omitted>'\r\n  }\r\n]\r\n```\r\n\r\nThis shouldn't impact the usage of Angular's template or templateUrls because they aren't native requires or imports; just strings and webpack will ignore them.\r\n\r\n### Describe alternatives you've considered\r\n\r\nI have tried several work arounds including attempting to preprocess the files like in AngularJS and replace templateUrl with the embedded html string. Looked into other angular tooling that will build angular in my existing webpack config; but all these solutions feel dirty.\r\n\r\nMy least offensive workaround for my issue is to publish my own hacked version of the angular-devkit/build-angular library that applies the above mentioned patch so I can process test files in a way I expect until which time I can move to a world strictly with the angular-cli.","Url":"https://github.com/angular/angular-cli/issues/16746","RelatedDescription":"Closed issue \"Add support for *.html via the raw-loader to the webpack.config generated by @angular-devkit/build-angular:karma\" (#16746)"},{"Id":"554563780","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2020-01-24T06:16:36","Actor":"alan-agius4","Number":"16749","RawContent":null,"Title":"ci: restore check for renovate pr user","State":"closed","Body":"We are now back on renovate fork.

The implementation contains a child component (searchbar.component.ts). The child component contains a SELECT element. The SELECT element emits a value on its (change) function. The emitted value is caught by the parent component's subscriber function and printed to the console. No problem. However, using Visual Studio Code v1.41.1 (2019Dec18) to debug the subscriber function while running Chrome 76.0.3809.146 as the runtime environment, a breakpoint set anywhere inside the parent's subscriber function will stop the code and allow inspection of values. However, when F5 (continue) is activated, Chrome immediately crashes.\r\n\r\n## 🔥 Exception or Error\r\n<pre><code>\r\n<!-- If the issue is accompanied by an exception or an error, please share it below: -->\r\n<!-- ✍️-->\r\nIf \"Aww, Snap\" is an error code from Chrome then this is what I get :)\r\n</code></pre>\r\n\r\n\r\n## 🌍 Your Environment\r\n<pre><code>\r\n<!-- run `ng version` and paste output below -->\r\n<!-- ✍️-->\r\nPackage                           Version\r\n-----------------------------------------------------------\r\n@angular-devkit/architect         0.803.6\r\n@angular-devkit/build-angular     0.803.6\r\n@angular-devkit/build-optimizer   0.803.6\r\n@angular-devkit/build-webpack     0.803.6\r\n@angular-devkit/core              8.3.6\r\n@angular-devkit/schematics        8.3.6\r\n@angular/cli                      8.3.6\r\n@ngtools/webpack                  8.3.6\r\n@schematics/angular               8.3.6\r\n@schematics/update                0.803.6\r\nrxjs                              6.5.3\r\ntypescript                        3.5.3\r\nwebpack                           4.39.2\r\nnode (npm) version     6.9.0\r\n</code></pre>\r\n\r\n**Anything else relevant?**\r\n<!-- ✍️Is this a browser specific issue?

Navigation rails provide ergonomic movement between primary destinations in apps. YouTube and Google Photos are a couple of examples that use this component.\r\n\r\n#### Use Case\r\n\r\nThe rail is a side navigation component that displays three to seven app destinations and, optionally, a Floating Action Button. Each destination is represented by an icon and a text label.\r\n\r\nThe rail can function on its own at larger screen sizes, such as desktop and tablet. When users transition between screen sizes and devices, the rail can also complement other navigation components, such as bottom navigation.\r\n\r\n#### Preview\r\n![](https://storage.googleapis.com/spec-host/mio-staging%2Fmio-components%2F1579302979877%2Fassets%2F16RFbe_aL_2_gNzrpCWu-wXNAJjouLRlm%2Frail-anatomy-container-dense.png)\r\n","Url":"https://github.com/angular/components/issues/18280","RelatedDescription":"Open issue \"Add Navigation Rail Sidenav Component\" (#18280)"},{"Id":"554811465","IsPullRequest":false,"CreatedAt":"2020-01-24T15:48:08","Actor":"mcroker","Number":"18279","RawContent":null,"Title":"youtube-player Unable to play video in ready Event handler.","State":"open","Body":"#### Reproduction\r\n\r\nUse StackBlitz to reproduce your issue:\r\nhttps://stackblitz.com/edit/components-issue-qcwjmp?file=app%2Fapp.component.ts\r\n\r\nSteps to reproduce:\r\n1.
