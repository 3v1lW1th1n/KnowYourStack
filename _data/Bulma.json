Create a tiling layout (mine uses a 8-width and 4-width tile)\r\n2. Set the min-width (I'm using 1024px)\r\n3.

I'm not sure how else with Bulma one would create a min width that prevents the website from dynamically changing beyond a point.\r\n\r\nNOTE that the website does get a horizontal scroll bar (if you set `$body-overflow-x: scroll;`) and that other things don't change but the tiling seems to be relative to the viewport width and therefore continues to change.\r\n\r\n### Actual behavior\r\n\r\nRefer to step 3 of \"steps to reproduce\"\r\n\r\n### Sidenote\r\n\r\nHuge fan of Bulma, thank you so much for making this awesome framework, let me know if there is anything else you need me to explain about the issue and I will happily.\r\n","Url":"https://github.com/jgthms/bulma/issues/2528","RelatedDescription":"Open issue \"Min-width for tiling?\" (#2528)"},{"Id":"454714620","IsPullRequest":false,"CreatedAt":"2019-06-11T14:10:38","Actor":"georgfranz","Number":"2527","RawContent":null,"Title":"Responsive margin + paddings","State":"open","Body":"### Responsive margins + paddings\r\n\r\nI am sure that I am not the first one who needs a different margin and padding setting on tablet and on desktop devices etc.\r\n\r\nSo, it would be cool if you can do the following thing:\r\n\r\n`<section class=\"section is-marginless-vertical-mobile has-margin-vertical-tablet\"></section> `\r\n\r\nBy default, there are only these entries in the helper.sass:\r\n```\r\n.is-marginless\r\n  margin: 0 !important\r\n\r\n.is-paddingless\r\n  padding: 0 !important\r\n```\r\n\r\nI've extended this having such things like:\r\n\r\n```\r\nis-marginless-tablet\r\nis-paddingless-vertical\r\nhas-padding-horizontal\r\nhas-margin-vertical-desktop\r\n```\r\nIf you don't need all variations (there are a lot...), you can control this by two arrays.\r\n\r\nI attach the sass file and a sample output with all variations.\r\n\r\nIf this is also helpful for anybody else, I can do a pull request.\r\n\r\n[margin_sample.css.txt](https://github.com/jgthms/bulma/files/3276839/margin_sample.css.txt)\r\n\r\n[margin_responsive.sass.txt](https://github.com/jgthms/bulma/files/3276843/margin_responsive.sass.txt)\r\n\r\n\r\nBest wishes,\r\nGeorg.\r\n\r\n_PS: I luv Bulma!!!!_\r\n","Url":"https://github.com/jgthms/bulma/issues/2527","RelatedDescription":"Open issue \"Responsive margin + paddings\" (#2527)"},{"Id":"454253153","IsPullRequest":false,"CreatedAt":"2019-06-10T16:29:19","Actor":"ediopia","Number":"2526","RawContent":null,"Title":".has-dropdown background color makes a trouble in .hero ","State":"closed","Body":"<!-- PLEASE READ THE FOLLOWING INSTRUCTIONS -->\r\n\r\n<!-- Choose one of the following: -->\r\nThis is about **Bulma | the Docs**.\r\n\r\n<!-- Is it about Bulma or about the Docs? -->\r\n<!-- Is it a bug/feature/question or do you need help? -->\r\n<!-- If it's a bug, is it a browser bug? -->\r\n\r\n### Overview of the problem\r\n.has-dropdown background color makes a trouble in .hero \r\n<!-- UNCOMMENT THE APPROPRIATE LINES -->\r\n\r\n<!-- This is about the Bulma **CSS framework** -->\r\n<!-- This is about the Bulma **Docs** -->\r\n<!-- I'm using Bulma **version** [x.x.x] -->\r\n<!-- My **browser** is: -->\r\n<!-- This is a **Sass** issue: I'm using version [x.x.x] -->\r\n<!-- I am sure this issue is **not a duplicate**? -->\r\n\r\n### Description\r\n\r\n<!-- Description of the bug, enhancement, or question -->\r\n\r\n### Steps to Reproduce\r\n\r\n<!--\r\n1.

This is my first time opening a pull request in Bulma! 👋🏻 The .is-title-adjacent helper adds the ability to arbitrarily move any element which is below a title or a subtitle closer to that title or subtitle, in the same way that a subtitle automatically moves closer to a title.\r\n\r\n### Proposed solution\r\n\r\n<!-- Which specific problem does this PR solve and how?  -->\r\n<!-- If it fixes a particular Issue, add \"Fixes #ISSUE_NUMBER\" in your title -->\r\nSome websites like to have things like bylines, post datetimes, or other things kept close to the post title area. This helper makes it easier to do this in Bulma without writing custom code.\r\n\r\nIt fixes Issue #2346, which I filed in February.\r\n\r\n### Tradeoffs\r\n\r\nThe way this is written, it shouldn't impact those who have already written custom code to do this same thing, so that's thankfully *not* a tradeoff here. I don't see any reason why it adds any significant tradeoffs, though, of course, for more specific use cases, some users will continue to create their own custom classes.\r\n<!-- What are the drawbacks of this solution? Are there alternative ones? -->\r\n<!-- Think of performance, build time, usability, complexity, coupling…) -->\r\n\r\n### Testing Done\r\n\r\nThe changes I've made are small, so they seem to work as intended.

Create a tile structure resembling this:\r\n```\r\ndiv class=\"tile is-ancestor\"\r\n  div class=\"tile is-parent\"\r\n    a href=\"#\" rel=\"Text\"\r\n      article class=\"tile is-child is-4 notification is-warning\"\r\n        p class=\"title\" Some text\r\n        p class=\"subtitle\" some text\r\n  div class=\"tile is-parent\"\r\n    a href=\"#\" rel=\"Text\"\r\n      article class=\"tile is-child is-4 notification is-info\"\r\n        p class=\"title\" Some other text\r\n        p class=\"subtitle\" some text\r\n  div class=\"tile is-parent\"\r\n    a href=\"#\" rel=\"Text\"\r\n      article class=\"tile is-child is-4 notification is-success\"\r\n        p class=\"title\" Even more text\r\n        p class=\"subtitle\" some text\r\n```\r\n2. Observe.\r\n\r\n### Expected behavior\r\n\r\nThe tiles will appear as expected, and also be functional links.\r\n\r\n### Actual behavior\r\n\r\nWhile having the appropriate y-coordinates that they otherwise should, the tiles fail to adhere to the specified default width, and the tiles shrink to fit around the content; the width specifically shrinks to fit around the widest character in the text, leaving each tile looking long and tall, like an unfurled banner. The heights of each tile no longer line up.\r\n\r\n### Commentary\r\n\r\nSwitch the \"is-4\" class from the .is-child divs to the .is-parent divs and observe the change in behavior. Note how while the tiles are still shrinking to fit around the content, it no longer appears strange as the tiles aren't shrinking on their x-axis.","Url":"https://github.com/jgthms/bulma/issues/2506","RelatedDescription":"Open issue \"0.7.5: Wrapping .tile.is-child in <a> element breaks tile width sizing, possibly the tiles entirely\" (#2506)"},{"Id":"449913532","IsPullRequest":false,"CreatedAt":"2019-05-29T16:44:54","Actor":"purrloftruth","Number":"2505","RawContent":null,"Title":"0.7.5: Tile gaps don't work unless each .is-child is wrapped in its own .is-parent, docs unclear","State":"open","Body":"<!-- PLEASE READ THE FOLLOWING INSTRUCTIONS -->\r\n\r\n<!-- Choose one of the following: -->\r\nThis is about **both Bulma and the Docs**.

However, in Bulma 0.7.5, each individual .tile.is-child needs to be housed within its own .tile.is-parent (where .is-vertical is not being used; it was not tested here and its effect here is currently unknown as it has as of yet been unnecessary for my project) for gaps to show up.\r\n\r\n### Steps to Reproduce\r\n\r\n1. Create a set of three tiles structured as such:\r\n```\r\n# .tile.is-ancestor\r\n|----# .tile.is-parent\r\n     |----# .tile.is-child is-4 notification is-warning\r\n          |----# p.title\r\n          |----# p.subtitle\r\n     |----# .tile.is-child is-4 notification is-warning\r\n          |----# p.title\r\n          |----# p.subtitle\r\n     |----# .tile.is-child is-4 notification is-warning\r\n          |----# p.title\r\n          |----# p.subtitle\r\n```\r\n2.
