Specifically, we'd like to have a proper way to control whether `preventDefault` is applied to C#-handled events.\r\n\r\nThe special case here is \"if you have a C# `onsubmit` handler, then call `preventDefault` on those events\". There's basically no way you *wouldn't* want to `preventDefault` those events, since (if async) the event handler would run *after* the default navigation event, which is totally useless. So I think the special case is OK as a stopgap measure.\r\n\r\nThe alternative could be that we say we're not changing the behavior, and people should explicitly put `type=\"button\"` on buttons inside forms. @rynowak @danroth27 let me know if you feel strongly either way.

trying to load image inside svg. \r\nI want my canvas based [clock component](https://lupusablazordemos.azurewebsites.net/) to rewrite on svg and compare results.\r\n\r\nI was generating svg tags inside blazor component, for now all tested svg elements are working properly, only image has problem.\r\n\r\nBlazor not displays expected image, in index.html it is loading normally, in index.cshtml not.\r\n\r\nFor test I tried this [example](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/SVG/Element/image#Example) from mozilla:\r\n```\r\n<svg width=200 height=200 \r\n
