Even under \"normal\" circumstances (when it's not 19 hours behind like today) it seems like I have to wait quite a long time for those counts to update. Even at a huge scale of a billion packages, maintaining a reasonably current and stable counter associated with each of them doesn't seem like it would be that hard of a problem to solve.\r\n\r\nI want to be as polite as possible here, and I don't think download stats are mission critical for anyone so I'm not suggesting this is red-hot, but isn't it possible there's a deeper architectural flaw or bottleneck, rather than some isolated incidents that are closed as soon as they appear to go away for the time being?

This is important sometimes because metadata may not always be available, or I may want it empty.\r\n\r\n## Detailed repro steps so we can see the same problem\r\n\r\n1. Create a project\r\n```xml\r\n<Project Sdk=\"Microsoft.NET.Sdk\">\r\n  <PropertyGroup>\r\n    <TargetFramework>netstandard2.0</TargetFramework>\r\n    <NuspecFile>repro.nuspec</NuspecFile>\r\n    <NuspecProperties>commithash=$(CommitHash)</NuspecProperties>\r\n  </PropertyGroup>\r\n</Project>\r\n```\r\n1. Create a nuspec like this:\r\n```xml\r\n<?xml version=\"1.0\" encoding=\"utf-8\"?>\r\n<package xmlns=\"http://schemas.microsoft.com/packaging/2012/06/nuspec.xsd\">\r\n  <metadata>\r\n    <id>repro</id>\r\n    <version>1.0.0</version>\r\n    <authors>repro</authors>\r\n    <description>Package from $commithash$</description>\r\n    <dependencies />\r\n    <repository type=\"git\"\r\n      url=\"http://github.com/NuGet\"\r\n      commit=\"$commithash$\" />\r\n  </metadata>\r\n  <files>\r\n    <file src=\"bin/Debug/netstandard2.0/repro.dll\" target=\"lib/netstandard2.0/repro.dll\" />\r\n  </files>\r\n</package>\r\n```\r\n2. `dotnet pack`\r\n\r\n## Expected\r\n\r\nEmpty values in NuspecProperties are okay. Let nuspec validation decide when something is required or not.\r\n\r\n## Actual\r\n\r\nPack fails with:\r\n\r\n> /Users/namc/.dotnet/sdk/2.1.300-preview2-008367/Sdks/NuGet.Build.Tasks.Pack/build/NuGet.Build.Tasks.Pack.targets(198,5): error : NuspecProperties should be in the form of \"key1=value1;key2=value2\".
