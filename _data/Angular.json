We deployed it months ago without any problem running ng build --configuration=production. We have IIS 10 (below I added it's configuration).\r\nNow, every time we need to do an update, we delete all deployed files and we copy new ones in site root. After this operation we start getting problems. Site doesn't load, we get black page with some errors (errors are described below)\r\nThis happens only in production environment. We have another server where we deploy app for testing before deploy to production, and here we have no problem. The difference between two environments is only the presence of a CDN in production one.\r\nAfter every deploy in production we also invalidate entire CDN cache.\r\n\r\n2.\r\nThis problem occurs in production but also on developer server where we don't have CDN. When we deploy an update (deleting all files in site root and then copying there new ones, we expect new version is loaded when user open site. Service workers should understand a new version has been deployed comparing its version with the new one through ngsw.json file, and finally \"install\" the correct version.\r\nThis happens only if a user delete browser cache or if user do a ctrl + f5. This doesn't happens with a simple page refresh. And this happens on every browser.\r\n\r\n## üî• Exception or Error\r\nError for problem 1:\r\n<pre><code>\r\nRefused to execute script from https://mysite/1.5960f4f...js/ because its MIME type (text/html/ is not executable, and strict MIME type checking is enabled\r\nand same error on other js files that are other modules files.\r\n</code></pre>\r\n\r\nError screenshot\r\n![Cattura](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/31180439/71763682-cfac1480-2ede-11ea-81fc-2ac3a0680364.JPG)\r\n\r\n## üåç  Your Environment\r\n\r\n**Angular Version:**\r\n<pre><code>\r\nAngular CLI: 7.3.9\r\nNode: 10.16.0\r\nOS: win32 x64\r\nAngular: 7.2.15\r\n... animations, common, compiler, compiler-cli, core, forms\r\n... http, language-service, platform-browser\r\n... platform-browser-dynamic, platform-server, router\r\n... service-worker\r\n\r\nPackage                           Version\r\n-----------------------------------------------------------\r\n@angular-devkit/architect         0.13.9\r\n@angular-devkit/build-angular     0.13.9\r\n@angular-devkit/build-optimizer   0.13.9\r\n@angular-devkit/build-webpack     0.13.9\r\n@angular-devkit/core              7.3.9\r\n@angular-devkit/schematics        7.3.9\r\n@angular/cdk                      7.3.7\r\n@angular/cli                      7.3.9\r\n@angular/material                 7.3.7\r\n@angular/pwa                      0.8.7\r\n@ngtools/webpack                  7.3.9\r\n@schematics/angular               0.8.7\r\n@schematics/update                0.13.9\r\nrxjs                              6.3.3\r\ntypescript                        3.1.6\r\nwebpack                           4.29.0\r\n</code></pre>\r\n\r\n**Anything else relevant?**\r\n\r\nThe site is under AWS CDN (CloudFront)\r\nCDN rules cache every image, js and css\r\n\r\nOur ngsw-config.json:\r\n<pre><code>\r\n{\r\n  \"index\": \"/index.html\",\r\n  \"assetGroups\": [\r\n    {\r\n      \"name\": \"app\",\r\n      \"installMode\": \"prefetch\",\r\n      \"resources\": {\r\n        \"files\": [\r\n          \"/favicon.ico\",\r\n          \"/index.html\",\r\n          \"/*.css\",\r\n          \"/*.js\",\r\n          \"/*.(woff2)\"\r\n        ]\r\n      }\r\n    }, {\r\n      \"name\": \"assets\",\r\n      \"installMode\": \"lazy\",\r\n      \"updateMode\": \"prefetch\",\r\n      \"resources\": {\r\n        \"files\": [\r\n          \"/assets/**\",\r\n          \"/*.(eot|svg|cur|jpg|png|webp|gif|otf|ttf|woff|ani)\"\r\n        ]\r\n      }\r\n    }\r\n  ]\r\n}\r\n</code></pre>\r\n\r\nOur index.html:\r\n```xml\r\n<!doctype html>\r\n<html lang=\"it\">\r\n\r\n<head>\r\n    <meta http-equiv=\"X-UA-Compatible\" content=\"IE=edge\" />\r\n    <style>\r\n        .async-hide {\r\n            opacity: 0 !important\r\n        }\r\n    </style>\r\n    <script>(function (a, s, y, n, c, h, i, d, e) {\r\n            s.className += ' ' + y;

All styling bindings ere executed in compiled order and than a linked list of bindings is created in priority order.\r\n- Flush the style bindings at the end of `advance()` instruction. This implies that there are two flush events. One at the end of template `advance` instruction in the template. Second one at the end of `hostBindings` `advance` instruction when processing host bindings (if any).\r\n- Each binding instructions effectively updates the string to represent the string at that location. Because most of the bindings are additive, this is a cheap strategy in most cases. In rare cases the strategy requires removing tokens from the styling up to this point. (We expect that to be rare case) Because, the bindings are presorted in the order of priority, it is safe to resume the processing of the concatenated string from the last change binding.\r\n\r\n## PR Checklist\r\nPlease check if your PR fulfills the following requirements:\r\n\r\n- [ ] The commit message follows our guidelines: https://github.com/angular/angular/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md#commit\r\n- [ ] Tests for the changes have been added (for bug fixes / features)\r\n- [ ] Docs have been added / updated (for bug fixes / features)\r\n\r\n\r\n## PR Type\r\nWhat kind of change does this PR introduce?\r\n\r\n<!-- Please check the one that applies to this PR using \"x\". -->\r\n\r\n- [x] Bugfix\r\n- [ ] Feature\r\n- [ ] Code style update (formatting, local variables)\r\n- [x] Refactoring (no functional changes, no api changes)\r\n- [ ] Build related changes\r\n- [ ] CI related changes\r\n- [ ] Documentation content changes\r\n- [ ] angular.io application / infrastructure changes\r\n- [ ] Other...

For example:\r\n\r\n```\r\nclass WordCount extends HTMLParagraphElement {\r\n  ...\r\n}\r\ncustomElements.define('word-count', WordCount, { extends: 'p' });\r\n```\r\n\r\ncan be invoked in HTML as:\r\n\r\n```\r\n<p is=\"word-count\"></p>\r\n```\r\n\r\nHowever, this will not work with angular elements since the `createCustomElement` method, by design, generates a custom element that extends from `HTMLElement`.\r\n\r\n### Describe the solution you'd like\r\nI am requesting the ability to pass a base class to `createCustomElement` to support extending other elements.  Possible API:\r\n\r\n```\r\nconst WordCount= createCustomElement(WordCountComponent, {injector, extends: HTMLParagraphElement});\r\ncustomElements.define('word-count', WordCount, { extends: 'p' });\r\n```\r\n\r\n### Describe alternatives you've considered\r\nFor the most part extending `HTMLElement` is fine for most components.

The subshell means I'm returned back to my original directory.\r\n\r\nThis pattern does not play well with `ng version` and `ng update`.

My mistake here was running `ng version` in the root of my monorepo, rather than the Angular project. After noticing this I tried:\r\n\r\n```shell\r\n$ (cd services/ng-frontend/ && ng version)\r\n     _                      _                 ____ _     ___\r\n    / \\   _ __   __ _ _   _| | __ _ _ __     / ___| |   |_ _|\r\n   / ‚ñ≥ \\ | '_ \\ / _` | | | | |/ _` | '__|   | |   | |    | |\r\n  / ___ \\| | | | (_| | |_| | | (_| | |      | |___| |___ | |\r\n /_/   \\_\\_| |_|\\__, |\\__,_|_|\\__,_|_|       \\____|_____|___|\r\n                |___/\r\n    \r\n\r\nAngular CLI: 9.0.0-rc.7\r\nNode: 13.5.0\r\nOS: linux x64\r\n\r\nAngular: 9.0.0-rc.7\r\n... animations, cli, common, compiler, compiler-cli, core, forms\r\n... language-service, platform-browser, platform-browser-dynamic\r\n... router\r\nIvy Workspace: Yes\r\n\r\nPackage                           Version\r\n-----------------------------------------------------------\r\n@angular-devkit/architect         0.900.0-rc.7\r\n@angular-devkit/build-angular     0.900.0-rc.7\r\n@angular-devkit/build-optimizer   0.900.0-rc.7\r\n@angular-devkit/build-webpack     0.900.0-rc.7\r\n@angular-devkit/core              9.0.0-rc.7\r\n@angular-devkit/schematics        9.0.0-rc.7\r\n@ngtools/webpack                  9.0.0-rc.7\r\n@schematics/angular               9.0.0-rc.7\r\n@schematics/update                0.900.0-rc.7\r\nrxjs                              6.5.4\r\ntypescript                        3.6.4\r\nwebpack                           4.41.2\r\n```\r\n\r\nWhich is what I expected post-update.\r\n\r\nIMHO this dichotomy is confusing. When the user is in an Angular project, it lists versions of that project. When outside an Angular project, it lists the global versions and it is very easy to look at the wrong one.\r\n\r\nI'm not sure what the ideal solution to this problem would be.

What I want is simple - remove a bunch of \"this.logger.info\" statements from the production build. Try as I might to convince uglify-js & co to do this, I failed (this was all so easy in closure-compiler... sigh). So the solution was to use string-replace-loader to just replace those statements with 0's before anything else happened. While this is not perfect, it works for us.\r\n\r\nHowever starting with Angular 9 (with Ivy enabled, in case it matters), this no longer works as before. I have to flip the order of the loaders, and then it works fine again. I believe this points to a deeper issue though, hence this report.\r\n\r\n## üî¨ Minimal Reproduction\r\n\r\nIn the prod build (which inherits some common thing), we have:\r\n\r\n<pre><code>\r\ncommonConfig.module.rules.push({ test: /\\.ts$/, use: [\r\n  {\r\n    loader: '@ngtools/webpack'\r\n  },\r\n  {\r\n    loader: 'string-replace-loader',\r\n    options: {\r\n      search: 'this\\\\.logger\\\\.(trace|debug|info)\\\\s*\\\\([^()]*\\\\)\\s*;',\r\n      replace: '0;',\r\n      flags: 'sg',\r\n    }\r\n  }\r\n] })\r\n</code></pre>\r\n\r\nThis works fine with Angular 8.1.2, but I have to flip the order of those two loaders for Angular 9.0.0.rc-7. If I flip the order with Angular 8, I end up with a bunch of _0's, because there's some transform that has already converted this -> _this (presumably tsc, invoked by @ngtools/webpack). However in Angular 9.0.0.rc-7, the string-replace-loader ends up doing nothing, all the logs are in the resulting output. Flipping the order to make it come after @ngtools/webpack, however, causes it to get rid of the logger.info's as expected.\r\n\r\nI would have expected the original thing to be correct, based on my understanding of loader chaining.","Url":"https://github.com/angular/angular-cli/issues/16544","RelatedDescription":"Open issue \"Ordering issue between @ngtools/webpack + other loader\" (#16544)"}],"ResultType":"GitHubIssue"},"material2-Issues":{"Issues":[{"Id":"545296438","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2020-01-04T15:21:12","Actor":"crisbeto","Number":"18104","RawContent":null,"Title":"fix(slide-toggle): fix and simplify high contrast styles","State":"open","Body":"Fixes the slide toggle high contrast styles which seem to have broken after we changed the mixin from producing a media query to a class.

Feature targeting for \"density\" mixins. We don't want to include the default density in the non-partial files. We want to maintain the component-specific density styles in separate partial files.\r\n   * MDC inconsistently includes the default density in the `without-ripple` mixins \r\n   * We need to have a dedicated density mixin anyway, so that developers can override density per component. Hence it would make sense to have a single place for the density per component.\r\n2. Ripples which do not have a hard-coded radius. We can achieve this by using `border-radius` on the ripple container. `MatRipple` will automatically calculate the needed radius.\r\n   * We use this pattern in a few non-MDC based components.. but the calculation is **flawed**. This is because it looks for the furthest edge in the ripple container, but does not respect the border radius. Hence ripple animations appear faster than configured.\r\n3. Ways to add custom density calculations. We do not always use building blocks provided by MDC (e.g. tabs-bar). This seems to be already possible with the current MDC density package.\r\n\r\nThis prototype intends a single partial file for density and color styles (potentially also typography; though typography styles are minimal most of the time). \r\n\r\n* The density and color styles are combined in the component `theme` mixin. That way, developers have the possibility to overwrite density on a per-component basis (without repeating unrelated styles).\r\n* The component theme includes density because by default, density styles are not included in the component styles. Density needs to be configurable and cannot be part of non-partial Sass files.\r\n* Allows developers to configure the default density without needing to add additional CSS overrides that activate the desired default density.\r\n\r\nWe include density in the `theme` to avoid breaking changes where developers need to manually setup default density styles for components. Instead, only setting up a theme is required. Though, we still provide _all_ the flexibility to fine-grain overwrite density or to simply specify a default scale for all components.","Url":"https://github.com/angular/components/pull/18096","RelatedDescription":"Open PR \"[prototype] feat: add support for density scaling in MDC based components\" (#18096)"},{"Id":"545014196","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2020-01-03T14:24:59","Actor":"crisbeto","Number":"18095","RawContent":null,"Title":"fix(chips): avoid accidental form submits when pressing remove button","State":"open","Body":"Sets a `type` on chip remove button so that parent forms don't get submitted by accident.","Url":"https://github.com/angular/components/pull/18095","RelatedDescription":"Open PR \"fix(chips): avoid accidental form submits when pressing remove button\" (#18095)"},{"Id":"544991827","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2020-01-03T13:24:19","Actor":"crisbeto","Number":"18094","RawContent":null,"Title":"fix(datepicker): re-render calendar when locale changes","State":"open","Body":"Fixes the different calendar views not being re-rendered when the locale is changed.

I'm using @ngx-translate for this. Below is a crude example using two locales (English and Norwegian):\r\n\r\n    this.translate.onLangChange.subscribe(lng => {\r\n      this.dateAdapter.getFirstDayOfWeek = () => (lng === 'en' ? 0 : 1);\r\n      this.dateAdapter.setLocale(lang === 'en' ? 'en-US' : 'nb');\r\n    });\r\n\r\nThe calendar object is rendered inside a mat-menu, and does not destruct when the menu is closed - only hidden. \r\n\r\n    <mat-menu #dialog=\"matMenu\">\r\n      <mat-calendar cdkTrapFocus\r\n          [startAt]=\"value\" \r\n          [minDate]=\"min\" \r\n          [maxDate]=\"max\" \r\n          [selected]=\"value\" \r\n          (selectedChange)=\"select($event)\">\r\n      </mat-calendar>\r\n    </mat-menu>\r\n\r\nSo initially, when the application starts, the locale and first day of week is set to whatever the default language is at that point (set from browsers default language). But after user initiated language change, any change I do to the dateAdapter has no effect on the currently rendered mat-calendar. \r\n\r\nI would like a way to trigger a re-render of the calendar using the current settings, and I had hoped that setting the locale would trigger this.\r\n\r\n#### Workaround\r\n\r\nI've worked around this by adding a `*ngIf=\"_reload\"` to the `<mat-calendar`, and then toggling the `reload` in order to destroy the calendar and recreate it:\r\n\r\n    this.translate.onLangChange.subscribe(lang => {\r\n      setTimeout(() => this._reload = false );\r\n      setTimeout(() => this._reload = true );\r\n    });\r\n\r\nBut this seems to be a hack.

Also I think it would be\r\nout of scope for `ng add` to handle potential scenarios of non-matching CDK installations.\r\n\r\nFixes #18020","Url":"https://github.com/angular/components/pull/18076","RelatedDescription":"Open PR \"fix(material): ng-add should always install matching CDK version\" (#18076)"},{"Id":"544146320","IsPullRequest":false,"CreatedAt":"2019-12-31T10:01:12","Actor":"olliekrk","Number":"18075","RawContent":null,"Title":"mat-datepicker is unaware of timezones","State":"open","Body":"#### Bug, feature request, or proposal:\r\n\r\nThis is a feature request.\r\n\r\n#### What is the current behavior?\r\n\r\nCurrently mat-datepicker has no option to set the timezone, therefore currently selected date which is placed in a circle is always in system timezone.\r\n\r\n#### What is the use-case or motivation for changing an existing behavior?\r\n\r\nI would like to use mat-datepicker which is aware of currently selected timezone in my app.","Url":"https://github.com/angular/components/issues/18075","RelatedDescription":"Open issue \"mat-datepicker is unaware of timezones\" (#18075)"},{"Id":"544288043","IsPullRequest":false,"CreatedAt":"2019-12-30T14:54:19","Actor":"ansonfoong","Number":"18079","RawContent":null,"Title":"menu: icon doesn't work in a navbar component ","State":"open","Body":"Yes, I do have the MatIconModule in my app.module.ts, Menu icon works in my other component but for some reason not in my Navbar Component.\r\n\r\nThis is app.component.html\r\n\r\n```\r\n<mat-sidenav-container class=\"example-container\" [hasBackdrop]=\"true\">\r\n  <mat-sidenav #sidenav mode=\"over\">\r\n    <div class=\"menu-top\">\r\n      <button mat-flat-button [autofocus]=\"false\" (click)=\"sidenav.toggle()\" class=\"close-btn-icon\">\r\n        <mat-icon>close</mat-icon>\r\n      </button>\r\n    </div>\r\n    <ul class=\"side-navbar\">\r\n      <li *ngFor=\"let link of links\" [routerLink]=\"link.url\" [ngClass]=\"{'active-route' : currentPath === link.url }\" (click)=\"sidenav.close()\">\r\n        {{link.name}}\r\n      </li>\r\n    </ul>\r\n  </mat-sidenav>\r\n  <mat-sidenav-content>\r\n<!-- Old Toolbar but menu icon works\r\n<mat-toolbar color=\"primary\">\r\n      <button mat-icon-button class=\"menu-button\" (click)=\"sidenav.toggle()\">\r\n        <mat-icon>menu</mat-icon>\r\n      </button>\r\n      <span class=\"example-fill-remaining-space\"></span>\r\n      <span *ngIf=\"name\">Welcome back, {{name}}</span>\r\n    </mat-toolbar> --> \r\n    <app-navbar></app-navbar>\r\n    <router-outlet></router-outlet>\r\n  </mat-sidenav-content>\r\n</mat-sidenav-container>\r\n```\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nand this is the app-navbar component\r\n```\r\n<mat-toolbar color=\"primary\">\r\n    <mat-icon>menu</mat-icon>\r\n    <span>Welcome Back, {{name}}!</span>\r\n    <span class=\"fill\"></span>\r\n    <nav>\r\n        <span *ngFor=\"let route of routes\">\r\n            <a [routerLink]=\"route.url\">{{route.name}}</a>\r\n        </span>\r\n    </nav>\r\n</mat-toolbar>\r\n```\r\n\r\nAs you can see the Navbar is a component of app, in the app component the menu icon works but in the Navbar it doesnt.
