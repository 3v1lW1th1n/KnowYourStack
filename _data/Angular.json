Additional checks to avoid recompilation were introduced in one of the previous commits (0244a2433e2d7009d98bc589899edcd5b1fa003f), but there were still some corner cases that required attention. In order to support the necessary logic better, Ivy TestBed was rewritten/refactored. Main results of this rewrite are:\r\n\r\n* no recompilation for Components/Directives/Pipes without overrides\r\n* the logic to restore state between tests (isolate tests) was improved\r\n* transitive scopes calculation no longer performs recompilation (it works with compiled defs)\r\n\r\nAs a result of these changes we see reduction in memory consumption (3.5-4x improvement) and performance increase (4-4.5x improvement).\r\n\r\nThis work is a join effort of @alxhub (thanks Alex!) and myself.\r\n\r\nThis PR resolves FW-1178.\r\n\r\n## PR Checklist\r\nPlease check if your PR fulfills the following requirements:\r\n\r\n- [ ] The commit message follows our guidelines: https://github.com/angular/angular/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md#commit\r\n- [ ] Tests for the changes have been added (for bug fixes / features)\r\n- [ ] Docs have been added / updated (for bug fixes / features)\r\n\r\n\r\n## PR Type\r\nWhat kind of change does this PR introduce?\r\n\r\n<!-- Please check the one that applies to this PR using \"x\". -->\r\n\r\n- [ ] Bugfix\r\n- [ ] Feature\r\n- [ ] Code style update (formatting, local variables)\r\n- [ ] Refactoring (no functional changes, no api changes)\r\n- [ ] Build related changes\r\n- [ ] CI related changes\r\n- [ ] Documentation content changes\r\n- [ ] angular.io application / infrastructure changes\r\n- [ ] Other...

Put `DummyService` in `providers` list of the root component, `AppComponent` . \r\n4. The the DummyService also can be injected into `OrdersModule` belong to lazy-loaded module `OrdersModule`\r\n5. check the console log\r\n```\r\n🐌🐌🐌 Dummy (1553284472555) created without parent\r\n🍅🍅🍅 Dummy (1553284472555) injected into AppComponent\r\n🍅🍅🍅 Dummy (1553284472555) injected into OrderListComponent\r\n```\r\nSo, the instance of DummyService was created by the Injector of root component `AppComponent` and also re-used by `OrderListComponent` which belongs to a lazy-loaded module. The behavior is different with description in the doc.\r\n\r\n### Expected vs Actual Behavior**\r\n<!-- If applicable please describe the difference between the expected and actual behavior after following the repro steps. -->\r\n<!-- ✍️edit:-->\r\n\r\n\r\n## 📷Screenshot\r\n<!-- Often a screenshot can help to capture the issue better than a long description. -->\r\n<!-- ✍️upload a screenshot:-->\r\n\r\n\r\n## 🔥 Exception or Error\r\n<pre><code>\r\n<!-- If the issue is accompanied by an exception or an error, please share it below: -->\r\n<!-- ✍️-->\r\n\r\n</code></pre>\r\n\r\n\r\n## 🌍  Your Environment\r\nAngular CLI: 7.3.5\r\nNode: 10.15.1\r\nOS: win32 x64\r\nAngular: 7.2.9\r\n... animations, common, compiler, compiler-cli, core, forms\r\n... http, platform-browser, platform-browser-dynamic\r\n... platform-server, router, upgrade\r\n\r\nPackage                           Version\r\n-----------------------------------------------------------\r\n@angular-devkit/architect         0.13.5\r\n@angular-devkit/build-angular     0.13.5\r\n@angular-devkit/build-optimizer   0.13.5\r\n@angular-devkit/build-webpack     0.13.5\r\n@angular-devkit/core              7.3.5\r\n@angular-devkit/schematics        7.3.5\r\n@angular/cli                      7.3.5\r\n@ngtools/webpack                  7.3.5\r\n@schematics/angular               7.3.5\r\n@schematics/update                0.13.5\r\nrxjs                              6.4.0\r\ntypescript                        3.1.6\r\nwebpack                           4.29.0\r\n\r\n\r\n### Browser info\r\n<!-- ✍️Is this a browser specific issue?

I can make it work though by reassigning my *ngTemplateOutlet to a second (non-sensical) template and then switch back to my original template. Then both places are filled with the desired content.

Create a new project using `ng new`.  \r\n2. Create two components `ng g c app/components/home` `ng g c app/components/feature`.  \r\n3. Make a copy of app.module.ts file and name it app.module.prod.ts file.   \r\n4. Remove `import { FeatureComponent } from './app/components/feature/feature.component';` from app.module.prod.ts.  Reason is feature component is not needed in production.  \r\n5.

In order to do this cleanly, and without namespace conflicts/races, we give each of these applications their own base-href, as follows:\r\n\r\n```\r\nng build\r\n    --configuration=staging\r\n    --output-path=./dist-e2e\r\n    --base-href=/ci-cd-draft-build-${JOB_NUMBER}/\r\n```\r\n\r\nThis is then uploaded to S3, and tested as follows:\r\n```\r\nng e2e --baseUrl=https://<s3-bucket>/ci-cd-draft-build-${JOB_NUMBER}/\r\n```\r\nWe also use these draft builds to perform Beta feature usability tests, product demos, and a variety of other activities that are greatly enhanced by having a fully functioning UI. Similarly, we publish whitelabel UI's for our customers, which we also run protractor-driven acceptance tests against, and whose base-url's vary greatly.\r\n\r\nJust now, I noticed this message:\r\n```\r\nOption \"baseUrl\" is deprecated: Use \"baseUrl\" in the Protractor config file instead.\r\n```\r\nWhich I traced to the following entry in the protractor schematic.\r\n```\r\n    \"baseUrl\": {\r\n      \"type\": \"string\",\r\n      \"description\": \"Base URL for protractor to connect to.\",\r\n      \"x-deprecated\": \"Use \\\"baseUrl\\\" in the Protractor config file instead.\"\r\n    }\r\n```\r\nAs our `buildUrl` value is not known ahead of time, we cannot easily use the protractor config file; while we could attempt to inject it via some form of environment parameter, modifying environment parameters is more cumbersome than adding a commandline flag.\r\n\r\n### Describe the solution you'd like\r\nWe do not want this flag to be removed. It's not harming anyone, why is it being removed?\r\n\r\n### Describe alternatives you've considered\r\nWriting a configuration file for CI/CD, for every customer, environment, and build target we have. This will litter our project with config files, and we'd really like to avoid that.\r\n","Url":"https://github.com/angular/angular-cli/issues/13952","RelatedDescription":"Open issue \"`baseUrl` flag

I believe the best would be for this to instead convert the pixels to 'rem'. \r\n\r\nRem is very important when it comes to accessibility concerns. If the user goes to the browser settings and changes the font size to very large the text in the application should scale accordingly.\r\n\r\nAs 'rem' is much stronger than pixels when it comes to accessibility I am a bit surprised this is not implemented in this manner. I believe this change would only make a positive impact, currently I am in the debate of using this because of this problem as we will be then failing some accessibility guidelines. \r\n\r\n#### What is the expected behavior?\r\nThe text in the application after using Angular's Typography should be converting pixels provided to rem for accessibility for when the user goes to adjust the browsers font size from medium (default) to another such as large.\r\n\r\n#### What is the current behavior?\r\nAngular Typography uses pixels. This prevents the application font-size from scaling when the user has trouble seeing and wishes to scale the font size up through the browser.\r\n\r\n#### What are the steps to reproduce?\r\n 1. Create new Angular Application\r\n 2. Add Angular Material Typography to the application with default values provided by the Angular guide [here](https://material.angular.io/guide/typography)\r\n 3. In your app components html add a simple h1 with typography class added:\r\n    <h1 class=\"mat-display-1\">Header Text For Testing<h1 class=\"mat-display-1\">\r\n 4.

At one point, you may find that it is better for maintainability if each tab was its own component so you do not need to have one giant component with every piece of data that may show up across any of the tabs.\r\n\r\nThis is also better if, for example, each tab fetches data from a different source and you'd like to delay that network call until navigating to the tab (although [lazy-loading](https://material.angular.io/components/tabs/overview#lazy-loading) may handle that as well).\r\n\r\nAlso, in a lot of cases, it would be more ideal to be able to deep link into a given tab by using a `<router-outlet>`, which is why `mat-tab-nav-bar` seems like a good fit for something like this.\r\n\r\n#### Is there anything else we should know?\r\n\r\nA work around may be to build separate components, have those components be within each `<mat-tab>`, and then manually wire up the active tab state in the router via query string or route params. However, it looks like `mat-tab-nav-bar` was built specifically for this use-case, so it may be worth just baking the functionality into `mat-tab-nav-bar`.","Url":"https://github.com/angular/material2/issues/15570","RelatedDescription":"Open issue \"[Tabs] Slide animation for mat-tab-nav-bar\" (#15570)"},{"Id":"423508982","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2019-03-21T20:51:22","Actor":"devversion","Number":"15557","RawContent":null,"Title":"build: serve ivy dev-app with lazy loading ","State":"closed","Body":"* Updates the Ivy script/build pipeline to support lazy-loading with the dev-app.\r\n* Removes duplicate lazy routes (otherwise causes error within rollup; to be in sync: #15558)\r\n* Ensures Ivy Angular install script ensures clean Ivy packages are installed\r\n* Ensures Ivy `build.sh` script works if Gulp is not installed globally.","Url":"https://github.com/angular/material2/pull/15557","RelatedDescription":"Closed or merged PR \"build: serve ivy dev-app with lazy loading \" (#15557)"},{"Id":"423918448","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2019-03-21T20:06:46","Actor":"crisbeto","Number":"15567","RawContent":null,"Title":"fix(sidenav): some internal subjects not being completed","State":"open","Body":"Fixes a couple of internal subjects not being completed in MatDrawer and MatDrawerContainer.","Url":"https://github.com/angular/material2/pull/15567","RelatedDescription":"Open PR \"fix(sidenav): some internal subjects not being completed\" (#15567)"},{"Id":"423911022","IsPullRequest":false,"CreatedAt":"2019-03-21T19:47:04","Actor":"itslenny","Number":"15566","RawContent":null,"Title":"Click animations sometimes fire without firing click event","State":"open","Body":"\r\nOccasionally, I'll click a button, tab, etc and see the animation fire, but the click event doesn't fire.\r\n\r\nThis causes an obviously broken feeling experience.
