This advisory also provides guidance on what developers can do to update their applications correctly.\r\n\r\nMicrosoft is aware of a security vulnerability in some public versions of ASP.NET Core where Cross-Origin Resource Sharing (CORS) can be bypassed, leading to information disclosure.\r\n\r\n## Discussion\r\n\r\nPlease use **** TODO: FILL IN ISSUE LINK *** for discussion of this advisory.\r\n\r\n### Mitigation Factors\r\nASP.NET Core applications using version 2.0.0 or higher are not vulnerable.\r\n\r\n## Affected Software\r\nThe vulnerabilities affect any Microsoft ASP.NET Core project if it uses the following affected package versions.\r\n\r\nPackage name | Package versions | Fixed package versions\r\n---------------- | ------------------- | -------------------------\r\nMicrosoft.AspNetCore.Mvc.Core | 1.0.0, 1.0.1, 1.0.2, 1.0.3, 1.0.4, 1.0.5<br />1.1.0, 1.1.1, 1.1.2 ,1.1.3, 1.1.4 |  1.0.6<br />1.1.5\r\nMicrosoft.AspNetCore.Mvc.Cors | 1.0.0, 1.0.1, 1.0.2, 1.0.3, 1.0.4, 1.0.5<br />1.1.0, 1.1.1, 1.1.2 ,1.1.3, 1.1.4 |  1.0.6<br />1.1.5\r\n\r\n## Advisory FAQ\r\n### How do I know if I am affected? \r\n\r\n.NET Core and ASP.NET Core have two types of dependencies: direct and transitive. If your project has a direct or transitive dependency on any of the packages and versions listed above, you are affected.\r\nNote: As part of patching ASP.NET Core MVC we update every Microsoft.AspNetCore.Mvc.* package. If, for example, you have a dependency on `Microsoft.AspNetCore.Mvc` you should update to the appropriate version first (1.0.x should be updated to 1.0.4, 1.1.x should be updated to 1.1.3), and it will also update any other vulnerable ` Microsoft.AspNetCore.Mvc` dependency.\r\n\r\n### NET Core Project formats\r\n.NET Core has two different project file formats, depending on what software created the project. \r\n\r\n1. `project.json` is the format used in .NET Core 1.0 and Microsoft Visual Studio 2015.\r\n2. `csproj` is the format used in .NET Core 1.1 and Microsoft Visual Studio 2017.  \r\n\t\r\nYou must ensure you follow the correct update instructions for your project type.\r\n\r\n### Direct Dependencies\r\nDirect dependencies are dependencies where you specifically add a package to your project. For example, if you add the `Microsoft.AspNetCore.Mvc` package to your project then you have taken a direct dependency on` Microsoft.AspNetCore.Mvc`.\r\n\r\nDirect dependencies are discoverable by reviewing your `project.json` or `csproj` file.\r\n\r\n### Transitive Dependencies\r\nTransitive dependencies occur when you add a package to your project that in turn relies on another package. For example, if you add the `Microsoft.AspNetCore.Mvc` package to your project it depends on the `Microsoft.AspNetCore.Mvc.Core` package (among others). Your project has a direct dependency on `Microsoft.AspNetCore.Mvc` and a transitive dependency on the `Microsoft.AspNetCore.Mvc.Core` package.\r\nTransitive dependencies are reviewable in the Visual Studio Solution Explorer window, which supports searching, or by reviewing the `project.lock.json` file contained in the root directory of your project for `project.json` projects or the `project.assets.json` file contained in the obj directory of your project for `csproj` projects. These files are the authoritative list of all packages used by your project, containing both direct and transitive dependencies.\r\n\r\n## How do I fix my affected application?\r\nYou will need to fix both direct dependencies and review and fix any transitive dependencies. The affected packages and versions in the previous “Affected Software” section include each vulnerable package, the vulnerable versions, and the patched versions\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n**Note**: If you are using ASP.NET Core MVC in your projects you should first update the `Microsoft.AspNetCore.Mvc` version to the fixed version in the table above. If you are currently using version 1.0.0, 1.0.1, 1.0.2, 1.0.3, 1.0.4 or 1.0.5  you should update your package version to 1.0.6. If you are using version 1.1.0, 1.1.1, 1.1.2, 1.1.3 or 1.1.4 you should update your package version to 1.1.5. This will update every MVC package to the fixed versions.\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n### Fixing Direct Dependencies – project.json/VS2015\r\nOpen your `project.json` file in your editor. Look for the dependencies section. Below is an example dependencies section:\r\n\r\n``` json\r\n    \"dependencies\": {\r\n      \"Microsoft.NETCore.App\": {\r\n        \"version\": \"1.0.1\",\r\n        \"type\": \"platform\"\r\n      },\r\n     \"Microsoft.AspNetCore.Server.Kestrel\": \"1.0.1\",\r\n     \"Microsoft.AspNetCore.Mvc.Core \": \"1.0.1\",\r\n    }\r\n```\r\nThis example has three direct dependencies: `Microsoft.NETCore.App`, `Microsoft.AspNetCore.Server.Kestrel` and `Microsoft.AspNetCore.Mvc.Core`. \r\n\r\n`Microsoft.NetCore.App` is the platform the application targets, you should ignore this. The other packages expose their version to the right of the package name. In our example, our non-platform packages are version 1.0.1.\r\n\r\nReview your direct dependencies for any instance of the packages and versions listed above. In the example above, there is a direct dependency on the vulnerable package, `Microsoft.AspNetCore.Mvc.Core` version 1.0.1.\r\n\r\nTo update to the fixed package, change the version number to be the appropriate package for your release. In the example, this would be updating `Microsoft.AspNetCore.Mvc.Core` to 1.0.6.\r\n\r\nAfter updating the vulnerable package versions, save your `project.json` file.\r\n\r\nThe dependencies section in our example `project.json` would now look as follows:\r\n\r\n```json\r\n  \"dependencies\": {\r\n    \"Microsoft.NETCore.App\": {\r\n      \"version\": \"1.0.1\",\r\n      \"type\": \"platform\"\r\n    },\r\n    \"Microsoft.AspNetCore.Server.Kestrel\": \"1.0.1\",\r\n    \"Microsoft.AspNetCore.Mvc.Core\": \"1.0.6\",     \r\n  }\r\n```\r\n\r\nIf you are using Visual Studio and save your updated `project.json` file, Visual Studio will restore the new package version. You can see the restore results by opening the Output Window (Ctrl+Alt+O) and changing the Show output from drop-down list to Package Manager.\r\n\r\nIf you are not using Visual Studio, open a command line and change to your project directory. Execute the `dotnet restore` command to restore your new dependency.\r\n\r\nAfter you have addressed all of your direct dependencies, you must also review your transitive dependencies.\r\n\r\n### Fixing Direct Dependencies – csproj/VS2017\r\nOpen your `projectname.csproj` file in your editor, or right click the project in Visual Studio 2017 and choose `Edit projectname.csproj` from the content menu, where projectname is the name of your project. Look for `PackageReference` nodes. The following shows an example project file:\r\n\r\n``` XML\r\n<Project Sdk=\"Microsoft.NET.Sdk.Web\">\r\n  <PropertyGroup>\r\n    <TargetFramework>netcoreapp1.1</TargetFramework>\r\n  </PropertyGroup>\r\n  <PropertyGroup>\r\n    <PackageTargetFallback>$(PackageTargetFallback);portable-net45+win8+wp8+wpa81;</PackageTargetFallback>\r\n  </PropertyGroup>\r\n  <ItemGroup>\r\n    <PackageReference Include=\"Microsoft.AspNetCore.Mvc.Core\" Version=\"1.1.3\" />\r\n  </ItemGroup>\r\n  <ItemGroup>\r\n    <DotNetCliToolReference Include=\"Microsoft.VisualStudio.Web.CodeGeneration.Tools\" Version=\"1.0.0 \" />\r\n  </ItemGroup>\r\n</Project>\r\n```\r\n\r\nThe example has a single direct dependency, as seen by the `PackageReference` element. The name of the package is in the Include attribute, and the package version number is in the Version attribute that is exposed to the right of the package name. The example shows a single package `Microsoft.AspNetCore.Mvc.Core` version 1.1.5.\r\n\r\nReview your `PackageReference` elements for any instance of the packages and versions listed above. In the example above, there is a direct dependency on the vulnerable package, `Microsoft.AspNetCore.Mvc.Core` version 1.1.3.\r\n\r\nTo update to the fixed package, change the version number to the appropriate package for your release. In the example, this would be updating `Microsoft.AspNetCore.Mvc.Cors` to 1.1.5.\r\n\r\nAfter updating the vulnerable package version, save your `csproj` file. The example `csproj` would now look as follows:\r\n\r\n``` XML\r\n<Project Sdk=\"Microsoft.NET.Sdk.Web\">\r\n  <PropertyGroup>\r\n    <TargetFramework>netcoreapp1.1</TargetFramework>\r\n  </PropertyGroup>\r\n  <PropertyGroup>\r\n    <PackageTargetFallback>$(PackageTargetFallback);portable-net45+win8+wp8+wpa81;</PackageTargetFallback>\r\n  </PropertyGroup>\r\n  <ItemGroup>\r\n    <PackageReference Include=\"Microsoft.AspNetCore.Mvc.Core\" Version=\"1.1.5\" />\r\n  </ItemGroup>\r\n  <ItemGroup>\r\n    <DotNetCliToolReference Include=\"Microsoft.VisualStudio.Web.CodeGeneration.Tools\" Version=\"1.0.0 \" />\r\n  </ItemGroup>\r\n</Project>\r\n```\r\n\r\nIf you are using Visual Studio and save your updated `csproj` file, Visual Studio will restore the new package version. You can see the restore results by opening the Output Window (Ctrl+Alt+O) and changing the Show output from drop-down list to Package Manager.\r\n\r\nIf you are not using Visual Studio open a command line and change to your project directory. Execute the `dotnet restore` command to restore your new dependency.\r\n\r\n### After updating your direct dependencies\r\n\r\nRecompile your application.\r\n\r\nIf after recompilation you see a Dependency conflict warning, you must update your other direct dependencies to the appropriate version. \r\n\r\nFor example if your project refers to `Microsoft.AspNetCore.Mvc.Cors` with a version number of 1.0.1 when you update your `Microsoft.AspNetCore.Mvc` package to 1.0.6, compilation will throw:\r\n\r\n`NU1012      Dependency conflict. Microsoft.AspNetCore.Mvc.Core 1.0.6 expected Microsoft.AspNetCore.Mvc.Cors >= 1.0.6 but received 1.0.1`\r\n\r\nTo fix this, edit the version for the expected package to be the version expected by updating your `csproj` or `project.json` in the same way that you used to update the vulnerable package versions.\r\n\r\nAfter you have addressed all of your direct dependencies, you must also review your transitive dependencies.\r\n\r\n### Reviewing Transitive Dependencies \r\n\r\nThere are two ways to view transitive dependencies. You can either use Visual Studio’s Solution Explorer, or you can review your `project.lock.json` (project.json/VS2015) or `project.assets.json` (csproj/VS2017) file.\r\n\r\n#### Using Visual Studio Solution Explorer (VS2015)\r\nIf you want to use Visual Studio 2015, open your project in Visual Studio 2015 and then press Ctrl+; to activate the search in Solution Explorer. Search for each of the vulnerable package names and make a note of the version numbers of any results you find.\r\n\r\nFor example, searching for `Microsoft.AspNetCore.Mvc.Core` in an example project that contains a reference to `Microsoft.AspNetCore.Mvc` shows the following results in Visual Studio 2015.\r\n\r\n![vs2015](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/796298/25858059/a1ae6624-348f-11e7-9ce9-ff2d25a3fc5b.png)\r\n\r\nThe search results appear as a tree. In these results, you can see we have found references to `Microsoft.AspNetCore.Mvc`, version 1.0.1, ` vulnerable version. \r\n\r\nThe first entry under the References heading refers to the target framework your application is using. This will be `.NETCoreApp`, `.NETStandard` or `.NET-Framework-vX.Y.Z` (where X.Y.Z is an actual version number) depending on how you configured your application. Under your target framework will be the list of packages you have directly taken a dependency on. In this example, the application takes a dependency on `Microsoft.AspNetCore.Mvc`. `Microsoft.AspNetCore.Mvc` in turn has leaf nodes that list its dependencies and their versions. In this case the `Microsoft.AspNetCore.Mvc` package takes a dependency on a vulnerable version of `Microsoft.AspNetCore.Mvc.Core` and numerous other packages.\r\n\r\n#### Manually reviewing project.lock.json (project.json/VS2015)\r\nOpen the `project.lock.json` file in your editor. We suggest you use an editor that understands json and allows you to collapse and expand nodes to review this file; both Visual Studio and Visual Studio Code provide this functionality.\r\n\r\nIf you are using Visual Studio the `project.lock.json` file is “under” the `project.json` file. Click the right pointing triangle, ▷, to the left of the `project.json` file to expand the solution tree to expose the `project.lock.json` file. The following image shows a project with the `project.json` file expanded to show the `project.lock.json` file.\r\n\r\n![project lock json](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/796298/25858179/f6e01200-348f-11e7-8a77-7176d8dd3f03.png)\r\n\r\nSearch the `project.lock.json` file for the vulnerable packages, using the format `packagename/`, using each of the package names from the table above. If you find any vulnerable assembly name in your search examine the line on which they are found, the version number is after the `/` and compare to the vulnerable versions table above. For example a search result that shows `Microsoft.AspNetCore.Mvc.Cors/1.0.1` is a reference to v1.0.1 of `Microsoft.AspNetCore.Mvc.Cors`.   If your `project.lock.json` file includes references to any of the package versions shown above then you will need to fix the transitive dependencies. \r\n\r\n#### Fixing transitive dependencies (project.json/VS2015)\r\n\r\nIf you have not found any reference to a vulnerable version of  `Microsoft.AspNetCore.Mvc.Cors` this means none of your direct dependencies depend on any vulnerable packages or you have already fixed the problem by updating the direct dependencies.\r\n\r\nIf your transitive dependency review found references to any of the vulnerable packages you must add a direct dependency to the updated package to your `project.json` file to override the transitive dependency. Open your `project.json` and find the dependencies section. For example:\r\n\r\n``` json\r\n  \"dependencies\": {\r\n    \"Microsoft.NETCore.App\": {\r\n      \"version\": \"1.0.1\",\r\n      \"type\": \"platform\"\r\n    },\r\n    \"Microsoft.AspNetCore.Server.Kestrel\": \"1.1.0\",\r\n    \"Microsoft.AspNetCore.Mvc\": \"1.0.0\"\r\n  }\r\n```\r\n\r\nFor each of the vulnerable packages your search returned you must add a direct dependency to the updated version by adding it to the `project.json` file. You do this by adding a new line to the dependencies section, referring the fixed version. For example, if your search showed a transitive reference to the vulnerable `Microsoft.AspNetCore.Mvc.Cors` version 1.0.0 you would add a reference to the appropriate fixed version, 1.0.6. Edit the `project.json` file as follows:\r\n\r\n``` json\r\n  \"dependencies\": {\r\n    \"Microsoft.NETCore.App\": {\r\n      \"version\": \"1.0.1\",\r\n      \"type\": \"platform\"\r\n    },\r\n    \"Microsoft.AspNetCore.Mvc.Cors\": \"1.0.6\",\r\n    \"Microsoft.AspNetCore.Server.Kestrel\": \"1.1.0\",\r\n    \"Microsoft.AspNetCore.Mvc\": \"1.0.0\"\r\n  }\r\n```\r\n\r\nAfter you have added direct dependencies to the fixed packages, save your `project.json` file.\r\n\r\nIf you are using Visual Studio save your updated `project.json` file and Visual Studio will restore the new package versions. You can see the restore results by opening the Output Window (Ctrl+Alt+O) and changing the Show output from drop-down list to Package Manager.\r\n\r\nIf you are not using Visual Studio open a command line and change to your project directory. Execute the `dotnet restore` command to restore your new dependencies.\r\n\r\n#### Using Visual Studio Solution Explorer (VS2017)\r\n\r\nIf you want to use Solution Explorer, open your project in Visual Studio 2017, and then press Ctrl+; to activate the search in Solution Explorer. Search for each of the vulnerable package names and make a note of the version numbers of any results you find.\r\n\r\nFor example, searching for `Microsoft.AspNetCore.Mvc.Core` in an example project that contains a package that takes a dependency on `Microsoft.AspNetCore.Mvc` shows the following results in Visual Studio 2017.\r\n\r\n![vs2017](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/796298/25858816/8ecdc2b4-3491-11e7-9363-746804bb9832.png)\r\n\r\nThe search results appear as a tree. In these results, you can see we have found references to `Microsoft.AspNetCore.Mvc.Core` version 1.1.2.\r\n\r\nUnder the Dependencies node will be a NuGet node. Under the NuGet node will be the list of packages you have directly taken a dependency on and their versions. In this example, the application takes a direct dependency on `Microsoft.AspNetCore.Mvc`. `Microsoft.AspNetCore.Mvc` in turn has leaf nodes that list its dependencies and their versions. In the example the `Microsoft.AspNetCore.Mvc` package takes a dependency on a version of `Microsoft.AspNetCore.Mvc.ApiExplorer` which in turn takes a dependency on a vulnerable version of `Microsoft.AspNetCore.Mvc.Core`.\r\n\r\n#### Manually reviewing project.assets.json (VS2017)\r\n\r\nOpen the `project.assets.json` file from your project’s obj directory in your editor. We suggest you use an editor that understands json and allows you to collapse and expand nodes to review this file; both Visual Studio and Visual Studio Code provide this functionality.\r\n\r\nSearch the `project.assets.json` file for each of the vulnerable packages, using the format `packagename/` using the package name from the table above. If you find the assembly name in your search examine the line on which they are found, the version number is after the `/` and compare to the vulnerable versions table above. For example a search result that shows `Microsoft.AspNetCore.Mvc.Cors/1.1.0` is a reference to v1.1.0 of `Microsoft.AspNetCore.Mvc.Cors`.   If your `project.assets.json` file includes references to any of the vulnerable packages shown above then you will need to fix the transitive dependencies.\r\n\r\nIf you have not found any reference to any vulnerable packages this means none of your direct dependencies depend on any vulnerable packages or you have already fixed the problem by updating the direct dependencies.\r\n\r\nIf your transitive dependency review found references to any of the vulnerable packages you must add a direct dependency to the updated package to your `csproj` file to override the transitive dependency. Open your `projectname.csproj` file in your editor, or right click on the project in Visual Studio 2017 and choose Edit `projectname.csproj` from the content menu, where `projectname` is the name of your project. Look for `PackageReference` nodes, for example:\r\n\r\n``` xml\r\n<Project Sdk=\"Microsoft.NET.Sdk.Web\">\r\n  <PropertyGroup>\r\n    <TargetFramework>netcoreapp1.1</TargetFramework>\r\n  </PropertyGroup>\r\n  <PropertyGroup>\r\n    <PackageTargetFallback>$(PackageTargetFallback);portable-net45+win8+wp8+wpa81;</PackageTargetFallback>\r\n  </PropertyGroup>\r\n  <ItemGroup>\r\n    <PackageReference Include=\"Microsoft.AspNetCore\" Version=\"1.1.1\" />\r\n    <PackageReference Include=\"Microsoft.AspNetCore.Mvc\" Version=\"1.1.3\" />\r\n  </ItemGroup>\r\n  <ItemGroup>\r\n    <DotNetCliToolReference Include=\"Microsoft.VisualStudio.Web.CodeGeneration.Tools\" Version=\"1.0.0\" />\r\n  </ItemGroup>\r\n</Project>\r\n```\r\n\r\nFor each of the vulnerable packages your search returned you must add a direct dependency to the updated version by adding it to the `csproj` file. You do this by adding a new line to the dependencies section, referring the fixed version. For example, if your search showed a transitive reference to the vulnerable `Microsoft.AspNetCore.Mvc.Cors`, version 1.1.4 you would add a reference to the appropriate fixed version, 1.1.5.\r\n\r\n``` xml\r\n<Project Sdk=\"Microsoft.NET.Sdk.Web\">\r\n  <PropertyGroup>\r\n    <TargetFramework>netcoreapp1.1</TargetFramework>\r\n  </PropertyGroup>\r\n  <PropertyGroup>\r\n    <PackageTargetFallback>$(PackageTargetFallback);portable-net45+win8+wp8+wpa81;</PackageTargetFallback>\r\n  </PropertyGroup>\r\n  <ItemGroup>\r\n    <PackageReference Include=\"Microsoft.AspNetCore.Mvc.Cors\" Version=\"1.1.5\" />\r\n    <PackageReference Include=\"Microsoft.AspNetCore\" Version=\"1.1.1\" />\r\n    <PackageReference Include=\"Microsoft.AspNetCore.Mvc\" Version=\"1.1.3\" />\r\n  </ItemGroup>\r\n  <ItemGroup>\r\n    <DotNetCliToolReference Include=\"Microsoft.VisualStudio.Web.CodeGeneration.Tools\" Version=\"1.0.0\" />\r\n  </ItemGroup>\r\n```\r\n\r\nAfter you have added the direct dependency reference, save your `csproj` file.\r\n\r\nIf you are using Visual Studio, save your updated `csproj` file and Visual Studio will restore the new package versions. You can see the restore results by opening the Output Window (Ctrl+Alt+O) and changing the Show output from drop-down list to Package Manager.\r\n\r\nIf you are not using Visual Studio, open a command line and change to your project directory. Execute the `dotnet restore` command to restore your new dependencies.\r\n\r\n### Rebuilding your application\r\nFinally rebuild your application, test as you would do normally and redeploy using your favored deployment mechanism.\r\n\r\n## Other Information\r\n### Reporting Security Issues\r\n\r\nIf you have found a potential security issue in .NET Core, please email details to secure@microsoft.com.

This advisory also provides guidance on what developers can do to update their applications correctly.\r\n\r\nMicrosoft is aware of a security vulnerability in all public versions of ASP.NET Core where the application is hosted through Windows Http,Sys where a malformed request can lead to a Denial Of Service.\r\n\r\n## Discussion\r\n\r\nPlease use **** TODO: FILL IN ISSUE LINK *** for discussion of this advisory.\r\n\r\n### Mitigation Factors\r\nASP.NET Core applications hosted using Kestrel as their web server are not affected. By default ASP.NET Core Web applications are hosted with Kestrel. Developers must make specific decisions to switch to using HTTP.SYS.\r\n\r\n## Affected Software\r\nThe vulnerabilities affect any Microsoft ASP.NET Core project if it uses the following affected package versions.\r\n\r\nPackage name | Package versions | Fixed package versions\r\n---------------- | ------------------- | -------------------------\r\nMicrosoft.AspNetCore.Server.WebListener | 1.0.0, 1.0.1, 1.0.2, 1.0.3, 1.0.4<br />1.1.0, 1.1.1, 1.1.2 ,1.1.3 | 1.0.6<br />1.1.5\r\nMicrosoft.AspNetCore.Server.HttpSys | 2.0.0 |  2.0.2\r\n\r\n## Advisory FAQ\r\n### How do I know if I am affected? \r\n\r\n.NET Core and ASP.NET Core have two types of dependencies: direct and transitive. If your project has a direct or transitive dependency on any of the packages and versions listed above, you are affected.\r\n\r\n### NET Core Project formats\r\n.NET Core has two different project file formats, depending on what software created the project. \r\n\r\n1. `project.json` is the format used in .NET Core 1.0 and Microsoft Visual Studio 2015.\r\n2. `csproj` is the format used in .NET Core 1.1, .NET Core 2.0 and Microsoft Visual Studio 2017.  \r\n\t\r\nYou must ensure you follow the correct update instructions for your project type.\r\n\r\n### Direct Dependencies\r\nDirect dependencies are dependencies where you specifically add a package to your project. For example, if you add the `Microsoft.AspNetCore.Mvc` package to your project then you have taken a direct dependency on` Microsoft.AspNetCore.Mvc`.\r\n\r\nDirect dependencies are discoverable by reviewing your `project.json` or `csproj` file.\r\n\r\n### Transitive Dependencies\r\nTransitive dependencies occur when you add a package to your project that in turn relies on another package. For example, if you add the `Microsoft.AspNetCore.Mvc` package to your project it depends on the `Microsoft.AspNetCore.Mvc.Core` package (among others). Your project has a direct dependency on `Microsoft.AspNetCore.Mvc` and a transitive dependency on the `Microsoft.AspNetCore.Mvc.Core` package.\r\nTransitive dependencies are reviewable in the Visual Studio Solution Explorer window, which supports searching, or by reviewing the `project.lock.json` file contained in the root directory of your project for `project.json` projects or the `project.assets.json` file contained in the obj directory of your project for `csproj` projects. These files are the authoritative list of all packages used by your project, containing both direct and transitive dependencies.\r\n\r\n## How do I fix my affected application?\r\nYou will need to fix both direct dependencies and review and fix any transitive dependencies. The affected packages and versions in the previous “Affected Software” section include each vulnerable package, the vulnerable versions, and the patched versions\r\n\r\n\r\n### Fixing Direct Dependencies – project.json/VS2015\r\nOpen your `project.json` file in your editor. Look for the dependencies section. Below is an example dependencies section:\r\n\r\n``` json\r\n    \"dependencies\": {\r\n      \"Microsoft.NETCore.App\": {\r\n        \"version\": \"1.0.1\",\r\n        \"type\": \"platform\"\r\n      },\r\n     \"Microsoft.AspNetCore.Server.WebListener\": \"1.0.1\",\r\n     \"Microsoft.AspNetCore.Mvc.Core \": \"1.0.6\",\r\n    }\r\n```\r\nThis example has three direct dependencies: `Microsoft.NETCore.App`, `Microsoft.AspNetCore.Server.WebListener` and `Microsoft.AspNetCore.Mvc.Core`. \r\n\r\n`Microsoft.NetCore.App` is the platform the application targets, you should ignore this. The other packages expose their version to the right of the package name. In our example, our non-platform packages are version 1.0.1.\r\n\r\nReview your direct dependencies for any instance of the packages and versions listed above. In the example above, there is a direct dependency on the vulnerable package, `Microsoft.AspNetCore.Server.WebListener` version 1.0.1.\r\n\r\nTo update to the fixed package, change the version number to be the appropriate package for your release. In the example, this would be updating `Microsoft.AspNetCore.Server.WebListener` to 1.0.6.\r\n\r\nAfter updating the vulnerable package versions, save your `project.json` file.\r\n\r\nThe dependencies section in our example `project.json` would now look as follows:\r\n\r\n```json\r\n  \"dependencies\": {\r\n    \"Microsoft.NETCore.App\": {\r\n      \"version\": \"1.0.1\",\r\n      \"type\": \"platform\"\r\n    },\r\n    \"Microsoft.AspNetCore.Server.WebListener\": \"1.0.6\",\r\n    \"Microsoft.AspNetCore.Mvc.Core\": \"1.0.6\",     \r\n  }\r\n```\r\n\r\nIf you are using Visual Studio and save your updated `project.json` file, Visual Studio will restore the new package version. You can see the restore results by opening the Output Window (Ctrl+Alt+O) and changing the Show output from drop-down list to Package Manager.\r\n\r\nIf you are not using Visual Studio, open a command line and change to your project directory. Execute the `dotnet restore` command to restore your new dependency.\r\n\r\nAfter you have addressed all of your direct dependencies, you must also review your transitive dependencies.\r\n\r\n### Fixing Direct Dependencies – csproj/VS2017\r\nOpen your `projectname.csproj` file in your editor, or right click the project in Visual Studio 2017 and choose `Edit projectname.csproj` from the content menu, where projectname is the name of your project. Look for `PackageReference` nodes. The following shows an example project file:\r\n\r\n``` XML\r\n<Project Sdk=\"Microsoft.NET.Sdk.Web\">\r\n  <PropertyGroup>\r\n    <TargetFramework>netcoreapp1.1</TargetFramework>\r\n  </PropertyGroup>\r\n  <PropertyGroup>\r\n    <PackageTargetFallback>$(PackageTargetFallback);portable-net45+win8+wp8+wpa81;</PackageTargetFallback>\r\n  </PropertyGroup>\r\n  <ItemGroup>\r\n    <PackageReference Include=\"Microsoft.AspNetCore.Server.WebListener\" Version=\"1.1.1\" />\r\n    <PackageReference Include=\"Microsoft.AspNetCore.Mvc.Core\" Version=\"1.1.3\" />\r\n  </ItemGroup>\r\n  <ItemGroup>\r\n    <DotNetCliToolReference Include=\"Microsoft.VisualStudio.Web.CodeGeneration.Tools\" Version=\"1.0.0 \" />\r\n  </ItemGroup>\r\n</Project>\r\n```\r\n\r\nThe example has a two direct dependencies, as seen by the two `PackageReference` elements. The name of the package is in the Include attribute, and the package version number is in the Version attribute that is exposed to the right of the package name.\r\n\r\nReview your `PackageReference` elements for any instance of the packages and versions listed above. The example shows a direct reference to the vulnerable package `Microsoft.AspNetCore.Server.WebListener` version 1.1.1.\r\n\r\nTo update to the fixed package, change the version number to the appropriate package for your release. In the example, this would be updating `Microsoft.AspNetCore.Mvc.Cors` to 1.1.5.\r\n\r\nAfter updating the vulnerable package version, save your `csproj` file. The example `csproj` would now look as follows:\r\n\r\n``` XML\r\n<Project Sdk=\"Microsoft.NET.Sdk.Web\">\r\n  <PropertyGroup>\r\n    <TargetFramework>netcoreapp1.1</TargetFramework>\r\n  </PropertyGroup>\r\n  <PropertyGroup>\r\n    <PackageTargetFallback>$(PackageTargetFallback);portable-net45+win8+wp8+wpa81;</PackageTargetFallback>\r\n  </PropertyGroup>\r\n  <ItemGroup>\r\n    <PackageReference Include=\"Microsoft.AspNetCore.Server.WebListener\" Version=\"1.1.5\" />\r\n    <PackageReference Include=\"Microsoft.AspNetCore.Mvc.Core\" Version=\"1.1.3\" />\r\n  </ItemGroup>\r\n  <ItemGroup>\r\n    <DotNetCliToolReference Include=\"Microsoft.VisualStudio.Web.CodeGeneration.Tools\" Version=\"1.0.0 \" />\r\n  </ItemGroup>\r\n</Project>\r\n```\r\n\r\nIf you are using Visual Studio and save your updated `csproj` file, Visual Studio will restore the new package version. You can see the restore results by opening the Output Window (Ctrl+Alt+O) and changing the Show output from drop-down list to Package Manager.\r\n\r\nIf you are not using Visual Studio open a command line and change to your project directory. Execute the `dotnet restore` command to restore your new dependency.\r\n\r\n### After updating your direct dependencies\r\n\r\nRecompile your application.\r\n\r\nIf after recompilation you see a Dependency conflict warning, you must update your other direct dependencies to the appropriate version. \r\n\r\nFor example if your project refers to `Microsoft.AspNetCore.Mvc.Cors` with a version number of 1.0.1 when you update your `Microsoft.AspNetCore.Mvc` package to 1.0.6, compilation will throw:\r\n\r\n`NU1012      Dependency conflict. Microsoft.AspNetCore.Mvc.Core 1.0.6 expected Microsoft.AspNetCore.Mvc.Cors >= 1.0.6 but received 1.0.1`\r\n\r\nTo fix this, edit the version for the expected package to be the version expected by updating your `csproj` or `project.json` in the same way that you used to update the vulnerable package versions.\r\n\r\nAfter you have addressed all of your direct dependencies, you must also review your transitive dependencies.\r\n\r\n### Reviewing Transitive Dependencies \r\n\r\nThere are two ways to view transitive dependencies. You can either use Visual Studio’s Solution Explorer, or you can review your `project.lock.json` (project.json/VS2015) or `project.assets.json` (csproj/VS2017) file.\r\n\r\n#### Using Visual Studio Solution Explorer (VS2015)\r\nIf you want to use Visual Studio 2015, open your project in Visual Studio 2015 and then press Ctrl+; to activate the search in Solution Explorer. Search for each of the vulnerable package names and make a note of the version numbers of any results you find.\r\n\r\nFor example, searching for `Microsoft.AspNetCore.Mvc.Core` in an example project that contains a reference to `Microsoft.AspNetCore.Mvc` shows the following results in Visual Studio 2015.\r\n\r\n![vs2015](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/796298/25858059/a1ae6624-348f-11e7-9ce9-ff2d25a3fc5b.png)\r\n\r\nThe search results appear as a tree. In these results, you can see we have found references to `Microsoft.AspNetCore.Mvc`, version 1.0.1, ` vulnerable version. \r\n\r\nThe first entry under the References heading refers to the target framework your application is using. This will be `.NETCoreApp`, `.NETStandard` or `.NET-Framework-vX.Y.Z` (where X.Y.Z is an actual version number) depending on how you configured your application. Under your target framework will be the list of packages you have directly taken a dependency on. In this example, the application takes a dependency on `Microsoft.AspNetCore.Mvc`. `Microsoft.AspNetCore.Mvc` in turn has leaf nodes that list its dependencies and their versions. In this case the `Microsoft.AspNetCore.Mvc` package takes a dependency on a vulnerable version of `Microsoft.AspNetCore.Mvc.Core` and numerous other packages.\r\n\r\n#### Manually reviewing project.lock.json (project.json/VS2015)\r\nOpen the `project.lock.json` file in your editor. We suggest you use an editor that understands json and allows you to collapse and expand nodes to review this file; both Visual Studio and Visual Studio Code provide this functionality.\r\n\r\nIf you are using Visual Studio the `project.lock.json` file is “under” the `project.json` file. Click the right pointing triangle, ▷, to the left of the `project.json` file to expand the solution tree to expose the `project.lock.json` file. The following image shows a project with the `project.json` file expanded to show the `project.lock.json` file.\r\n\r\n![project lock json](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/796298/25858179/f6e01200-348f-11e7-8a77-7176d8dd3f03.png)\r\n\r\nSearch the `project.lock.json` file for the vulnerable packages, using the format `packagename/`, using each of the package names from the table above. If you find any vulnerable assembly name in your search examine the line on which they are found, the version number is after the `/` and compare to the vulnerable versions table above. For example a search result that shows `Microsoft.AspNetCore.Mvc.Cors/1.0.1` is a reference to v1.0.1 of `Microsoft.AspNetCore.Mvc.Cors`.   If your `project.lock.json` file includes references to any of the package versions shown above then you will need to fix the transitive dependencies. \r\n\r\n#### Fixing transitive dependencies (project.json/VS2015)\r\n\r\nIf you have not found any reference to a vulnerable version of  `Microsoft.AspNetCore.Mvc.Cors` this means none of your direct dependencies depend on any vulnerable packages or you have already fixed the problem by updating the direct dependencies.\r\n\r\nIf your transitive dependency review found references to any of the vulnerable packages you must add a direct dependency to the updated package to your `project.json` file to override the transitive dependency. Open your `project.json` and find the dependencies section. For example:\r\n\r\n``` json\r\n  \"dependencies\": {\r\n    \"Microsoft.NETCore.App\": {\r\n      \"version\": \"1.0.1\",\r\n      \"type\": \"platform\"\r\n    },\r\n    \"Microsoft.AspNetCore.Mvc\": \"1.0.0\"\r\n  }\r\n```\r\n\r\nFor each of the vulnerable packages your search returned you must add a direct dependency to the updated version by adding it to the `project.json` file. You do this by adding a new line to the dependencies section, referring the fixed version. For example, if your search showed a transitive reference to the vulnerable `Microsoft.AspNetCore.Server.WebListener` version 1.0.0 you would add a reference to the appropriate fixed version, 1.0.6. Edit the `project.json` file as follows:\r\n\r\n``` json\r\n  \"dependencies\": {\r\n    \"Microsoft.NETCore.App\": {\r\n      \"version\": \"1.0.1\",\r\n      \"type\": \"platform\"\r\n    },\r\n    \"Microsoft.AspNetCore.Server.WebListener\": \"1.0.6\",\r\n    \"Microsoft.AspNetCore.Mvc\": \"1.0.0\"\r\n  }\r\n```\r\n\r\nAfter you have added direct dependencies to the fixed packages, save your `project.json` file.\r\n\r\nIf you are using Visual Studio save your updated `project.json` file and Visual Studio will restore the new package versions. You can see the restore results by opening the Output Window (Ctrl+Alt+O) and changing the Show output from drop-down list to Package Manager.\r\n\r\nIf you are not using Visual Studio open a command line and change to your project directory. Execute the `dotnet restore` command to restore your new dependencies.\r\n\r\n#### Using Visual Studio Solution Explorer (VS2017)\r\n\r\nIf you want to use Solution Explorer, open your project in Visual Studio 2017, and then press Ctrl+; to activate the search in Solution Explorer. Search for each of the vulnerable package names and make a note of the version numbers of any results you find.\r\n\r\nFor example, searching for `Microsoft.AspNetCore.Mvc.Core` in an example project that contains a package that takes a dependency on `Microsoft.AspNetCore.Mvc` shows the following results in Visual Studio 2017.\r\n\r\n![vs2017](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/796298/25858816/8ecdc2b4-3491-11e7-9363-746804bb9832.png)\r\n\r\nThe search results appear as a tree. In these results, you can see we have found references to `Microsoft.AspNetCore.Mvc.Core` version 1.1.2.\r\n\r\nUnder the Dependencies node will be a NuGet node. Under the NuGet node will be the list of packages you have directly taken a dependency on and their versions. In this example, the application takes a direct dependency on `Microsoft.AspNetCore.Mvc`. `Microsoft.AspNetCore.Mvc` in turn has leaf nodes that list its dependencies and their versions. In the example the `Microsoft.AspNetCore.Mvc` package takes a dependency on a version of `Microsoft.AspNetCore.Mvc.ApiExplorer` which in turn takes a dependency on a vulnerable version of `Microsoft.AspNetCore.Mvc.Core`.\r\n\r\n#### Manually reviewing project.assets.json (VS2017)\r\n\r\nOpen the `project.assets.json` file from your project’s obj directory in your editor. We suggest you use an editor that understands json and allows you to collapse and expand nodes to review this file; both Visual Studio and Visual Studio Code provide this functionality.\r\n\r\nSearch the `project.assets.json` file for each of the vulnerable packages, using the format `packagename/` using the package name from the table above. If you find the assembly name in your search examine the line on which they are found, the version number is after the `/` and compare to the vulnerable versions table above. For example a search result that shows `Microsoft.AspNetCore.Mvc.Cors/1.1.0` is a reference to v1.1.0 of `Microsoft.AspNetCore.Mvc.Cors`.   If your `project.assets.json` file includes references to any of the vulnerable packages shown above then you will need to fix the transitive dependencies.\r\n\r\nIf you have not found any reference to any vulnerable packages this means none of your direct dependencies depend on any vulnerable packages or you have already fixed the problem by updating the direct dependencies.\r\n\r\nIf your transitive dependency review found references to any of the vulnerable packages you must add a direct dependency to the updated package to your `csproj` file to override the transitive dependency. Open your `projectname.csproj` file in your editor, or right click on the project in Visual Studio 2017 and choose Edit `projectname.csproj` from the content menu, where `projectname` is the name of your project. Look for `PackageReference` nodes, for example:\r\n\r\n``` xml\r\n<Project Sdk=\"Microsoft.NET.Sdk.Web\">\r\n  <PropertyGroup>\r\n    <TargetFramework>netcoreapp1.1</TargetFramework>\r\n  </PropertyGroup>\r\n  <PropertyGroup>\r\n    <PackageTargetFallback>$(PackageTargetFallback);portable-net45+win8+wp8+wpa81;</PackageTargetFallback>\r\n  </PropertyGroup>\r\n  <ItemGroup>\r\n    <PackageReference Include=\"Microsoft.AspNetCore\" Version=\"1.1.1\" />\r\n    <PackageReference Include=\"Microsoft.AspNetCore.Mvc\" Version=\"1.1.3\" />\r\n  </ItemGroup>\r\n  <ItemGroup>\r\n    <DotNetCliToolReference Include=\"Microsoft.VisualStudio.Web.CodeGeneration.Tools\" Version=\"1.0.0\" />\r\n  </ItemGroup>\r\n</Project>\r\n```\r\n\r\nFor each of the vulnerable packages your search returned you must add a direct dependency to the updated version by adding it to the `csproj` file. You do this by adding a new line to the dependencies section, referring the fixed version. For example, if your search showed a transitive reference to the vulnerable `Microsoft.AspNetCore.Server.WebListener` version 1.1.0 you would add a reference to the appropriate fixed version 1.1.3.\r\n\r\n``` xml\r\n<Project Sdk=\"Microsoft.NET.Sdk.Web\">\r\n  <PropertyGroup>\r\n    <TargetFramework>netcoreapp1.1</TargetFramework>\r\n  </PropertyGroup>\r\n  <PropertyGroup>\r\n    <PackageTargetFallback>$(PackageTargetFallback);portable-net45+win8+wp8+wpa81;</PackageTargetFallback>\r\n  </PropertyGroup>\r\n  <ItemGroup>\r\n    <PackageReference Include=\"Microsoft.AspNetCore.Server.WebListener\" Version=\"1.1.5\" />\r\n    <PackageReference Include=\"Microsoft.AspNetCore\" Version=\"1.1.1\" />\r\n    <PackageReference Include=\"Microsoft.AspNetCore.Mvc\" Version=\"1.1.3\" />\r\n  </ItemGroup>\r\n  <ItemGroup>\r\n    <DotNetCliToolReference Include=\"Microsoft.VisualStudio.Web.CodeGeneration.Tools\" Version=\"1.0.0\" />\r\n  </ItemGroup>\r\n```\r\n\r\nAfter you have added the direct dependency reference, save your `csproj` file.\r\n\r\nIf you are using Visual Studio, save your updated `csproj` file and Visual Studio will restore the new package versions. You can see the restore results by opening the Output Window (Ctrl+Alt+O) and changing the Show output from drop-down list to Package Manager.\r\n\r\nIf you are not using Visual Studio, open a command line and change to your project directory. Execute the `dotnet restore` command to restore your new dependencies.\r\n\r\n### Rebuilding your application\r\nFinally rebuild your application, test as you would do normally and redeploy using your favored deployment mechanism.\r\n\r\n## Other Information\r\n### Reporting Security Issues\r\n\r\nIf you have found a potential security issue in .NET Core, please email details to secure@microsoft.com.

If your project has a direct or transitive dependency on any of the packages and versions listed above, you are affected.\r\n\r\n### Direct Dependencies\r\nDirect dependencies are dependencies where you specifically add a package to your project. For example, if you add the `Microsoft.AspNetCore.Mvc` package to your project then you have taken a direct dependency on` Microsoft.AspNetCore.Mvc`.\r\n\r\nDirect dependencies are discoverable by reviewing your `csproj` file.\r\n\r\n### Transitive Dependencies\r\nTransitive dependencies occur when you add a package to your project that in turn relies on another package. For example, if you add the `Microsoft.AspNetCore.Mvc` package to your project it depends on the `Microsoft.AspNetCore.Mvc.Core` package (among others). Your project has a direct dependency on `Microsoft.AspNetCore.Mvc` and a transitive dependency on the `Microsoft.AspNetCore.Mvc.Core` package.\r\nTransitive dependencies are reviewable in the Visual Studio Solution Explorer window, which supports searching, or by reviewing the `project.lock.json` file contained in the root directory of your project for `project.json` projects or the `project.assets.json` file contained in the obj directory of your project for `csproj` projects. These files are the authoritative list of all packages used by your project, containing both direct and transitive dependencies.\r\n\r\n## How do I fix my affected application?\r\nYou will need to fix both direct dependencies and review and fix any transitive dependencies. The affected packages and versions in the previous “Affected Software” section include each vulnerable package, the vulnerable versions, and the patched versions\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\nIf you are targeting .NET Core a \"meta-package\" is used, `Microsoft.AspNetCore.All`. You should begin by updating its version number to 2.0.1, this will pull in the fixed `Microsoft.AspNetCore.Mvc.Core` package.\r\n\r\nIf you are targeting .NET Framework you should first update the `Microsoft.AspNetCore` version to the version number to 2.0.1, then adjust the version number for any other packages beginning with `Microsoft.AspNetCore.` to 2.0.1.\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n### Fixing Direct Dependencies – Projects targeting .NET Core\r\nOpen your `projectname.csproj` file in your editor, or right click the project in Visual Studio 2017 and choose `Edit projectname.csproj` from the content menu, where projectname is the name of your project. Look for `PackageReference` nodes. The following shows an example project file:\r\n\r\n``` XML\r\n<Project Sdk=\"Microsoft.NET.Sdk.Web\">\r\n  <PropertyGroup>\r\n    <TargetFramework>netcoreapp2.0</TargetFramework>\r\n  </PropertyGroup>\r\n  <ItemGroup>\r\n    <PackageReference Include=\"Microsoft.AspNetCore.All\" Version=\"2.0.0\" />\r\n  </ItemGroup>\r\n  <ItemGroup>\r\n    <DotNetCliToolReference Include=\"Microsoft.VisualStudio.Web.CodeGeneration.Tools\" Version=\"2.0.0\" />\r\n  </ItemGroup>\r\n</Project>\r\n```\r\n\r\nThe example has has a reference to the vulnerable metapackage, as seen by the single `PackageReference` elements. The name of the package is in the Include attribute, and the package version number is in the Version attribute that is exposed to the right of the package name. The example shows a single direct dependency on `Microsoft.AspNetCore.All` version 2.0.0.\r\n\r\nTo update to the fixed package, change the version number to the updated package version. In the example, this would be updating `Microsoft.AspNetCore.All` to 2.0.1.\r\n\r\nAfter updating the vulnerable package version, save your `csproj` file. The example `csproj` would now look as follows:\r\n\r\n``` XML\r\n<Project Sdk=\"Microsoft.NET.Sdk.Web\">\r\n  <PropertyGroup>\r\n    <TargetFramework>netcoreapp2.0</TargetFramework>\r\n  </PropertyGroup>\r\n  <ItemGroup>\r\n    <PackageReference Include=\"Microsoft.AspNetCore.All\" Version=\"2.0.1\" />\r\n  </ItemGroup>\r\n  <ItemGroup>\r\n    <DotNetCliToolReference Include=\"Microsoft.VisualStudio.Web.CodeGeneration.Tools\" Version=\"2.0.0\" />\r\n  </ItemGroup>\r\n</Project>\r\n```\r\n\r\nIf you are using Visual Studio and save your updated `csproj` file, Visual Studio will restore the new package version. You can see the restore results by opening the Output Window (Ctrl+Alt+O) and changing the Show output from drop-down list to Package Manager.\r\n\r\nIf you are not using Visual Studio open a command line and change to your project directory. Execute the `dotnet restore` command to restore your new dependency.\r\n\r\n### Fixing Direct Dependencies – Projects targeting .NET Framework\r\nOpen your `projectname.csproj` file in your editor, or right click the project in Visual Studio 2017 and choose `Edit projectname.csproj` from the content menu, where projectname is the name of your project. Look for `PackageReference` nodes. The following shows an example project file:\r\n\r\n``` XML\r\n<Project Sdk=\"Microsoft.NET.Sdk.Web\">\r\n  <PropertyGroup>\r\n    <TargetFramework>net461</TargetFramework>\r\n  </PropertyGroup>\r\n  <ItemGroup>\r\n    <PackageReference Include=\"Microsoft.AspNetCore.Mvc.Core\" Version=\"2.0.0\" />\r\n  </ItemGroup>\r\n  <ItemGroup>\r\n    <DotNetCliToolReference Include=\"Microsoft.VisualStudio.Web.CodeGeneration.Tools\" Version=\"2.0.0\" />\r\n  </ItemGroup>\r\n</Project>\r\n```\r\n\r\nThe example has has a reference a single packages, as seen by the `PackageReference` element. The name of the package is in the Include attribute, and the package version number is in the Version attribute that is exposed to the right of the package name. The example shows a direct dependency on one of the vulnerable packages from the table above, `Microsoft.AspNetCore.Core` version 2.0.0.\r\n\r\nTo update to the fixed package, change the version number to the updated package version. In the example, this would be updating `Microsoft.AspNetCore.Core` to 2.0.1.\r\n\r\nAfter updating the vulnerable package version, save your `csproj` file. The example `csproj` would now look as follows:\r\n\r\n``` XML\r\n<Project Sdk=\"Microsoft.NET.Sdk.Web\">\r\n  <PropertyGroup>\r\n    <TargetFramework>net461</TargetFramework>\r\n  </PropertyGroup>\r\n  <ItemGroup>\r\n    <PackageReference Include=\"Microsoft.AspNetCore.Mvc.Core\" Version=\"2.0.1\" />\r\n  </ItemGroup>\r\n  <ItemGroup>\r\n    <DotNetCliToolReference Include=\"Microsoft.VisualStudio.Web.CodeGeneration.Tools\" Version=\"2.0.0\" />\r\n  </ItemGroup>\r\n</Project>\r\n```\r\nIf you are using Visual Studio and save your updated `csproj` file, Visual Studio will restore the new package version. You can see the restore results by opening the Output Window (Ctrl+Alt+O) and changing the Show output from drop-down list to Package Manager.\r\n\r\nIf you are not using Visual Studio open a command line and change to your project directory. Execute the `dotnet restore` command to restore your new dependency.\r\n\r\n### After updating your direct dependencies\r\n\r\nRecompile your application.\r\n\r\nIf after recompilation you see a Dependency conflict warning, you must update your other direct dependencies to the appropriate version. \r\n\r\nFor example if your project refers a direct reference to `Microsoft.AspNetCore.Mvc.Cors` with a version number of 2.0.0 when you update your `Microsoft.AspNetCore.Mvc` package to 2.0.1, compilation will throw:\r\n\r\n`NU1012      Dependency conflict. Microsoft.AspNetCore.Mvc 2.0.1 expected Microsoft.AspNetCore.Mvc.Cors >= 2.0.1 but received 2.0.0`\r\n\r\nTo fix this, edit the version for the expected package to be the version expected by updating your `project.json` in the same way that you used to update the vulnerable package versions.\r\n\r\nAfter you have addressed all of your direct dependencies, you must also review your transitive dependencies.\r\n\r\n### Reviewing Transitive Dependencies \r\n\r\nThere are two ways to view transitive dependencies. You can either use Visual Studio’s Solution Explorer, or you can review your `project.assets.json` file.\r\n\r\n#### Using Visual Studio Solution Explorer (VS2017)\r\n\r\nIf you want to use Solution Explorer, open your project in Visual Studio 2017, and then press Ctrl+; to activate the search in Solution Explorer. Search for each of the vulnerable package names and make a note of the version numbers of any results you find.\r\n\r\nFor example, searching for `Microsoft.AspNetCore.Mvc.Core` in an example project that contains a package that takes a dependency on `Microsoft.AspNetCore.Mvc` shows the following results in Visual Studio 2017.\r\n\r\n![vs2017](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/796298/25858816/8ecdc2b4-3491-11e7-9363-746804bb9832.png)\r\n\r\nThe search results appear as a tree. In these results, you can see we have found references to `Microsoft.AspNetCore.Mvc.Core` version 1.1.2.\r\n\r\nUnder the Dependencies node will be a NuGet node. Under the NuGet node will be the list of packages you have directly taken a dependency on and their versions. In this example, the application takes a direct dependency on `Microsoft.AspNetCore.Mvc`. `Microsoft.AspNetCore.Mvc` in turn has leaf nodes that list its dependencies and their versions. In the example the `Microsoft.AspNetCore.Mvc` package takes a dependency on a version of `Microsoft.AspNetCore.Mvc.ApiExplorer` which in turn takes a dependency on a vulnerable version of `Microsoft.AspNetCore.Mvc.Core`.\r\n\r\n#### Manually reviewing project.assets.json (VS2017)\r\n\r\nOpen the `project.assets.json` file from your project’s obj directory in your editor. We suggest you use an editor that understands json and allows you to collapse and expand nodes to review this file; both Visual Studio and Visual Studio Code provide this functionality.\r\n\r\nSearch the `project.assets.json` file for each of the vulnerable packages, using the format `packagename/` for each of the package names from the table above. If you find the assembly name in your search examine the line on which they are found, the version number is after the `/` and compare to the vulnerable versions table above. For example a search result that shows `Microsoft.AspNetCore.Mvc.Cors/1.1.0` is a reference to v1.1.0 of `Microsoft.AspNetCore.Mvc.Cors`.   If your `project.assets.json` file includes references to any of the vulnerable packages shown above then you will need to fix the transitive dependencies.\r\n\r\nIf you have not found any reference to any vulnerable packages this means none of your direct dependencies depend on any vulnerable packages or you have already fixed the problem by updating the direct dependencies.\r\n\r\nIf your transitive dependency review found references to any of the vulnerable packages you must add a direct dependency to the updated package to your `csproj` file to override the transitive dependency. Open your `projectname.csproj` file in your editor, or right click on the project in Visual Studio 2017 and choose Edit `projectname.csproj` from the content menu, where `projectname` is the name of your project. Look for `PackageReference` nodes, for example:\r\n\r\n``` xml\r\n<Project Sdk=\"Microsoft.NET.Sdk.Web\">\r\n  <PropertyGroup>\r\n    <TargetFramework>net461</TargetFramework>\r\n  </PropertyGroup>\r\n  <ItemGroup>\r\n    <PackageReference Include=\"ThirdParty.NotUpdatedYet\" Version=\"2.0.0\" />\r\n  </ItemGroup>\r\n  <ItemGroup>\r\n    <DotNetCliToolReference Include=\"Microsoft.VisualStudio.Web.CodeGeneration.Tools\" Version=\"2.0.0\" />\r\n  </ItemGroup>\r\n</Project>\r\n```\r\n\r\nFor each of the vulnerable packages your search returned you must add a direct dependency to the updated version by adding it to the `csproj` file. You do this by adding a new line to the dependencies section, referring the fixed version. For example, if your search showed a transitive reference to the vulnerable `Microsoft.AspNetCore.Mvc.Core` version 2.0.0 you would add a reference to the fixed version, 2.0.1.\r\n\r\n``` xml\r\n<Project Sdk=\"Microsoft.NET.Sdk.Web\">\r\n  <PropertyGroup>\r\n    <TargetFramework>net461</TargetFramework>\r\n  </PropertyGroup>\r\n  <ItemGroup>\r\n    <PackageReference Include=\"Microsoft.AspNetCore.Mvc.Core\" Version=\"2.0.1\" />\r\n    <PackageReference Include=\"ThirdParty.NotUpdatedYet\" Version=\"2.0.0\" />\r\n  </ItemGroup>\r\n  <ItemGroup>\r\n    <DotNetCliToolReference Include=\"Microsoft.VisualStudio.Web.CodeGeneration.Tools\" Version=\"2.0.0\" />\r\n  </ItemGroup>\r\n</Project>\r\n```\r\n\r\nAfter you have added the direct dependency reference, save your `csproj` file.\r\n\r\nIf you are using Visual Studio, save your updated `csproj` file and Visual Studio will restore the new package versions. You can see the restore results by opening the Output Window (Ctrl+Alt+O) and changing the Show output from drop-down list to Package Manager.\r\n\r\nIf you are not using Visual Studio, open a command line and change to your project directory. Execute the `dotnet restore` command to restore your new dependencies.\r\n\r\n### Rebuilding your application\r\nFinally rebuild your application, test as you would do normally and redeploy using your favored deployment mechanism.\r\n\r\n## Other Information\r\n### Reporting Security Issues\r\n\r\nIf you have found a potential security issue in .NET Core, please email details to secure@microsoft.com.
