That can be made only for `adstract` mode.\r\n\r\n[jsfiddle](https://jsfiddle.net/mcfq1yqy/23/)\r\n\r\nThis issue was caused by attempt to make custom-element component that have it's own routing (an abstract one) from a ready vuejs app, wich have quite alot of logic. \r\nAnd any page of an app can have multiple instances of it.\r\n\r\nWith that feature implemented it could be possible to make really modular pages that don't know what components they have inside, and components itself can be very complex. And it's the behavior that i think people are expecting - if you can have multiple Vue applications on a page, why only one router?\r\n\r\n### What does the proposed API look like?\r\ni dont think that api should change, but it can be possible to set some uid to tell `vue-router` instance wich `router-view` tag to use with it.
