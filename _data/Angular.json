In this commit, default imports\r\nprocessed in a type-to-value conversion were recorded as non-local imports\r\nwith a '*' name, and the ImportManager generated a new default import for\r\nthem. When transpiled to ES2015 modules, this resulted in the following\r\ncorrect code:\r\n\r\nimport i3 from './module';\r\n\r\n// somewhere in the file, a value reference of i3:\r\n{type: i3}\r\n\r\nHowever, when the AST with this synthetic import and reference was\r\ntranspiled to non-ES2015 modules (for example, to commonjs) an issue\r\nappeared:\r\n\r\nvar module_1 = require('./module');\r\n{type: i3}\r\n\r\nTypeScript renames the imported identifier from i3 to module_1, but doesn't\r\nsubstitute later references to i3. This is because the import and reference\r\nare both synthetic, and never went through the TypeScript AST step of\r\n\"binding\" which associates the reference to its import. This association is\r\nimportant during emit when the identifiers might change.\r\n\r\nSynthetic (transformer-added) imports will never be bound properly. The only\r\npossible solution is to reuse the user's original import and the identifier\r\nfrom it, which will be properly downleveled. The issue with this approach\r\n(which prompted the fix in b6f6b117) is that if the import is only used in a\r\ntype position, TypeScript will mark it for deletion in the generated JS,\r\neven though additional non-type usages are added in the transformer. This\r\nagain would leave a dangling import.\r\n\r\nTo work around this, it's necessary for the compiler to keep track of\r\nidentifiers that it emits which came from default imports, and tell TS not\r\nto remove those imports during transpilation. A `DefaultImportTracker` class\r\nis implemented to perform this tracking. It implements a\r\n`DefaultImportRecorder` interface, which is used to record two significant\r\npieces of information:\r\n\r\n* when a WrappedNodeExpr is generated which refers to a default imported\r\n  value, the ts.Identifier is associated to the ts.ImportDeclaration via\r\n  the recorder.\r\n* when that WrappedNodeExpr is later emitted as part of the statement /\r\n  expression translators, the fact that the ts.Identifier was used is\r\n  also recorded.\r\n\r\nCombined, this tracking gives the `DefaultImportTracker` enough information\r\nto implement another TS transformer, which can recognize default imports\r\nwhich were used in the output of the Ivy transform and can prevent them\r\nfrom being elided. This is done by creating a new ts.ImportDeclaration for\r\nthe imports with the same ts.ImportClause. A test verifies that this works.\r\n","Url":"https://github.com/angular/angular/pull/29266","RelatedDescription":"Closed or merged PR \"fix(ivy): reuse default exports in type-to-value references\" (#29266)"},{"Id":"420157176","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2019-03-12T22:43:46","Actor":"devversion","Number":"29262","RawContent":null,"Title":"fix(ivy): platform module bootstrap does not resolve resources [patch]","State":"closed","Body":"Patch version of #29083 ","Url":"https://github.com/angular/angular/pull/29262","RelatedDescription":"Closed or merged PR \"fix(ivy): platform module bootstrap does not resolve resources [patch]\" (#29262)"},{"Id":"420218340","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2019-03-12T21:55:46","Actor":"devversion","Number":"29270","RawContent":null,"Title":"ci: run legacy saucelabs for every build [patch]","State":"closed","Body":"Patch version of #29255 ","Url":"https://github.com/angular/angular/pull/29270","RelatedDescription":"Closed or merged PR \"ci: run legacy saucelabs for every build [patch]\" (#29270)"},{"Id":"420215781","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2019-03-12T21:33:02","Actor":"matsko","Number":"29269","RawContent":null,"Title":"fix(ivy): ensure template styles/classes are applied before directives are instantiated","State":"open","Body":"Angular Ivy interprets inline static style/class attribute values as instructions that\r\nare processed whilst an element gets created.

Until now the locale was hard coded as `en-US`.\r\nThis PR refactors all of the localization code that was previously living in `@angular/common`. Everything but the locale data has been moved to `@angular/core`, making it possible to get the correct plural form. Since we plan on refactoring all of this later and we didn't want to create a breaking change for that now, everything is still publicly exported by `@angular/common`, but the code is actually in `@angular/core`, making it possible to use it in core (core cannot import from common).\r\nFor compatibility reasons, if you use ivy with AOT and bootstrap your app with `bootstrapModule` then the `LOCALE_ID` token will be set automatically for ivy, which is then used to get the correct plural form.\r\n⚠️ For JIT you need to call `ɵsetLocaleId` manually to define the `LOCALE_ID` before bootstrap. Same thing if you don't use the compat mode and start your app with `renderComponent`. We expect this to change once we start adding the new i18n APIs, so don't rely on this function (there's a reason why it's a private export).","Url":"https://github.com/angular/angular/pull/29249","RelatedDescription":"Open PR \"feat(ivy): use i18n locale data to determine the plural form of ICU expressions\"

So another option is a script to change port in the file before run.\r\n\r\n\r\n","Url":"https://github.com/angular/angular-cli/issues/13891","RelatedDescription":"Open issue \"Ability to override the port when running \"ng test\"\" (#13891)"},{"Id":"420155399","IsPullRequest":false,"CreatedAt":"2019-03-12T19:58:58","Actor":"oleksiipotiekhin","Number":"13888","RawContent":null,"Title":"import { AppModule } from './app/app.module';","State":"closed","Body":"# 🐞 Bug report\r\n### Command (mark with an `x`)\r\n```\r\n- [ ] new\r\n- [ ] build\r\n- [ ] serve\r\n- [ ] test\r\n- [ ] e2e\r\n- [ ] generate\r\n- [x] add\r\n- [ ] update\r\n- [ ] lint\r\n- [ ] xi18n\r\n- [ ] run\r\n- [ ] config\r\n- [ ] help\r\n- [ ] version\r\n- [ ] doc\r\n```\r\n### Is this a regression?\r\nNo\r\n### Description\r\nBy changing **AppModule** import url in **main.ts** `ng add @angular/pwa` or `ng add @angular/material` stop working because `getAppModulePath` from `ng-ast-utils.ts` combine `${mainDir}` from **angular.json** and `${moduleRelativePath}` from **main.ts**\r\n\r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/30025319/54227180-af4e3c00-44ff-11e9-9cf8-fbd8ac5f6529.png)\r\n\r\n## 🔬 Minimal Reproduction\r\nEdit **tsconfig.json**\r\n\r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/30025319/54226579-6d70c600-44fe-11e9-8077-dfc99b2abe9e.png)\r\n\r\nChange the **AppModule** import url\r\n\r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/30025319/54225932-fe46a200-44fc-11e9-8188-763855bbce88.png)\r\n\r\nRun `ng add @angular/pwa` or `ng add @angular/material`\r\n## 🔥 Exception or Error\r\n<pre><code>Could not read file (/src/@app/app.module.ts).\r\n</code></pre>\r\n## 🌍 Your Environment\r\n<pre><code>Angular CLI: 7.3.5\r\nNode: 10.15.1\r\nOS: win32 x64\r\nAngular: 7.2.8\r\n... animations, common, compiler, compiler-cli, core, forms\r\n... language-service, platform-browser, platform-browser-dynamic\r\n... router, service-worker\r\n\r\nPackage                           Version\r\n-----------------------------------------------------------\r\n@angular-devkit/architect         0.13.5\r\n@angular-devkit/build-angular     0.13.5\r\n@angular-devkit/build-optimizer   0.13.5\r\n@angular-devkit/build-webpack     0.13.5\r\n@angular-devkit/core              7.3.5\r\n@angular-devkit/schematics        7.3.5\r\n@angular/cdk                      7.3.3\r\n@angular/cli                      7.3.5\r\n@angular/fire                     5.1.1\r\n@angular/flex-layout              7.0.0-beta.23\r\n@angular/material                 7.3.3\r\n@angular/pwa                      0.12.4\r\n@ngtools/webpack                  7.3.5\r\n@schematics/angular               7.3.5\r\n@schematics/update                0.13.5\r\nrxjs                              6.3.3\r\ntypescript                        3.2.4\r\nwebpack                           4.29.0\r\n</code></pre>\r\n## 🔬Resolution\r\n`isRelativePath` function should be added to determine whether the path to **AppModule** from **main.ts** is relative or not","Url":"https://github.com/angular/angular-cli/issues/13888","RelatedDescription":"Closed issue \"import { AppModule } from './app/app.module';\" (#13888)"},{"Id":"420161418","IsPullRequest":false,"CreatedAt":"2019-03-12T19:54:38","Actor":"jzap71023","Number":"13889","RawContent":null,"Title":"ng build does not work with library","State":"closed","Body":"<!--🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅\r\n\r\nOh hi there! 😄\r\n\r\nTo expedite issue processing please search open and closed issues before submitting a new one.\r\nExisting issues often contain information about workarounds, resolution, or progress updates.\r\n\r\n🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅-->\r\n\r\n\r\n# 🐞 Bug report\r\n\r\n### Command (mark with an `x`)\r\n<!-- Can you pin-point the command or commands that are effected by this bug?

For example, exclude property can be useful here:\r\n`        \"serve\": {\r\n          \"builder\": \"@angular-devkit/build-angular:dev-server\",\r\n          \"options\": {\r\n            \"browserTarget\": \"hasib-apps:build\",\r\n            \"sourceMap\": {\r\n              \"scripts\": true,\r\n              \"styles\": false,\r\n              \"hidden\": false,\r\n              \"vendor\": true,\r\n              \"exclude\": [\r\n                \"node_modules/devexpress-reporting\"\r\n                ]\r\n            }            \r\n          },\r\n          \"configurations\": {\r\n            \"production\": {\r\n              \"browserTarget\": \"hasib-apps:build:production\"\r\n            }\r\n          }\r\n        },`\r\n\r\n\r\n### Describe alternatives you've considered\r\n\r\n1) Attempted to use \"ng eject\" to extract webpack.config.json and configure it to exclude  \"node_modules/devexpress-reporting\" but got the error:\r\n\r\n`The 'eject' command has been disabled and will be removed completely in 8.0.\r\nThe new configuration format provides increased flexibility to modify the\r\nconfiguration of your workspace without ejecting.\r\n\r\nThere are several projects that can be used in conjuction with the new\r\nconfiguration format that provide the benefits of ejecting without the maintenance\r\noverhead.  One such project is ngx-build-plus found here:\r\nhttps://github.com/manfredsteyer/ngx-build-plus`\r\n\r\n2) Disabled vendor source maps when I don't necessarily need them, to avoid seeing this warning for this vendor.\r\n\r\n\r\n","Url":"https://github.com/angular/angular-cli/issues/13881","RelatedDescription":"Closed issue \"Allow excluding specific source maps\" (#13881)"},{"Id":"419813268","IsPullRequest":false,"CreatedAt":"2019-03-12T06:13:16","Actor":"sahilbabbar","Number":"13883","RawContent":null,"Title":"Generate component command working differently for different names","State":"closed","Body":"<!--🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅\r\n\r\nOh hi there! 😄\r\n\r\nTo expedite issue processing please search open and closed issues before submitting a new one.\r\nExisting issues often contain information about workarounds, resolution, or progress updates.\r\n\r\n🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅-->\r\n\r\n\r\n# 🐞 Bug report\r\n\r\n### Command (mark with an `x`)\r\n<!-- Can you pin-point the command or commands that are effected by this bug? -->\r\n<!-- ✍️edit: -->\r\n```\r\n- [ ] new\r\n- [ ] build\r\n- [ ] serve\r\n- [ ] test\r\n- [ ] e2e\r\n- [x] generate\r\n- [ ] add\r\n- [ ] update\r\n- [ ] lint\r\n- [ ] xi18n\r\n- [ ] run\r\n- [ ] config\r\n- [ ] help\r\n- [ ] version\r\n- [ ] doc\r\n```\r\n\r\n### Is this a regression?\r\n\r\n<!-- Did this behavior use to work in the previous version? -->\r\n<!-- ✍️--> Not sure.

regression?\r\n\r\nNo\r\n\r\n### Description\r\n\r\nWhen using Webpack `done` hook together with `ng build --watch` command, the `stats` object, passed to the hook as a parameter doesn't always have `stats.compilation.errors` array filled even if there are errors and the build has failed.\r\n\r\nAlthough it could be seen as a minor issue, it makes impossible using of popup build notifiers like the `webpack-notifier` because these rely on errors presence in the `stats` object.\r\n\r\n## 🔬 Minimal Reproduction\r\n\r\nThe sample code could be found at\r\n[https://github.com/Usurer/bugreports.NgCliBuildWebpackHooks](https://github.com/Usurer/bugreports.NgCliBuildWebpackHooks)\r\n\r\n* Create a new Angular app via `ng new my-app`\r\n* Create a simple Webpack plugin that would use the `done` [hook](https://webpack.js.org/api/compiler-hooks/#done):\r\n\r\n```javascript\r\nvar MyWebpackPlugin = module.exports = function() {};\r\n\r\nMyWebpackPlugin.prototype.compilationDone = function(stats) {\r\n    console.log('Errors:');\r\n    console.info(stats.compilation.errors);\r\n};\r\n\r\nMyWebpackPlugin.prototype.apply = function(compiler) {\r\n  if (compiler.hooks) {\r\n    var plugin = { name: 'My Plugin' };\r\n\r\n    compiler.hooks.done.tap(plugin, this.compilationDone.bind(this));\r\n  } else {\r\n    compiler.plugin('done', this.compilationDone.bind(this));\r\n  }\r\n};\r\n```\r\n\r\n* Add custom webpack config by following [instructions](https://github.com/manfredsteyer/ngx-build-plus) for `ngx-build-plus`:\r\n\r\n  * run `ng add ngx-build-plus`\r\n  * add `webpack.partial.js` to the project root with the following contents:\r\n\r\n    ```javascript\r\n    const MyWebpackPlugin = require('./myWebpackPlugin');\r\n    module.exports = {\r\n        plugins: [ new MyWebpackPlugin() ]\r\n    }\r\n    ```\r\n\r\n* run `ng build --watch --extra-webpack-config webpack.partial.js`\r\n  Result as expected: no build errors and an empty errors array logged to console.\r\n* Now open `/src/app/app.component.ts` and add the following new line to the end of the file: `xxx;`\r\n\r\n* Check

The only change is that Default change detection strategy will be used instead of OnPush for table and row components.]\r\n\r\nThis resolves an issue with Ivy where change detection was not reflecting binding changes made to the row and cell templates in the component declaring the table.\r\n\r\nIn View Engine, change detection for a dynamically created view runs in two cases:\r\n1) When the view in which it was inserted is checked\r\n2) When the view in which it was declared is checked\r\n\r\nAs a result, if a dynamic view is inserted into an OnPush component, that view is not actually checked only \"on push\". It is also checked as often as its declaration view is checked (even if the insertion view is explicitly detached from change detection).\r\n\r\nFor this reason, marking `MatTable` as \"OnPush\" doesn't have much of an effect. It is built almost entirely of views that are declared elsewhere, so its change detection frequency is dependent on those declaration views. It also doesn't have any bindings inside its own view that would be protected by \"OnPush\", so marking it this way is effectively a noop and can be removed without performance regressions.\r\n\r\nIn Ivy, this change detection loophole has been closed, so  declaration views can no longer de-optimize OnPush components. This means bindings inherited from declaration views aren't updated by default if `MatTable` is OnPush (the embedded view would need to be marked dirty explicitly).\r\n\r\nTo avoid breaking changes when we transition to Ivy, it makes more sense to perpetuate the current behavior by removing the \"OnPush\" marker. As delineated earlier, this has no impact on View Engine. For Ivy, it would ensure bindings inherited from the declaration view are still checked by default.","Url":"https://github.com/angular/material2/pull/15440","RelatedDescription":"Closed or merged PR \"fix(table): use default change detection strategy on table\" (#15440)"},{"Id":"420226750","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2019-03-12T22:05:09","Actor":"crisbeto","Number":"15455","RawContent":null,"Title":"refactor(overlay): remove explicit subscription count","State":"open","Body":"Uses the observer count from the `Subject` itself, rather than counting it manually.\r\n\r\nRelates to #15441.","Url":"https://github.com/angular/material2/pull/15455","RelatedDescription":"Open PR \"refactor(overlay): remove explicit subscription count\" (#15455)"},{"Id":"420222972","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2019-03-12T21:53:47","Actor":"crisbeto","Number":"15454","RawContent":null,"Title":"fix(menu): prevent menu from collapsing to less than one item","State":"open","Body":"Currently we allow the menu it's height to collapse so that it becomes scrollable if it won't fit in the viewport, however this has the side effect that the user can make the menu go to zero height when they scroll away.
