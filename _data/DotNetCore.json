This is very similar to how we approached 2.x and 3.0 projects. As context, `master` branches produced 3.0 builds for the entire period of the 2.2 project.\r\n\r\nAt present, this change is only relevant if you contribute to .NET Core repositories. Otherwise, we recommend that you wait for the 5.0 Preview releases before installing this new version.\r\n\r\n## Discussion\r\nPlease share your thoughts on this change and see what others are saying at:\r\n\r\n[dotnet/core #3059](https://github.com/dotnet/core/issues/3059)\r\n\r\n## Details\r\n\r\nThe following repos have moved their master branches to \"5.0\":\r\n\r\n- [dotnet/coreclr](https://github.com/dotnet/coreclr)\r\n- [dotnet/corefx](https://github.com/dotnet/corefx)\r\n- [dotnet/core-setup](https://github.com/dotnet/core-setup)\r\n\r\nYou can see that [5.0 .NET Core Runtime builds](https://github.com/dotnet/core-setup#daily-builds) are now being built and published at dotnet/core-setup.\r\n\r\nIn large part, we switched `master` to 5.0 to enable to the community to contribute changes. As the .NET Core 3.0 released has progressed, we've had to increase scrutiny on the changes we will accept. Now that we've permanently branched for 3.0, we can accept a much broader set of changes. Please consider that to be an open invitation!\r\n\r\nNotably, [dotnet/core-sdk](https://github.com/dotnet/core-sdk) is not yet producing 5.0 builds. We expect that the dotnet/core-sdk master branch will continue as a 3.0 branch for 2-3 months while we finish up the .NET Core 3.0 project.\r\n\r\nAt present, there is no developer experience for 5.0. We are waiting on the dotnet/core-sdk repo to switch to 5.0. Switching your project file to target `netcoreapp5.0` won't do anything useful. We'll update this issue when a 5.0 SDK comes available."},{"Id":"9971220766","Type":"IssuesEvent","CreatedAt":"2019-07-08T23:25:31","Actor":"terrajobst","Repository":"dotnet/announcements","Organization":"dotnet","RawContent":null,"RelatedAction":"opened","RelatedUrl":"https://github.com/dotnet/announcements/issues/117","RelatedDescription":"Opened issue \"System.Text.Json usability study results\" (#117) at dotnet/announcements","RelatedBody":"We've performed a usability study on the new `System.Text.Json` APIs which will replace JSON.NET as the default JSON experience in .NET Core 3.0:\r\n\r\n* We focused on the primary \"getting started\" scenarios to validate that we picked the right type- and method names.\r\n* We simulated what we believe to be common error cases to validate that our exception messages are understandable and actionable.\r\n* Since we were short on time, we couldn't use the recruiting provided by the UX lab but instead brought in our own developers, which we recruited from the .NET engineering team\r\n\r\nThis has worked out well for us as we were able to get short term feedback which resulted in significant improvements to the overall API shape and usability.

Every person who started a scenario successfully finished it.\r\n    - We feel this validates that we picked the right scope for a 60 minute study of people from various backgrounds\r\n* Overall people liked the new API\r\n    - Key value prop for most people was the fact that \"it's now built in\"\r\n    - Very few mentioned perf and the ones that did thought that it probably wouldn't make a difference in their scenarios.\r\n    - Most people said they would prefer `System.Text.Json` for new APIs, but would stick to JSON.NET in code that already uses it.\r\n    - **[Action]** None, this is in line with what we expected.\r\n* Virtually everyone tried to google for sample code in the documentation\r\n    - Everyone found our blog post and online documentation\r\n    - People new to .NET were confused that JSON.NET and `System.Text.Json` weren't the same thing\r\n    - Everyone complained that the current docs are lacking, especially sample code.\r\n    - **[Action]** Docs are work in progress. We plan on shipping with a fully documented API surface and sample code.\r\n* Virtually everyone found the key type relatively quickly\r\n    - Some people were confused when types were static, rather than something that one can new up\r\n    - **[Action]** None. This is by-design as we try to reduce the number of allocations.\r\n* Virtually everyone had trouble selecting the correct method on\r\n  `JsonSerializer`\r\n    - We chose a very complicated naming convention\r\n    - **[Action]** We simplified it by using names that people in the study told us were looking for.\r\n* Most of our error messages were well received because they told people what\r\n  the problem is & how they can fix them.\r\n    - One error message was unclear because we reported an unexpected character when we could have reported that we didn't expect a comment.\r\n    - **[Action]** We've reworded the error message.\r\n    - We had one error message that was generated by a lower layer and provided an action item that doesn't make sense when people receive it when using the higher layer component.\r\n    - **[Action]** We've reworded the error message to be more generic so it makes sense for both kind of consumers.\r\n* Virtually everyone used the new Roslyn completion feature which will also show\r\n  types from namespaces not imported yet.\r\n    - However, virtually nobody realized that they were doing it.\r\n    - This caused confusion when people found other APIs that happen to include Json in them, specifically the old data contract serialization.\r\n    - **[Action]** Talk to the Roslyn IDE team to see if this something more people will run into. This could prove to be especially problematic for technologies that share type names (e.g. `UserControl` in WinForms and WPF) and both are referenced by the project.\r\n* Optional parameters and `async`/`await` are usability cliffs\r\n    - Many were confused by optional parameters and tried to pass them in, even though they didn't have to.\r\n    - **[Action]** Talk to the Roslyn IDE team to see if we can visualize them better in VS.\r\n    - **[Action]** Try to avoid heavy use of optional parameters for mainline APIs.\r\n    - Async is a very steep cliff. People have no idea what to do in their code to make async work. While IntelliSense shows the usage by prefixing it with await, people didn't notice that.\r\n    - **[Action]** Unclear; this is a broader issue.\r\n* Virtually nobody used F1 to get help for APIs\r\n    - *Surprise*. I expected more people to use <kbd>F1</kbd>.\r\n* Virtually everyone used F12 to explore the API (\"metadata view\")\r\n    - *Surprise*. I expected most people to explore the type via the\r\n      IntelliSense completion\r\n* Nobody used Object Browser to explorer the APIs\r\n    - *Surprise*. I expected at least some people to.\r\n\r\n## Discussion\r\n\r\nFor a discussion, please go to https://github.com/dotnet/corefx/issues/39304."}],"ResultType":"GitHubEvent"},"CoreCLR":{"Events":[{"Id":"10197687133","Type":"IssuesEvent","CreatedAt":"2019-08-13T01:36:10","Actor":"VincentBu","Repository":"dotnet/coreclr","Organization":"dotnet","RawContent":null,"RelatedAction":"opened","RelatedUrl":"https://github.com/dotnet/coreclr/issues/26139","RelatedDescription":"Opened issue \"Test failed: Interop\\PInvoke\\Delegate\\DelegateTest\\DelegateTest.cmd\" (#26139) at dotnet/coreclr","RelatedBody":"**Job:**\r\nhttps://helix.dot.net/api/2019-06-17/jobs/e15a2731-c82b-422d-88b0-cddf09a861cd/workitems/Interop/console\r\n\r\n**Failed tests:**\r\nInterop\\PInvoke\\Delegate\\DelegateTest\\DelegateTest.cmd\r\n\r\n**Log:**\r\n```\r\nInterop\\PInvoke\\Delegate\\DelegateTest\\DelegateTest.cmd [FAIL]\r\n      \r\n      Return code:      1\r\n      Raw output file:      C:\\dotnetbuild\\work\\e15a2731-c82b-422d-88b0-cddf09a861cd\\Work\\16efc325-4829-438b-85c0-fe7192d1c2a1\\Exec\\Interop\\PInvoke\\Reports\\Interop.PInvoke\\Delegate\\DelegateTest\\DelegateTest.output.txt\r\n      Raw output:\r\n      BEGIN EXECUTION\r\n       \"C:\\dotnetbuild\\work\\e15a2731-c82b-422d-88b0-cddf09a861cd\\Payload\\corerun.exe\" DelegateTest.exe \r\n      Expected: 100\r\n      Actual: -1073740940\r\n      END EXECUTION -

You can find it here: https://github.com/NitzanEgozy/dotnet/tree/master/testers/Unloading (cd out, run.bat)\r\nThe important part of the output:\r\n```\r\nClassLoadFinished: Plugin.PluginClass (140731382877856)\r\n...\r\nClassLoadFinished: Plugin.MyGenericTest (140731382879056)\r\n...\r\nClassLoadFinished: Plugin.MyGenList`1 <System.__Canon> (140731382880136)\r\nClassLoadFinished: Plugin.MyGenList`1 <System.String> (140731382880344)\r\n...\r\nERROR - can't retrieve moduleId\r\nClassUnloadStarted: Plugin.MyGenList`1 <Unknown> (140731382879688)\r\nClassUnloadStarted: Plugin.MyGenericTest (140731382879056)\r\nClassUnloadStarted: Plugin.PluginClass (140731382877856)\r\nClassUnloadStarted: Plugin.MyGenList`1 <System.__Canon> (140731382880136)\r\n```\r\nAs we can see, Plugin.MyGenList1 is loaded twice and unloaded twice. The load/unload for System.__Canon is fine (same ClassID). We have another Load/Unload set. The Load is for System.String, but the the unload is unknown (Can't retrieve moduleID, probably too late). They are of *different* ClassIDs. Also, the loaded ClassID (Plugin.MyGenList1 <System.String> (140731382880344)) is never unloaded, and the unloaded ClassID (Plugin.MyGenList1 <Unknown> (140731382879688)) is never loaded, nor do we get this ClassID in any other way.\r\n\r\nThis is a huge issue for profilers who rely on tracking currently loaded classes.","Url":"https://github.com/dotnet/coreclr/issues/26126","RelatedDescription":"Open issue \"Profiling API: Different ClassID in ClassLoad and ClassUnload callbacks\" (#26126)"},{"Id":"479407443","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2019-08-12T06:08:04","Actor":"AaronRobinsonMSFT","Number":"26120","RawContent":null,"Title":"Pass HRESULT instead of Win32 error code","State":"closed","Body":"A Win32 error code was being passed to `Marshal.ThrowExceptionForHR()` in [`TimerQueue.TickCount64`](https://github.com/dotnet/coreclr/blob/48ff0937552e540f21835391b693daf47ffabece/src/System.Private.CoreLib/shared/System/Threading/TimerQueue.Windows.cs#L25), but the API indicates it should be an `HRESULT`.

O(n^2) to O(n)","State":"open","Body":"Fixes #7398\r\nFixes #37572\r\nRelates to https://github.com/aspnet/Razor/issues/614 and many other customer accomodations that are no longer needed.\r\n\r\nHistory of this bug:  When constant folding a long sequence of string concatentations, there is an intermediate constant value for every left-hand operand.  So the total memory consumed to compute the whole concatenation was *O(n^2)*.  The compiler would simply perform this work and eventually run out of memory, simply crashing with no useful diagnostic.  Later, the concatenation implementation was instrumented so it would detect when it was likely to run out of memory soon, and would instead report a diagnostic at the last step. See https://github.com/dotnet/roslyn/commit/f177077665a5bef862014f1898b961d1759c9248.  Test `Bug529600()` was added to demonstrate that we produced a diagnostic.  However, the compiler still consumed *O(n^2)* memory for the concatenation and this test used to consume so much memory that it would cause other tests running in parallel to fail because they might not have enough memory to succeed.  So the test was disabled and eventually removed.  The compiler would still crash with programs containing large string concatenations, or consume huge amounts of memory and take a long time before reporting a diagnostic, so the underlying problem had not been addressed.\r\n\r\nHere we have revised the implementation of constant folding string concatenations so that it requires *O(n)* memory and remove the old instrumentation.  As a consequence the test `Bug529600()` now runs very quickly and does not consume gobs of memory.\r\n","Url":"https://github.com/dotnet/roslyn/pull/37915","RelatedDescription":"Open PR \"Reduce memory consumption for string concatenation from O(n^2) to O(n)\" (#37915)"},{"Id":"479792626","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2019-08-12T18:41:45","Actor":"AlekseyTs","Number":"37914","RawContent":null,"Title":"Allow implementation of virtual interface methods in VB.","State":"open","Body":"Closes #35821.","Url":"https://github.com/dotnet/roslyn/pull/37914","RelatedDescription":"Open PR \"Allow implementation of virtual interface methods in VB.\" (#37914)"},{"Id":"479777869","IsPullRequest":false,"CreatedAt":"2019-08-12T18:06:13","Actor":"jnm2","Number":"37913","RawContent":null,"Title":"Generated GetHashCode implementation falls foul of BCL nullability of IEqualityComparer<>.GetHashCode","State":"open","Body":"**Version Used**: Visual Studio 16.2.1, `<LangVersion>preview</LangVersion>`, `<Nullable>enable</Nullable>`\r\nGenerate equality members for:\r\n\r\n```cs\r\nstruct Foo\r\n{\r\n    public string?

The test has been adapted to test some of those constructs for 3.0 instead of testing for `My.*` working.\r\n\r\nAlso fix related issue that could cause a bug or misconfigured project to result in the .NET Framework VB compiler trying to reference the .NET Framework Microsoft.VisualBasic.dll in the runtime directory instead of the resolved Microsoft.VisualBasic.dll.","Url":"https://github.com/dotnet/sdk/pull/3513","RelatedDescription":"Closed or merged PR \"React to removal of types in Microsoft.VisualBasic.Core.dll\" (#3513)"},{"Id":"478985601","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2019-08-09T13:24:47","Actor":"dotnet-maestro[bot]","Number":"3519","RawContent":null,"Title":"[release/3.0.1xx] Update dependencies from dotnet/core-setup","State":"open","Body":"This pull request updates the following dependencies\r\n\r\n[marker]: <> (Begin:ee7760b1-2875-4869-d002-08d7114cdbad)\r\n## From https://github.com/dotnet/core-setup\r\n- **Build**: 20190811.11\r\n- **Date Produced**: 8/11/2019 11:48 PM\r\n- **Commit**: 91004b0eb6f484c56f50d0f428988268e3ef455d\r\n- **Branch**: refs/heads/release/3.0\r\n- **Updates**:\r\n  - **Microsoft.NET.HostModel** -> 3.0.0-preview9-19411-11\r\n\r\n[marker]: <> (End:ee7760b1-2875-4869-d002-08d7114cdbad)\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n","Url":"https://github.com/dotnet/sdk/pull/3519","RelatedDescription":"Open PR \"[release/3.0.1xx] Update dependencies from dotnet/core-setup\" (#3519)"},{"Id":"478141934","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2019-08-09T00:33:03","Actor":"peterhuene","Number":"3516","RawContent":null,"Title":"Separate supported target framework into app/standard lists.","State":"closed","Body":"#### Description\r\n\r\nThis commit makes the `SupportedTargetFramework` items be composed of\r\n`NETCoreApp` and `NETStandard` versions so that other SDKs, such as\r\nWindowsDesktop, can selectively remove unsupported target frameworks from these\r\nlists.\r\n\r\nFixes #3438.\r\n\t\t\r\n#### Customer Impact\r\n\r\nWithout this change, the Windows Desktop SDK cannot easily filter out unsupported target frameworks.\r\n\t\t\r\n#### Regression?\r\n\r\nNo.\r\n\t\t\r\n#### Risk\r\n\r\nLow","Url":"https://github.com/dotnet/sdk/pull/3516","RelatedDescription":"Closed or merged PR \"Separate supported target framework into app/standard lists.\" (#3516)"},{"Id":"478473456","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2019-08-08T17:18:21","Actor":"dotnet-maestro[bot]","Number":"3518","RawContent":null,"Title":"[release/3.0.1xx] Update dependencies from dotnet/core-setup","State":"closed","Body":"This pull request updates the following dependencies\r\n\r\n[marker]: <> (Begin:ee7760b1-2875-4869-d002-08d7114cdbad)\r\n## From https://github.com/dotnet/core-setup\r\n- **Build**: 20190807.10\r\n- **Date Produced**: 8/7/2019 9:45 PM\r\n- **Commit**: 88e391bb71d5659c28fdb23434752cab6878cc06\r\n- **Branch**: refs/heads/release/3.0\r\n- **Updates**:\r\n  - **Microsoft.NET.HostModel** -> 3.0.0-preview9-19407-10\r\n\r\n[marker]: <> (End:ee7760b1-2875-4869-d002-08d7114cdbad)\r\n\r\n","Url":"https://github.com/dotnet/sdk/pull/3518","RelatedDescription":"Closed or merged PR \"[release/3.0.1xx] Update dependencies from dotnet/core-setup\" (#3518)"},{"Id":"478472398","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2019-08-08T17:18:08","Actor":"dotnet-maestro[bot]","Number":"3517","RawContent":null,"Title":"[release/3.0.1xx] Update dependencies from dotnet/core-setup","State":"closed","Body":"This pull request updates the following dependencies\r\n\r\n[marker]: <> (Begin:ee7760b1-2875-4869-d002-08d7114cdbad)\r\n## From https://github.com/dotnet/core-setup\r\n- **Build**: 20190807.10\r\n- **Date Produced**: 8/7/2019 9:45 PM\r\n- **Commit**: 88e391bb71d5659c28fdb23434752cab6878cc06\r\n- **Branch**: refs/heads/release/3.0\r\n- **Updates**:\r\n  - **Microsoft.NET.HostModel** -> 3.0.0-preview9-19407-10\r\n\r\n[marker]: <> (End:ee7760b1-2875-4869-d002-08d7114cdbad)\r\n\r\n","Url":"https://github.com/dotnet/sdk/pull/3517","RelatedDescription":"Closed or merged PR \"[release/3.0.1xx] Update dependencies from dotnet/core-setup\" (#3517)"},{"Id":"477070233","IsPullRequest":false,"CreatedAt":"2019-08-07T22:33:41","Actor":"wli3","Number":"3508","RawContent":null,"Title":"Warning from RAR with hint path has extra new line","State":"closed","Body":"Given a hint path has extra new line.

In the future, we should do more API focused UX studies 😊\r\n\r\n## Tasks\r\n\r\n| # | Description                            | Code\r\n|:--|:---------------------------------------|:-----\r\n| 1 | Serialize and pretty print             | [Link](https://github.com/ahsonkhan/JsonUxStudy/blob/master/UxScenarios/Scenario1/Program.cs#L19-L31)\r\n| 2 | Deserialize with trailing comma        | [Link](https://github.com/ahsonkhan/JsonUxStudy/blob/master/UxScenarios/Scenario2/Program.cs#L19-L25)\r\n| 3 | Deserialize with custom property names | [Link](https://github.com/ahsonkhan/JsonUxStudy/blob/master/UxScenarios/Scenario3/Program.cs#L30-L45)\r\n| 4 | Read with DOM                          | [Link](https://github.com/ahsonkhan/JsonUxStudy/blob/master/UxScenarios/Scenario4/Program.cs#L20-L35)\r\n| 5 | Pretty print an existing JSON file     | [Link](https://github.com/ahsonkhan/JsonUxStudy/blob/master/UxScenarios/Scenario5/Program.cs#L26-L34)\r\n\r\n## Hypotheses\r\n\r\nWe expect developers to...\r\n\r\n| # | Description                                            | Result\r\n|:--|:-------------------------------------------------------|:---------------\r\n| 1 | ...assume the APIs are similar/identical to JSON.NET   |  Validated\r\n| 2 | ...complete tasks 1-4 successfully                     |  Validated\r\n| 3 | ...struggle/unable to complete the task 5, because it requires working with two different components which is very different from JSON.NET |  Invalidated\r\n| 4 | ...not look at documentation for most of their coding as IntelliSense is good enough |  Invalidated\r\n| 5 | ...be happy with the experience of using the API                                     |  Validated\r\n| 6 | ...plan on using `System.Text.Json` for their next JSON task                         |  Partially Validated\r\n\r\n##  Key Observations\r\n\r\n* Everyone completed scenarios #1-#3, 2 didn't complete #4, 6 didn't complete #5\r\n    - The reason was always \"out of time\". Every person who started a scenario successfully finished it.\r\n    - We feel this validates that we picked the right scope for a 60 minute study of people from various backgrounds\r\n* Overall people liked the new API\r\n    - Key value prop for most people was the fact that \"it's now built in\"\r\n    - Very few mentioned perf and the ones that did thought that it probably wouldn't make a difference in their scenarios.\r\n    - Most people said they would prefer `System.Text.Json` for new APIs, but would stick to JSON.NET in code that already uses it.\r\n    - **[Action]** None, this is in line with what we expected.\r\n* Virtually everyone tried to google for sample code in the documentation\r\n    - Everyone found our blog post and online documentation\r\n    - People new to .NET were confused that JSON.NET and `System.Text.Json` weren't the same thing\r\n    - Everyone complained that the current docs are lacking, especially sample code.\r\n    - **[Action]** Docs are work in progress. We plan on shipping with a fully documented API surface and sample code.\r\n* Virtually everyone found the key type relatively quickly\r\n    - Some people were confused when types were static, rather than something that one can new up\r\n    - **[Action]** None. This is by-design as we try to reduce the number of allocations.\r\n* Virtually everyone had trouble selecting the correct method on\r\n  `JsonSerializer`\r\n    - We chose a very complicated naming convention\r\n    - **[Action]** We simplified it by using names that people in the study told us were looking for.\r\n* Most of our error messages were well received because they told people what\r\n  the problem is & how they can fix them.\r\n    - One error message was unclear because we reported an unexpected character when we could have reported that we didn't expect a comment.\r\n    - **[Action]** We've reworded the error message.\r\n    - We had one error message that was generated by a lower layer and provided an action item that doesn't make sense when people receive it when using the higher layer component.\r\n    - **[Action]** We've reworded the error message to be more generic so it makes sense for both kind of consumers.\r\n* Virtually everyone used the new Roslyn completion feature which will also show\r\n  types from namespaces not imported yet.\r\n    - However, virtually nobody realized that they were doing it.\r\n    - This caused confusion when people found other APIs that happen to include Json in them, specifically the old data contract serialization.\r\n    - **[Action]** Talk to the Roslyn IDE team to see if this something more people will run into. This could prove to be especially problematic for technologies that share type names (e.g. `UserControl` in WinForms and WPF) and both are referenced by the project.\r\n* Optional parameters and `async`/`await` are usability cliffs\r\n    - Many were confused by optional parameters and tried to pass them in, even though they didn't have to.\r\n    - **[Action]** Talk to the Roslyn IDE team to see if we can visualize them better in VS.\r\n    - **[Action]** Try to avoid heavy use of optional parameters for mainline APIs.\r\n    - Async is a very steep cliff. People have no idea what to do in their code to make async work. While IntelliSense shows the usage by prefixing it with await, people didn't notice that.\r\n    - **[Action]** Unclear; this is a broader issue.\r\n* Virtually nobody used F1 to get help for APIs\r\n    - *Surprise*. I expected more people to use <kbd>F1</kbd>.\r\n* Virtually everyone used F12 to explore the API (\"metadata view\")\r\n    - *Surprise*. I expected most people to explore the type via the\r\n      IntelliSense completion\r\n* Nobody used Object Browser to explorer the APIs\r\n    - *Surprise*. I expected at least some people to.\r\n\r\n## Discussion\r\n\r\nFor a discussion, please go to https://github.com/dotnet/corefx/issues/39304.","Url":"https://github.com/dotnet/announcements/issues/117","RelatedDescription":"Open issue \"System.Text.Json usability study results\" (#117)"},{"Id":"465034831","IsPullRequest":false,"CreatedAt":"2019-07-08T03:13:38","Actor":"leecow","Number":"116","RawContent":null,"Title":"Updates to releases.json (.NET Core release metadata)","State":"open","Body":"**The changes described in this issue will be live with the .NET Core July update on 7/9/2019.**\r\n\r\nThe releases.json files (e.g. [2.2 releases.json](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dotnet/core/master/release-notes/2.2/releases.json)) are comprehensive metadata files which capture details of each .NET Core release. These files, along with the top level [releases-index.json](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dotnet/core/master/release-notes/releases-index.json), are becoming increasingly important .NET Core release assets. These files, one for each major.minor channel, are relied upon by many to detect when updates for .NET Core are available, discover security update details and other uses.\r\n\r\nChanges are sometimes necessary, and the growing dependencies require that we treat compatibility of the schema with the utmost care. This announcement describes an addition to the releases.json schema.\r\n\r\n## SDK Versions and Visual Studio\r\n\r\nBecause of current .NET Core SDK product construction dependencies, there is a hard link between the Runtime, SDK, toolset (compilers, MSBuild, NuGet, and other components), and Visual Studio. Simplistically, this means that when anything updates, everything updates. The unfortunate result of this linking is that multiple versions of the SDK are released with each monthly update for each supported versions of Visual Studio. For example, the May Update for .NET Core 2.2 included the 2.2.5 runtime, 2.2.107 SDK for Visual Studio 2017 and 2.2.204 for Visual Studio 2019 and yet another pair of SDK versions for .NET Core 2.1. An example of this is the [2.2.5 Release Notes](https://github.com/dotnet/core/blob/master/release-notes/2.2/2.2.5/2.2.5.md). \r\n\r\nThis is a confusing situation and we are working to mitigate the need to release multiple SDKs with .NET Core 3.0. The need for multiple SDK versions will persist for 2.1 LTS.\r\n\r\n## Adding the SDKS array\r\n\r\nTo appropriately model multiple SDKs per release, we are adding an SDKs array to releases.json, which will contain SDK objects. The top-level SDK object will represent the highest versioned SDK for a given update. Using the previous 2.2.5 update example, SDK 2.2.204 is in the top SDK object as well as duplicated in the SDKS array. All other applicable 2.2* SDK objects are included in the SDKS array. The SDK objects within the array will carry specific Visual Studio compatibility and version inclusion information to provide appropriate context.\r\n\r\nHere is an example of the new array based on the upcoming July update.\r\nAgain, this will be additive and the previous SDK object will include the highest SDK version for the release.\r\n\r\n```json\r\n{\r\n    \"sdk\": {\r\n        \"version\": \"2.2.301\",\r\n        \"version-display\": \"2.2.301\",\r\n        \"runtime-version\": \"2.2.6\",\r\n        \"vs-version\": \"16.1.3\",\r\n        \"vs-support\": \"Visual Studio 2019 (v16.1)\",\r\n        \"csharp-version\": \"7.3\",\r\n        \"fsharp-version\": \"4.5\",\r\n        \"vb-version\": null,\r\n        \"files\": []\r\n    },\r\n    \"sdks\": [\r\n        {\r\n            \"version\": \"2.2.301\",\r\n            \"version-display\": \"2.2.301\",\r\n            \"runtime-version\": \"2.2.6\",\r\n            \"vs-version\": \"16.1.3\",\r\n            \"vs-support\": \"Visual Studio 2019 (v16.1)\",\r\n            \"csharp-version\": \"7.3\",\r\n            \"fsharp-version\": \"4.5\",\r\n            \"vb-version\": null,\r\n            \"files\": []\r\n        },\r\n        {\r\n          \"version\": \"2.2.205\",\r\n          \"version-display\": \"2.2.205\",\r\n          \"runtime-version\": \"2.2.6\",\r\n          \"vs-version\": \"16.0.5\",\r\n          \"vs-support\": \"Visual Studio 2019 (v16.0)\",\r\n          \"csharp-version\": \"7.3\",\r\n          \"fsharp-version\": \"4.5\",\r\n          \"vb-version\": null,\r\n          \"files\": []\r\n        }\r\n    ]\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\n## vs-version and the Runtime\r\n\r\nThe same version of the runtime is included in multiple versions of Visual Studio. To account for this, the vs-version field is being updated to a comma-delimited string. The string will represent all versions of Visual Studio which first include the particular .NET Core update. Again, an example from the upcoming July Update.\r\n\r\n```json\r\n\"runtime\": {\r\n        \"version\": \"2.2.6\",\r\n        \"version-display\": \"2.2.6\",\r\n        \"vs-version\": \"15.9.13, 16.1.3, 16.2.0\",\r\n```\r\n\r\nThe same `vs-versions` changes will be seen in the `aspnetcore-runtime` object.\r\n\r\n## Future Enhancements\r\n\r\nThere are other improvements to the schema which have been suggested by the community which we are evaluating. Generally, theses enhancements are additive and should not represent compatibility compromises for existing parsers and similar announcements will be published ahead of any changes.\r\n\r\n","Url":"https://github.com/dotnet/announcements/issues/116","RelatedDescription":"Open issue \"Updates to releases.json (.NET Core release metadata)\" (#116)"},{"Id":"444065225","IsPullRequest":false,"CreatedAt":"2019-05-14T18:38:23","Actor":"TaraOverfield","Number":"114","RawContent":null,"Title":"May 2019 .NET Updates","State":"open","Body":"# May 2019 .NET Updates\r\n\r\nThe following .NET updates were released in May 2019.

Either target .NET Core 2.1 or lower, or use a version of the .NET SDK that supports .NET Core 2.2.`\r\n\r\nIf you downloaded the .NET Core SDK 2.2 between April 2 and April 12, 2019, the main [.NET downloads page](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/download/) included only 2.2.2nn. Starting April 12th, a new button marked \"Compatible with Visual Studio 2017\" is provided to target 2.2.1nn.

This article explains why this happens and how you can fix your installation.\r\n\r\nWhen Visual Studio can't find an appropriate version of the .NET Core SDK, you'll receive an error message. This may appear in the Error pane as NETSDK1045:\r\n\r\n\"The current .NET SDK does not support targeting .NET Core 2...\"\r\n\r\nYou can check what .NET Core SDKs you have on your machine with the following command:\r\n\r\n```bash\r\ndotnet --list-sdks\r\n```\r\n\r\nUnless you have a global.json file, when you use `dotnet` from the command line, the latest .NET Core SDK is used.\r\n\r\n> [TIP!] \r\n> Open a command prompt and try to build with `dotnet build`. If the command line build works, but Visual Studio doesn't suggestions in this article may help.\r\n\r\nThe last two digits of the .NET Core SDK version numbers are in the format are a patch number, which is represented by `nn` in this article because we will continue to service them to include the latest runtimes. To find out more, vist the [Overview of how .NET Core is versioned page](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/core/versions/).\r\n\r\n## Fixes for Common Problems\r\n\r\n### Visual Studio 2017 can't target .NET Core 2.2\r\n\r\nIf you receive the error message in Visual Studio 2017:\r\n\r\n`The current .NET SDK does not support targeting .NET Core 2.2… Either target .NET Core 2.1 or lower, or use a version of the .NET SDK that supports .NET Core 2.2.`\r\n\r\nUse `dotnet --list-sdks` to ensure you have .NET Core SDK 2.2.1nn. As an example, 2.2.106 would be a valid entry.\r\n\r\nIf you downloaded the .NET Core SDK 2.2 after April 2, 2019, version 2.2.2nn (such as 2.2.203) is listed first and is the highest version available. However, Visual Studio 2017 requires 2.2.1nn (such as 2.2.106). .NET Core SDK 2.2.2nn works with Visual Studio 2019. Visual Studio 2017 and Visual Studio 2019 can be installed side by side, but this requires both .NET Core SDK 2.2.1nn and .NET Core SDK 2.2.2nn to develop .NET Core 2.2 applications.\r\n\r\nTo download .NET Core SDK 2.2.2nn, visit the [.NET downloads page](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/download/dotnet-core/2.2).\r\n\r\n### Visual Studio 2017 can't target .NET Core 2.1\r\n\r\nIf you receive this error message in Visual Studio 2017:\r\n\r\n`The current .NET SDK does not support targeting .NET Core 2.1. Either target .NET Core 2.0 or lower, or use a version of the .NET SDK that supports .NET Core 2.1.`\r\n\r\nUse `dotnet --list-sdks` to ensure you have .NET Core SDK 2.1.5nn. As an example, 2.1.505 would be a valid entry. \r\n\r\nThis problem occurs of you manually uninstall the 2.1.5nn version.\r\n\r\nThe Visual Studio 2019 installation will not remove this file and Visual Studio 2017 will continue to work side by side.\r\n\r\nTo reinstall .NET Core SDK 2.1.5nn, visit the [.NET downloads page](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/download/dotnet-core/2.1).\r\n\r\n### Visual Studio 2019 can't target .NET Core 3.0 Preview\r\n\r\nIf you receive this error message in Visual Studio 2019:\r\n\r\n`The current .NET SDK does not support targeting .NET Core 2.1. Either target .NET Core 2.0 or lower, or use a version of the .NET SDK that supports .NET Core 2.1.`\r\n\r\nUse `dotnet --list-sdks` to ensure you have .NET Core SDK 3.0.100-preview... As an example, SDK 3.0.100-preview3-010431 would be a valid entry.\r\n\r\nTo install .NET Core SDK 3.0.1nn preview, visit the [.NET downloads page](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/download/dotnet-core/3.0).\r\n\r\nIn Visual Studio, go to `Tools\\Options\\Projects and Solutions\\.NET Core` and check the box `Use Previews of the .NET Core SDK`.\r\n\r\n> [NOTE!]\r\n> This option will be moving to `Tools\\Options\\Environment` and renamed `Preview Features` in Visual Studio 2019 version 16.1 Preview 2.\r\n\r\nIf you are targeting .NET Core 3.0 preview, the [C# language version will be C# 8.0 Preview by default](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/visualstudio/releases/2019/release-notes#csharp-defaults) allowing you to use new C# features.\r\n\r\n## Understand the relationship between .NET Core SDKs and Visual Studio build tools\r\n\r\nVisual Studio has its own copies of tools like MSBuild, NuGet and the compilers. If you install the .NET Core workload, it also installs the .NET Core SDK which has versions of these tools and provides tasks and targets. These two versions are built from the same repositories, but target .NET Framework and .NET Core respectively. \r\n\r\nWhen you build a .NET Core project in Visual Studio, it uses Visual Studio's copy of MSBuild, but the tasks and targets are supplied from the selected version of the .NET Core SDK. \r\n\r\nWhen you upgrade the .NET Core SDK, you get new tasks and targets. These new tasks and targets may contain features that are not supported by older versions of MSBuild. Like all of the .NET Core SDK, MSBuild is backwards compatible. It is not forwards compatible.\r\n\r\nThis generally works well, but requires a guarantee that the tasks and targets work with the MSBuild version. To ensure this, each .NET Core SDK indicates an MSBuild version range that is used by Visual Studio to determine compatibility. Versions of the .NET Core SDK that have a higher MSBuild identifier than expected are ignored by Visual Studio. In the normal case, this simply means you use the tasks and targets that were installed with your version of Visual Studio.\r\n\r\nBecause of this, you may have many versions of the .NET Core SDK on your machine and Visual Studio still fail to find one it considers appropriate. This is compounded by a poor error message, which we cannot fully correct because it is from the old version of the .NET Core SDK on your machine. Confusion is also compounded by a complex non-linear release matrix that makes it difficult to predict the right .NET Core SDK to select. We are working to improve all this. \r\n\r\n## The Visual Studio / .NET Core SDK support matrix\r\n\r\nThe last two digits of the .NET Core SDK version number are a patch number, which are represented by a `nn` in this table. You can learn more about .NET Core SDK and .NET Core Runtime versioning at the [Overview of how .NET Core is versioned page](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/core/versions/).\r\n\r\nThe following table shows which Visual Studio versions and .NET Core SDKs are compatible and how they are acquired if you are working with Visual Studio. \r\n\r\n| .NET Core SDK | .NET Core Runtime | Compatible Visual Studio | MSBuild | Notes                                     |\r\n|---------------|-------------------|--------------------------|---------|-------------------------------------------|\r\n| 2.1.5nn       | 2.1               | 2017                     | 15      | Installed as part of VS 2017 version 15.9 |\r\n| 2.1.6nn       | 2.1               | 2019                     | 16      | Installed as part of VS 2019              |\r\n| 2.2.1nn       | 2.2               | 2017                     | 15      | Installed manually                        |\r\n| 2.2.2nn       | 2.2               | 2019                     | 16      | Installed as part of VS 2019              |\r\n| 3.0.1nn       | 3.0 (Preview)     | 2019                     | 16      | Installed manually                        |\r\n\r\nVisual Studio 2017 cannot work with .NET Core SDK 2.1.6nn or 2.2.2nn.\r\n\r\nTo find out more about removing older versions of the .NET Core Runtime and .NET Core SDK, visit the [How to remove the .NET Core Runtime and SDK page](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/core/versions/remove-runtime-sdk-versions?tabs=macos).\r\n\r\nTo download the .NET Core SDK, visit the [.NET downloads page](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/download/dotnet-core).","Url":"https://github.com/dotnet/announcements/issues/108","RelatedDescription":"Open issue \".NET Core SDK 2.2.2nn and 2.1.6nn do not work with Visual Studio 2017\" (#108)"},{"Id":"432081093","IsPullRequest":false,"CreatedAt":"2019-04-11T15:16:43","Actor":"KathleenDollard","Number":"107","RawContent":null,"Title":"Limit DotNetCliToolReference Tools to .NET Core 2.2 and Below","State":"open","Body":"# Limit DotNetCliToolReference Tools to .NET Core 2.2 and Below\r\n\r\n.NET Core 3 takes the next step in the .NET Core tool strategy with local tools.

This issue would occur much more frequently if targeting .NET Core 3.0 was allowed. Restricting tools to target only .NET Core 2.2 and below means existing scenarios to continue to work (as well as they previously did), regardless of the framework version targeted by the project or the current .NET Core SDK. \r\n\r\nThe new .NET Core tool strategy avoids this flaw in restore strategy and offers other benefits, like the ability to author one type of tool and install it in different ways depending on project and user needs.\r\n\r\nWe look forward to your feedback on .NET Core Local Tools, and on challenges you face moving away from DotNetCliToolReference tools. \r\n\r\n[dotnet/sdk #3057](https://github.com/dotnet/sdk/pull/3057)","Url":"https://github.com/dotnet/announcements/issues/107","RelatedDescription":"Open issue \"Limit DotNetCliToolReference Tools to .NET Core 2.2 and Below\" (#107)"},{"Id":"431012407","IsPullRequest":false,"CreatedAt":"2019-04-09T14:51:18","Actor":"MichaelSimons","Number":"106","RawContent":null,"Title":".NET Core SDK container images now contain the Visual Studio 2019 toolset","State":"open","Body":"# .NET Core SDK container images now contain the Visual Studio 2019 toolset\r\n\r\n.NET Core SDK container images now include Visual Studio 2019 tools.

There are two primary reasons for this change:\r\n\r\n* Syndicate Microsoft-provided container images to multiple registries, like Docker Hub and Red Hat.\r\n* Use Microsoft Azure as a global CDN for delivering Microsoft-provided container images.\r\n\r\nYou will use and see MCR as a storage back-end for Microsoft images. The primary way you learn about Microsoft container images and tags will be through a registry, which for most users will continue to be Docker Hub. Most of the experience you've had browsing for .NET Core container images will continue unchanged with this new model. The Docker Hub URLs you've used for Microsoft repos will continue to work, and forward to updated locations on Docker Hub. Existing Docker Hub will images will be maintained as-is.\r\n\r\nSee [.NET Core Container Images now Published to Microsoft Container Registry](https://devblogs.microsoft.com/dotnet/net-core-container-images-now-published-to-microsoft-container-registry/) for the most updated information on our use of MCR.\r\n\r\n## Discussion\r\nPlease share your thoughts on this change and see what others are saying at:\r\n\r\n* [dotnet-docker #935](https://github.com/dotnet/dotnet-docker/issues/935)\r\n\r\n## Starting with .NET Core nightly repo\r\n\r\nOn the .NET team, we started our [transition to MCR](https://github.com/dotnet/dotnet-docker/issues/745) with the .NET Core \"nightly\" repo. [dotnet-nightly](dockerhub.com/r/microsoft/dotnet-nightly) is now hosted on MCR and syndicated to Docker Hub. We started with the nightly repo in order to discover and fix any challenges we found with this new model before we move our higher-traffic primary container repository.\r\n\r\nWe will start publishing [dotnet](dockerhub.com/r/microsoft/dotnet) to MCR a bit later, in either February or March. This issue will be updated when that happens.\r\n\r\n## Repo Split\r\n\r\nThe [.NET Core repo](https://hub.docker.com/r/microsoft/dotnet) currently includes 4 major categories of tags: \r\n\r\n* `sdk`\r\n* `aspnetcore-runtime`\r\n* `runtime` \r\n* `runtime-deps`\r\n\r\nProviding all of the tags in one place has helped with discoverability but made for a repo with an enormous README that can be challenging to navigate and consume. It is large enough that we exceeded Docker Hub README limits and had to artificially make it smaller.\r\n\r\nGoing forward, we will provide a repo for each of the tag categories listed above. We'll also provide a \"product repo\" that will hierarchicaly group all of our repos together. This will satisfy discoverability needs so that it will be easy to find the tags you want.\r\n\r\nYou can already see this experience with [microsoft-dotnet-core-nightly](https://hub.docker.com/_/microsoft-dotnet-core-nightly). There are now multiple repos for our nightly builds:\r\n\r\n* [.NET Core Nightly product repo](https://hub.docker.com/_/microsoft-dotnet-core-nightly)\r\n* [.NET Core SDK Nightly repo](https://hub.docker.com/_/microsoft-dotnet-core-nightly-sdk/)\r\n* [.NET Core ASP.NET Core Nightly repo](https://hub.docker.com/_/microsoft-dotnet-core-nightly-aspnet/)\r\n* [.NET Core Runtime Nightly repo](https://hub.docker.com/_/microsoft-dotnet-core-nightly-runtime/)\r\n* [.NET Core Runtime-deps Nightly repo](https://hub.docker.com/_/microsoft-dotnet-core-nightly-runtime-deps/)\r\n\r\nThe same split will exist for the non-nightly stable repo (currently hosted at  [microsoft/dotnet](https://hub.docker.com/r/microsoft/dotnet)) when we start publishing it to MCR and syndicating it back to DockerHub.\r\n\r\n## Changes to registry URL\r\n\r\nThe biggest change is that your Dockerfiles need to be updated to point to the MCR registry in order get access to new .NET Core container tags. The same change is required for scripts or human operations that pull images via `docker pull`.\r\n\r\nThe following example shows the registry path, repo and tag for the .NET Core 2.2 \"Nightly\" SDK on MCR:\r\n\r\n```console\r\nmcr.microsoft.com/dotnet/core-nightly/sdk:2.2\r\n```\r\n\r\nAs comparison, the following repo and tag have been used to date for the .NET Core 2.2 \"Nightly\" SDK on Docker Hub:\r\n\r\n```console\r\nmicrosoft/dotnet-nightly:2.2-sdk\r\n```\r\n\r\nThe new repo URL is provided at each of the news repos. For example, the new .NET Core SDK \"nightly\" repo provides a box on the right where you can copy and paste the correct MCR-based repo syntax that you can use for `docker pull` or in `FROM` statements in your Dockerfiles.\r\n\r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/2608468/52811702-95c5eb80-304a-11e9-8de8-e6ea1f4b4d75.png)\r\n\r\n## Servicing existing Docker Hub tags\r\n\r\nWe will continue to service existing non-version-specific or floating tags on Docker Hub while the associated .NET Core version is supported. For example the `microsoft/dotnet:2.1-sdk` tag is a floating tag that will continue to be serviced for the lifetime of .NET Core 2.1. You can continue using floating tags without issue.\r\n\r\nIf you use non-floating tags, like `microsoft/dotnet:2.1.504-sdk-alpine`, then you will need to update your Dockerfile to use a new non-floating tag. No new non-floating tags will be published to `microsoft/dotnet` and `microsoft/dotnet-nightly` after we fully transition to MCR.\r\n\r\n.NET Core 3.0 Preview 3 and later will only be made available on MCR.\r\n\r\n## Microsoft is a Verified Publisher\r\n\r\nUntil now, Microsoft-provided container images were considered \"community images\". As part of this change, we are re-classifying Microsoft as a \"verified publisher\" on Docker Hub.

Congratulations, Alpine team! On the .NET team, we are committed to supporting new Alpine versions quickly, and also need to define a policy for older versions. This policy only applies for the container images that we publish.\r\n\r\n## Discussion\r\nPlease share your thoughts on this change and see what others are saying at:\r\n\r\n* [dotnet-docker #933](https://github.com/dotnet/dotnet-docker/issues/933)\r\n\r\n## Policy\r\n\r\nWe intend to establish the following policy for supporting Alpine with .NET Core container images:\r\n\r\n* Support new Alpine versions within 60 days of release (hopefully much less).\r\n* Support n-1 Alpine versions for 3 months after we support a new Alpine version.\r\n\r\nNote: The [.NET Core support policy](https://github.com/dotnet/core/blob/master/os-lifecycle-policy.md) may be broader. This policy is specific to the container images we produce.\r\n\r\n## Plans\r\n\r\nWe're in the process of [fixing issues required to support Alpine 3.9](https://github.com/dotnet/dotnet-docker/issues/921). We expect that these issues will be resolved in February and that we'll be able to provide support for Alpine 3.9 in March.\r\n\r\nWe will produce Alpine 3.9 images for .NET Core 2.1, 2.2 and 3.0. Assuming we publish 3.9 images in March, we'll stop producing and supporting Alpine 3.7 and 3.8 images after June (2019).\r\n\r\n## Using Alpine-based .NET Core images\r\n\r\nWe produce a variety of Alpine-based images. You can either depend on a specific Alpine version, like with `microsoft/dotnet:2.2-sdk-alpine3.8` or opt to use the latest Alpine image we have to offer, like with `microsoft/dotnet:2.2-sdk-alpine`. Either are good choices. It is just a question of whether you want to make a conscious decision to move to later Alpine releases.\r\n\r\n## Support for ARM32?\r\n\r\nWe produce Alpine images for x64 (and ARM64, shortly). The [Alpine 3.9 announcement](https://twitter.com/alpinelinux/status/1090416212822110214) made mention of support for ARM32v7. We would like to enable .NET Core [Alpine-based images on ARM32](https://github.com/gliderlabs/docker-alpine/issues/463#issuecomment-460530395). We are patiently waiting for that to happen.

To check the currently installed runtimes, open a command prompt and run the `dotnet --info` command. If you have a 2.1 or greater runtime installed, you'll see output like the following;\r\n\r\n```text\r\n.NET Core SDK (reflecting any global.json):\r\n Version:   2.2.100\r\n Commit:    b9f2fa0ca8\r\n\r\nRuntime Environment:\r\n OS Name:     Windows\r\n OS Version:  10.0.17134\r\n OS Platform: Windows\r\n RID:         win10-x64\r\n Base Path:   C:\\Program Files\\dotnet\\sdk\\2.2.100\\\r\n\r\nHost (useful for support):\r\n  Version: 2.2.0\r\n  Commit:  1249f08fed\r\n\r\n.NET Core SDKs installed:\r\n  2.1.5 [C:\\Program Files\\dotnet\\sdk]\r\n  2.1.502 [C:\\Program Files\\dotnet\\sdk]\r\n  2.2.100 [C:\\Program Files\\dotnet\\sdk]\r\n\r\n.NET Core runtimes installed:\r\n  Microsoft.AspNetCore.All 2.1.6 [C:\\Program Files\\dotnet\\shared\\Microsoft.AspNetCore.All]\r\n  Microsoft.AspNetCore.App 2.1.6 [C:\\Program Files\\dotnet\\shared\\Microsoft.AspNetCore.App]\r\n  Microsoft.AspNetCore.All 2.2.0 [C:\\Program Files\\dotnet\\shared\\Microsoft.AspNetCore.All]\r\n  Microsoft.AspNetCore.App 2.2.0 [C:\\Program Files\\dotnet\\shared\\Microsoft.AspNetCore.App]\r\n  Microsoft.NETCore.App 2.1.6 [C:\\Program Files\\dotnet\\shared\\Microsoft.NETCore.App]\r\n  Microsoft.NETCore.App 2.2.0 [C:\\Program Files\\dotnet\\shared\\Microsoft.NETCore.App]\r\n\r\nTo install additional .NET Core runtimes or SDKs:\r\n  https://aka.ms/dotnet-download\r\n```\r\n\r\nIf your host version is 2.1.x and the highest `Microsoft.NETCore.App` runtime version is less than 2.1.7, you're vulnerable to this issue.\r\nIf your host version is 2.2.x and the highest 2.1.x `Microsoft.NETCore.App` runtime version is less than 2.2.1, you're vulnerable to this issue.\r\n\r\nYou will not see SDK versions if you have only installed the runtime.\r\n\r\n#### Applications not using Microsoft.NetCore.App\r\n\r\nThe affected assembly is also available separately as a NuGet package. If you are not using Microsoft.NetCore.App, you may still be affected if you are referencing the packages listed above.\r\n\r\n##### Direct dependencies\r\n\r\nDirect dependencies are discoverable by examining your `csproj` file. They can be fixed by [editing the project file](#fixing-direct-dependencies) or using NuGet to update the dependency.\r\n\r\n##### Transitive dependencies\r\n\r\nTransitive dependencies occur when you add a package to your project that in turn relies on another package. For example, if Contoso publishes a package `Contoso.Utility` which, in turn, depends on `Contoso.Internals` and you add the `Contoso.Utility` package to your project now your project has a direct dependency on `Contoso.Utility` and, because `Contoso.Utility` depends 'Contoso.Internals', your application gains a transitive dependency on the `Contoso.Internals` package.\r\n\r\nTransitive dependencies are reviewable in two ways:\r\n\r\n* In the Visual Studio Solution Explorer window, which supports searching.\r\n* By examining the `project.assets.json` file contained in the obj directory of your project for `csproj` based projects\r\n\r\nThe `project.assets.json` files are the authoritative list of all packages used by your project, containing both direct and transitive dependencies.\r\n\r\nThere are two ways to view transitive dependencies. You can either [use Visual Studio’s Solution Explorer](#vs-solution-explorer), or you can review [the `project.assets.json` file](#project-assets-json)).\r\n\r\n##### <a name=\"vs-solution-explorer\"></a>Using Visual Studio Solution Explorer\r\n\r\nTo use Solution Explorer, open the project in Visual Studio, and then press Ctrl+; to activate the search in Solution Explorer. Search for the [vulnerable package](#affected-software) and make a note of the version numbers of any results you find.\r\n\r\nFor example, searching for `Microsoft.AspNetCore.Mvc.Core` in an example project that contains a package that takes a dependency on `Microsoft.AspNetCore.Mvc` shows the following results in Visual Studio 2017:\r\n\r\n![Screenshot of search results in Visual Studio 2017](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/796298/25858816/8ecdc2b4-3491-11e7-9363-746804bb9832.png)\r\n\r\nThe search results appear as a tree. In the previous results, you can see that a reference to `Microsoft.AspNetCore.Mvc.Core` version 1.1.2 is discovered.\r\n\r\nUnder the Dependencies node is a NuGet node. Under the NuGet node is the list of packages you have directly taken a dependency on and their versions.\r\nIn screenshot, the application takes a direct dependency on `Microsoft.AspNetCore.Mvc`. `Microsoft.AspNetCore.Mvc` in turn has leaf nodes that list its dependencies and their versions.\r\nThe `Microsoft.AspNetCore.Mvc` package takes a dependency on a version of `Microsoft.AspNetCore.Mvc.ApiExplorer`, that in turn takes a dependency on a version of `Microsoft.AspNetCore.Mvc.Core`.\r\n\r\n##### <a name=\"project-assets-json\"></a> Manually reviewing project.assets.json\r\n\r\nOpen the *project.assets.json* file from your project’s obj directory in your editor. We suggest you use an editor that understands JSON and allows you to collapse and expand nodes to review this file.\r\nVisual Studio and Visual Studio Code provide JSON friendly editing.\r\n\r\nSearch the *project.assets.json* file for the [vulnerable package](#affected-software), using the format `packagename/` for each of the package names from the preceding table. If you find the assembly name in your search:\r\n\r\n* Examine the line on which they are found, the version number is after the `/`.\r\n* Compare to the [vulnerable versions table](#affected-software).\r\n\r\nFor example, a search result that shows `System.Private.Uri/4.3.0` is a reference to version 4.3.0 of `System.Private.Uri`.\r\n\r\nIf your *project.assets.json* file includes references to the [vulnerable package](#affected-software), then you need to fix the transitive dependencies.\r\n\r\nIf you have not found any reference to any vulnerable packages, this means either\r\n\r\n* None of your direct dependencies depend on any vulnerable packages, or\r\n* You have already fixed the problem by updating the direct dependencies.\r\n\r\n### <a name=\"how-fix\"></a>How do I fix the issue?\r\n\r\n#### Updating the version of Microsoft.NETCore.App\r\n\r\nIf your host version is a 2.1.x host you must install version 2.1.8 or later of the [.NET Core 2.1 runtime](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/download/dotnet-core/2.1), or corresponding [.NET Core 2.1 SDK](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/download/dotnet-core/2.1).\r\n\r\nIf your host version is a 2.2.x you must install version 2.2.2 or later of the [.NET Core 2.2 runtime](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/download/dotnet-core/2.2), or corresponding  [.NET Core 2.2 SDK](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/download/dotnet-core/2.2).\r\n\r\n#### <a name=\"fixing-direct-dependencies\"></a>Fixing direct dependencies\r\n\r\nOpen *projectname.csproj* in your editor. If you're using Visual Studio, right-click the project and choose **Edit projectname.csproj** from the context menu, where projectname is the name of your project. Look for `PackageReference` elements. The following shows an example project file:\r\n\r\n```xml\r\n<Project Sdk=\"Microsoft.NET.Sdk.Web\">\r\n  <PropertyGroup>\r\n    <TargetFramework>netcoreapp2.1</TargetFramework>\r\n  </PropertyGroup>\r\n  <ItemGroup>\r\n    <PackageReference Include=\"System.Private.Uri\" Version=\"4.3.0\" />\r\n  </ItemGroup>\r\n</Project>\r\n```\r\n\r\nThe preceding example has a reference to the [vulnerable package](#affected-software), as seen by the single `PackageReference` element. The name of the package is in the `Include` attribute.\r\nThe package version number is in the `Version` attribute. The previous example shows a single direct dependency on `System.Private.Uri` version 4.3.0\r\n\r\nTo update the version to the secure package, change the version number to the updated package version as listed on the table [previously](#affected-software).\r\nIn this example, update `System.Private.Uri` to the appropriate [fixed package number](#affected-software) for your major version. Save the *csproj* file. The example *csproj* now looks as follows:\r\n\r\n```xml\r\n<Project Sdk=\"Microsoft.NET.Sdk.Web\">\r\n  <PropertyGroup>\r\n    <TargetFramework>netcoreapp2.1</TargetFramework>\r\n  </PropertyGroup>\r\n  <ItemGroup>\r\n    <PackageReference Include=\"System.Private.Uri\" Version=\"4.3.0\" />\r\n  </ItemGroup>\r\n</Project>\r\n```\r\n\r\nIf you're using Visual Studio and you save your updated *csproj* file, Visual Studio will restore the new package version.\r\nYou can see the restore results by opening the **Output** window (Ctrl+Alt+O) and changing the **Show output from** drop-down list to **Package Manager**.\r\n\r\nIf you're not using Visual Studio, open a command line and change to your project directory. Execute the `dotnet restore` command to restore the updated dependencies.\r\n\r\nNow recompile your application. If after recompilation you see a *Dependency conflict warning*, you must update your other direct dependencies to versions that take a dependency on the updated package.\r\n\r\n#### <a name=\"transitive-dependencies\"></a>Fixing transitive dependencies\r\n\r\nIf your transitive dependency review found references to the [vulnerable package](#affected-software), you must add a direct dependency to the updated package to your *csproj* file to override the transitive dependency.\r\n\r\nOpen *projectname.csproj* in your editor. If you're using Visual Studio, right-click the project and choose **Edit projectname.csproj** from the context menu, where projectname is the name of your project.\r\nLook for `PackageReference` nodes, for example:\r\n\r\n```xml\r\n<Project Sdk=\"Microsoft.NET.Sdk.\">\r\n  <PropertyGroup>\r\n    <TargetFramework>net461</TargetFramework>\r\n  </PropertyGroup>\r\n  <ItemGroup>\r\n    <PackageReference Include=\"ThirdParty.NotUpdatedYet\" Version=\"2.0.0\" />\r\n  </ItemGroup>\r\n</Project>\r\n```\r\n\r\nYou must add a direct dependency to the updated version of the [vulnerable package](#affected-software) by adding it to the *csproj* file.\r\nYou do this by adding a new line to the dependencies section, referencing the fixed version.\r\nFor example, if your search showed a transitive reference to a vulnerable `System.ServiceModel.Http` version, you'd add a reference to the [fixed package number](#affected-software).\r\n\r\n```xml\r\n<Project Sdk=\"Microsoft.NET.Sdk.Web\">\r\n  <PropertyGroup>\r\n    <TargetFramework>net461</TargetFramework>\r\n  </PropertyGroup>\r\n  <ItemGroup>\r\n    <PackageReference Include=\"System.Private.Uri\" Version=\"4.3.0\" />\r\n    <PackageReference Include=\"ThirdParty.NotUpdatedYet\" Version=\"2.0.0\" />\r\n  </ItemGroup>\r\n</Project>\r\n```\r\n\r\nAfter you've added the direct dependency reference, save your *csproj* file.\r\n\r\nIf you're using Visual Studio, save your updated *csproj* file and Visual Studio will restore the new package versions.\r\nYou can see the restore results by opening the **Output** window (Ctrl+Alt+O) and changing the **Show output from** drop-down list to **Package Manager**.\r\n\r\nIf you're not using Visual Studio, open a command line and change to your project directory. Execute the `dotnet restore` command to restore the new dependencies.\r\n\r\n##### Rebuilding your application\r\n\r\nFinally, you must rebuild your application, test, and redeploy.\r\n\r\n## Other Information\r\n\r\n### Reporting Security Issues\r\n\r\nIf you have found a potential security issue in .NET Core, please email details to secure@microsoft.com.

To check the currently installed runtimes, open a command prompt and run the `dotnet --info` command. If you have a 2.1 or greater runtime installed, you'll see output like the following;\r\n\r\n```text\r\n.NET Core SDK (reflecting any global.json):\r\n Version:   2.2.100\r\n Commit:    b9f2fa0ca8\r\n\r\nRuntime Environment:\r\n OS Name:     Windows\r\n OS Version:  10.0.17134\r\n OS Platform: Windows\r\n RID:         win10-x64\r\n Base Path:   C:\\Program Files\\dotnet\\sdk\\2.2.100\\\r\n\r\nHost (useful for support):\r\n  Version: 2.2.0\r\n  Commit:  1249f08fed\r\n\r\n.NET Core SDKs installed:\r\n  2.1.5 [C:\\Program Files\\dotnet\\sdk]\r\n  2.1.502 [C:\\Program Files\\dotnet\\sdk]\r\n  2.2.100 [C:\\Program Files\\dotnet\\sdk]\r\n\r\n.NET Core runtimes installed:\r\n  Microsoft.AspNetCore.All 2.1.6 [C:\\Program Files\\dotnet\\shared\\Microsoft.AspNetCore.All]\r\n  Microsoft.AspNetCore.App 2.1.6 [C:\\Program Files\\dotnet\\shared\\Microsoft.AspNetCore.App]\r\n  Microsoft.AspNetCore.All 2.2.0 [C:\\Program Files\\dotnet\\shared\\Microsoft.AspNetCore.All]\r\n  Microsoft.AspNetCore.App 2.2.0 [C:\\Program Files\\dotnet\\shared\\Microsoft.AspNetCore.App]\r\n  Microsoft.NETCore.App 2.1.6 [C:\\Program Files\\dotnet\\shared\\Microsoft.NETCore.App]\r\n  Microsoft.NETCore.App 2.2.0 [C:\\Program Files\\dotnet\\shared\\Microsoft.NETCore.App]\r\n\r\nTo install additional .NET Core runtimes or SDKs:\r\n  https://aka.ms/dotnet-download\r\n```\r\n\r\nIf your host version is 2.1.x and the highest `Microsoft.NETCore.App` runtime version is less than 2.1.7, you're vulnerable to this issue.\r\nIf your host version is 2.2.x and the highest 2.1.x `Microsoft.NETCore.App` runtime version is less than 2.1.7, you're vulnerable to this issue.\r\n\r\nYou will not see SDK versions if you have only installed the runtime.\r\n\r\n#### Applications not using Microsoft.NetCore.App\r\n\r\nThe affected assembly is also available separately as a NuGet package. If you are not using Microsoft.NetCore.App, you may still be affected if you are referencing the packages listed above.\r\n\r\n##### Direct dependencies\r\n\r\nDirect dependencies are discoverable by examining your `csproj` file. They can be fixed by [editing the project file](#fixing-direct-dependencies) or using NuGet to update the dependency.\r\n\r\n##### Transitive dependencies\r\n\r\nTransitive dependencies occur when you add a package to your project that in turn relies on another package. For example, if Contoso publishes a package `Contoso.Utility` which, in turn, depends on `Contoso.Internals` and you add the `Contoso.Utility` package to your project now your project has a direct dependency on `Contoso.Utility` and, because `Contoso.Utility` depends 'Contoso.Internals', your application gains a transitive dependency on the `Contoso.Internals` package.\r\n\r\nTransitive dependencies are reviewable in two ways:\r\n\r\n* In the Visual Studio Solution Explorer window, which supports searching.\r\n* By examining the `project.assets.json` file contained in the obj directory of your project for `csproj` based projects\r\n\r\nThe `project.assets.json` files are the authoritative list of all packages used by your project, containing both direct and transitive dependencies.\r\n\r\nThere are two ways to view transitive dependencies. You can either [use Visual Studio’s Solution Explorer](#vs-solution-explorer), or you can review [the `project.assets.json` file](#project-assets-json)).\r\n\r\n##### <a name=\"vs-solution-explorer\"></a>Using Visual Studio Solution Explorer\r\n\r\nTo use Solution Explorer, open the project in Visual Studio, and then press Ctrl+; to activate the search in Solution Explorer. Search for the [vulnerable package](#affected-software) and make a note of the version numbers of any results you find.\r\n\r\nFor example, searching for `Microsoft.AspNetCore.Mvc.Core` in an example project that contains a package that takes a dependency on `Microsoft.AspNetCore.Mvc` shows the following results in Visual Studio 2017:\r\n\r\n![Screenshot of search results in Visual Studio 2017](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/796298/25858816/8ecdc2b4-3491-11e7-9363-746804bb9832.png)\r\n\r\nThe search results appear as a tree. In the previous results, you can see that a reference to `Microsoft.AspNetCore.Mvc.Core` version 1.1.2 is discovered.\r\n\r\nUnder the Dependencies node is a NuGet node. Under the NuGet node is the list of packages you have directly taken a dependency on and their versions.\r\nIn screenshot, the application takes a direct dependency on `Microsoft.AspNetCore.Mvc`. `Microsoft.AspNetCore.Mvc` in turn has leaf nodes that list its dependencies and their versions.\r\nThe `Microsoft.AspNetCore.Mvc` package takes a dependency on a version of `Microsoft.AspNetCore.Mvc.ApiExplorer`, that in turn takes a dependency on a version of `Microsoft.AspNetCore.Mvc.Core`.\r\n\r\n##### <a name=\"project-assets-json\"></a> Manually reviewing project.assets.json\r\n\r\nOpen the *project.assets.json* file from your project’s obj directory in your editor. We suggest you use an editor that understands JSON and allows you to collapse and expand nodes to review this file.\r\nVisual Studio and Visual Studio Code provide JSON friendly editing.\r\n\r\nSearch the *project.assets.json* file for the [vulnerable package](#affected-software), using the format `packagename/` for each of the package names from the preceding table. If you find the assembly name in your search:\r\n\r\n* Examine the line on which they are found, the version number is after the `/`.\r\n* Compare to the [vulnerable versions table](#affected-software).\r\n\r\nFor example, a search result that shows `SSystem.Net.Http/4.3.0` is a reference to version 4.3.0 of `System.Net.Http`.\r\n\r\nIf your *project.assets.json* file includes references to the [vulnerable package](#affected-software), then you need to fix the transitive dependencies.\r\n\r\nIf you have not found any reference to any vulnerable packages, this means either\r\n\r\n* None of your direct dependencies depend on any vulnerable packages, or\r\n* You have already fixed the problem by updating the direct dependencies.\r\n\r\n### <a name=\"how-fix\"></a>How do I fix the issue?\r\n\r\n#### Updating the version of Microsoft.NETCore.App\r\n\r\nIf your host version is a 2.1.x host you must install version 2.1.7 or later of the [.NET Core 2.1 runtime](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/download/dotnet-core/2.1), or corresponding [.NET Core 2.1 SDK](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/download/dotnet-core/2.1).\r\n\r\nIf your host version is a 2.2.x you must install version 2.2.1 or later of the [.NET Core 2.2 runtime](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/download/dotnet-core/2.2), or corresponding  [.NET Core 2.2 SDK](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/download/dotnet-core/2.2).\r\n\r\n#### <a name=\"fixing-direct-dependencies\"></a>Fixing direct dependencies\r\n\r\nOpen *projectname.csproj* in your editor. If you're using Visual Studio, right-click the project and choose **Edit projectname.csproj** from the context menu, where projectname is the name of your project. Look for `PackageReference` elements. The following shows an example project file:\r\n\r\n```xml\r\n<Project Sdk=\"Microsoft.NET.Sdk.Web\">\r\n  <PropertyGroup>\r\n    <TargetFramework>netcoreapp2.1</TargetFramework>\r\n  </PropertyGroup>\r\n  <ItemGroup>\r\n    <PackageReference Include=\"System.Net.Http\" Version=\"4.3.0\" />\r\n  </ItemGroup>\r\n</Project>\r\n```\r\n\r\nThe preceding example has a reference to the [vulnerable package](#affected-software), as seen by the single `PackageReference` element. The name of the package is in the `Include` attribute.\r\nThe package version number is in the `Version` attribute. The previous example shows a single direct dependency on `System.Net.Http` version 4.3.0\r\n\r\nTo update the version to the secure package, change the version number to the updated package version as listed on the table [previously](#affected-software).\r\nIn this example, update `System.IO.Pipelines` to the appropriate [fixed package number](#affected-software) for your major version. Save the *csproj* file. The example *csproj* now looks as follows:\r\n\r\n```xml\r\n<Project Sdk=\"Microsoft.NET.Sdk.Web\">\r\n  <PropertyGroup>\r\n    <TargetFramework>netcoreapp2.1</TargetFramework>\r\n  </PropertyGroup>\r\n  <ItemGroup>\r\n    <PackageReference Include=\"System.Net.Http\" Version=\"4.3.5\" />\r\n  </ItemGroup>\r\n</Project>\r\n```\r\n\r\nIf you're using Visual Studio and you save your updated *csproj* file, Visual Studio will restore the new package version.\r\nYou can see the restore results by opening the **Output** window (Ctrl+Alt+O) and changing the **Show output from** drop-down list to **Package Manager**.\r\n\r\nIf you're not using Visual Studio, open a command line and change to your project directory. Execute the `dotnet restore` command to restore the updated dependencies.\r\n\r\nNow recompile your application. If after recompilation you see a *Dependency conflict warning*, you must update your other direct dependencies to versions that take a dependency on the updated package.\r\n\r\n#### <a name=\"transitive-dependencies\"></a>Fixing transitive dependencies\r\n\r\nIf your transitive dependency review found references to the [vulnerable package](#affected-software), you must add a direct dependency to the updated package to your *csproj* file to override the transitive dependency.\r\n\r\nOpen *projectname.csproj* in your editor. If you're using Visual Studio, right-click the project and choose **Edit projectname.csproj** from the context menu, where projectname is the name of your project.\r\nLook for `PackageReference` nodes, for example:\r\n\r\n```xml\r\n<Project Sdk=\"Microsoft.NET.Sdk.\">\r\n  <PropertyGroup>\r\n    <TargetFramework>net461</TargetFramework>\r\n  </PropertyGroup>\r\n  <ItemGroup>\r\n    <PackageReference Include=\"ThirdParty.NotUpdatedYet\" Version=\"2.0.0\" />\r\n  </ItemGroup>\r\n</Project>\r\n```\r\n\r\nYou must add a direct dependency to the updated version of the [vulnerable package](#affected-software) by adding it to the *csproj* file.\r\nYou do this by adding a new line to the dependencies section, referencing the fixed version.\r\nFor example, if your search showed a transitive reference to a vulnerable `System.ServiceModel.Http` version, you'd add a reference to the [fixed package number](#affected-software).\r\n\r\n```xml\r\n<Project Sdk=\"Microsoft.NET.Sdk.Web\">\r\n  <PropertyGroup>\r\n    <TargetFramework>net461</TargetFramework>\r\n  </PropertyGroup>\r\n  <ItemGroup>\r\n    <PackageReference Include=\"System.Net.Http\" Version=\"4.3.5\" />\r\n    <PackageReference Include=\"ThirdParty.NotUpdatedYet\" Version=\"2.0.0\" />\r\n  </ItemGroup>\r\n</Project>\r\n```\r\n\r\nAfter you've added the direct dependency reference, save your *csproj* file.\r\n\r\nIf you're using Visual Studio, save your updated *csproj* file and Visual Studio will restore the new package versions.\r\nYou can see the restore results by opening the **Output** window (Ctrl+Alt+O) and changing the **Show output from** drop-down list to **Package Manager**.\r\n\r\nIf you're not using Visual Studio, open a command line and change to your project directory. Execute the `dotnet restore` command to restore the new dependencies.\r\n\r\n##### Rebuilding your application\r\n\r\nFinally, you must rebuild your application, test, and redeploy.\r\n\r\n## Other Information\r\n\r\n### Reporting Security Issues\r\n\r\nIf you have found a potential security issue in .NET Core, please email details to secure@microsoft.com.

However, .NET hasn't had a (great) built-in way to deal with JSON. Instead we've relied on [Json.NET] which continues to serve the .NET ecosystem well.\r\n\r\n[Json.NET]: https://www.newtonsoft.com/json\r\n\r\nMoving forward, we plan on making some changes to our JSON support:\r\n\r\n* **We need high-performance JSON APIs**. We need a new set of JSON APIs that are highly tuned for performance by using `Span<T>` and allows for processing UTF-8 directly without having to transcode to UTF-16 `string` instances. Both aspects are critical for our web server Kestrel, where throughput is a key requirement.\r\n\r\n* **Remove dependency from ASP.NET Core to Json.NET**. Today, ASP.NET Core has a dependency on Json.NET. While this provides a tight integration between ASP.NET Core and Json.NET, it also means that application developers cannot freely choose which JSON library they are using. This is also problematic for customers of Json.NET as the version is dictated by the underlying platform. However, Json.NET is frequently updated and application developers often want to -- or even have to -- use a specific version. Thus, we want to remove the dependency from ASP.NET Core 3.0 to Json.NET so that customers can choose which version to use, without fearing they might accidentally break the underlying platform. In addition, this makes it also possible to plug-in an entirely different JSON library.\r\n\r\n* **Provide an ASP.NET Core integration package for Json.NET**. Json.NET has basically become the Swiss Army knife of JSON processing in .NET. It provides many options and facilities that allow customers to handle their JSON needs with ease. We don't want to compromise on the Json.NET support customers are getting today, for example, the ability to configure the JSON serialization via the `AddJsonOptions` extension method. Thus, we want to provide the Json.NET integration as a NuGet package that developers can optionally install so they get all the bells and whistles they get from Json.NET today. The other part of this work item is to ensure we have the right extension points so that other parties can provide similar integration packages for their JSON library of choice.\r\n\r\nBelow are more details around this plan.\r\n\r\n## The need for high-performance JSON APIs\r\n\r\nThe requirements for the .NET stack have changed a bit since the arrival of .NET Core. Historically, .NET has valued usability and convenience. With .NET Core, we've added a focus on performance, and we've made significant investments to serve high performance needs. And the [improvements we made][techempower] in the popular TechEmpower benchmark are a testament to that.\r\n\r\n[techempower]: https://www.techempower.com/blog/2016/11/16/framework-benchmarks-round-13/\r\n\r\nWith .NET Core 2.1, we've added a brand new primitive called [Span\\<T>][span-msdn] that allows us to represent native memory and arrays in a uniform way. With this type, we've also added a set of parsing and encoding APIs that are much more memory efficient without having to resort to unsafe code.\r\n\r\n[span-msdn]: https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/magazine/mt814808.aspx\r\n\r\nPart of the work of minimizing allocations is to avoid having to transcode UTF-8 payloads into UTF-16 strings, purely for parsing reasons. Currently, Json.NET is implemented by reading UTF-16. We need the ability to read (and write) JSON documents directly in UTF-8 because most network protocols (including HTTP) use UTF-8.\r\n\r\nDuring .NET Core 2.1 we've learned that updating our existing APIs to leverage `Span<T>` has limits. While we did add a bunch of overloads that accept spans, we also had to produce brand new APIs that are designed around minimizing allocations and dealing with buffers, which we exposed in `System.Buffers` namespaces. And with `System.IO.Pipelines` we've also added a programming model that enables developers to share buffers without having to deal with lifetime issues.\r\n\r\nBased on these experiences we believe in order to support JSON parsing, we'll need to expose a new set of JSON APIs that are specifically geared for high-performance scenarios.\r\n\r\nYou might wonder why we can't just update Json.NET to include support for parsing JSON using `Span<T>`? Well, James Newton-King -- the author of Json.NET -- has the following to say about that:\r\n\r\n> Json.NET was created over 10 years ago, and since then it has added a wide range of features aimed to help developers work with JSON in .NET. In that time Json.NET has also become far and away NuGet's most depended on and downloaded package, and is the go-to library for JSON support in .NET. Unfortunately, Json.NET's wealth of features and popularity works against making major changes to it. Supporting new technologies like `Span<T>` would require fundamental breaking changes to the library and would disrupt existing applications and libraries that depend on it.\r\n>\r\n> Going forward Json.NET will continue to be worked on and invested in, both addressing known issues today and supporting new platforms in the future. Json.NET has always existed alongside other JSON libraries for .NET, and there will be nothing to prevent you using one or more together, depending on whether you need the performance of the new JSON APIs or the large feature set of Json.NET.\r\n\r\n## Move Json.NET integration into a separate NuGet package\r\n\r\nToday, you cannot use ASP.NET Core without Json.NET because it is a dependency of ASP.NET Core itself. Over the years, we've received feedback that the dependency can conflict with other libraries that have their own dependency on a different version of Json.NET. In the past, we've considered addressing this issue by using a private copy of Json.NET in ASP.NET. However, this would create problems when developers want to configure Json.NET (for instance, in order to control how the serializer behaves when formatting JSON objects).\r\n\r\nMoving forward we'd like to:\r\n\r\n1. Replace the internal usage of Json.NET in ASP.NET Core by the new platform-provided JSON APIs.\r\n\r\n2. Factor the public facing usage of Json.NET into an optional integration package that can be acquired from NuGet.\r\n\r\nSo the existing integration between ASP.NET Core and Json.NET will continue to be supported, but will be moving out of the platform and into a separate package. However, since the integration is then designed to sit on top of the platform, it will also allow customers to update Json.NET to later versions.\r\n\r\nFurthermore, customers who need more performance can also choose to use the new JSON APIs, at the expense of the rich feature set that Json.NET offers.\r\n\r\n## Discussion\r\n\r\nFor a discussion, please go to https://github.com/dotnet/corefx/issues/33115.","Url":"https://github.com/dotnet/announcements/issues/90","RelatedDescription":"Open issue \"The future of JSON in .NET Core 3.0\" (#90)"},{"Id":"368440353","IsPullRequest":false,"CreatedAt":"2018-10-09T23:44:06","Actor":"vivmishra","Number":"89","RawContent":null,"Title":"October 2018 .NET Updates","State":"open","Body":"# October 2018 .NET Updates\r\n\r\nThe following .NET updates were released in October 2018.
