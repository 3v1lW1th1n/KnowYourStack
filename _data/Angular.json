Before this change that information was stored in the `hostBindings` function. This was problematic, because in order to get to that information the `hostBindings` would have to be executed. In order for `hostBindings` to be executed the directives would have to be instantiated. This means that the directive instantiation would happen before we had knowledge about the `hostAttrs` and as a result the directive could observe in the constructor that not all of the `hostAttrs` have been applied. This further complicates the runtime as we have to apply `hostAttrs` in parts over many invocations.\r\n    \r\n`ɵɵallocHostVars` was unnecessarily complicated because it would have to update the `LView` (and Blueprint) while existing directives are already executing. By moving it out of `hostBindings` function we can access it statically and we can create correct `LView` (and Blueprint) in a single pass.\r\n    \r\nThis change only changes how the instructions are generated, but does not change the runtime much. (We cheat by emulating the old behavior by calling `ɵɵallocHostVars` and `ɵɵelementHostAttrs`) Subsequent change will refactor the runtime to take advantage of the static information.\r\n\r\n## PR Checklist\r\nPlease check if your PR fulfills the following requirements:\r\n\r\n- [x] The commit message follows our guidelines: https://github.com/angular/angular/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md#commit\r\n- [x] Tests for the changes have been added (for bug fixes / features)\r\n- [ ] Docs have been added / updated (for bug fixes / features)\r\n\r\n\r\n## PR Type\r\nWhat kind of change does this PR introduce?\r\n\r\n<!-- Please check the one that applies to this PR using \"x\". -->\r\n\r\n- [ ] Bugfix\r\n- [ ] Feature\r\n- [ ] Code style update (formatting, local variables)\r\n- [x] Refactoring (no functional changes, no api changes)\r\n- [ ] Build related changes\r\n- [ ] CI related changes\r\n- [ ] Documentation content changes\r\n- [ ] angular.io application / infrastructure changes\r\n- [ ] Other...

Rather, they are taken from rawUrlTree. This can cause a problem because the parameters might have changed with urlUpdateStrategy set to 'eager'.\r\n\r\n## 🔬 Minimal Reproduction\r\nHere's a stackblitz repro based on heroes app from the router tutorial:\r\nhttps://stackblitz.com/edit/angular-router-redirect\r\n\r\nThe example is changed from [the original](https://angular.io/guide/router#wrap-up-and-final-app) in the following ways:\r\n - it keeps the user ID in a query param instead of the path param,\r\n - initially, it loads /superheroes?id=11,\r\n - for /superhero path, it adds a RedirectingResolver that, when id=12, redirects to /crisis-center,\r\n - it has urlUpdateStrategy: 'eager'.\r\n\r\n*To trigger the error, follow these steps*:\r\n1. Open https://stackblitz.com/edit/angular-router-redirect\r\n1. You should start on the list of heroes (url is /superheroes?id=11), with hero 11 selected.\r\n1. Click \"Narco\" (hero 12) (its URL is /superhero?id=12)\r\n1. See that you get redirected to /crisis-center?id=11.\r\n\r\nHowever, if you look at RedirectingResolver in heroes-routing.module.ts, you'll see that:\r\n - it checks for query parameter and determines it's equal to 12\r\n - it redirects to /crisis-center with merged query params\r\n\r\nWith urlUpdateStragegy: 'eager' in app-routing.module.ts, I would expect to land at /crisis-center?id=12.\r\n\r\n## 🌍  Your Environment\r\n\r\n**Angular Version:**\r\nAngular 8.2.14 on StackBlitz.\r\n\r\n## Fix proposal\r\n\r\nThis issue could be fixed by changing [this line](https://github.com/angular/angular/blob/18d89c9c891844440a919b835c0f198a2b7395a6/packages/router/src/router.ts#L983):\r\n\r\n<code>const mergedTree = this.urlHandlingStrategy.merge(urlTree, this.rawUrlTree);</code>\r\n\r\nto:\r\n\r\n<code>const mergedTree = this.urlHandlingStrategy.merge(urlTree, this.browserUrlTree);</code>\r\n\r\nThen, the code behaves as expected: you get redirected to /crisis-center?id=12.

When using Jest, I think the test runs are already isolated so the problem might not show up there.\r\n\r\n### Description\r\n\r\nCalling `createAngularJSTestingModule()` immediately calls (under the hood) `angular.module(...)`, thus it \"globally\" adds the required angularJSTestingModule to the \"global storage\" of all angularJS modules. This works fine so long as you always require the same `angularModules` (like in `createAngularJSTestingModule(angularModules)`). However, once you have multiple test suites (i.e. different and totally unrelated spec files), you'll start to require different angularModules from time to time.\r\n\r\nNow, due to `createAngularJSTestingModule()` immediately calling `angular.module()`, all previous invocations get overriden. \"In the end\", only the last call \"wins\" with its required angularModules. All previous calls are in vane, making their respective test suites fail, because they don't have (or load) the required `angularModules`.\r\n\r\nTo understand why this happens, you need to recall that Jasmine will first execute ALL describe blocks for ALL test files that are part of the test run (I guess this is needed so that Jasmine can provide the \"focused specs\" feature). Thus, when you stick to the notation provided in the official docs, you're lost:\r\n\r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/1225659/71955749-79461b00-31e9-11ea-8eeb-9aded7cbe27b.png)\r\n\r\nA workaround for the problem is to not call `angular.mock.module()` directly, but provide a function to `beforeEach` instead (which will only be called later, just before the test is run):\r\n\r\n```\r\nbeforeEach(() => angular.mock.module(createAngularJSTestingModule(angularModules))); // notice the \"() =>\" to the left\r\n```\r\n\r\nThe simplest solution would be to update the docs accordingly. However, when you're using `angular.mock.module.sharedInjector()` you'll most likely have a `beforeAll` instead of an `beforeEach`. While the workaround looks the same (just replace the beforeEach with beforeAll), you can no longer use a `beforeAll` in combination with `inject()`. Those calls need to be replaced instead with a `beforeEach`. This is due to `beforeAll(inject(...))` creating the injector too early which makes TestBed feel uncomfortable (erroring).\r\n\r\nMaybe there's yet another, better, solution? \r\n\r\nWhen looking at the source code:\r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/1225659/71956179-c1b20880-31ea-11ea-9cc0-5f3123d83dde.png)\r\n\r\nMaybe it's feasible to use an internal counter to create different modules each time?\r\nOr maybe it's possible to not call `angular.module()` at all, and provide a simple \"module function\" instead, that will be unique to the test suite?\r\n\r\n@petebacondarwin ","Url":"https://github.com/angular/angular/issues/34670","RelatedDescription":"Open issue \"createAngularJSTestingModule() breaks tests when used multiple times across unrelated spec files\" (#34670)"},{"Id":"546562314","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2020-01-07T23:28:27","Actor":"vikerman","Number":"34666","RawContent":null,"Title":"refactor(core): move ngDevMode to an exported variable","State":"open","Body":"WIP: DO NOT SUBMIT","Url":"https://github.com/angular/angular/pull/34666","RelatedDescription":"Open PR \"refactor(core): move ngDevMode to an exported variable\" (#34666)"},{"Id":"546425436","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2020-01-07T17:58:38","Actor":"devversion","Number":"34664","RawContent":null,"Title":"test: run styling benchmarks in benchpress ","State":"open","Body":"Runs the styling benchmarks that have been added with 2e0b237\r\nin benchpress.

It will be somewhat difficult to detect whether a expression with `Object.assign` is actually resolving to the default ES6 `Object.assign`.\r\n\r\nSince the default libs are disabled in the ngcc program, we cannot simply use the type checker. Joost had the idea of providing these types on our own in the program.

This prevents browsers from sending cookies with requests for these files.  Certain environment require cookies to be sent with all requests.  In production environments, Angular CLI's `ng build` command offers an option `--crossOrigin use-credentials` which applies a `crossorigin=\"use-credentials\"` attribute to the script tag, causing headers to be sent.  In a development environment, though, `ng serve` does not offer the same options, so Angular CLI projects cannot be previewed.\r\n\r\n### Describe the solution you'd like\r\nPlease enable the same `--crossOrigin` functionality for `ng serve` as exists in `ng build`.","Url":"https://github.com/angular/angular-cli/issues/16602","RelatedDescription":"Open issue \"ng serve --crossOrigin\" (#16602)"},{"Id":"547216037","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2020-01-09T02:48:09","Actor":"clydin","Number":"16601","RawContent":null,"Title":"Improve source map generation quality","State":"open","Body":"","Url":"https://github.com/angular/angular-cli/pull/16601","RelatedDescription":"Open PR \"Improve source map generation quality\" (#16601)"},{"Id":"547205583","IsPullRequest":false,"CreatedAt":"2020-01-09T02:07:40","Actor":"kyle-erin","Number":"16600","RawContent":null,"Title":"ng serve running lint in node_modules folder after update from 5.2 to 8.2.14","State":"open","Body":"- [ ] new\r\n- [ ] build\r\n- [x] serve\r\n- [ ] test\r\n- [ ] e2e\r\n- [ ] generate\r\n- [ ] add\r\n- [ ] update\r\n- [ ] lint\r\n- [ ] xi18n\r\n- [ ] run\r\n- [ ] config\r\n- [ ] help\r\n- [ ] version\r\n- [ ] doc\r\n### Is this a regression?\r\n\r\n<!-- Did this behavior use to work in the previous version? -->\r\n<!-- ✍️--> Yes, the previous version in which this bug was not present was: 5.2\r\n\r\n\r\n### Description\r\nI'm using the codelyzer library, when I run the `ng serve` command, it finds linting errors in the node_modules folder (codelyzer).
