For example, this simple pipe with two method signatures will have 2 distinct errors with valid use cases:\r\n```\r\n@Pipe({\r\n  name: 'translate',\r\n})\r\nexport class TranslatePipe implements PipeTransform {\r\n  transform(value: string, namespace?: string): string;\r\n  transform(value: string, params?: string | Record<string, string>, namespace?: string): string {\r\n    console.log('transforming...');\r\n  }\r\n}\r\n```\r\nThe first error is:\r\n```\r\nArgument type Record<string, string> is not assignable to parameter type string | undefined\r\n```\r\nWhen using the pipe like this:\r\n```\r\n<p>{{ 'with.params' | translate:stringParams }}</p>\r\n```\r\n\r\nAnd the 2nd error is:\r\n```\r\nInvalid number of arguments, expected 1..2\r\n```\r\nWhen using the pipe like this:\r\n```\r\n<p>{{ 'with.params.and.namespace' | translate:stringParams:featureNamespace }}</p>\r\n```\r\n\r\nJudging by the errors, the language service takes into account only the first method signature.\r\n\r\nTo reproduce this, you can run `ng serve` in this example Angular v10 repository:\r\n\r\n> https://github.com/SchnWalter/ng-pipe-method-overloading-issue\r\n\r\nAnd check the browser to see that everything is working with a single method signature, then uncomment the 2nd one and you will see that the application compiles successfully after the change and it still works properly, but now both the IDE and Angular Compiler will show the 2 type of errors that I've listed above.\r\n\r\nThis is the log output with a comment inserted where the 2nd signature was un-commented.\r\n```\r\n> ng serve\r\n\r\nchunk {main} main.js, main.js.map (main) 14.5 kB [initial] [rendered]\r\nchunk {polyfills} polyfills.js, polyfills.js.map (polyfills) 141 kB [initial] [rendered]\r\nchunk {runtime} runtime.js, runtime.js.map (runtime) 6.15 kB [entry] [rendered]\r\nchunk {styles} styles.js, styles.js.map (styles) 12.4 kB [initial] [rendered]\r\nchunk {vendor} vendor.js, vendor.js.map (vendor) 2.72 MB [initial] [rendered]\r\nDate: 2020-05-06T23:28:28.055Z - Hash: 1758942286bf1bc9d64f - Time: 5877ms\r\n** Angular Live Development Server is listening on localhost:4200, open your browser on http://localhost:4200/ **\r\n: Compiled successfully.\r\n\r\n///// UN-COMMENT METHOD SIGNATURE...\r\n\r\nDate: 2020-05-06T23:28:37.928Z - Hash: a3489c657d7e6a14600e\r\n4 unchanged chunks\r\nchunk {main} main.js, main.js.map (main) 14.3 kB [initial] [rendered]\r\nTime: 227ms\r\n: Compiled successfully.\r\n\r\n    ERROR in src/app/app.component.ts:8:37 - error TS2345: Argument of type 'Record<string, string>' is not assignable to parameter of type 'string'.\r\n\r\n    8     <p>{{ 'with.params' | translate:stringParams }}</p>\r\n                                          ~~~~~~~~~~~~\r\n    src/app/app.component.ts:9:67 - error TS2554: Expected 1-2 arguments, but got 3.\r\n\r\n    9     <p>{{ 'with.namespace.undefined.params' | translate:undefined:appOneNamespace }}</p>\r\n                                                                        ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\r\n    src/app/app.component.ts:11:64 - error TS2554: Expected 1-2 arguments, but got 3.\r\n\r\n    11     <p>{{ 'with.params.and.namespace' | translate:stringParams:appOneNamespace }}</p>\r\n                                                                      ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\r\n```\r\n\r\n### Describe alternatives you've considered\r\n\r\nTypeScript method overloading is a \"nice to have\" feature, but it's not a deal breaker.","Url":"https://github.com/angular/angular/issues/36966","RelatedDescription":"Open issue \"@angular/language-service doesn't suport pipes with overloaded transform method\" (#36966)"},{"Id":"613670229","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2020-05-06T23:17:41","Actor":"matsko","Number":"36965","RawContent":null,"Title":"refactor(core): remove style sanitization code for `[style]`/`[style.prop]` bindings","State":"open","Body":"In 420b9be1c14ec6900692b641a3d89b99eb9c6e5b all style-based sanitization code was disabled because modern\r\nbrowsers no longer allow for javascript expressions within CSS.

In the directive it gets a reference to the third party component using `@ContentChild` then in `ngAfterContentInit()` it calls the public interface to customise it.\r\n\r\nUnfortunately, after upgrading to Angular 9, this behaviour seems to have changed, and the component instance is undefined in `ngAfterContentInit()`. \r\n\r\n\r\n## 🔬 Minimal Reproduction\r\nI was unable to reproduce this in Stackblitz for an unknown reason, but you should be able to reproduce by cloning https://github.com/juliancarrivick/angular-9-content-child-bug and executing `ng serve`. You will get a alert of `Child is not defined`. Note that `@ContentChild` is used in this example, but `@ContentChildren` also has the same issue, with the querylist having a length of 0.\r\n\r\nIf you checkout the commit before the upgrade to Angular 9 and run `ng serve` you will notice that you get an alert of `Child is defined` instead.\r\n\r\n## 🔥 Exception or Error\r\nThe property that is decorated with `@ContentChild` is never defined.\r\n\r\n\r\n## 🌍  Your Environment\r\n\r\n**Angular Version:**\r\n<pre><code>$ ng version\r\n\r\n     _                      _                 ____ _     ___\r\n    / \\   _ __   __ _ _   _| | __ _ _ __     / ___| |   |_ _|\r\n   / △ \\ | '_ \\ / _` | | | | |/ _` | '__|   | |   | |    | |\r\n  / ___ \\| | | | (_| | |_| | | (_| | |      | |___| |___ | |\r\n /_/   \\_\\_| |_|\\__, |\\__,_|_|\\__,_|_|       \\____|_____|___|\r\n                |___/\r\n    \r\n\r\nAngular CLI: 9.1.4\r\nNode: 10.15.3\r\nOS: win32 x64\r\n\r\nAngular: 9.1.4\r\n... animations, cli, common, compiler, compiler-cli, core, forms\r\n... language-service, platform-browser, platform-browser-dynamic\r\n... router\r\nIvy Workspace: Yes\r\n\r\nPackage                           Version\r\n-----------------------------------------------------------\r\n@angular-devkit/architect         0.901.4\r\n@angular-devkit/build-angular     0.901.4\r\n@angular-devkit/build-optimizer   0.901.4\r\n@angular-devkit/build-webpack     0.901.4\r\n@angular-devkit/core              9.1.4\r\n@angular-devkit/schematics        9.1.4\r\n@ngtools/webpack                  9.1.4\r\n@schematics/angular               9.1.4\r\n@schematics/update                0.901.4\r\nrxjs                              6.5.5\r\ntypescript                        3.8.3\r\nwebpack                           4.42.0\r\n</code></pre>\r\n\r\n**Anything else relevant?**\r\nIf I alter the directive to targeting the parent element (in the repros case, target `div[appAlterChild]` and wrap `<app-child>` in `<div appAlterChild>`) then `@ContentChild` and `@ContentChildren` are populated as you would expect.\r\n\r\nThis is arguably consistent with the naming of `@ContentChild` and `@ContentChildren`, but it is a regression, unless there's an option that isn't documented (or that I could find!) which reverts the behaviour.\r\n","Url":"https://github.com/angular/angular/issues/36945","RelatedDescription":"Closed issue \"@ContentChild and @ContentChildren in directive don't find component that is targeted in selector\" (#36945)"},{"Id":"613196753","IsPullRequest":false,"CreatedAt":"2020-05-06T09:59:42","Actor":"essoShopbox","Number":"36947","RawContent":null,"Title":"angular documentation Error: loading chunk failed","State":"open","Body":"# 📚 Docs or angular.io bug report\r\n\r\n### Description\r\nI know it common and known issues but it has to be reported so here what happen when open a angular docs after while it's not loaded correctly and opening the console found a lot of errors lines\r\nthe error of serve responded with a status 404\r\nthen Error preparing document 'cli/serve' : ChunkLoadError: Loading chunk 15 failed\r\n\r\n## 🔬 Minimal Reproduction\r\nI think that the deploying many times with small changes to the versions will cause the problem\r\n\r\n### What's the affected URL?**\r\nhttps://angular.io/\r\n\r\n### Reproduction Steps**\r\n<!-- If applicable please list the steps to take to reproduce the issue -->\r\n<!-- ✍️edit:-->\r\n\r\n### Expected vs Actual Behavior**\r\n<!-- If applicable please describe the difference between the expected and actual behavior after following the repro steps. -->\r\n<!-- ✍️edit:-->\r\n\r\n\r\n## 📷Screenshot\r\n[Screen shot](https://imgur.com/kNkWZac)\r\n\r\n\r\n## 🔥 Exception or Error\r\n<pre><code>\r\n<!-- If the issue is accompanied by an exception or an error, please share it below: -->\r\n<!-- ✍️-->\r\n\r\n</code></pre>\r\n\r\n\r\n## 🌍  Your Environment\r\n\r\n### Browser info\r\n<!-- ✍️Is this a browser specific issue?

Yes it might solve some structure and organization problems, but it creates tons of complexity problems, Angular is not a solution, it just made things worst. **Working on test cases now**,nothing wants to work too many undefined stuff, when something works, i consider it lucky accident.\r\ntoo  much dependency which in angular made mandatory in tests, what if i don't like/ don't want DI? the worst part is, if there is one component that have dependency problem , it wrecks all project tests, the same problem happens when you refactor a component, you will need to refactor the test too otherwise the coverage report is wrecked, I guess the only way to fix/make my tests work is to learn propitiatory Angular stuff  from the beginning, i.e I need to be professional angular dev to be able to fix these issues,and I don't want to waste that much effort that applies to just one framework.\r\nNot so bright Google. Not so bright at all.\r\nIt might end up being interesting for me to read Angular warriors defending this scam of a framework here, and then close this.\r\nSo what is the point of this post? there is only one point: I think they need to completely refactor and simplify this framework, or stop making too much propaganda about how \"great\" it is.

When using mat datepicker inside a kendo-ui grid, it works fine when we try to open it from a normal flow but when the same datepicker is accessed from a web component it misbehaves and \r\ndoes not open sometimes and sometimes it just appears as an empty white rectangle. \r\n\r\nIn some cases, eg while clicking on a close icon inside a matDialog it takes some 5-10 seconds to close the dialog when opened inside a web component otherwise it works properly.\r\n\r\n#### What troubleshooting steps have you tried?\r\n\r\nInitial thought was that this might be an issue with the event detection in angular as we are running some code outside zone.js so tried to run this outside zone as well but did not work. Not sure about the exact issue.\r\n\r\nWhat are you seeing that does not match your expectations? \r\n\r\nWould just need your insight to figure out if this is a known issue or something that we might be doing wrong.\r\n\r\n  \r\n#### Environment\r\n\r\n- Angular: 8\r\n- CDK/Material: 8.0.0\r\n- Browser(s): google chrome\r\n- Operating System (e.g. Windows, macOS, Ubuntu):  windows\r\n","Url":"https://github.com/angular/components/issues/19269","RelatedDescription":"Closed issue \"Event delay when using material components inside web components\" (#19269)"},{"Id":"613376323","IsPullRequest":false,"CreatedAt":"2020-05-06T14:43:33","Actor":"ceoaliongroo","Number":"19270","RawContent":null,"Title":"ng update Migration Failed when migrating from 8.2.3 to 9.2.2","State":"open","Body":"Reproduction\r\nSteps to reproduce:\r\n\r\n```ng update @angular/material --migrate-only --from=8.2.3 --verbose```\r\n\r\nBecause there is not enough information provided by the migration, I am unable to provide a reproduction stackblitz.\r\n\r\nExpected Behavior\r\nSuccessful migration to v9, or at least a meaningful error message that tells me where something might be wrong.\r\n\r\nActual Behavior\r\nWhat behavior did you actually see?\r\n```bash\r\nx Migration failed: Path \"/../../../app/common/fwa/fwa-modals/fwa-modal-confirma\r\ntion-with-message/fwa-modal-confirmation-with-message.component.html\" is invalid\r\n.\r\n  See \"C:\\Users\\carlosm\\AppData\\Local\\Temp\\ng-Tj2o0T\\angular-errors.log\" for fur\r\nther details.\r\n```\r\nEnvironment\r\nAngular: 9.1.4\r\nCDK/Material: 8.2.3 -> 9.2.2\r\nBrowser(s): N/A\r\nOperating System (e.g. Windows, macOS, Ubuntu): Windows\r\nI add the console an then the error log \r\n\r\n# console\r\n```bash\r\nD:\\Dev\\WEB\\FWAClient>ng update @angular/material --allow-dirty --migrate-only  -\r\n-from=8.2.3 --verbose\r\nLocating potential npmrc files:\r\nTrying 'C:\\Program Files\\nodejs\\etc\\npmrc'...not found.\r\nTrying 'C:\\Users\\carlosm\\.npmrc'...found.\r\nTrying 'D:\\Dev\\.npmrc'...not found.\r\nTrying 'D:\\Dev\\WEB\\.npmrc'...not found.\r\nTrying 'D:\\Dev\\WEB\\FWAClient\\.npmrc'...not found.\r\nRepository is not clean.
