When you touch outside the contol with PanGestureRecognizer it will scroll fine. It seems that the PanGestureRecognizer blocks the gesture event from bubbeling up to the listview so it won't scroll any more. This is only an issue on iOS, on Android it does work fine.\r\n\r\n### Steps to Reproduce\r\n\r\n1. Put two labels in a listview viewcell. \r\n2. Give one label a PanGestureRecognizer.\r\n3. Bind to a list with enough items so that not all items are visible in the listview.\r\n4. Start the iOS simulator.\r\n5. Touch a label without PanGestureRecognizer and try to scroll. It will work fine.\r\n6 Touch a label with PanGestureRecognizer and try to scroll. It will not scroll.\r\n\r\n### Expected Behavior\r\nI would expect that when I touch a control in a listview with a PanGestureRecognizer I would still be able to scroll the listview in iOS. Or at least it should work the same on both platforms. In that case we should have control if gesture event must bubble up to listview or not.\r\n\r\n### Actual Behavior\r\nWhen a listview has a control that contains a PanGestureRecognizer it will not scroll when you try to scroll and you touch the contol with the PanGestureRecognizer. \r\n\r\n### Basic Information\r\n\r\n- Version with issue: all latest versions\r\n- Last known good version: not known\r\n- IDE: Visual Studio for windows 15.6.5\r\n\r\n- Platform Target Frameworks: \r\n  - iOS:  11.9.1.24\r\n  - Android: 8.2.0.16\r\n- Android Support Library Version: 27.0.2\r\n- Nuget Packages: XF 2.5.1.444934\r\n- Affected Devices: All iOS devices\r\n\r\nSee the attached zip with a very simple example solution that demonstrates the issue.\r\n[GestureIssue.zip](https://github.com/xamarin/Xamarin.Forms/files/1881799/GestureIssue.zip)\r\n\r\n\r\n"},{"Id":"7487447617","Type":"IssuesEvent","CreatedAt":"2018-04-05T20:30:12","Actor":"hartez","Repository":"xamarin/Xamarin.Forms","Organization":"xamarin","RawContent":null,"RelatedAction":"opened","RelatedUrl":"https://github.com/xamarin/Xamarin.Forms/issues/2298","RelatedDescription":"Opened issue \"UI test 38105 needs instructions\" (#2298) at xamarin/Xamarin.Forms","RelatedBody":"It's a manual test, so it needs on-screen instructions."},{"Id":"7487278941","Type":"IssuesEvent","CreatedAt":"2018-04-05T19:55:40","Actor":"EmilAlipiev","Repository":"xamarin/Xamarin.Forms","Organization":"xamarin","RawContent":null,"RelatedAction":"opened","RelatedUrl":"https://github.com/xamarin/Xamarin.Forms/issues/2297","RelatedDescription":"Opened issue \"UWP throws exception on close application if native page is displayed\" (#2297) at xamarin/Xamarin.Forms","RelatedBody":"Bug report best practices: https://github.com/xamarin/Xamarin.Forms/wiki/Submitting-Issues\r\n\r\n### Description\r\n\r\n### Steps to Reproduce\r\n\r\n1.
