We've typically automatically done this for users. While usage in the API is very distinct in that people tend to like implicit behavior in tools but dislike implicit behavior in APIs, at least offering a convenience for normalization is appropriate.\r\n\r\n## Existing Method\r\n\r\nSome familiar with this codebase are aware of this existing method, in the `TrainUtils` utility class, that serves a similar function.\r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/dotnet/machinelearning/blob/2501049f5cb60ed2c9ec191d2937cab7b59824da/src/Microsoft.ML.Data/Commands/TrainCommand.cs#L492\r\n\r\nThe goal of *that* method is not to provide a convenient API, so much as to factor out code common to the various commands that train models (e.g., train, traintest, cross-validation, some transforms like train-and-score). The same is true of many methods in that `TrainUtils` class. This as we see in the first few lines:\r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/dotnet/machinelearning/blob/2501049f5cb60ed2c9ec191d2937cab7b59824da/src/Microsoft.ML.Data/Commands/TrainCommand.cs#L499-L506\r\n\r\nWhile beneficial in providing consistent behavior across all of these things from a command-line perspective, the condition where it just exits would be inappropriate to have in an ML.NET API -- you might imagine someone designing a method with a parameter `bool doNothing` where the first thing is, if it's true, the method returns without doing anything. Again, appropriate from the point of view of factoring out common code, but not appropriate for an API. Also the method of communicating important information to the user is via the console, which again is not the most helpful option for an API.\r\n\r\n## Proposed API Helpers\r\n\r\nNonetheless, this function has several things that are helpful to do: it detects if a trainer wants normalization, if data is normalized, and if appropriate and necessary applies normalization.\r\n\r\nThis would probably take the form of a static method on the `NormalizerTransform` class, perhaps following this signature:\r\n\r\n```csharp\r\npublic static bool CreateIfNeeded(IHostEnvironment env, ref RoleMappedData data, ITrainer trainer)\r\n```\r\n\r\nWe could also have two additional methods to provide key information.\r\n\r\n```csharp\r\npublic static bool FeatureVectorIsNormalized(RoleMappedData data)\r\npublic static bool NeedsNormalization(this ITrainer trainer)\r\n```","Url":"https://github.com/dotnet/machinelearning/issues/433","RelatedDescription":"Open issue \"Direct API: Auto-normalization\" (#433)"},{"Id":"336290066","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2018-06-27T16:15:28","Actor":"shauheen","Number":"431","RawContent":null,"Title":"Build fix - removing the BOM from the CMakeLists.txt file (#430)","State":"closed","Body":"Cherrypick internal build fix into release\r\n\r\n","Url":"https://github.com/dotnet/machinelearning/pull/431","RelatedDescription":"Closed or merged PR \"Build fix - removing the BOM from the CMakeLists.txt file (#430)\" (#431)"},{"Id":"336290301","IsPullRequest":false,"CreatedAt":"2018-06-27T15:57:00","Actor":"sfilipi","Number":"432","RawContent":null,"Title":"Add documentation and examples for Factorization Machines","State":"open","Body":"The Factorization Machine trainer/predictor got added to ML.NET, but we need to complement with documentation, and examples on how to use it. \r\n","Url":"https://github.com/dotnet/machinelearning/issues/432","RelatedDescription":"Open issue \"Add documentation and examples for Factorization Machines\" (#432)"},{"Id":"336269704","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2018-06-27T15:49:16","Actor":"sfilipi","Number":"430","RawContent":null,"Title":"Build fix - removing the BOM from the CMakeLists.txt file","State":"closed","Body":"Remove the BOM from the CMakeLists.txt file, since it is breaking the build in vsts. \r\n\r\n","Url":"https://github.com/dotnet/machinelearning/pull/430","RelatedDescription":"Closed or merged PR \"Build fix - removing the BOM from the CMakeLists.txt file\" (#430)"},{"Id":"336260665","IsPullRequest":false,"CreatedAt":"2018-06-27T14:43:00","Actor":"vivekpradhan","Number":"429","RawContent":null,"Title":"How do I use the newly added LightGBM classifier?","State":"open","Body":"### System information\r\n\r\n.NET Core SDK:\r\nVersion: 2.1.301\r\nCommit: 59524873d6\r\n\r\nRuntime Environment:\r\nOS Name: ubuntu\r\nOS Version: 16.04\r\n\r\n### Issue\r\n\r\n- **What did you do?**\r\nCloned the master. \r\nRan ./build.sh\r\n\r\n- **What happened?**\r\nThe build was successful.\r\n\r\n-**My Code**\r\n```\r\n<PropertyGroup>\r\n    <OutputType>Exe</OutputType>\r\n    <TargetFramework>netcoreapp2.1</TargetFramework>\r\n  </PropertyGroup>\r\n\r\n  <PropertyGroup>\r\n  <TreatWarningsAsErrors>false</TreatWarningsAsErrors>\r\n  <NoWarn>CS0649;CS0168;CS0219</NoWarn>\r\n  <AllowUnsafeBlocks>true</AllowUnsafeBlocks>\r\n  </PropertyGroup>\r\n  \r\n  <ItemGroup>\r\n    <PackageReference Include=\"Microsoft.ML\" Version=\"0.2.0\" />\r\n  </ItemGroup>\r\n...\r\n```\r\nI'm using the example on iris with my dataset.
