Create a simple class library (full clr) and add System.runtime 4.3.0 to the classlibrary\r\n2.  There’s no binding redirect added on adding just the system.runtime’s 4.3.0 version to the classlibrary.\r\n3.  Create a test project exercising the classlibrary (Test -> Unit Test Project)\r\n4.  Execute the test, from the test explorer the tests execute fine with System.RunTime.dll being picked from GAC (4.0.0.0) version (which is the test platform/framework dependency)\r\n5.  Add Moq nuget package to the test project (version 4.8.*). When Moq.dll is added to the test project, the app.config of the test project gets updated with the redirect for the System.RunTime to 4.1.1.0. There’s no reference added to the test project appropriate dll (System.RunTime.dll 4.1.1.0 version).\r\n6.  Run the tests, the test fails to execute. When the tests execute the configuration provided in dll.config is used to setup an appdomain for test execution. The appbase for the appdomain is the output directory of the test project. Since the System.Runtime.dll (4.1.1.0) is not present in the test project output path the execution fails (the error message doesn't indicate the dll that failed and has been fixed to provide a meaningful message in an upcoming update)\r\n7.  Now uninstall Moq.dll (which added the redirection in the first place). The redirection still stays in the test project.\r\n8.  The issue doesn’t repro when the test projects target 4.7.1 (looks like some consolidation that’s being talked of here dotnet/corefx#25773 is helping)\r\n9.  The issue can be mitigated by either removing the redirects or by adding a reference to the 4.1.1.0 version of the System.Runtime.dll and ensuring that it is present in the test output path.\r\n\r\nThis is affecting a lot of users (as seen in https://github.com/Microsoft/testfx/issues/241).

A year ago, we introduced [scoped API keys](https://blog.nuget.org/20170202/introducing-scoped-api-keys.html) to help our users better manage their API keys. While we recommend the use of scoped API keys, we will continue to support our legacy 'Full access API keys' that were previously granted by the service. Such keys do not expire if you use them at least one every 365 days to push a package.\r\n \r\nWe are making a change to our service such that a newly issued API key cannot be copied after the page is refreshed. While this was always the case for scoped API keys, we were allowing users with 'Full access API keys' to copy them down at any point. We plan to remove this capability in the future, as making this change allows us to migrate all of our APIs keys to use a one-way hash and further protect against malicious use of the key.\r\n\r\n**Starting Feb 5th 2018, the 'Full access API key' cannot be copied from NuGet.org**. While most of the packages pushed to NuGet.org now use a scoped API key and are not impacted by this change, users continuing to use our legacy 'Full access API keys' will need to securely stash the key before this date after which they will not be accessible. Please note that the 'Full access API keys' will continue to work just like they did before. We are only removing the ability to copy them down from NuGet.org.\r\n\r\nIf you have further question, please reach out to us by commenting on the [discussion issue](https://github.com/NuGet/NuGetGallery/issues/5231) or send me an email at [anangaur@microsoft.com](mailto:anangaur@microsoft.com).
