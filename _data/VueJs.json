This may be by design, but it is confusing because a `<transition>` at the component's template's root _does_ get triggered when the component is mounted.\r\n\r\n### What does the proposed API look like?\r\nWhen the following modal's template is mounted/destroyed, the dynamic `fade-in-*` classes are applied correctly, but the inner \"slide-up\" effect is never triggered. I propose that _all_ `<transition>`s (including the inner ones) that do not have an associated `v-for`/`v-if`/etc be triggered on component mounting (& before destroy).\r\n\r\n```html\r\n<template>\r\n<transition name=\"fade-in\">\r\n  <div class=\"modal-backdrop\">\r\n\r\n    <transition name=\"slide-up\">\r\n      <div v-show=\"show\" class=\"modal\" role=\"dialog\">\r\n        <div class=\"modal-dialog\" role=\"document\">\r\n          <div class=\"modal-content\">\r\n            <slot></slot>\r\n          </div>\r\n        </div>\r\n      </div>\r\n    </transition>\r\n\r\n  </div>\r\n</transition>\r\n</template>\r\n```\r\n\r\nCurrently, I'm using the following workaround, with the parent calling the `close` method via `$refs` and listening for `'close'` before destroying the modal.\r\n\r\n```javascript\r\n<script>\r\nexport default {\r\n  data() { return { show: false } },\r\n  mounted() {\r\n    this.show = true\r\n  },\r\n  methods: {\r\n    close() {\r\n      this.show = false\r\n      this.$nextTick(() => this.$emit('close'))\r\n    }\r\n  }\r\n}\r\n</script>\r\n```\r\n\r\n<!-- generated by vue-issues.

It should prompt an alert but in Firefox it doesn't. This is because in Firefox `keyCodes` are [not supported](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/KeyboardEvent/keyCode) and most browser will probably drop support in the future. If you check the `main.js` file I set custom keyCodes:\r\n\r\n```js\r\nVue.config.keyCodes = {\r\n  dot: 46\r\n};\r\n```\r\n\r\nI need to do this (to make it at least work on Chrome) because in directives I can't use the `.` as a modifier of the directive `@keypress` like so: `@keypress..=\"doSomething\"`.\r\n\r\nOne could think that somehow I can capture the `.` key, as described [in the documentation](https://vuejs.org/v2/guide/events.html#Automatic-Key-Modifiers) with Automatic Key Modifiers, however I can't because Vue uses `Keyboard.key` instead of `Keyboard.code`.\r\n\r\nI think using `KeyboardEvent` is a step in the right direction, however, using **KeyboardEvent.key instead of KeyboardEvent.code will open a whole ordeal of problems, like this issue**. You can check on this [online viewer](https://w3c.github.io/uievents/tools/key-event-viewer.html) the `KeyboardEvent.key` vs `KeyboardEvent.code`.\r\n\r\nIn the `App.vue` you can check all I've tried to capture the `.` key.

In the context of an app that uses multiple web components, we don't want to manually add every new component's tag to the `ignoredElements` list. Maintaining that list could quickly become a headache. If the  `isUnknownElement` also checks the custom elements registry, it could figure out that the element in question is not necessarily unknown.\r\n\r\n### What does the proposed API look like?\r\nThe API would stay the same, but on top of checking for `config.ignoredElements` in the function `isUnknownElement`, we would also check if `window.customElements.get(vnode.tag)` is defined or not. If it is defined, then we return false.\r\n\r\nI am happy to submit a pull request, I just wanted to discuss this first to make sure there aren't design constraints to adding something like this.\r\n\r\n<!-- generated by vue-issues.

But in production mode, the result css after processed by `less` is **wrong**, because:\r\n\r\n1. The `/deep/` syntax will be [considered a combinator](https://github.com/less/less.js/blob/master/lib/less/parser/parser.js#L1242-L1253)\r\n\r\n\r\n2. And then when [process a combinator](https://github.com/less/less.js/blob/master/lib/less/tree/combinator.js#L19-L22), when the `compress` flag(**in production it's `true` by default but in development is `false`**) is `true`, the result will be `''   combinator   ''`(i.e. `/deep/`), but it should be `' '  + combinator +  ' '`(i.e. \" /deep/ \"). I.e. there needs a space before and after the combinator. But in production mode it's not, so all deep selectors won't work in production mode. \r\n\r\nIMO, maybe `less.js` is right because combinators usually are '>', '+', '~', '^'...  **These combinators still work even there is no space before and after them.** On the other hand, `/deep/` is a 'feature' used by Vue rather than **pure CSS**, so `less.js` doesn't consider this is passable.\r\n\r\n### What is expected?\r\n`div { /deep/ a { color: red; } }` -> `div a {color: red;}`\r\n\r\n### What is actually happening?\r\n`div { /deep/ a { color: red; } }` -> `div/deep/a {color: red;}`\r\n\r\n### Versions\r\nless: 3.8.1\r\nvue-loader: 15.4.1\r\n\r\n<!-- generated by vue-issues.

So you could allow a slot to take multiple variations of a name.

The number will be set and display correctly, but the type will be string. You can confirm this in the Vue devtools.\r\n\r\n### What is expected?\r\nOn a fresh load or reload, the type of the \"number\" param should be the same as it was when it was set by Vue. The type should be number.\r\n\r\n### What is actually happening?\r\nOn reload, the type changes to string.\r\n\r\n---\r\nFrankly I don't care which type vue router gives to me. I would prefer the parsing happens automatically, so I get a number, but if I know I'll get a string, I can always call parseInt myself. The important thing is that there is no difference in types between loading from another page vs loading for the first time from a URL. With many more query params of different types it is a pain (and code bloat) to handle the case where any of them can come in as a string or as the expected type.\r\n\r\n<!-- generated by vue-issues.

It provides a few code snippets and assumes you'll understand. The documentation has been the biggest source of my frustration while using Vue since it never actually explains anything.\r\n\r\nFor example, on the Vuex installation page, sandwiched between CDN/package manager installation and building from source, you've put that Vuex needs to be instantiated in a module set up. You've provided zero context for this. Is this in the store? Is this for every file you need to access the store in? More importantly, it shouldn't be on the installation page, let alone sandwiched in between different installation methods. Vue's documentation is riddled with these issues. Unfortunately, I still don't actually know enough about how Vue actually works to be able to contribute to the documentation in any way. If I didn't have to use Vue for the project I am on, I would be using React, Redux, & RxJs and have access to meaningful, better written documentation that bothers to walk you through the set up. If Vue actually wants to gain any real traction, you're going to need to actually show folks how to use and set up your tools.\r\n\r\n<!-- generated by vue-issues.
