This advisory also provides guidance on what developers can do to update their applications to remove this vulnerability.\r\n\r\nMicrosoft is aware of a security feature bypass vulnerability that exists when .NET Core when HTTP authentication information is inadvertently exposed in an outbound request that encounters an HTTP redirect. An attacker who successfully exploited this vulnerability could use the information to further compromise the web application.\r\n\r\nThe update addresses the vulnerability by correcting how .NET Core applications handles HTTP redirects.\r\n\r\nSystem administrators running .NET Core 1.0 or .NET Core 1.1 applications must update their .NET Core runtimes to versions 1.0.13 and 1.1.10 then restart their applications. If installed applications target .NET Core 2.0, the applications must be migrated to 2.1 or newer and redeployed.\r\n\r\nDevelopers must update their .NET Core SDK to versions 1.1.11 and migrate any [.NET Core 2.0](https://docs.microsoft.com/dotnet/core/migration/20-21) or [ASP.NET Core 2.0](https://docs.microsoft.com/aspnet/core/migration/20_21?view=aspnetcore-2.1) applications to 2.1 then redeploy.\r\n\r\n## Discussion\r\n\r\nDiscussion for this issue can be found at <https://github.com/dotnet/corefx/> **TBD**\r\n\r\n### <a name=\"mitigation-factors\"></a>Mitigation factors\r\n\r\nNone\r\n\r\n## <a name=\"affected-software\"></a>Affected software\r\n\r\nAny .NET Core application that runs on a .NET Core 1.0.x runtime with a version number of 1.0.12 or lower, or a .NET Core application that runs on a .NET Core 1.1.x runtime with a version number of 1.1.9 or lower, or a .NET Core application that runs on a .NET Core 2.0.x runtime.\r\n\r\nAdditionally package authors should check their dependencies to ensure they aren't depending on a vulnerable version of the following package:\r\n\r\n<a name=\"package-list\"></a>Package name | Vulnerable versions | Secure versions\r\n------------ | ---------------- | -------------------------\r\nSystem.Net.Http| 2.0.20126.16343, 2.0.20505, 2.0.20710, 4.0.0, 4.1.0, 4.1.1, 4.1.2, 4.3.0, 4.3.1, 4.3.2, 4.3.3 |  4.3.4 or later\r\n\r\n## <a name=\"advisory-faq\"></a>Advisory FAQ\r\n\r\n### <a name=\"how-affected\"></a>How do I know if I am affected?\r\n\r\nAny .NET Core application that runs on a .NET Core 1.0.x runtime with a version number of 1.0.12 or lower, or a .NET Core application that runs on a .NET Core 1.1.x runtime with a version number of 1.1.9 or lower, or a .NET Core application that runs on a .NET Core 2.0.x runtime.\r\n\r\nTo check the currently installed runtimes and SDKs with version 2.1 or later of .NET Core, open a command prompt and run the `dotnet --info` command. You should see an output similar to the following:\r\n\r\n```\r\n.NET Core SDK (reflecting any global.json):\r\n Version:   2.1.403\r\n Commit:    04e15494b6\r\n\r\nRuntime Environment:\r\n OS Name:     Windows\r\n OS Version:  10.0.17763\r\n OS Platform: Windows\r\n RID:         win10-x64\r\n Base Path:   C:\\Program Files\\dotnet\\sdk\\2.1.403\\\r\n\r\nHost (useful for support):\r\n  Version: 2.1.5\r\n  Commit:  290303f510\r\n\r\n.NET Core SDKs installed:\r\n  1.0.4 [C:\\Program Files\\dotnet\\sdk]\r\n  1.1.10 [C:\\Program Files\\dotnet\\sdk]\r\n  2.0.3 [C:\\Program Files\\dotnet\\sdk]\r\n  2.1.4 [C:\\Program Files\\dotnet\\sdk]\r\n\r\n.NET Core runtimes installed:\r\n  Microsoft.AspNetCore.All 2.1.4 [C:\\Program Files\\dotnet\\shared\\Microsoft.AspNetCore.All]\r\n  Microsoft.AspNetCore.App 2.1.4 [C:\\Program Files\\dotnet\\shared\\Microsoft.AspNetCore.App]\r\n  Microsoft.NETCore.App 1.0.12 [C:\\Program Files\\dotnet\\shared\\Microsoft.NETCore.App]\r\n  Microsoft.NETCore.App 1.1.9 [C:\\Program Files\\dotnet\\shared\\Microsoft.NETCore.App]\r\n  Microsoft.NETCore.App 2.0.9 [C:\\Program Files\\dotnet\\shared\\Microsoft.NETCore.App]\r\n  Microsoft.NETCore.App 2.1.5 [C:\\Program Files\\dotnet\\shared\\Microsoft.NETCore.App]\r\n\r\nTo install additional .NET Core runtimes or SDKs:\r\n  https://aka.ms/dotnet-download\r\n```\r\n\r\nIf you don't see a runtime entry for 1.0.13 or 1.1.10, any .NET Core 1.x applications run on that computer are vulnerable.\r\n\r\nIf you don't have a 2.1 version of the runtime or SDK installed, you can produce the complete list of runtimes by performing a directory listing in the install root directories. The default root directories are listed in the following table:\r\n\r\n| Operating System | Location |\r\n|------------------|----------|\r\n| Windows | `C:\\Program Files\\dotnet\\shared\\Microsoft.NETCore.App\\` |\r\n| macOS | `/usr/local/share/dotnet/shared/Microsoft.NETCore.App/` |\r\n| Supported Linux platforms | `/usr/share/dotnet/shared/Microsoft.NETCore.App/` |\r\n\r\nEach runtime version is installed in its own directory, where the directory name is the version number. If you don't have a directory for 1.0.13, 1.1.10 then any application targeting versions 1.0 or 1.1 are vulnerable.\r\n\r\nAdditionally, if you've deployed [self-contained applications](https://docs.microsoft.com/dotnet/core/deploying/#self-contained-deployments-scd) targeting any of the impacted versions, these applications are also vulnerable and must be recompiled and redeployed.\r\n\r\n### <a name=\"fix-runtime\">How do I fix the vulnerability?\r\n\r\nSystem administrators are advised to update their .NET Core runtimes to versions 1.0.13, 1.1.10 and install the latest 2.1 runtime, ensuring that any 2.0 applications are migrated to 2.1 as soon as possible.\r\n\r\n Developers are advised to update their .NET Core SDK to versions 1.1.11 and migrate any [.NET Core](https://docs.microsoft.com/dotnet/core/migration/20-21) or [ASP.NET Core 2.0](https://docs.microsoft.com/aspnet/core/migration/20_21?view=aspnetcore-2.1) applications to 2.1 and redeploy.\r\n\r\n## Other Information\r\n\r\n### Reporting Security Issues\r\n\r\nIf you have found a potential security issue in .NET Core, please email details to secure@microsoft.com. Reports may qualify for the .NET Core Bug Bounty.

The newer version of `StackTrace` makes async stack traces far more usable, but also introduces overhead due to System.Reflection being...less than awesome.\r\n\r\nThe code in question is trying to take what is an async stack frame and find the \"user\" method that goes with it. This happens by checking if the type we're on is decorated with `[CompilerGenerated]` (via `.IsDefined()`) and if so, looping through all methods in the parent class decorated with `[AsyncStateMachine]`, looping at their Type property, and seeing which one we belong with.\r\n\r\nWith the above info, we know we need not look at parents in the reflection path. This introduces additional overhead in both `.IsDefined()` and `.GetCustomAttributes<T>()` in pretty much every call to them. Since this resolution runs for every stack frame in every exception, so the multiplicative impact is quite large.\r\n\r\n#### Details\r\nFor `.GetCustomAttributes<T>()`:\r\nThis eventually calls down [to `CustomAttribute.GetCustomAttributes()`](https://github.com/dotnet/coreclr/blob/57f8358221a3c4ad7f1608f625bc3c5936618505/src/System.Private.CoreLib/src/System/Reflection/CustomAttribute.cs#L1302). By looking at the short circuit path in: https://github.com/dotnet/coreclr/blob/57f8358221a3c4ad7f1608f625bc3c5936618505/src/System.Private.CoreLib/src/System/Reflection/CustomAttribute.cs#L1315-L1320\r\n\r\nWe can avoid [the list allocation](https://github.com/dotnet/coreclr/blob/57f8358221a3c4ad7f1608f625bc3c5936618505/src/System.Private.CoreLib/src/System/Reflection/CustomAttribute.cs#L1322), [the array from `.ToArray()`](https://github.com/dotnet/coreclr/blob/57f8358221a3c4ad7f1608f625bc3c5936618505/src/System.Private.CoreLib/src/System/Reflection/CustomAttribute.cs#L1341), and [the resulting combined array](https://github.com/dotnet/coreclr/blob/57f8358221a3c4ad7f1608f625bc3c5936618505/src/System.Private.CoreLib/src/System/Reflection/CustomAttribute.cs#L1340) by not looking for inherited attributed members that cannot exist for our purposes of creating a stack trace.\r\n\r\nFor `.IsDefined()`:\r\nThis eventually calls down [to `CustomAttribute.IsDefined()`](https://github.com/NickCraver/coreclr/blob/5135e9878839f721c0262c4bad03d44e3c612eb1/src/System.Private.CoreLib/src/System/Reflection/CustomAttribute.cs#L1123). We can [also short circuit overhead there](https://github.com/NickCraver/coreclr/blob/5135e9878839f721c0262c4bad03d44e3c612eb1/src/System.Private.CoreLib/src/System/Reflection/CustomAttribute.cs#L1136).\r\n\r\n#### Impact\r\nIn a test deploy of some .NET Core code for websockets at Stack Overflow, we were throwing a few thousand exceptions *per minute* (not that many) and racked up millions of arrays from these code paths. Here's a quick summary of that memory dump:\r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/454813/47045112-083bc300-d160-11e8-8b25-65ee3b42faf4.png)\r\n\r\nNote that Gen 0 is not being cleared correctly (that's a separate issue), but we needn't be allocating these arrays in the first place.\r\n\r\nI'll open another PR tomorrow (thanks to @benaadams for digging with me!) where we have a plan to utilize `Array.Empty<T>()` in the reflection miss (no attributes found) path that's another optimization on top of this with quick wins for all reflection consumers.\r\n\r\ncc @benaadams @mgravell
