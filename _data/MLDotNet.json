Hide _image re-size_ step:** Since the image size is determined by the internal DNN model (TensorFlow model, currently) why don't we simply do it within the `ImageClassification` code?\r\n\r\n**2. Hide extract pixels step:** Same thing here. The extract pixels step should be hidden as part of the `ImageClassification` code. This is surfacing too much details. I expect the interleavePixelColors could also be determined by the info in the TF model .pb file, ot in the worst case based on the Architecture metadata that we could have per architecture (InceptionV3, etc.).\r\n \r\n**3. Hide EPOCH and BATCHSIZE:** These are also configuration details that, even when they currently have \"by default values\" (epoch=10 and batchSize=20), those values are not valid for *any* imageset and architecture and should vary depending on the specific image-set size and chosen architecture. I'd be good to have them initialized dynamically within the `ImageClassification` code depending on the context instead of \"fixed default values\" and parameters that surface to the user who might not know what is an EPOCH or BATCH.\r\n\r\nAfter simplifying the above points, the example code could look like the following, which looks a lot simpler and clean: :)\r\n\r\n```\r\n var pipeline = mlContext.Transforms.Conversion.MapValueToKey(\"Label\")\r\n                    .Append(mlContext.Transforms.LoadImages(\"ImageObject\", null, \"ImagePath\"))\r\n                    .Append(mlContext.Model.ImageClassification(\"ImageObject\", \"Label\", arch: DnnEstimator.Architecture.InceptionV3));  \r\n```\r\n\r\nEven the architecture should also be simplified and maybe letting the user select per type of images to be trained, such as: Photos vs. Numbers/Digits vs. other characteristics that make one or the other architecture advisable to be used. A regular .NET developer usually won't know if he/she should use InceptionV3 vs. ResnetV2101, etc.\r\n","Url":"https://github.com/dotnet/machinelearning/issues/4087","RelatedDescription":"Open issue \"[ImageClassification Transfer Learning] Simplify/Hide steps and hyper-parameters in new ImageClassification - Transfer Learning \" (#4087)"},{"Id":"478195262","IsPullRequest":false,"CreatedAt":"2019-08-07T16:11:27","Actor":"jaxidian","Number":"4092","RawContent":null,"Title":"How do I max out CPU cores with AutoML?","State":"open","Body":"I'm using AutoML to find and train the \"best model possible\" for my set of data.

I have a workstation with 12 cores (24 threads) yet when I have AutoML hammering at my system for multiple minutes, I only see ~20-25% CPU usage with most of my cores sitting idle. Given that it is training many different models at once, shouldn't it be able to make use of every single core available, complete with SMT resources as well? Is this configurable somewhere?","Url":"https://github.com/dotnet/machinelearning/issues/4092","RelatedDescription":"Open issue \"How do I max out CPU cores with AutoML?\" (#4092)"},{"Id":"478147052","IsPullRequest":false,"CreatedAt":"2019-08-06T17:07:01","Actor":"likellykang","Number":"4086","RawContent":null,"Title":"Easy way to get model parameters of AutoML's best run ","State":"open","Body":"It seems like there is no straightforward way to let users exam AutoML best run's model parameters when using AutoML API in ML.NET at this point. \r\nThis is potentially important for uses who need to re-produce AutoML's best run in other platforms. \r\n","Url":"https://github.com/dotnet/machinelearning/issues/4086","RelatedDescription":"Open issue \"Easy way to get model parameters of AutoML's best run \" (#4086)"}],"ResultType":"GitHubIssue"}},"RunOn":"2019-08-15T05:30:36.8468887Z","RunDurationInMilliseconds":666}
