Any property reads in bindings,\r\ninterpolations etc. read from a given object (usually the component\r\ninstance). In that case there is an _implicit_ receiver which can also\r\nbe specified explicitly by just using `this`.\r\n\r\ne.g.\r\n\r\n```html\r\n<ng-template>{{this.myProperty}}</ng-template>\r\n```\r\n\r\nThis works as expected in Ivy and View Engine, but breaks in case the\r\nimplicit receiver is not used for property reads. For example:\r\n\r\n```html\r\n<my-dir [myFn]=\"greetFn.bind(this)\"></my-dir>\r\n```\r\n\r\nIn that case the `this` will not be properly translated into the generated\r\ntemplate function code because the Ivy compiler currently always treats\r\nthe `ctx` variable as the implicit receiver. This is **not correct** and breaks\r\ncompatibility with View Engine. Rather we need to ensure that we retrieve\r\nthe root context for the standalone implicit receiver similar to how it works\r\nfor property reads (as seen in the example above with `this.myProperty`)\r\n\r\nNote that this requires some small changes to the `expression_converter`\r\nbecause we only want to generate the `eenextContent()` instruction if the\r\nimplicit receiver is _actually_ used/needed. View Engine determines if that is the case\r\nby recursively walking through the converted output AST and checking for usages of\r\nthe `o.variable('_co')` variable ([see here][ve_check]). This would work too for Ivy, but involves\r\nmost likely more code duplication since templates are isolated in different functions and it\r\nanother pass through the output AST for every template expression.\r\n\r\n[ve_check]: https://github.com/angular/angular/blob/0d6c9d36a174f7dc6eb1029e459beecc2dfb0026/packages/compiler/src/view_compiler/view_compiler.ts#L206-L208\r\n\r\nResolves FW-1366.","Url":"https://github.com/angular/angular/pull/30897","RelatedDescription":"Open PR \"fix(ivy): unable to bind to implicit receiver in embedded views\" (#30897)"},{"Id":"452906401","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2019-06-06T15:51:57","Actor":"petebacondarwin","Number":"30889","RawContent":null,"Title":"build(docs-infra): fix CLI command github links","State":"closed","Body":"The \"view\" links were broken because the version used to\r\ncompute the git tag for the GitHub URL included a build SHA.\r\nNow we clean that off before using it in the URL.\r\n\r\nThe links are to the JSON schema that defines the documentation for\r\nthe command.

(Or: _\"lazy loaded modules that depend on **some** components of other lazy loaded modules\"_)\r\n\r\n### Example 1:\r\nI have an enterprise application with lot's of modules, which are all lazy loaded. But some of these modules use a few components and services of other modules. \r\n```\r\napp/\r\n    module1/\r\n        components/\r\n            M1Component1\r\n            M1Component2 <-- uses M1Component1 internally. no problem because it's the same module\r\n\r\n    module2/\r\n            M2Component1 <-- uses M1Component1 internally\r\n```\r\nWhat's the best way to solve this? Putting these components into `SharedModule` isn't an option, because those components aren't _\"**commonly** used\"_. And importing the whole `Module1` into `Module2` isn't an either, because I only need a few components from `Module1`.\r\n\r\n### Example 2:\r\nThe application has a `DashboardModule` which uses `InjectionToken` and `Provider`s to register `WidgetComponent`s from other modules. Those `Providers` must be registered at application start (or when the `DashboardModule` gets loaded).\r\nIn other words: The `DashboardModule` doesn't know any widgets by itself. All widgets are provided by the other modules. But all those modules are lazy loaded.\r\n```\r\napp/\r\n    dashboard/\r\n        services/\r\n            DashboardWidgetTypeService <-- with @Inject(DASHBOARD_WIDGET) widgets\r\n\r\n    module1/ <-- provides M1DashboardComponent as DASHBOARD_WIDGET\r\n        components/\r\n            M1DashboardComponent\r\n\r\n    module2/ <-- provides M2DashboardComponent as DASHBOARD_WIDGET\r\n        components/\r\n            M2DashboardComponent\r\n```\r\n\r\n### Current Solution:\r\n<!-- If applicable please describe the difference between the expected and actual behavior after following the repro steps. -->\r\n<!-- ✍️edit:-->\r\n\r\nAt the moment each module consists of 2 modules: a `SharedFeatureModule` and a `FeatureModule`. And the `AppModule` imports all those `SharedFeatureModule`s.\r\n```\r\napp/\r\n    module1/\r\n        MyFeature1Module <-- imports MyFeature1RoutingModule and MyFeature1SharedModule\r\n        MyFeature1RoutingModule\r\n        MyFeature1SharedModule <-- has forRoot method to register Dashboard providers\r\n\r\n    module2/\r\n        MyFeature2Module <-- imports MyFeature2RoutingModule and MyFeature2SharedModule and MyFeature1SharedModule\r\n        MyFeature2RoutingModule\r\n        MyFeature2SharedModule <-- has forRoot method to register Dashboard providers\r\n\r\n    AppModule <-- imports MyFeature1SharedModule.forRoot() and MyFeature2SharedModule.forRoot()\r\n```\r\nThe `AppModule` imports all `SharedFeatureModule`s via `forRoot()` to register the dashboard widget providers.\r\n\r\nI'm not yet sure what's the \"best practice\" for this. But I'm sure you'll have some good advice.","Url":"https://github.com/angular/angular/issues/30896","RelatedDescription":"Open issue \"Style Guide / Docs advice for partially shared lazy feature modules\" (#30896)"},{"Id":"453031796","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2019-06-06T13:29:49","Actor":"gkalpak","Number":"30894","RawContent":null,"Title":"fix(docs-infra): do not redirect docs URLs on archive deployments","State":"open","Body":"To avoid showing outdated info (such as events, resources, etc.) but still allow people to see docs for older versions, we redirect non-documentation URLs to `/docs`.

Some specific areas: \r\n\r\n* Before and after section headings. We need more space above a new section. See guide/deprecations.md for examples.\r\n\r\n* At bottom of alert boxes. See start/index.md alert about stackblitz tips. Not enough space below text. \r\n\r\n* Between text and figures. See start/index.md for one set of instructions with screen shots that follow. See guide/architecture.md and related architecture*.md for examples with diagrams. Also guide/forms-overview.md.\r\n\r\nAlso worth checking before and after tables.\r\n\r\nMarkdown is particularly poor in supporting authors in this regard. Where style sheets require specific spacing in the doc source file, we should be more clear in the Doc Style Guide about blank lines, etc. that are required to get the correct spacing and put in docs backlog to clean up certain elements (such as clean up all alerts). https://angular.io/guide/docs-style-guide \r\n\r\n\r\n<!-- ✍️edit:--> A clear and concise description of the problem...\r\n\r\n\r\n## 🔬 Minimal Reproduction\r\nSee above \r\n\r\n### What's the affected URL?**\r\n<!-- ✍️edit:--> https://angular.io/...\r\nSee above\r\n\r\n### Reproduction Steps**\r\n<!-- If applicable please list the steps to take to reproduce the issue -->\r\n<!-- ✍️edit:-->\r\nSee above\r\n\r\n### Expected vs Actual Behavior**\r\n<!-- If applicable please describe the difference between the expected and actual behavior after following the repro steps. -->\r\n<!-- ✍️edit:-->\r\nSee above\r\n\r\n## 📷Screenshot\r\n<!-- Often a screenshot can help to capture the issue better than a long description. -->\r\n<!-- ✍️upload a screenshot:-->\r\n\r\n\r\n## 🔥 Exception or Error\r\n<pre><code>\r\n<!-- If the issue is accompanied by an exception or an error, please share it below: -->\r\n<!-- ✍️-->\r\n\r\n</code></pre>\r\n\r\n\r\n## 🌍  Your Environment\r\n\r\n### Browser info\r\n<!-- ✍️Is this a browser specific issue?

inclusion of bootstrap scss within a wrapper selector looks like this:\r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/4008452/58956143-f3b74400-879d-11e9-8da7-01d7e3f8ef2f.png)\r\n\r\n\r\nclone this repo: `https://github.com/cmaart/angular-bootstrap-css-problem`\r\nrun it with `ng serve --prod` and you will see that the container on the site has set a min-width which actually should only be in print mode.\r\n\r\nCSS with **non-prod mode**  (the min-width style for container is **inside** of the media query for print):\r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/4008452/58955900-5f4ce180-879d-11e9-8048-e9aa070341b7.png)\r\n\r\n\r\nCSS with **prod mode** (the min-width style for container is

With flexible connected position strategy the flexible dimensions are calculated relative to the viewport, and thus for a very long menu isOverlayClipped is always fired. \r\n","Url":"https://github.com/angular/components/issues/16214","RelatedDescription":"Open issue \"Mat Menu overlaps toolbar when scrolled\" (#16214)"},{"Id":"452071053","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2019-06-05T19:24:07","Actor":"crisbeto","Number":"16202","RawContent":null,"Title":"fix: prevent default on escape key presses","State":"closed","Body":"Calls `preventDefault` on all handlers that deal with the escape key, except when a modifier is pressed since the user might've intended something different.
