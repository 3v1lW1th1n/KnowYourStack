This change instead utilizes the information in the particle constraint that already exists on an item to determine where the child should be inserted.\r\n\r\nThis change introduces the ability to *compile* particle information into a list of paths to identify location of each element. This is then used during insertion to identify if an element should be added before or after the other.
