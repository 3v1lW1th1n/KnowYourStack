tooltip should pop a popper on the right side in the electron app too.\r\n\r\n\r\n### What is actually happening?\r\nThe tooltip didn't pop a popper on the right side in the electron app.\r\n\r\n\r\n---\r\nI investigated the issue, found that at `element-ui\\packages\\tooltip\\src\\main.js` Line 88 the render function passed `ref: 'popper'` into `createElement` function. The tooltip instance should get a ref to that VNode for the use in `element-ui\\src\\utils\\vue-popper.js (a mixin)` Line 87. \r\n\r\nIn a normal browser, setting a breakpoint at `vue.js` Line 5390 will see exactly one call with `vnode.data.ref` equals `popper` in 7 calls to the `registerRef` function, but in electron environment, setting a breakpoint at `vue.common.js` Line 5405 will never see such a call in 5 calls.\r\n\r\nIt seems that in electron environment, the ref is not registered properly.\r\n\r\n<!-- generated by vue-issues.

Press the \"run\" button to trigger the initial render.\r\n\r\n### What is expected?\r\nThe console should print \"slot missing\" and \"default slot content\" should appear in the rendered div.\r\n\r\n### What is actually happening?\r\nThe console prints \"slot present\" and nothing appears in the rendered div. It seems like the `v-if` is being moved from the slot itself to the slot contents (which is why executing the slot returns nothing rather than \"custom slot contents\").\r\n\r\n---\r\nConsumers of my component may want to customize how a particular piece is being rendered. Using `v-if` to toggle this always results in the slot being defined in `this.$scopedSlots`. Based on [this commit](https://github.com/vuejs/vue/commit/68bdbf508b915872627676d6bf987bdac9e5fe97) it would seem that putting a `v-if` on a scoped slot is valid usage.\r\n\r\nI could in theory check `this.$scopedSlots.content()` to see if they provided the slot, but this doesn't allow me to determine whether the user provided no slot, or they intentionally provided an empty slot.\r\n\r\n<!-- generated by vue-issues.

Currently registerModule only supports registering namespaced modules with `store.registerModule`.  \r\n\r\nFor example lets say you have two namespaced modules that you dynamically load into your application: Sandwich and Human.  The two modules shouldn't know anything about each other.  There needs to be some highter level actions and getters that can tie the two together that you can also dynamically load.\r\n\r\n### What does the proposed API look like?\r\n```\r\nstore.registerActions({\r\n  ...newActions\r\n})\r\n\r\nstore.registerGetters({\r\n  ...newGetters\r\n})\r\n```\r\nThese functions would still throw errors if the user tried to register duplicate actions or getters so it would be up the the user to make sure they are not passing in duplicates by checking existing data and making sure their actions and getters are namespaced appropriately.\r\n\r\n<!-- generated by vue-issues.

I understand that there are currently two ways to achieve what I want in user land but neither of them are ideal.\r\n\r\n1. Define modules that are `namespaced` that have actions and getters that only reference rootGetters, rootState and dispatch to root. I've never like using the root features.

This is currently what I'm doing.\r\n\r\n### What does the proposed API look like?\r\n\r\nString `namespace` - Setting `namespace` would namespace all actions, getters, and mutations with that value. A \".\" separator to be able to distinguish between a namespaced module that is localized (\"/\") and not localized (\".\"). A module with this setting should never have state as it's only purpose is to group together other modules actions, getters, and mutations to do higher order operations.\r\n\r\nSome validations worth calling out.\r\n- if the namespace option was set, validate that there is no state defined. \r\n\r\n<!-- generated by vue-issues.

I don't think this line of reasoning holds in the Vue/Vuex world. In almost all other aspects of Vue/Vuex, the API looks straight forward (e.g. just getting and setting properties), but under the hood a lot of additional logic runs (dependency tracking, etc.). So there is really no need to make committing mutations more cumbersome than they need to be.\r\n\r\nIn addition to making the code harder to read, this leads to additional rules about argument passing.\r\n\r\nMoreover, it is very hard to spot typos in the mutation name early on, as the mutation name is just a string - let alone checking that the call to `commit()` received the correct arguments according to the mutation function. These types of errors should be easy to spot at compile time, but with the current syntax, these are all pushed into runtime.\r\n\r\nFinally, this cumbersome syntax might be (correctly) perceived as boilerplate, especially to beginners. Hence, replacing the commit syntax with a more straight forward syntax might improve the adoption of Vuex.\r\n\r\n### What does the proposed API look like?\r\nInstead of:\r\n\r\n    this.$store.commit('someMutation', args...)\r\n\r\none should be allowed to write:\r\n\r\n    this.$store.someMutation(args...)\r\n\r\nMoreover, it would be great if looking at `this.$store` in the developer console all available mutation methods are shown. That is, the methods should be real properties of this.$store, collected once at program start.\r\n\r\nUnder the hood, of course, these methods might all call some central commit() function.\r\n\r\nAlternative syntax: The above syntax might introduce some name collisions. For example, someone might name one of their mutations \"state\", for whatever reason, making \"this.$store.state\" ambiguous. For the sake of simplicity, these names should just be forbidden as mutation names. But if this is not an option for whatever reason, an intermediate object might do the trick as well. This would be less beautiful, but still better than what we have today:\r\n\r\n    this.$store.commit.someMutation(args...)\r\n\r\nor shorter:\r\n\r\n    this.$store.c.someMutation(args...)\r\n\r\nAs an additional proposal, the old `this.$store.commit()` syntax should be marked deprecated.  And removed in future Vuex versions. This generic call is not needed. Any generic commit call might as well be formulated as `this.$store[mutationName](args...)`, which is still easy to understand and even shorter than `this.$store.commit(mutationName, args...)`.\r\n\r\n<!-- generated by vue-issues.
