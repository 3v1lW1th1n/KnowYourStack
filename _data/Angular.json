As a result, the main package\r\ndepended on all of the ngtsc internal packages, and a significant portion of\r\nngtsc logic lived in NgtscProgram.\r\n\r\nThis commit refactors NgtscProgram and moves the main logic of compilation\r\ninto a new 'core' package. The new package defines a new API which enables\r\nimplementers of TypeScript compilers (compilers built using the TS API) to\r\nsupport Angular transpilation as well. It involves a new NgCompiler type\r\nwhich takes a ts.Program and performs Angular analysis and transformations,\r\nas well as an NgCompilerHost which wraps an input ts.CompilerHost and adds\r\nany extra Angular files.\r\n\r\nTogether, these two classes are used to implement a new NgtscProgram which\r\nadapts the legacy api.Program interface used by the View Engine compiler\r\nonto operations on the new types. The new NgtscProgram implementation is\r\nsignificantly smaller and easier to reason about.\r\n\r\nThe new NgCompilerHost replaces the previous GeneratedShimsHostWrapper which\r\nlived in the 'shims' package.\r\n\r\nA new 'resource' package is added to support the HostResourceLoader which\r\npreviously lived in the outer compiler package.\r\n\r\nAs a result of the refactoring, the dependencies of the outer\r\n@angular/compiler-cli package on ngtsc internal packages are significantly\r\ntrimmed.\r\n\r\nThis refactoring was driven by the desire to build a plugin interface to the\r\ncompiler so that tsc_wrapped (another consumer of the TS compiler APIs) can\r\nperform Angular transpilation on user request.\r\n","Url":"https://github.com/angular/angular/pull/34887","RelatedDescription":"Open PR \"refactor(ivy): introduce the 'core' package and split apart NgtscProgram\" (#34887)"},{"Id":"553183544","IsPullRequest":false,"CreatedAt":"2020-01-21T22:36:13","Actor":"mgechev","Number":"34886","RawContent":null,"Title":"ERROR in Cannot read property 'members' of undefined","State":"open","Body":"<!--🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅\r\n\r\nOh hi there! 😄\r\n\r\nTo expedite issue processing please search open and closed issues before submitting a new one.\r\nExisting issues often contain information about workarounds, resolution, or progress updates.\r\n\r\n🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅-->\r\n\r\n\r\n# 🐞 bug report\r\n\r\nAfter running `ng serve` in [this project](https://github.com/mgechev/ngx-charts/tree/compiler-bug), I get:\r\n\r\n```\r\nERROR in Cannot read property 'members' of undefined\r\n```\r\n\r\n### Affected Package\r\n\r\n```\r\n@angular/compiler\r\n```\r\n\r\n\r\n### Is this a regression?\r\n\r\nLooks like it is.

The grand child then tries to display the template with `ngTemplateOutlet` but nothing is shown.\r\n\r\n\r\n## 🔬 Minimal Reproduction\r\n\r\nAs I wasn't able to reproduce the problem on StackBlitz, I set up a minimal GitHub repo at https://github.com/gillerr/ngTemplateoutlet.\r\n\r\nThe **master** branch (https://github.com/gillerr/ngTemplateoutlet/tree/master/src/app) has been created with `ng new ngTemplateoutlet` and cleaned up of anything irrelevant. It features Angular 8 and works as expected.\r\n\r\nThe **angular9** branch (https://github.com/gillerr/ngTemplateoutlet/tree/angular9/src/app) contains the exact same code, I only executed \r\n`ng update @angular/core@9.0.0-next.0 @angular/cli@9.0.0-next.0` and pushed relevant files (`angular.json`, `package.json`, `package-lock.json` and `tsconfig.app.json`). I also had to manually update `typescript`.\r\n\r\nThe **workaround** branch (https://github.com/gillerr/ngTemplateoutlet/tree/workaround/src/app) shows a workaround that solves the problem but not in a way that satisfies me.

In its current form it assumes that the es5 exports of all libraries are transpiled versions of their es2015 exports. \r\n\r\nThis is not necessarily true. A library could decide to use hand-optimized version for es5 and es2015.\r\n\r\nIf I configure the Angular application build to use es5 as a target, then the build process would use the es5 exports of the libraries.\r\n\r\nThe Angular package format documentation clearly documents different es5 and es2015 entry points into libraries.

It shows a pending forever in the network tab and we theorize that this is because it is getting some kind of parsing error.\r\n\r\nWe first tracked it down to the @angular-dev-kit/build-angular and then to this commit (https://github.com/angular/angular-cli/commit/6ffa74acead4798a42f82b4a3001fec26625d738) which upgraded core-js 3.3.6 to 3.6.0 to the build-angular dependencies. Any build after this one (https://github.com/angular/angular-devkit-build-angular-builds/commit/cbd21fa9307631006689f42f2afeb986f5c4f5be) fails to load in IE11 with either a never ending spinner or a long running script error. No other errors ever present themselves in the console.\r\n\r\nFor any build after the one listed above, if you go into the `node_modules/@angular-devkit/build-angular/node_modules` and delete the `core-js` folder, then node will revert to the project `core-js` folder (we can verify it works at 3.1.4, 3.3.6, and 3.5.0) and everything works just fine.\r\n\r\nWe have tested this with the most recent commits/builds and this is still an issue with 3.6.4 of core-js.\r\n\r\n\r\n## 🔬 Minimal Reproduction\r\n<!--\r\nSimple steps to reproduce this bug.\r\n\r\nPlease include: commands run (including args), packages added, related code changes.\r\n\r\nIf reproduction steps are not enough for reproduction of your issue, please create a minimal GitHub repository with the reproduction of the issue. \r\nA good way to make a minimal reproduction is to create a new app via `ng new repro-app` and add the minimum possible code to show the problem. \r\nShare the link to the repo below along with step-by-step instructions to reproduce the problem, as well as expected and actual behavior.\r\n\r\nIssues that don't have enough info and can't be reproduced will be closed.\r\n\r\nYou can read more about issue submission guidelines here: https://github.com/angular/angular-cli/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md#-submitting-an-issue\r\n-->\r\nThis is super hard to reproduce because we are running an AngularJS and Angular hybrid app with over half a million lines of code. We are not sure what in our build process is causing the issue but it is for sure being caused by the upgrade to version 3.6.x of `core-js`. We are very happy to do any kind of screen share or provide more information if that is required.\r\n\r\nWe are attempting to make a project that makes this reproducable\r\n\r\n## 🔥 Exception or Error\r\nThe only error is sometimes it errors with \"...not responding due to a long running script\"\r\n\r\n\r\n## 🌍 Your Environment\r\n<pre><code>\r\nAngular CLI: 9.0.0-rc.9\r\nNode: 12.13.0\r\nOS: darwin x64\r\n\r\nAngular: 9.0.0-rc.9\r\n... animations, cli, common, compiler, compiler-cli, core, forms\r\n... language-service, localize, platform-browser\r\n... platform-browser-dynamic, router, service-worker, upgrade\r\nIvy Workspace: Yes\r\n\r\nPackage                           Version\r\n-----------------------------------------------------------\r\n@angular-devkit/architect         0.900.0-rc.9\r\n@angular-devkit/build-angular     0.900.0-rc.9\r\n@angular-devkit/build-optimizer   0.900.0-rc.9\r\n@angular-devkit/build-webpack     0.900.0-rc.9\r\n@angular-devkit/core              9.0.0-rc.9\r\n@angular-devkit/schematics        9.0.0-rc.9\r\n@angular/cdk                      9.0.0-rc.8\r\n@ngtools/webpack                  9.0.0-rc.9\r\n@schematics/angular               9.0.0-rc.9\r\n@schematics/update                0.900.0-rc.9\r\nrxjs                              6.5.3\r\ntypescript                        3.6.4\r\nwebpack                           4.41.5\r\n</code></pre>\r\n\r\n**Anything else relevant?**\r\n<!-- ✍️Is this a browser specific issue?
