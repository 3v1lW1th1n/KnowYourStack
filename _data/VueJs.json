`[name-not-finalized] start`, users can have a fully featured text editor right inside Chrome DevTools shell, automatically pointing at their project directory.\r\n\r\nIt comes with DOM inspector, where you pick an element and it'll literally take you to `file:line:col` where that element was defined. So you don't have to look through files to figure out where that button below the header is coming from. Useful when a new dev joins a project or you're revisiting your work after a very long time.\r\n\r\n▶ [Watch 30 sec demo w/ a React project](http://goo.gl/d64cgv)\r\n\r\n___\r\n\r\nAnd of course, it also works with Vue projects, just as awesome.\r\n\r\n▶ [Watch 20 sec demo w/ a Vue project](https://drive.google.com/open?id=1rGeFiNLezxzaJqnhnDbjvD_OvLMyaMIh)\r\n\r\nAbove demos were shot using locally tinkered compilers (just not clean enough to be a PR)\r\n\r\nThe goal is to deliver the ultimate developer experience ever. Other features are in development as we speak, like CSS QuickEditing, built-in image editor and a SVG editor so devs don't have to fire up Illustrator or Photoshop to make minor tweaks to their stuff.\r\n\r\nThe only hurdle in me releasing the app is getting external players to participate in revolutionizing how we write web.\r\n\r\nSo to wrap up I have only two requests:\r\n- Please have the template compilers add metadata to each tag (either as data attribute, or property on DOM node itself), that contains path to `*.vue` file (can be relative to project root), `line:col`/offset where the tag opens and last `line:col`/offset where the tag closes.\r\n\r\n- Please star this issue: https://bugs.chromium.org/p/chromium/issues/detail?id=811036\r\n\r\n### What does the proposed API look like?\r\nSomething like this:\r\n```javascript\r\nconsole.log(someElement.__vue__._debugSource)\r\n// > { file: 'src/components/Header.vue', line: 12, col: 4, lineEnd: 16, col: 8 }\r\n// or\r\n// > { file: 'src/components/Header.vue', start: 241, end: 352 }\r\n```\r\n\r\n<!-- generated by vue-issues.

An example of this is using Vue as a frontend for Wordpress, but allowing wordpress to dictate the url structure.\r\n\r\nSo for example\r\n\r\nwould have a route that looks like:\r\n```\r\n{\r\n      name: 'post',\r\n      path: '/:permalink([0-9] [/][0-9] [/][\\\\S] )',\r\n      component: StandardArticle\r\n}\r\n```\r\nand a page would have a route that looks like:\r\n```\r\n{\r\n     name: 'page',\r\n     path: '/:permalink*',\r\n     component: StandardPage\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nThis would mean a post url would look like\r\n/2018/04/some-post\r\nand a page would look like\r\n/some-page\r\n\r\nThe regular expressions work but when you actually try to use them it would look like \r\n/2018%2F04%2Fsome-post\r\nfor the post route, page route would look fine since it does not have a / normally\r\n\r\nI see this is an option in path-to-regex but the option is not forwarded to vue-router. This means that if a path would have a / it would be urlencoded by path-to-regex and makes it seemingly impossible to get around (at least I have not found a way around it).\r\n\r\nThis would have additional benefits of, for instance being able to not urlencode but instead change / with _ or even encode it to base64 or something.\r\n\r\n### What does the proposed API look like?\r\nIt would just be passing the second parameter of path to regexp's compile function to the route.\r\n```\r\n{\r\n     name: 'post',\r\n     path: '/:permalink([0-9] [/][0-9] [/][\\\\S] )',\r\n     compile: {\r\n         encode: (value, token) => value\r\n     },\r\n     component: StandardArticle\r\n},\r\n```\r\nhttps://github.com/pillarjs/path-to-regexp#compile-reverse-path-to-regexp\r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/vuejs/vue-router/blob/dev/src/util/params.js\r\non line 20 is where it would need to be passed in some way, `{ pretty: true }` is where the encoding can be changed.\r\n\r\n<!-- generated by vue-issues.

In the actions below, I use the library `axios` to make http request, and I return it as a promise:\r\n\r\n```ts\r\n    const actions = {    \r\n      getCurrentSession(context: Context) {\r\n        return axios.get(\"http://localhost:3000/sessions/current\")\r\n          .then((res) => {\r\n            commitSharedFiles(context, res.data.shared_files);\r\n          })\r\n          .catch((e: string) => {\r\n            console.error(e);\r\n          });\r\n      }\r\n    };\r\n    \r\n    // export action\r\n    export const dispatchGetSharedFiles = dispatch(actions.getCurrentSession);\r\n\r\n    // commit\r\n    export const commitSharedFiles = commit(mutations.setSharedFileList);\r\n    \r\n    // mutations to the state tree\r\n    const mutations = {\r\n      setSharedFileList(state: State, sharedFiles: StoreState.DirFile[]) {\r\n        state.sharedFileList = sharedFiles;\r\n      }\r\n    };\r\n```\r\nBecause of the asynchronous nature of the actions, I have to resolve the promise before retrieving the fetched list of files from the store/state tree:\r\n```ts\r\n    // this is called in the mounted() life cycle method:\r\n    Store.dispatchGetSharedFiles(this.$store).then(res => {\r\n                this.sharedFiles = Store.readSharedFilesList(this.$store);\r\n    });\r\n```\r\nThis works, but I think it is very convoluted to resolve the promise and then get the data.

It would be helpful to have such method as a part of action context object (also, a namespaced version would be very good to have) because more often than not such dynamic activity is strongly tied to API querying (otherwise, why would one not register modules in before?).\r\n\r\nMy end user experience which led to this proposal is trying to build a page, which would show multiple collections of items filtered by various conditions (an app marketplace, to be exact). These collections are acquired from the backend via GraphQL and are tied to a 3rd party API which cannot be accessed directly from the frontend.\r\n\r\nRight now I'm doing this via `beforeMount` hook of the root presentation component:\r\n```\r\n// Presentation component\r\n      this.$store.dispatch('selections/fetchLanding', this.$store.registerModule.bind(this.$store))\r\n}\r\n\r\n// Store module\r\nactions: {\r\n  fetchLanding ({commit, state}, registerModule) {\r\n    queryCollections.bind(self)(state.filter)\r\n      .then((result) => {\r\n        for (let key in result.collections) {\r\n          if (typeof state.collections[key] === 'undefined') {\r\n            registerModule(['collections', key], (new CollectionModule(self.client)).createModule())\r\n          }\r\n        }\r\n        commit('SET_COLLECTIONS', result.collections)\r\n      })\r\n  }\r\n},\r\n```\r\n\r\nBut passing the bound registerModule method in payload looks ugly.\r\n\r\n### What does the proposed API look like?\r\nI've cleaned up the example to keep it precise to the task:\r\n\r\n```\r\n// Store module\r\nnamespaced: true,\r\nactions: {\r\n  fetchSomething ({commit, state, registerModule}) {\r\n    querySomeAPI()\r\n      .then((result) => {\r\n        registerModule(namespacedKey, new ModuleInstance())\r\n      })\r\n  }\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\n<!-- generated by vue-issues.
