I check the `this.User` that was passed from the Controller. \r\n\r\nI also check the current context in `_context` - a Singleton you can see in the `Startup.cs`.\r\n\r\nThere is also the `_caller` which is from this line in `Startup.cs`\r\n\r\n    services.AddTransient<ClaimsPrincipal>(s => s.GetService<IHttpContextAccessor>().HttpContext.User);\r\n\r\nWhen I inspect any of those variables, the `Claims` object **does not** contain the same claims as the JWT that was sent during the request. \r\n\r\n**I have verified the claims do not match by checking the claims at [jwt.io][1].**\r\n\r\nTo be specific, I'll give a scenario:\r\n\r\nI sign into my app with email `user@example.com`. That email is then set as a claim (Sub) as `user.UserName` inside the `CreateUserClaims()` function in the `AuthController.cs`:\r\n\r\n    var newClaims = new[]\r\n\t\t\t{\r\n\t\t\t\tnew Claim(JwtRegisteredClaimNames.Sub, user.UserName),\r\n\t\t\t\tnew Claim(JwtRegisteredClaimNames.Jti, Guid.NewGuid().ToString()),\r\n\t\t\t\tnew Claim(JwtRegisteredClaimNames.NameId, user.Id)\r\n\t\t\t}.Union(userClaims).ToList();\r\n\r\nThen some other properties are set and eventually the token is returned to the client. The client stores it in `localStorage`.\r\n\r\nThe client then makes a request, including the JWT in the header and adds it to the request options like this (Angular service):\r\n\r\n    private headers = new Headers(\r\n\t\t{\r\n\t\t\t'Content-Type': 'application/json',\r\n\t\t\t'Authorization': 'Bearer ' + this.authService.token\r\n\t\t});\r\n\tprivate options = new RequestOptions({ headers: this.headers });\r\n\r\nI check the Header in the Network tab and it contains the JWT - I check it on [jwt.io][1] and it looks good - has the proper email and other claims.\r\n\r\nNow I can logout of the app, sign in as a different user, get a new JWT, and make the request to that **same controller** shown above and the JWT will have the previous email, not the new one that I just signed in as. \r\n\r\nAnd I did go through the same checks, checking the JWT in the Header on the Network tab to ensure the claims contain the new email as the `sub` as well as the other claims. \r\n\r\nSo that means I was issued the proper JWT on the new sign in, but somehow the API is still looking at the old JWT.\r\n\r\nHow crazy is that?\r\n\r\nSomething else I have noticed is that even on that first login (pretend I just started the API with `dotnet run` and then I make my first request to the same controller shown above it will be missing the `nameid` claim. I can go check the JWT that was sent in the Header request and it **does have the `nameid` claim.** So, again, **the api will issue the proper JWT but when I send it back over HTTP in a request the API does not have the same JWT that I sent in the request.**\r\n\r\n**ONE MORE THING**\r\nI log the JWT in the console for simplicity. I went back and found the first one I started using today, at 9am. Its `jti` is the same as the one that is currently in the .net core API. It's now 4:45pm. I have 9 different JTWs in my console between those two times (9am and 4:45pm), all issued from the API. But the API seems to have kept the first one it created this morning - even after I have stopped and started the project numerous times.\r\n\r\n\r\nPlease help me understand what I am doing wrong. I must not be fully understanding how JWTs are handled.\r\n\r\n\r\n  [1]: http://jwt.io"},{"Id":"6785561681","Type":"IssuesEvent","CreatedAt":"2017-10-30T18:44:03","Actor":"HaoK","Repository":"aspnet/Identity","Organization":"aspnet","RawContent":null,"RelatedAction":"closed","RelatedUrl":"https://github.com/aspnet/Identity/issues/1487","RelatedDescription":"Closed issue \"Changing required password length\" (#1487) at aspnet/Identity","RelatedBody":"\r\nI’m using the following code:\r\n\r\n`\r\nservices.AddIdentity<ApplicationUser, IdentityRole>(options =>\r\n{\r\n\t// Password settings\r\n\toptions.Password.RequiredLength = 8;\r\n\toptions.Password.RequireNonAlphanumeric = false;\r\n\toptions.Password.RequireUppercase = false;\r\n})\r\n.AddEntityFrameworkStores<ApplicationDbContext>()\r\n.AddDefaultTokenProviders();\r\n`\r\n\r\nWhen i go to register, and click a single letter for password, the validation scripts still warn me about the default required length, which is 6 characters, instead of the new one i set (8 characters).\r\nIf i submit the form, i get the correct warning from the server, for the 8 characters.\r\n"},{"Id":"6783962430","Type":"IssuesEvent","CreatedAt":"2017-10-30T13:56:42","Actor":"pushist1y","Repository":"aspnet/Identity","Organization":"aspnet","RawContent":null,"RelatedAction":"opened","RelatedUrl":"https://github.com/aspnet/Identity/issues/1490","RelatedDescription":"Opened issue \"IdentityConstants\" (#1490) at aspnet/Identity","RelatedBody":"Consider redeclaring `IdentityConstants` class properties as actual constants instead of static readonly fields. \r\n\r\nThese fields are used as authentication schema names.

I check the `this.User` that was passed from the Controller. \r\n\r\nI also check the current context in `_context` - a Singleton you can see in the `Startup.cs`.\r\n\r\nThere is also the `_caller` which is from this line in `Startup.cs`\r\n\r\n    services.AddTransient<ClaimsPrincipal>(s => s.GetService<IHttpContextAccessor>().HttpContext.User);\r\n\r\nWhen I inspect any of those variables, the `Claims` object **does not** contain the same claims as the JWT that was sent during the request. \r\n\r\n**I have verified the claims do not match by checking the claims at [jwt.io][1].**\r\n\r\nTo be specific, I'll give a scenario:\r\n\r\nI sign into my app with email `user@example.com`. That email is then set as a claim (Sub) as `user.UserName` inside the `CreateUserClaims()` function in the `AuthController.cs`:\r\n\r\n    var newClaims = new[]\r\n\t\t\t{\r\n\t\t\t\tnew Claim(JwtRegisteredClaimNames.Sub, user.UserName),\r\n\t\t\t\tnew Claim(JwtRegisteredClaimNames.Jti, Guid.NewGuid().ToString()),\r\n\t\t\t\tnew Claim(JwtRegisteredClaimNames.NameId, user.Id)\r\n\t\t\t}.Union(userClaims).ToList();\r\n\r\nThen some other properties are set and eventually the token is returned to the client. The client stores it in `localStorage`.\r\n\r\nThe client then makes a request, including the JWT in the header and adds it to the request options like this (Angular service):\r\n\r\n    private headers = new Headers(\r\n\t\t{\r\n\t\t\t'Content-Type': 'application/json',\r\n\t\t\t'Authorization': 'Bearer ' + this.authService.token\r\n\t\t});\r\n\tprivate options = new RequestOptions({ headers: this.headers });\r\n\r\nI check the Header in the Network tab and it contains the JWT - I check it on [jwt.io][1] and it looks good - has the proper email and other claims.\r\n\r\nNow I can logout of the app, sign in as a different user, get a new JWT, and make the request to that **same controller** shown above and the JWT will have the previous email, not the new one that I just signed in as. \r\n\r\nAnd I did go through the same checks, checking the JWT in the Header on the Network tab to ensure the claims contain the new email as the `sub` as well as the other claims. \r\n\r\nSo that means I was issued the proper JWT on the new sign in, but somehow the API is still looking at the old JWT.\r\n\r\nHow crazy is that?\r\n\r\nSomething else I have noticed is that even on that first login (pretend I just started the API with `dotnet run` and then I make my first request to the same controller shown above it will be missing the `nameid` claim. I can go check the JWT that was sent in the Header request and it **does have the `nameid` claim.** So, again, **the api will issue the proper JWT but when I send it back over HTTP in a request the API does not have the same JWT that I sent in the request.**\r\n\r\n**ONE MORE THING**\r\nI log the JWT in the console for simplicity. I went back and found the first one I started using today, at 9am. Its `jti` is the same as the one that is currently in the .net core API. It's now 4:45pm. I have 9 different JTWs in my console between those two times (9am and 4:45pm), all issued from the API. But the API seems to have kept the first one it created this morning - even after I have stopped and started the project numerous times.\r\n\r\n\r\nPlease help me understand what I am doing wrong. I must not be fully understanding how JWTs are handled.\r\n\r\n\r\n  [1]: http://jwt.io"}],"ResultType":"GitHubEvent"},"Kestrel":{"Events":[{"Id":"6803562069","Type":"IssuesEvent","CreatedAt":"2017-11-03T01:57:35","Actor":"suryagh","Repository":"aspnet/KestrelHttpServer","Organization":"aspnet","RawContent":null,"RelatedAction":"closed","RelatedUrl":"https://github.com/aspnet/KestrelHttpServer/issues/2146","RelatedDescription":"Closed issue \"Mac: The specified SDK version [2.1.0-preview1-007042] from global.json [...] not found\" (#2146) at aspnet/KestrelHttpServer","RelatedBody":"On my Mac, I had an older version .net sdk and KestrelHttpServer cloned and compiled few months back.\r\n\r\nScenario, \r\n1.

(Typically your Program class) If you don't have this method ```WebApplicationTestFixture<TStartup>``` won't be able to initialize your app in the same way it is done on a normal run. You can configure the WebHostBuilder yourself by overriding CreateWebHostBuilder on ```WebApplicationTestFixture<TStartup>```.\r\n\r\n### The test infrastructure needs to know the content root of the application under test\r\nTo set the content root for your app, ```WebApplicationTestFixture<TStartup>``` first locate your solution file ```(.sln)``` and then make a guess about where project might be. The Content Root of the application is defined by convention as ```<<SolutionFolder>>/<<ProjectAssemblyName>>```. For example, based on the folder structure defined below, the content root of the application is defined as ```c:\\work\\MyApp```. This is important because if not set correctly to the root folder of your application under test all views and static files will not be found.\r\n\r\n```\r\nc:/work/\r\n    MyApp.sln\r\n    MyApp/MyApp.csproj\r\n    MyApp.FunctionalTests/MyApp.FunctionalTests.csproj\r\n```\r\n\r\nThe process for determining the folder to use as the content root when running the tests is the following:\r\n* ```WebApplicationTestFixture<TStartup>``` starts on the bin folder of the test project, in the example above ```c:/work/MyApp.FunctionalTests/MyApp.FunctionalTests/bin/<<Configuration>>/<<Framework>>```\r\n* It navigates to the parent folder until it finds a ```.sln``` file.\r\n* It appends ```<<AssemblyName>>``` to the folder in which it found the ```.sln``` file and set that as the content root.\r\n\r\nIf you happen to be using a different convention for the layout of your projects, you can inherit from WebApplicationTestFixture and pass in the relative path from your solution to the application under test when calling the constructor. For example ```\"/src/MyApp\"```\r\n\r\n```csharp\r\npublic class MyAppTestFixture<TStartup> : WebApplicationTestFixture<TStartup> where TStartup : class\r\n{\r\n    public MyAppTestFixture(string solutionRelativePath)\r\n        : base(\"/src/MyApp\") { }\r\n}\r\n```"},{"Id":"6754805124","Type":"IssuesEvent","CreatedAt":"2017-10-23T21:16:00","Actor":"Eilon","Repository":"aspnet/Announcements","Organization":"aspnet","RawContent":null,"RelatedAction":"opened","RelatedUrl":"https://github.com/aspnet/Announcements/issues/274","RelatedDescription":"Opened issue \"ASP.NET/EF Core 2.0.3 patch pre-release test feed\" (#274) at aspnet/Announcements","RelatedBody":"Hi, we now have a public test feed that you can use to try out the ASP.NET/EF Core 2.0.3 patch!\r\n\r\nYou can test this pre-release patch by adding the following feed to your app's or machine's NuGet.config file:\r\n* `https://dotnet.myget.org/F/aspnet-2-0-2-october2017-patch-public/api/v3/index.json`\r\n   * ![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/202643/31913542-4757d2a0-b7fc-11e7-9bf7-7157bd18a6ca.png)\r\n   * (please ignore the *name* of the feed; it is incorrect 😦)\r\n\r\n## Update your project\r\n1.
