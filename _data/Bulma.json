Create a tiling layout (mine uses a 8-width and 4-width tile)\r\n2. Set the min-width (I'm using 1024px)\r\n3.

I'm not sure how else with Bulma one would create a min width that prevents the website from dynamically changing beyond a point.\r\n\r\nNOTE that the website does get a horizontal scroll bar (if you set `$body-overflow-x: scroll;`) and that other things don't change but the tiling seems to be relative to the viewport width and therefore continues to change.\r\n\r\n### Actual behavior\r\n\r\nRefer to step 3 of \"steps to reproduce\"\r\n\r\n### Sidenote\r\n\r\nHuge fan of Bulma, thank you so much for making this awesome framework, let me know if there is anything else you need me to explain about the issue and I will happily.\r\n","Url":"https://github.com/jgthms/bulma/issues/2528","RelatedDescription":"Open issue \"Min-width for tiling?\" (#2528)"},{"Id":"454714620","IsPullRequest":false,"CreatedAt":"2019-06-11T14:10:38","Actor":"georgfranz","Number":"2527","RawContent":null,"Title":"Responsive margin + paddings","State":"open","Body":"### Responsive margins + paddings\r\n\r\nI am sure that I am not the first one who needs a different margin and padding setting on tablet and on desktop devices etc.\r\n\r\nSo, it would be cool if you can do the following thing:\r\n\r\n`<section class=\"section is-marginless-vertical-mobile has-margin-vertical-tablet\"></section> `\r\n\r\nBy default, there are only these entries in the helper.sass:\r\n```\r\n.is-marginless\r\n  margin: 0 !important\r\n\r\n.is-paddingless\r\n  padding: 0 !important\r\n```\r\n\r\nI've extended this having such things like:\r\n\r\n```\r\nis-marginless-tablet\r\nis-paddingless-vertical\r\nhas-padding-horizontal\r\nhas-margin-vertical-desktop\r\n```\r\nIf you don't need all variations (there are a lot...), you can control this by two arrays.\r\n\r\nI attach the sass file and a sample output with all variations.\r\n\r\nIf this is also helpful for anybody else, I can do a pull request.\r\n\r\n[margin_sample.css.txt](https://github.com/jgthms/bulma/files/3276839/margin_sample.css.txt)\r\n\r\n[margin_responsive.sass.txt](https://github.com/jgthms/bulma/files/3276843/margin_responsive.sass.txt)\r\n\r\n\r\nBest wishes,\r\nGeorg.\r\n\r\n_PS: I luv Bulma!!!!_\r\n","Url":"https://github.com/jgthms/bulma/issues/2527","RelatedDescription":"Open issue \"Responsive margin + paddings\" (#2527)"},{"Id":"454253153","IsPullRequest":false,"CreatedAt":"2019-06-10T16:29:19","Actor":"ediopia","Number":"2526","RawContent":null,"Title":".has-dropdown background color makes a trouble in .hero ","State":"closed","Body":"<!-- PLEASE READ THE FOLLOWING INSTRUCTIONS -->\r\n\r\n<!-- Choose one of the following: -->\r\nThis is about **Bulma | the Docs**.\r\n\r\n<!-- Is it about Bulma or about the Docs? -->\r\n<!-- Is it a bug/feature/question or do you need help? -->\r\n<!-- If it's a bug, is it a browser bug? -->\r\n\r\n### Overview of the problem\r\n.has-dropdown background color makes a trouble in .hero \r\n<!-- UNCOMMENT THE APPROPRIATE LINES -->\r\n\r\n<!-- This is about the Bulma **CSS framework** -->\r\n<!-- This is about the Bulma **Docs** -->\r\n<!-- I'm using Bulma **version** [x.x.x] -->\r\n<!-- My **browser** is: -->\r\n<!-- This is a **Sass** issue: I'm using version [x.x.x] -->\r\n<!-- I am sure this issue is **not a duplicate**? -->\r\n\r\n### Description\r\n\r\n<!-- Description of the bug, enhancement, or question -->\r\n\r\n### Steps to Reproduce\r\n\r\n<!--\r\n1.
