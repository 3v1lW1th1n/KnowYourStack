Pack the packages with NuGet.exe to generate your needed packages. \r\n3. Launch VS2017 and start a new C#project (best to do .Net 4.6.1) per settings above.\r\n4. Inside the VS2017 properties, verify that you are using ProjectReferences as the default package management format\r\n5. Right click your new project and select Manage NuGet Package...\r\n6. Navigate/setup the ability to install your new packages but only install the Awesome package.\r\n7. Note that the content files from Awesome.Assets do not get installed or get pushed to the bin directory as you may expect.\r\n\r\nThe only way that these asset files get pushed to the directory is if you install the Awesome.Assets package. There is no way to force these files to be pushed and a consumer is going to have to know that they need to install the Awesome.Assets package or do more manual steps to include the files via their csproj.\r\n\r\nIs this as designed or am I missing something?

The v2 file system push is special because it already overwrites duplicates without an error, therefore if a user specifies it in that situation, I output a message that says we ignored it. Currently that repeats for every push (1, 10, or 100+) and the discussion is whether it should work that way or just show once. \r\n\r\nI think it's acceptable since it makes it makes it easier for the user to see their option did nothing, discourages using it for this scenario, should be a rarely used scenario (option is newly introduced), other things are similarly verbose. For a verbosity example: if I push 100 packages to a server that already exist, today I will see output repeated for all 100 of them: \"Pushing package xyz\", HTTP Put, HTTP Conflict, \"error: Response status code does not indicate success: 409 (Conflict).\"\r\n\r\nNuGet product used: NuGet.exe \r\n\r\n## Detailed repro steps so we can see the same problem\r\n\r\n1.
