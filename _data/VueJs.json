So it also works with deconstructing:\r\n\r\n``` vue\r\n<comp v-scope=\"{ msg }\">\r\n  {{ msg }}\r\n</comp>\r\n```\r\n\r\n### Why a New Directive\r\n\r\nI believe the team briefly discussed what I proposed in https://github.com/vuejs/vue/issues/7740#issuecomment-371309357 on Slack some time back, but I could no longer find the chat record. Here's the reasoning behind a new directive:\r\n\r\n- `slot-scope` was introduced as a special attribute instead of a directive (attributes that start with `v-` prefix) because `slot` is an attribute, and we wanted to keep slot-related attributes consistent. `slot` was in turn introduced as a non-directive attribute because we want the usage to mirror the actual slot usage in the Shadow DOM standard. We figured it would be best to avoid having our own parallel `v-slot` when there's something that is conceptually the same in the standard.\r\n\r\n- Originally, `slot-scope` was designed to be only usable on `<template>` elements that act as abstract containers. But that was verbose - so we introduced the ability to use it directly on a slot element without the wrapping `<template>`. However, this also makes it impossible to allow using `slot-scope` directly on the component itself, because it would lead to ambiguity as illustrated [here](https://github.com/vuejs/vue/issues/7740#issuecomment-370252860).\r\n\r\n- I thought about adding modifiers or special prefixes to `slot-scope` so that that we can use it on a component directly to indicate its slot content should be treated as the default scoped slot, but neither a modifier or a prefix like `$` seem to be the right fit. The modifier by design should only be applied to directives, while new special syntax for a single use case is inconsistent with the whole syntax design.\r\n\r\n- For a very long time we've shied away from adding more directives, part of it being template syntax is something we want to keep as stable as possible, part of it being that we want to keep core directives to a minimum and only do things that users cannot easily do in userland. However, in this case scoped slot usage is important enough, and I think a new directive can be justified for making its usage significantly less noisy.\r\n\r\n### Concerns\r\n\r\n- The expression accepted by `v-scope` is different from most other directives: it expects a temporary variable name (which can also be a deconstruction), but not without a precedence: it acts just like the alias part of `v-for`. So conceptually `v-scope` falls into the same camp with `v-for` as a structural directive that creates temporary variables for its inner scope.\r\n\r\n- This would break the users code if the user has a custom directive named `v-scope` and is used on a component.\r\n\r\n  - Since custom directives in v2 are primarily focused on direct DOM manipulations, it's relatively rare to see custom directives used on components, even more so for something that happens to be called `v-scope`, so the impact should be minimal.\r\n\r\n  - Even in the case of it actually happening, it is straightforward to deal with by simply renaming the custom directive.","Url":"https://github.com/vuejs/vue/issues/9180","RelatedDescription":"Open issue \"RFC: Simplify scoped slot usage\" (#9180)"},{"Id":"389397144","IsPullRequest":false,"CreatedAt":"2018-12-10T17:30:33","Actor":"minaseem","Number":"9179","RawContent":null,"Title":"Autocomplete email field's model is not populated properly when there are multiple forms in a single page","State":"closed","Body":"### Version\r\n2.5.2\r\n\r\n### Reproduction link\r\n[https://codesandbox.io/s/5xlrk8v80k](https://codesandbox.io/s/5xlrk8v80k)\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n### Steps to reproduce\r\nSteps to reproduce:\r\nGo to https://codesandbox.io/s/5xlrk8v80k\r\n1.

The value is at `pathMatch` property instead.\r\n\r\n---\r\nhttps://github.com/vuejs/vue-router/pull/1995/files (@posva) has done a change that changes from having `0` property on the `params` object to having `pathMatch`.\r\n\r\nI would argue that this is an API breaking change and should be done in a major version release. I would, but `params` object is not documented very well so it's hard to reason about. (see https://router.vuejs.org/api/#route-object-properties)\r\n\r\nAs the damage is done already, maybe you can use this bug to improve on documentation and state in documentation for `$route.params` where the matched part is exposed for routes that are using `*`.\r\n\r\n<!-- generated by vue-issues.

Often, I found it is annoying when I \"time-traveled\", there is a side-effect being performed due to the component life cycle or routing middleware try to do their \"regular\" task... this resulted in a polluted mutation records... Consider the fact that some component can be delayed rendered by `v-if=state` (so components may be mounted/unmounted during time-traveling), the same may also happen if the one uses `@vue/vuex-router-sync`, this feature is good to have.\r\n\r\n### What does the proposed API look like?\r\nWhen we click \"time travel to the state\" in the dev tool, Vuex internally have a mechanism to silent and ignore any dispatch or commit to be performed (or prevent state to be mutated during time-traveling).  This locking mechanism can be unlocked if we decide to either **revert** or **traverse** to the latest state (they are basically the same).

Overuse string when using `mapState`, `mapGetters`, `mapActions`\r\n2. Duplicated namespace in components\r\n\r\nlike this:\r\n_my-component.vue_ (AS-IS version)\r\n\r\n```js\r\nexport default {\r\n  computed: {\r\n    ...mapState(\"todos\", {\r\n      allItems: ({ items }) => items,\r\n    }),\r\n    ...mapGetters(\"todos\", {\r\n      doneItems: \"doneItems\",\r\n      activeItems: \"activeItems\",\r\n    }),\r\n  }\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nIn this code, `\"doneItmes\"` is written by string. It will cause bug easily.\r\nAnd there are duplicated namespace called `\"todos\"`. It will inhibit maintainabillity.\r\n\r\n### What does the proposed API look like?\r\nThe way to introduce it is not to suggest a new API, but to use the existing API properly.\r\nWe can use `createNamespacedHelpers` API with constants in store directory!\r\n\r\n### Example\r\n\r\n_@/store/todos/types.js_\r\n\r\n```js\r\nexport const NAMESPACE = \"todos\";\r\n```\r\n\r\n_@/store/todos/index.js_\r\n\r\n```js\r\nimport { createNamespacedHelpers } from\"vuex\";\r\nimport { NAMESPACE } from \"./types\";\r\n\r\n// Key point !\r\nconst { mapState, mapGetters, mapActions } = createNamespacedHelpers(NAMESPACE);\r\n\r\nexport { mapState, mapGetters, mapActions };\r\n\r\nexport default { /* namespaced, state, getters, mutations, actions */ }\r\n```\r\n\r\n_@/store/todos/getters.js_\r\n\r\n```js\r\n// Key point !\r\nexport const DONE_ITEMS = \"DONE_ITEMS\";\r\nexport const ACTIVE_ITEMS = \"ACTIVE_ITEMS\";\r\n\r\nexport default {\r\n  [DONE_ITEMS]: state => state.items.filter(todo => todo.isDone),\r\n  [ACTIVE_ITEMS]: state => state.items.filter(todo => !todo.isDone)\r\n};\r\n```\r\n\r\nIf we do this, we can use customized binding helpers.\r\n\r\n_my-component.vue_ (TO-BE version)\r\n\r\n```js\r\nimport * as todos from '@/store/todos'; // Key point !\r\nimport * as getters from '@/store/todos/getters'; // Key point !\r\nimport * as actions from '@/store/todos/types'; // Key point !\r\n\r\nexport default {\r\n  computed: {\r\n    ...todos.mapState({\r\n      allItems: ({ items }) => items,\r\n    }),\r\n    ...todos.mapGetters([\r\n      getters.DONE_ITEMS,\r\n      getters.ACTIVE_ITEMS,\r\n    ])\r\n  },\r\n  methods: {\r\n    ...todos.mapActions([\r\n      actions.ADD_ITEM,\r\n    ]),\r\n  }\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nHow about this? If you do not mind this, I would like to post it on the official Vuex document.\r\nYou can see the all example code in [this repository](https://github.com/JaeYeopHan/vuex-best-practice-lab)\r\n\r\nThanks!\r\n\r\n<!-- generated by vue-issues.
