I am a newbie of using ML.net to implement my classification problem. I already trained a model from CIFA 10 datasets based on Keras library and that model has been transferred to ONNX model. My goal is to display the image's prediction task on WindowForm, so I am going to use ML.net integrated with ONNX model, but right now I am getting stuck on how to use the ONNX model on ML.net and how to define the label and get the prediction result by the model. Do you have any suggestion to me? Thank you a lot in advance.\r\n### Source code / logs\r\n\r\nPlease paste or attach the code or logs or traces that would be helpful to diagnose the issue you are reporting.\r\n","Url":"https://github.com/dotnet/machinelearning/issues/3562","RelatedDescription":"Open issue \"Making a prediction from ONNX model in ML.net\" (#3562)"},{"Id":"436395145","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2019-04-23T23:27:47","Actor":"wschin","Number":"3551","RawContent":null,"Title":"Fix AP's output schema in its XML doc","State":"closed","Body":"Fix #3498 and fix #3496 by\r\n\r\n- Add a new I/O file for binary classifier without probability output\r\n- Reference that new file in AP's and LinearSVM's XML docs.\r\n","Url":"https://github.com/dotnet/machinelearning/pull/3551","RelatedDescription":"Closed or merged PR \"Fix AP's output schema in its XML doc\" (#3551)"},{"Id":"436416855","IsPullRequest":false,"CreatedAt":"2019-04-23T22:27:53","Actor":"artidoro","Number":"3556","RawContent":null,"Title":"FastTree and LightGbm base class is specific to Ranking","State":"open","Body":"The only training task that requires a `RowGroupColumn` is ranking.
