See vuetifyjs/vuetify#10163 for a real-world example of this.\r\n\r\nI tried to keep this PR concise and focused, but it's worth discussing potential side effects of this change. Ideally it would be scoped just to hydration to limit the surface area for side effects, but that wasn't as simple as limiting it to creation, so I opted for the simpler route for the PR.\r\n\r\nSome users may be relying on the current behavior (perhaps without realizing it), so this would break behavior for them. However, considering the current gotcha for otherwise sane looking code, it seems to be a reasonable trade-off to potentially break a tiny amount of code to remove a hard to debug issue which can lead to messed up markup.\r\n\r\nAn argument could be made that much as the DOM structure needing to match when hydrating, perhaps styles should also be required to match, which would avoid this issue. However, it seems like a tall order to ensure all styles are rendered identically between server and client since more style-oriented information is available on the client (screen size, device capabilities, etc). So, that seems like an overly burdensome requirement to put on developers for SSR. However, if that's preferred, this PR could be turned into issuing a warning on style-mismatch instead.","Url":"https://github.com/vuejs/vue/pull/10993","RelatedDescription":"Open PR \"fix: clear extra styles when hydrating/mounting element\" (#10993)"},{"Id":"547071282","IsPullRequest":false,"CreatedAt":"2020-01-08T20:17:03","Actor":"Slimeyyyy","Number":"10992","RawContent":null,"Title":"Vue in ASP.NET Core w/ webpack: Failed to mount component: template or render function not defined","State":"closed","Body":"### Version\r\n2.6.11\r\n\r\n### Reproduction link\r\n[https://github.com/Slimeyyyy/M306](https://github.com/Slimeyyyy/M306)\r\n\r\n### Steps to reproduce\r\n1.

This approach has a major limitations though: it is imperative and thus not compossible very well (when multiple state fields are used). One has to know manually which reactive sources `getAnswer` uses and then setup watchers for each of the reactive fields manually. If code of `getAnswer` changes to use more of the state, watchers have to be updated as well. If `getAnswer` is really complicated (which is the main purpose of debouncing, a complicated and expensive function), calling potentially into other functions, it is not always clear what all state it is using.\r\n\r\n### What does the proposed API look like?\r\nIdeally, debouncing throttling of expensive computed fields would be integrated with Vue reactivity enginge. Such computed property would:\r\n* Run the computation once, detect which reactive dependencies the computation uses.\r\n* When dependencies change, instead of scheduling computation to be re-run immediately, it would be queued with additional metadata: the timestamp only after which it should be run from the queue. For debouncing, new dependency changes would push further down the queue existing re-run entry (while keeping the timestamp in the future). For throttling, logic would just have to prevent re-adding an existing entry to the queue (I think this is already the case, so it would work out; we would just have to not run the entry before the timeout).\r\n* So current queue processing would just have to be changed so that entries which timeouts in the future are skipped when going over the queue. Leaving them for future queue processing to process them. In a way we would make the queue not be just a FIFO queue.\r\n\r\nHow we expose this to the developers, not sure, maybe we could expand on the [getter/setter syntax of the computed fields](https://vuejs.org/v2/guide/computed.html#Computed-Setter), and add also some fields for debounce/throttling options.\r\n\r\n<!-- generated by vue-issues.

First contributor + pretty new to Vue 👋 😄 \r\n\r\nThis PR adds `aria-current=\"page\"` to active links, and resolves #2116. I made the following two choices:\r\n\r\n1. Use `aria-current=\"page\"` over other token values\r\nThe original issue mentions allowing custom token values, or future `<router-link>` extension possibilities. That still seems useful, but `aria-current=\"page\"` seems like the right choice at least 90% of the time. The other tokens are either much less common (e.g. `step`) or unlikely to be used with a router at all (e.g. `date`)\r\n\r\n2. Use the `activeClass` logic over only applying it to the exact active route\r\nThis is more hand-wavy, but seems like the better choice -- URL params shouldn't necessarily affect `aria-current`, and it's not the worst thing to have parent routes also receive `aria-current` if `exact` is not applied.\r\n\r\nI'm hoping this is a small enough change that it can go in before the harder work of figuring out how to extend `<router-link>` is done, and it seems like a sensible default even with customization. I've run into some issues using vue-router b/c of this, so I'd personally love to see `aria-current` added :). I'm happy to answer any questions on the accessibility side, and let me know if I missed anything PR-wise.

But `beforeRouteEnter` can not modify existing state (or even access it). \r\n\r\n\r\n### What is expected?\r\nSince the component is reused, I would expect `beforeRouteUpdate` to be fired.\r\n\r\nIn my situation, if my query param changes, I need to fetch new data from the backend and store them in local state. As of now, there is no easy way to detect that my param changes.\r\n\r\nI would need to add a watcher on $route, but that watcher will run in every other child component since my component is not destroyed. \r\n\r\n### What is actually happening?\r\n`beforeRouteEnter` is fired\r\n\r\n---\r\nWith this situation, if I keep using `keep-alive` , it makes it pretty hard to detect when my page is openend again. \r\nSince my watchers would still run even when I am visiting other child-pages, there is a lot of overhead of introducing a $route watcher that performs some action when my query params change. In addition, I would need to make sure that the action only triggers when I am actually seeing this sub-page (requiring my component to be aware of its route, which feels wrong). \r\n\r\nI think that in cases with existing components, Vue Router should fire `beforeRouteUpdate` even when the route changes. \r\nI do understand though that technically the route is changing so it makes sense to call beforeRouteEnter instead of Update. \r\nBut then, it would help if the second beforeRouteEnter, that is called when then component already exists, has access to `this`.\r\n\r\n<!-- generated by vue-issues.
