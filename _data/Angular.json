The base class has a constructor with an injected service. (`Injector` from the example)\r\n\r\n```ts\r\n@Injectable()\r\nexport class BaseService {\r\n  // \"Injector\" is just for the sake of example.

(_dont ask me how I have found this, but:_) In `angular.json` `[lib name].test.options.codeCoverage` should be true. \r\n\r\n### PROBLEM:   \r\n\r\n`injector` is undefined in the instance of `MyLibService`. \r\n\r\n--- \r\n\r\nüö© Removing property from the child class _(2)_ AND/OR opting out `codeCoverage` config in angular.json _(3)_ doesn't brake test.\r\n\r\nAs a result, I can't have a class inheritance and code coverage at the same time.\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\nI could put a constructor in the child class and call `super` by passing all required arguments manually, but it's the last option since the real-life scenario is much more complicated than the example provided here.\r\n\r\n## üî¨ Minimal Reproduction\r\ngit repo: https://github.com/ddramone/ng-8-library-inheritance-di-test-bug\r\n\r\nreproduce steps:\r\n\r\n1.

This has highlighted that this class is tightly coupled to process.cwd and that this should instead be passed as an argument.\r\n\r\n**More details**\r\n \r\nClass NodeModulesEngineHost. Whilst methods _resolvePackageJson, _resolvePath accept a path to be provided, _resolveCollectionPath uses process.cwd() when calling them. This means that this class will always use the processes current working directory to identify schematics.\r\n\r\nInstead, in my opinion, the class that creates the NodeModulesEngineHost should provide the baseDir. i.e. add (private path: string) to the constructor and then update the cli implementations to pass the path.\r\n\r\n\r\n","Url":"https://github.com/angular/angular-cli/issues/14935","RelatedDescription":"Open issue \"NodeModuleEngineHost tightly coupled to process working directory\" (#14935)"},{"Id":"461942044","IsPullRequest":false,"CreatedAt":"2019-06-28T09:23:13","Actor":"hugodes","Number":"14933","RawContent":null,"Title":"Bazel opt in : ng add @angular/bazel fails","State":"open","Body":"<!--üîÖüîÖüîÖüîÖüîÖüîÖüîÖüîÖüîÖüîÖüîÖüîÖüîÖüîÖüîÖüîÖüîÖüîÖüîÖüîÖüîÖüîÖüîÖüîÖüîÖüîÖüîÖüîÖüîÖüîÖüîÖ\r\n\r\nOh hi there! üòÑ\r\n\r\nTo expedite issue processing please search open and closed issues before submitting a new one.\r\nExisting issues often contain information about workarounds, resolution, or progress updates.\r\n\r\nüîÖüîÖüîÖüîÖüîÖüîÖüîÖüîÖüîÖüîÖüîÖüîÖüîÖüîÖüîÖüîÖüîÖüîÖüîÖüîÖüîÖüîÖüîÖüîÖüîÖüîÖüîÖüîÖüîÖüîÖüîÖüîÖüîÖ-->\r\n\r\n\r\n# üêû Bug report\r\n\r\n### Command (mark with an `x`)\r\n<!-- Can you pin-point the command or commands that are effected by this bug? -->\r\n<!-- ‚úçÔ∏èedit: -->\r\n```\r\n- [ ] new\r\n- [ ] build\r\n- [ ] serve\r\n- [ ] test\r\n- [ ] e2e\r\n- [ ] generate\r\n- [ x ] add\r\n- [ ] update\r\n- [ ] lint\r\n- [ ] xi18n\r\n- [ ] run\r\n- [ ] config\r\n- [ ] help\r\n- [ ] version\r\n- [ ] doc\r\n```\r\n\r\n### Description\r\n\r\nI followed the steps [here](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1CZsABQJDjpBLun5Ewk3lNUTAHX2Y-pUb3-dfLMZ22DE/preview?slide=id.g568f4cb48a_1_7) for using Bazel in out existing application and got this error:\r\n\r\n<pre><code>\r\n$ ng add @angular/bazel\r\nUnable to find compatible package.

And legacy browsers like IE11 don't have it. So, its polyfill is necessary.\r\n\r\nCLI v7 used core-js v2 and its `core-js/es6/symbol` contains `Symbol.iterator` support.\r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/angular/angular-cli/blob/7.3.x/packages/angular_devkit/build_angular/src/angular-cli-files/models/es2015-polyfills.js\r\n\r\nSince core-js v3, `Symbol.iterator` has been seperated from `Symbol` itself.\r\n\r\n- https://github.com/zloirock/core-js/blob/v3.1.4/packages/core-js/modules/es.symbol.js\r\n- https://github.com/zloirock/core-js/blob/v3.1.4/packages/core-js/modules/es.symbol.iterator.js\r\n\r\nBecause of that, to support IE11 Angular CLI should include `es.symbol.iterator.js` in `es5-polyfills`. But now CLI lacks it. \r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/angular/angular-cli/blob/master/packages/angular_devkit/build_angular/src/angular-cli-files/models/es5-polyfills.js#L10\r\n\r\n\r\n## üî¨ Minimal Reproduction\r\n<!--\r\nSimple steps to reproduce this bug.\r\n\r\nPlease include: commands run (including args), packages added, related code changes.\r\n\r\nIf reproduction steps are not enough for reproduction of your issue, please create a minimal GitHub repository with the reproduction of the issue. \r\nA good way to make a minimal reproduction is to create a new app via `ng new repro-app` and add the minimum possible code to show the problem. \r\nShare the link to the repo below along with step-by-step instructions to reproduce the problem, as well as expected and actual behavior.\r\n\r\nIssues that don't have enough info and can't be reproduced will be closed.\r\n\r\nYou can read more about issue submission guidelines here: https://github.com/angular/angular-cli/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md#-submitting-an-issue\r\n-->\r\n\r\n## üî• Exception or Error\r\n<pre><code>\r\n<!-- If the issue is accompanied by an exception or an error, please share it below: -->\r\n<!-- ‚úçÔ∏è-->\r\n\r\n</code></pre>\r\n\r\nNo errors but `HttpClient.get(..., { headers })` doesn't send headers to server.\r\n\r\n## üåç Your Environment\r\n<pre><code>\r\n<!-- run `ng version` and paste output below -->\r\n<!-- ‚úçÔ∏è-->\r\n\r\n</code></pre>\r\n\r\n**Anything else relevant?**\r\n<!-- ‚úçÔ∏èIs this a browser specific issue?

The fact that there's that pretty animation scrolling on the bottom forces the display to update at 60hz, which, through the power of the magnificent DWM that can't handle this in 2019, forces the main display at 60hz and with massive stutters. Switching to a different tab in the browser fixes this.\r\n```\r\n```\r\nthis is gonna sound weird, but when i had the tab with the site open just now on my secondary monitor and waiting for a trade to pop, it really killed the performance of my game client. like it was forcing a vsync ingame or something, very noticeably choppy. it could be just a one off thing i dont know, just bringing it up in case anyone else gets that and can confirm/deny. my primary monitor is 144hz, secondary is 60hz.\r\ni could just need a pc restart. my pc acts weird sometimes when i wake it from sleep and just go about doing my normal stuff\r\n```\r\n\r\n#### Environment\r\n\r\n- Angular: 8.0.0\r\n- CDK/Material: 8.0.0\r\n- Browser(s): Google Chrome\r\n- Operating System (e.g. Windows, macOS, Ubuntu): Windows 10\r\n","Url":"https://github.com/angular/components/issues/16389","RelatedDescription":"Open issue \"Performance degradation when using an animated progress bar with multiple monitors\" (#16389)"},{"Id":"460739515","IsPullRequest":false,"CreatedAt":"2019-06-26T03:19:03","Actor":"Crazyang","Number":"16388","RawContent":null,"Title":"About expend panel animation ","State":"open","Body":"#### Feature Description\r\n\r\n\r\nCould you give me an interface to set animation time\r\n\r\n#### Use Case\r\n\r\nSome time I need animation go fast or slow\r\n","Url":"https://github.com/angular/components/issues/16388","RelatedDescription":"Open issue \"About expend panel animation \" (#16388)"},{"Id":"460677136","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2019-06-25T22:38:41","Actor":"jelbourn","Number":"16386","RawContent":null,"Title":"chore: fix new typescript errors with 3.5","State":"open","Body":"Google's TypeScript team is flushing out errors for 3.5.
