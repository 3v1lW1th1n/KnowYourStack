That means the convenience is unavailable for computed properties that rely on Vuex state and methods that dispatch Vuex actions, which is a big limitation.\r\n\r\n- It requires tight coupling of components to Vuex modules, which I've found doesn't scale well to large apps. Instead, I've found it very useful to _never_ use the `mapXXX` helpers directly in my components, but in a [state helpers file](https://github.com/chrisvfritz/vue-enterprise-boilerplate/blob/master/src/state/helpers.js), which describes the public interfaces for all Vuex modules. From this file, I'll import the concerns I care about into individual components. For example:\r\n  ```js\r\n  import {\r\n    authComputed,\r\n    notificationsComputed,\r\n    notificationsMethods,\r\n    searchMethods,\r\n  } from '@state/helpers'\r\n\r\n  // ...\r\n\r\n  computed: {\r\n    ...authComputed,\r\n    ...notificationsComputed,\r\n  },\r\n  methods: {\r\n    ...notificationsMethods,\r\n    ...searchMethods,\r\n  },\r\n  ```\r\n  This prevents verbose and duplicated `mapXXX` code in components, replaced by a nice list of the global concerns this component cares about. But the benefit _really_ comes in when adding new state/getters/actions or when refactoring a Vuex module. For example, if I add a new `userLoggedIn` getter to `authComputed`, it will automatically be available in any component using `authComputed`. Or, if I rename some state or split it out into additional modules, the state helpers file allows the refactor to be done in two steps: first on the Vuex side, while updating the state helpers for compatibility, _then_ in my components (if I actually want the public interface to change as well).\r\n\r\nFor these reasons, I feel like the `mapXXX` helpers should stay and the scoped slot pattern should actually be avoided. What are others' thoughts? Is there something I've missed?","Url":"https://github.com/vuejs/vuex/issues/1417","RelatedDescription":"Open issue \"Discussion on removing mapXXX helpers in Vuex 4\" (#1417)"},{"Id":"367476734","IsPullRequest":false,"CreatedAt":"2018-10-07T19:43:38","Actor":"syntacticsolutions","Number":"1416","RawContent":null,"Title":"Support for IndexedDB","State":"closed","Body":"### What problem does this feature solve?\r\nIt should (in theory) make dealing with Big Data Web Visualizations easier and more performant.\r\n\r\nI'm using echarts to render big data vizualizations at the company I work for.

The app pretty much becomes unresponsive and so now the only alternative I have is to do all of the aggregation on the backend and then return the response.\r\n\r\n### What does the proposed API look like?\r\nI would imagine that the vuex instance would send messages back and forth between the serviceworker and itself. The mutations could then be passed as arguments to the serviceworker. The serviceworker would perform the operation and return the aggregated data. If the user does not have third-party-cookies enabled. It would just fall back to the normal Vuex instance.\r\n\r\n<!-- generated by vue-issues.
