Making synchronous requests like `source-map-support` does will create a deadlock and halt execution indefinitely.\r\n\r\n## 🌍 Your Environment\r\n\r\n```\r\n$ ng --version\r\n\r\n     _                      _                 ____ _     ___\r\n    / \\   _ __   __ _ _   _| | __ _ _ __     / ___| |   |_ _|\r\n   / △ \\ | '_ \\ / _` | | | | |/ _` | '__|   | |   | |    | |\r\n  / ___ \\| | | | (_| | |_| | | (_| | |      | |___| |___ | |\r\n /_/   \\_\\_| |_|\\__, |\\__,_|_|\\__,_|_|       \\____|_____|___|\r\n                |___/\r\n    \r\n\r\nAngular CLI: 7.3.0\r\nNode: 11.8.0\r\nOS: linux x64\r\nAngular: 7.2.3\r\n... animations, common, compiler, compiler-cli, core, forms\r\n... language-service, platform-browser, platform-browser-dynamic\r\n... router\r\n\r\nPackage                           Version\r\n-----------------------------------------------------------\r\n@angular-devkit/architect         0.13.0\r\n@angular-devkit/build-angular     0.13.0\r\n@angular-devkit/build-optimizer   0.13.0\r\n@angular-devkit/build-webpack     0.13.0\r\n@angular-devkit/core              7.3.0\r\n@angular-devkit/schematics        7.3.0\r\n@angular/cli                      7.3.0\r\n@ngtools/webpack                  7.3.0\r\n@schematics/angular               7.3.0\r\n@schematics/update                0.13.0\r\nrxjs                              6.3.3\r\ntypescript                        3.2.4\r\nwebpack                           4.29.0\r\n`` ","Url":"https://github.com/angular/angular-cli/issues/13580","RelatedDescription":"Closed issue \"Inability to avoid including `source-map-support` in Karma tests\" (#13580)"},{"Id":"406017872","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2019-02-06T05:15:37","Actor":"renovate-bot","Number":"13583","RawContent":null,"Title":"build: update ajv to version 6.8.1","State":"closed","Body":"This PR contains the following updates:\n\n| Package | Type | Update | Change | References |\n|---|---|---|---|---|\n| ajv | dependencies | minor | `6.7.0` -> `6.8.1` | [source](https://togithub.com/epoberezkin/ajv) |\n| ajv | devDependencies | minor | `6.7.0` -> `6.8.1` | [source](https://togithub.com/epoberezkin/ajv) |\n\n---\n\n### Release Notes\n\n<details>\n<summary>epoberezkin/ajv</summary>\n\n### [`v6.8.1`](https://togithub.com/epoberezkin/ajv/compare/v6.8.0...v6.8.1)\n\n[Compare Source](https://togithub.com/epoberezkin/ajv/compare/v6.8.0...v6.8.1)\n\n### [`v6.8.0`](https://togithub.com/epoberezkin/ajv/releases/v6.8.0)\n\n[Compare Source](https://togithub.com/epoberezkin/ajv/compare/v6.7.0...v6.8.0)\n\nDocs: [security considerations](https://togithub.com/epoberezkin/ajv#security-considerations).\n[Meta-schema](https://togithub.com/epoberezkin/ajv/blob/master/lib/refs/json-schema-secure.json) for the security assessment of JSON Schemas.\n\n</details>\n\n---\n\n### Renovate configuration\n\n:date: **Schedule**: \"after 10pm every weekday,before 4am every weekday,every weekend\" in timezone America/Tijuana.\n\n:vertical_traffic_light: **Automerge**: Disabled by config.

Description\r\nIt would be a great feature to have the possibility to add the newly generated component|class|service|... to a barrel file when using the ng generate <c|s|class|...>.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Describe the solution you'd like\r\nThe barrel exportation could be an option that is defaulted to false. The exportation would be in the module of the generated item if any index.ts file is present:\r\n#### Examples\r\n##### The folder diagram\r\n```\r\n\r\no\r\n| --core\r\n|   | --core.module.ts\r\n|   | --index.ts  // core module's barrel\r\n|   | --services\r\n|   `-- models\r\n|-- pages\r\n|   |-- pages.module.ts\r\n|   |-- index.ts // pages module's barrel\r\n|   |-- dashboard\r\n|   |   |-- dashboard.module.ts\r\n|   |   `-- index.ts  // dashboard module's barrel. \r\n|    | `-- about\r\n|       |-- about.module.ts // This module doesn't have any barrel\r\n|       `-- about // about component folder is exported in index.ts of about module's barrel\r\n    `-- shared // more folder for style\r\n```\r\n\r\n##### Generating a module with barrels enabled\r\n```\r\nng g m pages/about\r\n```\r\nGenerate a module without any barrels in it. If the user had specified `-b` an `index.ts` file would have been created.\r\n\r\n\r\n##### Generating a new service with the shorthand syntax\r\n```\r\nng generate service core/services/myService -b\r\n```\r\nThis generate a new service named MyService and it is exported in the \"closest\" relative module. That means that the `index.ts` is in the core folder\r\n\r\n\r\n##### Generating a new component with the long syntax\r\n```\r\nng generate component pages/dashboard/dash --barrel\r\n```\r\nThis generate a new component named DashComponent in the \"closest\" relative module. That means that the `index.ts` is in the dashboard folder.\r\n\r\n##### Generating a new component that has no barrel \r\n```\r\nng generate component /pages/about/me -b\r\n```\r\nThis still generate the component, but does not add anything to any barrel because the module it belongs to doesn't have one\r\n\r\n##### Generating a new component that has no barrel \r\n```\r\nng generate component /pages/about/me -b=pages\r\n```\r\nThis generate a new component named MeComponent in specified module. That means that the `index.ts` is in the pages folder.\r\n\r\n### Describe alternatives you've considered\r\nThere is currently a library doing this: https://www.npmjs.com/package/barrelsby, but we have to run a separate command everytime we create a new item, a lot of configuration is needed as well and there is a devDependency.\r\n","Url":"https://github.com/angular/angular-cli/issues/13590","RelatedDescription":"Closed issue \"Barrel generation options\" (#13590)"},{"Id":"406308086","IsPullRequest":false,"CreatedAt":"2019-02-04T12:30:35","Actor":"V3nsla","Number":"13588","RawContent":null,"Title":"Html changes not detected in watched library by \"ng serve --aot\"","State":"open","Body":"<!--🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅\r\n\r\nOh hi there! 😄\r\n\r\nTo expedite issue processing please search open and closed issues before submitting a new one.\r\nExisting issues often contain information about workarounds, resolution, or progress updates.\r\n\r\n🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅-->\r\n\r\n\r\n# 🐞 Bug report\r\n\r\n### Command\r\n<!-- Can you pin-point the command or commands that are effected by this bug? -->\r\n<!-- ✍️edit: -->\r\n```\r\n- [ ] new\r\n- [ ] build\r\n- [X] serve\r\n- [ ] test\r\n- [ ] e2e\r\n- [ ] generate\r\n- [ ] add\r\n- [ ] update\r\n- [ ] lint\r\n- [ ] xi18n\r\n- [ ] run\r\n- [ ] config\r\n- [ ] help\r\n- [ ] version\r\n- [ ] doc\r\n```\r\n\r\n\r\n### Description\r\n\r\nHtml changes are not detected in library when starting project using ng serve --aot. Library is built using --watch flag and main project is served with --aot. On html change build and serve process are triggered and page refreshes but with no changes in html. Typescript changes are visible  after rebuild. Html change is only visible when you restart ng serve --aot process. \r\n\r\nWithout --aot flag everything is working as intended. \r\n\r\nSame problem exists with npm linked external library (not in the same project).\r\n\r\n## 🔬 Minimal Reproduction\r\n\r\nI made a small repro of the problem: https://github.com/V3nsla/aot-lib-html-changes\r\n\r\nTo reproduce the problem build library using --watch flag (ng build lib --watch) and start main project using ng serve --aot. \r\n\r\nMake some changes in the template of LibComponent and save to trigger build process. After main project is recompiled html changes are not reflected. \r\n\r\n## 🌍 Your Environment\r\n<pre><code>\r\nAngular CLI: 7.3.0\r\nNode: 10.12.0\r\nOS: win32 x64\r\nAngular: 7.2.3\r\n... animations, common, compiler, compiler-cli, core, forms\r\n... language-service, platform-browser, platform-browser-dynamic\r\n... router\r\n\r\nPackage                            Version\r\n------------------------------------------------------------\r\n@angular-devkit/architect          0.13.0\r\n@angular-devkit/build-angular      0.13.0\r\n@angular-devkit/build-ng-packagr   0.13.0\r\n@angular-devkit/build-optimizer    0.13.0\r\n@angular-devkit/build-webpack      0.13.0\r\n@angular-devkit/core               7.3.0\r\n@angular-devkit/schematics         7.3.0\r\n@angular/cli                       7.3.0\r\n@ngtools/json-schema               1.1.0\r\n@ngtools/webpack                   7.3.0\r\n@schematics/angular                7.3.0\r\n@schematics/update                 0.13.0\r\nng-packagr                         4.7.0\r\nrxjs                               6.3.3\r\ntypescript                         3.2.4\r\nwebpack                            4.29.0\r\n</code></pre>\r\n","Url":"https://github.com/angular/angular-cli/issues/13588","RelatedDescription":"Open issue \"Html changes not detected in watched library by \"ng serve --aot\"\" (#13588)"},{"Id":"406241475","IsPullRequest":false,"CreatedAt":"2019-02-04T09:29:22","Actor":"hussyd","Number":"13587","RawContent":null,"Title":"Angular CLI 7.3.0 generated angular.json contains src/styles.sass entry instead of .scss extension","State":"closed","Body":"<!--🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅\r\n\r\nOh hi there!

After searching forums, blogs for hours I realized that setting text color is actually not an option although some people have found very hacky workarounds to address this(basically overriding the services in theming.scss) which kinda defeats the purpose.\r\n\r\n#### Is there anything else we should know?\r\nI do appreciate all the work that has been done to facilitate things for both development and design teams but the thing is I can't tell my designers go ahead and mock up the app screens with this plugin but keep in mind the implementation is going to be only 80 percent like your mock-ups.","Url":"https://github.com/angular/material2/issues/15074","RelatedDescription":"Open issue \"Sketch Theme Editor\" (#15074)"},{"Id":"406256699","IsPullRequest":false,"CreatedAt":"2019-02-04T10:08:10","Actor":"madmurl0c","Number":"15071","RawContent":null,"Title":"MatTabNav unexpected bahavior","State":"open","Body":"#### What is the expected behavior?\r\nI expect the MatTabNavBar element to show the scroll indicators on the left/right side once it becomes too wide for the current view as the normal MatTabGroup does\r\n\r\n#### What is the current behavior?\r\nThe labels are getting pushed together until they disappear\r\n\r\n#### What are the steps to reproduce?\r\nI modified the original tab example to show what I mean, just resize it and see how it reacts.\r\n\r\nhttps://stackblitz.com/edit/angular-n3nlp2\r\n\r\n#### Which versions of Angular, Material, OS, TypeScript, browsers are affected?\r\nAngular: 7.2.3\r\nMaterial: 7.3.0\r\nTypescript: 3.2.4\r\n\r\nDebian (testing):\r\nChromium: 71.0.3578.98\r\nFirefox: 65.0\r\n\r\nWindows (10 / 1709):\r\nFirefox: 60.5.0 ESR\r\n\r\n\r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/42262826/52201872-19beed00-286d-11e9-9e45-4f242f65504a.png)\r\n","Url":"https://github.com/angular/material2/issues/15071","RelatedDescription":"Open issue \"MatTabNav unexpected bahavior\" (#15071)"},{"Id":"406248968","IsPullRequest":false,"CreatedAt":"2019-02-04T09:46:18","Actor":"gerardcarbo","Number":"15070","RawContent":null,"Title":"mat-select not updating display value if model value is changed again inside selectionChange","State":"open","Body":"#### What is the expected behavior?\r\n\r\nIf the value of the model is changed inside selectionChange event, due to an internal validation, it should be updated in the mat-select view.\r\n\r\n#### What is the current behavior?\r\n\r\nKeeps the selected value.\r\n\r\n#### What are the steps to reproduce?\r\n\r\nhttps://stackblitz.com/edit/angular-qa4txi\r\n\r\nSelect 'invoice' wich is \"not allowed\".
