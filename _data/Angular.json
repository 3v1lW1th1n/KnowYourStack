With Ivy integrated in my project, it's no longer skipping its own injections and accessing the ones in its parent. \r\n\r\nFor example, I have the following code: \r\n\r\nIn app.component.ts\r\n```ts\r\n@Directive({ selector: '[parentDirective]' })\r\nexport class ParentDirective {\r\n  constructor(private vc: ViewContainerRef){\r\n    console.log(vc.element);\r\n  }\r\n}\r\n\r\n@Directive({ selector: '[childDirective]' })\r\nexport class ChildDirective {\r\n  constructor(@SkipSelf() private vc: ViewContainerRef){\r\n    console.log(vc.element);\r\n  }\r\n}\r\n```\r\nin app.component.html\r\n\r\n```html\r\n<div parentDirective>parent <span childDirective>child</span></div>\r\n```\r\n\r\nThese two directive classes should log the same ViewContainerRef element. However, with Ivy, you can see that's no longer the case. Here is the [reproduction](https://ivy.ng-run.com/edit/xMfu7xoF1t4b8hFvoU9N?open=app%2Fapp.component.html). This reproduction is made in Angular Ivy 8.1.0-next.3. But I also see this behavior in my project that's on \"@angular/core\": \"9.0.0-rc.3\",\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n## 🔬 Minimal Reproduction\r\n<!--\r\nPlease create and share minimal reproduction of the issue starting with this template: https://stackblitz.com/fork/angular-issue-repro2\r\n-->\r\n[Minimal Reproduction](https://ivy.ng-run.com/edit/xMfu7xoF1t4b8hFvoU9N?open=app%2Fapp.component.html)\r\n\r\n<!--\r\nIf StackBlitz is not suitable for reproduction of your issue, please create a minimal GitHub repository with the reproduction of the issue.\r\nA good way to make a minimal reproduction is to create a new app via `ng new repro-app` and add the minimum possible code to show the problem. \r\nShare the link to the repo below along with step-by-step instructions to reproduce the problem, as well as expected and actual behavior.\r\n\r\nIssues that don't have enough info and can't be reproduced will be closed.\r\n\r\nYou can read more about issue submission guidelines here: https://github.com/angular/angular/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md#-submitting-an-issue\r\n-->\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n## 🌍  Your Environment\r\n\r\n**Angular Version:**\r\n<pre><code>\r\n\r\n\"@angular/core\": \"9.0.0-rc.3\",\r\n\r\n</code></pre>\r\n","Url":"https://github.com/angular/angular/issues/34066","RelatedDescription":"Open issue \"In Ivy, SkipSelf() is not accessing the parent's ViewContainerRef, ElementRef, etc\" (#34066)"},{"Id":"529022142","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2019-11-26T23:12:42","Actor":"petebacondarwin","Number":"34065","RawContent":null,"Title":"fix(ivy): i18n - ensure that escaped chars are handled in localized s…","State":"open","Body":"…trings\r\n\r\nWhen creating synthesized tagged template literals, one must provide both\r\nthe \"cooked\" text and the \"raw\" (unparsed) text.

I took the code from the original PR, rebased it against master, fixed the unit test failures and addressed the PR feedback. Sorry @alxhub, but for some reason the ownership of the original commit was switched when I rebased it. My changes are isolated to the second `fixup` commit.\r\n\r\n--------------------------\r\n\r\nAngular View Engine uses global knowledge to compile the following code:\r\n\r\n```typescript\r\nexport class Base {\r\n  constructor(private vcr: ViewContainerRef) {}\r\n}\r\n\r\n@Directive({...})\r\nexport class Dir extends Base {\r\n  // constructor inherited from base\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nHere, `Dir` extends `Base` and inherits its constructor. To create a `Dir`\r\nthe arguments to this inherited constructor must be obtained via dependency\r\ninjection. View Engine is able to generate a correct factory for `Dir` to do\r\nthis because via metadata it knows the arguments of `Base`'s constructor,\r\neven if `Base` is declared in a different library.\r\n\r\nIn Ivy, DI is entirely a runtime concept. Currently `Dir` is compiled with\r\nan ngDirectiveDef field that delegates its factory to `getInheritedFactory`.\r\nThis looks for some kind of factory function on `Base`, which comes up\r\nempty. This case looks identical to an inheritance chain with no\r\nconstructors, which works today in Ivy.\r\n\r\nBoth of these cases will now become an error in this commit. If a decorated\r\nclass inherits from an undecorated base class, a diagnostic is produced\r\ninforming the user of the need to either explicitly declare a constructor or\r\nto decorate the base class.","Url":"https://github.com/angular/angular/pull/34061","RelatedDescription":"Open PR \"feat(ivy): error in ivy when inheriting a ctor from an undecorated base\" (#34061)"},{"Id":"528888726","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2019-11-26T18:04:17","Actor":"cooneyasendia","Number":"34060","RawContent":null,"Title":"fix(common): HttpHeaders lazyInit type check","State":"open","Body":"Add an undefined and null check to the possible value(s) when running the lazyInit of HttpHeaders with a key/value pair object.\r\n\r\nfixes #34059\r\n\r\n## PR Checklist\r\nPlease check if your PR fulfills the following requirements:\r\n\r\n- [x] The commit message follows our guidelines: https://github.com/angular/angular/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md#commit\r\n- [ ] Tests for the changes have been added (for bug fixes / features)\r\n- [ ] Docs have been added / updated (for bug fixes / features)\r\n\r\n\r\n## PR Type\r\nWhat kind of change does this PR introduce?\r\n\r\n<!-- Please check the one that applies to this PR using \"x\". -->\r\n\r\n- [x] Bugfix\r\n- [ ] Feature\r\n- [ ] Code style update (formatting, local variables)\r\n- [ ] Refactoring (no functional changes, no api changes)\r\n- [ ] Build related changes\r\n- [ ] CI related changes\r\n- [ ] Documentation content changes\r\n- [ ] angular.io application / infrastructure changes\r\n- [ ] Other...

All plugins (even the administration module, where the plugins are available) are lazy loaded:\r\n\r\napp.module.ts\r\n```ts\r\nexport const APP_ROUTES: ProcusRoutes = [\r\n  { path: '', component: AppComponent },\r\n  { path: 'auth', loadChildren: () => import('./authentication/authentication.module').then(m => m.AuthenticationModule) },\r\n  { path: 'admin', loadChildren: () => import('./administration/administration.module').then(m => m.AdministrationModule), title: 'Administration' },\r\n\r\n  { path: '**', redirectTo: '404' },\r\n];\r\n```\r\n\r\nadministration.module.ts:\r\n```ts\r\nconst routes: ProcusRoutes = [\r\n  {\r\n    path: '',\r\n    component: AdministrationComponent,\r\n\r\n    children: [\r\n      { title: 'Dashboard', path: 'dashboard', icon: ['fas', 'home'], loadChildren: () => import('./dashboard/dashboard.module').then(m => m.DashboardModule) },\r\n      { title: 'Shootings', icon: ['fas', 'camera'], path: 'shootings', redirectTo: 'dashboard' },\r\n      { title: 'Photos', icon: ['fas', 'images'], path: 'photos', redirectTo: 'dashboard' },\r\n      // { title: 'Users', icon: ['fas', 'users'], path: 'users', redirectTo: 'dashboard' },\r\n      { title: 'Forum', icon: ['fas', 'comments'], path: 'forum', redirectTo: 'dashboard' },\r\n      { title: 'Login', icon: ['fas', 'lock'], path: 'auth/login', redirectTo: 'dashboard' },\r\n      { title: '404', icon: ['fas', 'exclamation-triangle'], path: '404', redirectTo: 'dashboard' },\r\n      { title: 'Test', icon: ['fas', 'vial'], path: 'test-content', component: TestContentComponent },\r\n      { title: 'Configuration', icon: ['fas', 'cog'], path: 'config', component: TestContentComponent },\r\n      { title: 'Plugins', path: 'plugins', icon: ['fas', 'plug'], loadChildren: () => import('../plugins/plugins.module').then(m => m.PluginsModule) },\r\n      // { path: '**', title: 'Not found', component: NotFoundComponent },\r\n    ],\r\n\r\n  },\r\n];\r\n\r\n```\r\n\r\nWhen I load a plugin, I inject a new route into the routes of the `administration.module.ts` in my `routing.service.ts`, where `registerRoute` is the entry:\r\n\r\n```ts\r\npublic registerRoute(route: ProcusRoute) {\r\n    if (this.routes) {\r\n      if (this.routeIsRegistered(route.path)) { return; }\r\n\r\n      const baseRouteArray = this.routes[0].children;\r\n\r\n\r\n      const newRouteIndex = baseRouteArray.push(route);\r\n      const fallthroughRouteIndex = baseRouteArray.findIndex(item => item.path == '**');\r\n      baseRouteArray.swap(fallthroughRouteIndex, newRouteIndex);\r\n\r\n      this.updateRouteConfig(this.routes);\r\n    }\r\n\r\n  }\r\n\r\n  \r\n  private routeIsRegistered(path: string) {\r\n    if (!this.routes) { return false; }\r\n    return this.routes.filter(r => r.path.toLowerCase() === path.toLowerCase()).length > 0;\r\n  }\r\n\r\n  private updateRouteConfig(config) {\r\n\r\nHOW CAN I UPDATE THIS ROUTE?   \r\n\r\n    this.routesChanged$.next(config);\r\n  }\r\n\r\n  \r\n  private unRegisterRoute(path: string) {\r\n    console.log('Unregister', path);\r\n    this.updateRouteConfig(this.router.config.filter(route => route.path !== path));\r\n  }\r\n```\r\n\r\n`ProcusRoutes` is only an extended `Route` with some additional metadata of me:\r\n\r\n```ts\r\nimport { Route } from '@angular/router';\r\n\r\nexport interface ProcusRoute extends Route {\r\n    title?: string;\r\n    icon?: string[];\r\n    children?: ProcusRoutes;\r\n}\r\n\r\nexport declare type ProcusRoutes = ProcusRoute[];\r\n```\r\n\r\nThe new route is added correct and the application shows me it in the navigation.

The first commit refactors the size computations without any significant changes to the output.\r\n* Files listed as `lazy: true` or `inject: false` in the app dev's `angular.json` file were included in the `initial` bundle, even though these resources must be loaded asynchronously. The second commit filters out files which were marked asynchronous from the `initial` bundle.\r\n* Differential builds were included in the same size, so the `main` size was including both the ES2015 **and** ES5 sizes together, which isn't what the user would want. The third commit updates the relevant budgets to output two sizes, one for each differential build, rather than including them together.\r\n\r\nI made separate commits performing each of these steps individually to make the logic a little easier to follow and understand.","Url":"https://github.com/angular/angular-cli/pull/16268","RelatedDescription":"Open PR \"fix(@angular-devkit/build-angular): fix budget checks\" (#16268)"},{"Id":"527401200","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2019-11-22T21:36:32","Actor":"gregmagolan","Number":"16267","RawContent":null,"Title":"refactor(@angular-devkit/build-angular): allow @angular/core version 0.0.0","State":"closed","Body":"Allow version \"0.0.0\" for integration testing in the angular/angular repository with the generated development @angular/core npm package which is versioned \"0.0.0\".\r\n\r\nThis is a pre-req for https://github.com/angular/angular/pull/33927 which runs integration tests against the bazel generated npm packages.\r\n\r\nTo green up that PR I have a patch that does the same thing https://github.com/angular/angular/pull/33927/files#diff-817b74474f8a65162b6115d04a6f43c7 which will get removed once this change makes it in to the next release","Url":"https://github.com/angular/angular-cli/pull/16267","RelatedDescription":"Closed or merged PR \"refactor(@angular-devkit/build-angular): allow @angular/core version 0.0.0\" (#16267)"},{"Id":"527388264","IsPullRequest":false,"CreatedAt":"2019-11-22T20:00:19","Actor":"mucbits","Number":"16266","RawContent":null,"Title":"Live Reload not working with --basehref","State":"open","Body":"# 🐞 Bug report\r\n\r\n### Command (mark with an `x`)\r\n\r\n- [ ] new\r\n- [ ] build\r\n- [x] serve\r\n- [ ] test\r\n- [ ] e2e\r\n- [ ] generate\r\n- [ ] add\r\n- [ ] lint\r\n- [ ] update\r\n- [ ] xi18n\r\n- [ ] run\r\n- [ ] config\r\n- [ ] help\r\n- [ ] version\r\n- [ ] doc\r\n\r\n\r\n### Is this a regression?\r\n\r\nYes, the previous version in which this bug was not present was: 0.803.13\r\n\r\n\r\n### Description\r\nLive Reload stopped working after this change:\r\nhttps://github.com/angular/angular-cli/commit/5260bbb9a3d17aefb90bcf1b660e252996cf68df#diff-6c0b312b8bd33db747e50549a66f7ab1\r\n\r\n`https://localhost:xxxx/admin/sockjs-node/info` returns 404\r\n\r\nwhile `https://localhost:xxxx/admin/admin/sockjs-node/info` exists.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n## 🔬 Minimal Reproduction\r\nng serve app --base-href /admin/  --deploy-url /admin/\r\n\r\n## 🔥 Exception or Error\r\n`https://localhost:xxxx/admin/sockjs-node/info` returns 404\r\n\r\n","Url":"https://github.com/angular/angular-cli/issues/16266","RelatedDescription":"Open issue \"Live Reload not working with --basehref\" (#16266)"},{"Id":"527123128","IsPullRequest":false,"CreatedAt":"2019-11-22T11:53:56","Actor":"Dok11","Number":"16265","RawContent":null,"Title":"SessionNotCreatedError: session not created: This version of ChromeDriver only supports Chrome version 76","State":"closed","Body":"<!--🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅\r\n\r\nOh hi there! 😄\r\n\r\nTo expedite issue processing please search open and closed issues before submitting a new one.\r\nExisting issues often contain information about workarounds, resolution, or progress updates.\r\n\r\n🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅🔅-->\r\n\r\n\r\n# 🐞 Bug report\r\n\r\n### Command (mark with an `x`)\r\n<!-- Can you pin-point the command or commands that are effected by this bug? -->\r\n<!-- ✍️edit: -->\r\n\r\n- [x] e2e\r\n\r\n\r\n### Description\r\n\r\nCommand `npm run e2e` doesnt work and throw error into a terminal.\r\nGoogle Chrome showing for a split second and close immediately.
