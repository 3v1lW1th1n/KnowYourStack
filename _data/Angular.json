According to the valueChanges Observable, the value is being emitted correctly.\r\n```\r\n<form\r\n    (ngSubmit)=\"onSubmit()\"\r\n    [formGroup]=\"form\"\r\n>\r\n    {{ form.value.file }} <-- this isn't updated until I drop a second file, then it always shows the previous file\r\n<div\r\n        fileDropzone\r\n        formControlName=\"file\"\r\n    ></div>\r\n</form>\r\n```\r\nI've noticed that if I add a custom event on the control, everything works correctly, but I shouldn't have to do that.\r\n\r\n```\r\n<form\r\n    (ngSubmit)=\"onSubmit()\"\r\n    [formGroup]=\"form\"\r\n>\r\n    {{ form.value.file }} <-- This updates correctly when listening to any custom event on the control\r\n<div\r\n        fileDropzone\r\n        (changed)=\"onChange($event)\"\r\n        formControlName=\"file\"\r\n    ></div>\r\n</form>\r\n```\r\nI assumed the problem might be OnPush change detection, but even after removing it, the problem persists.\r\n\r\n## üåç  Your Environment\r\n\r\n**Angular Version:**\r\n<pre><code>\r\n<!-- run `ng version` and paste output below -->\r\n<!-- ‚úçÔ∏è-->\r\nAngular CLI: 7.3.8\r\nNode: 8.10.0\r\nOS: win32 x64\r\nAngular: 7.2.13\r\n... animations, common, compiler, compiler-cli, core, forms\r\n... http, language-service, platform-browser\r\n... platform-browser-dynamic, router\r\n\r\nPackage                            Version\r\n------------------------------------------------------------\r\n@angular-devkit/architect          0.13.8\r\n@angular-devkit/build-angular      0.13.8\r\n@angular-devkit/build-optimizer    0.13.8\r\n@angular-devkit/build-webpack      0.13.8\r\n@angular-devkit/core               7.3.8\r\n@angular-devkit/schematics         7.3.8\r\n@angular/cdk                       7.3.7\r\n@angular/cli                       7.3.8\r\n@angular/flex-layout               7.0.0-beta.24\r\n@angular/material                  7.3.7\r\n@angular/material-moment-adapter   7.3.7\r\n@ngtools/webpack                   7.3.8\r\n@schematics/angular                7.3.8\r\n@schematics/update                 0.13.8\r\nrxjs                               6.4.0\r\ntypescript                         3.2.2\r\nwebpack                            4.29.0\r\n</code></pre>\r\n\r\n","Url":"https://github.com/angular/angular/issues/30494","RelatedDescription":"Open issue \"Custom form control (ControlValueAccesor) doesn't make parent run change detection\" (#30494)"},{"Id":"444634389","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2019-05-15T20:38:23","Actor":"gkalpak","Number":"30493","RawContent":null,"Title":" build: update version to 8.0.0-rc.4 in `package.json`","State":"open","Body":"This will update the version shown as `@next` on next.angular.io (but we need a long-term solution).","Url":"https://github.com/angular/angular/pull/30493","RelatedDescription":"Open PR \" build: update version to 8.0.0-rc.4 in `package.json`\" (#30493)"},{"Id":"444600400","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2019-05-15T19:12:54","Actor":"JoostK","Number":"30492","RawContent":null,"Title":"feat(ivy): static evaluation of TypeScript's `__spread` helper","State":"open","Body":"The usage of array spread syntax in source code may be downleveled to a\r\ncall to TypeScript's `__spread` helper function from `tslib`, depending\r\non the options `downlevelIteration` and `emitHelpers`.

As far as I can tell this class did exist in angularJS. This complicates forms that are relying on classes like `ng-touched` and `ng-invalid` to add error styling. For example if a form element is required, but not touched before the form is submitted, then a style using `.ng-touched.ng-invald` will not be matched. This means you either need to mark the form/elements as touched manually on submit, or add a class binding yourself to track when the form has been submitted. You'll have to do this on every form in your project, making it likely that you may forget to do it on occasion, and your error styling won't kick in under certain circumstances. You could disable form submission when the form is invalid, but that doesn't seem ideal, especially on larger forms as the user may have missed some form elements that are required, and there won't be any error styling to indicate this, because the element hasn't been touched.\r\n\r\nOpened a new issue because this feels different from #20477","Url":"https://github.com/angular/angular/issues/30486","RelatedDescription":"Open issue \"Apply ng-submitted class to formGroups that have been submitted\" (#30486)"},{"Id":"444469848","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2019-05-15T14:25:10","Actor":"pkozlowski-opensource","Number":"30485","RawContent":null,"Title":"docs(ivy): document rules for the global state access","State":"open","Body":"","Url":"https://github.com/angular/angular/pull/30485","RelatedDescription":"Open PR \"docs(ivy): document rules for the global state access\" (#30485)"},{"Id":"444461826","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2019-05-15T14:10:32","Actor":"ryanwolhuter","Number":"30484","RawContent":null,"Title":"docs: Add missing period at end of sentence.","State":"open","Body":"## PR Checklist\r\nPlease check if your PR fulfills the following requirements:\r\n\r\n- [ ] The commit message follows our guidelines: https://github.com/angular/angular/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md#commit\r\n- [ ] Tests for the changes have been added (for bug fixes / features)\r\n- [ ] Docs have been added / updated (for bug fixes / features)\r\n\r\n\r\n## PR Type\r\nWhat kind of change does this PR introduce?\r\n\r\n<!-- Please check the one that applies to this PR using \"x\". -->\r\n\r\n- [ ] Bugfix\r\n- [ ] Feature\r\n- [ ] Code style update (formatting, local variables)\r\n- [ ] Refactoring (no functional changes, no api changes)\r\n- [ ] Build related changes\r\n- [ ] CI related changes\r\n- [ x] Documentation content changes\r\n- [ ] angular.io application / infrastructure changes\r\n- [ ] Other...

It leads to inconsistency of applied styles. Consider two components:\r\n1) Button with hostbinded class `._large` to set size\r\n2) A Card component with Button inside it that has class `.override_size` applied to nested Button that sets a different size\r\n\r\nIf there was a Button component in the view by the time we load Card, Button styles are already in HEAD and therefore `.override_size` class, having the same specificity, overrides `._large` class, because it comes later.\r\n\r\nOn the other hand, if Button first appears inside Card, its styles are added to the HEAD later and therefore `._large` class takes over.\r\n\r\nHave a look at this Stackblitz demo:\r\nhttps://stackblitz.com/edit/angular-styles-specificity-bug\r\n\r\n_**Note**: please do not think about exact examples I gave, these are just the simplest cases I could think of._\r\n\r\n### Describe the solution you'd like\r\nIncrease specificity of `_ngcontent` styles as they are typically more important. You would have some styles built in within a component and when you use it later inside some other component ‚Äî you add classes to it to specify what styles you need in exactly this usage. Easiest way to do so would be to add `[_ngcontent-X]` attribute selector to styles twice (i.e. `.override_size[_ngcontent-c2][_ngcontent-c2] {`).\r\n\r\n\r\n### Describe alternatives you've considered\r\nRight now we have to manually increase specificity by either adding tag name before class (i.e. `button-component.override_size`) or with any other way like adding two classes instead of one:\r\n```\r\n.override_size {\r\n && {\r\n    our styles\r\n}\r\n```\r\nso it compiles to `.override_size.override_size` which is not ideal but is the cleanest solution I could think of. Problem is, we have to keep that in mind **all the time we add classes to components** and not just HTML tags.","Url":"https://github.com/angular/angular/issues/30474","RelatedDescription":"Open issue \"Prioritize _ngcontent styles over _nghost\" (#30474)"}],"ResultType":"GitHubIssue"},"AngularCli-Issues":{"Issues":[{"Id":"444689240","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2019-05-15T23:31:41","Actor":"clydin","Number":"14437","RawContent":null,"Title":"test: update update-7.0 E2E to reflect 8.0-rc.4 changes","State":"open","Body":"Chrome 41 is no longer added to browserslist and polyfills are now removed from unmodified polyfills.ts files","Url":"https://github.com/angular/angular-cli/pull/14437","RelatedDescription":"Open PR \"test: update update-7.0 E2E to reflect 8.0-rc.4 changes\" (#14437)"},{"Id":"444300785","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2019-05-15T21:31:45","Actor":"renovate-bot","Number":"14431","RawContent":null,"Title":"build: update terser-webpack-plugin to version 1.2.4","State":"closed","Body":"This PR contains the following updates:\n\n| Package | Type | Update | Change | References |\n|---|---|---|---|---|\n| terser-webpack-plugin | dependencies | patch | [`1.2.3` -> `1.2.4`](https://diff.intrinsic.com/terser-webpack-plugin/1.2.3/1.2.4) | [source](https://togithub.com/webpack-contrib/terser-webpack-plugin) |\n\n---\n\n### Release Notes\n\n<details>\n<summary>webpack-contrib/terser-webpack-plugin</summary>\n\n### [`v1.2.4`](https://togithub.com/webpack-contrib/terser-webpack-plugin/blob/master/CHANGELOG.md#&#8203;124httpsgithubcomwebpack-contribterser-webpack-plugincomparev123v124-2019-05-15)\n\n[Compare Source](https://togithub.com/webpack-contrib/terser-webpack-plugin/compare/v1.2.3...v1.2.4)\n\n</details>\n\n---\n\n### Renovate configuration\n\n:date: **Schedule**: \"after 10pm every weekday,before 4am every weekday,every weekend\" in timezone America/Tijuana.\n\n:vertical_traffic_light: **Automerge**: Disabled by config.
