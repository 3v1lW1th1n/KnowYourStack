This was an important improvement, however, I am still missing a smarter build command that would `build` all the projects in a correct sequence. And the same is applicable to `test` command.\r\n\r\n**What does the correct sequence mean**\r\nUsually in a bigger monorepo workspaces developed packages can have dependencies on one another, which means that simple alphabetical order of build/test will not work.\r\n\r\n**Example**\r\n\r\n```bash\r\nLibraries & dependencies\r\n├── Library 1\r\n│   ├── Library 3\r\n├── Library 2\r\n│   ├── Library 3\r\n├── Library3\r\n```\r\n\r\nIn the example above current sequence of `ng test` would be `Library 1 - Library 2 - Library 3`, but the correct sequence would be `Library 3 - Library 1 - Library 2`\r\n\r\n\r\n### Describe the solution you'd like\r\nEvery project in a workspace already contains `package.json` (_obviously_). We could use `peerDependencies` to declare the dependencies between projects of the workspace. Then `build` and `test` commands would be able to detect the dependencies and build the libraries in the correct sequence.\r\n\r\nI have written myself a node executable that does exactly that.
