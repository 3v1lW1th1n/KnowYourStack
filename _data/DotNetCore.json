run`.","State":"closed","Body":"This commit improves the handling of the SIGINT signal from `dotnet run`.\r\n\r\nThe current behavior of `dotnet run` is to use the default handler for the\r\nSIGINT signal.  This results in the termination of the `dotnet run` process\r\nwith an exit status of 130 on POSIX systems and 0xC000013A on Windows.  This\r\nprevents a child process to gracefully handle SIGINT by returning a zero exit\r\ncode or from ignoring the signal entirely and letting the process appear to\r\ncontinue to run.\r\n\r\nAdditionally, the child process of `dotnet run` may still be writing to stdout\r\nduring the handling of SIGINT.  Because `dotnet run` may terminate before the\r\nchild process does, a waiting parent of `dotnet run`, such as a shell, may\r\nproceed to print out a new prompt to the user while the child continues to\r\nwrite to stdout.  This results in inconsistent and interleaved output in a\r\nterminal and can be a source of confusion to users.\r\n\r\nThis commit changes `dotnet` to always ignore SIGINT when spawning a child\r\nprocess.  This allows the child process to handle the signal and decide what to\r\ndo with it.  As a result, the UX from when the user program is run directly or\r\nvia `dotnet run` is the same regarding SIGINT.\r\n\r\nFixes #812.","Url":"https://github.com/dotnet/cli/pull/10544","RelatedDescription":"Closed or merged PR \"Improve Ctrl-C experience for `dotnet run`.\" (#10544)"},{"Id":"396374907","IsPullRequest":false,"CreatedAt":"2019-01-07T20:38:20","Actor":"yuki233","Number":"10551","RawContent":null,"Title":"SDK 3.0.100-preview-010006 should merge runtime 3.0.0-preview-27219-3 rather than 3.0.0-preview-27218-01","State":"closed","Body":"## Steps to reproduce\r\n1.

These \"profiles\" are then allowed to overlap as needed.\r\n\r\nA FrameworkReferences should be able to address such a profile. Furthermore, this should be done by assigning a unique FrameworkReference name for each subset to retain the simplicity of just having a single string to record per FrameworkReference in https://github.com/NuGet/Home/issues/7342\r\n\r\nWe could do this by picking distinct complete names for each profile:\r\n\r\n``` xml\r\n<FrameworkReference include=\"Microsoft.WindowsForms\" />\r\n<FrameworkReference Include=\"Microsoft.WPF\" />\r\n```\r\n\r\nOr by encoding the shared framework + profile in the name:\r\n\r\n``` xml\r\n<FrameworkReference Include=\"Microsoft.WindowsDesktop.App|WindowsForms\" />\r\n<FrameworkReference Include=\"Microsoft.WindowsDesktop.App|WPF\" />\r\n```","Url":"https://github.com/dotnet/cli/issues/10536","RelatedDescription":"Open issue \"WindowsDesktop reference assembly split\" (#10536)"},{"Id":"395679588","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2019-01-03T19:44:56","Actor":"livarcocc","Number":"10534","RawContent":null,"Title":"Updating msbuild version to 16.0.0-preview.352.","State":"closed","Body":"","Url":"https://github.com/dotnet/cli/pull/10534","RelatedDescription":"Closed or merged PR \"Updating msbuild version to 16.0.0-preview.352.\" (#10534)"},{"Id":"394977535","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2019-01-03T18:35:41","Actor":"dotnet-maestro[bot]","Number":"10526","RawContent":null,"Title":"Update dependency files","State":"closed","Body":"This pull request updates the following dependencies\r\n\r\nUpdates from https://github.com/dotnet/arcade\r\n\r\n- Microsoft.DotNet.Arcade.Sdk - 1.0.0-beta.18630.2\r\n\r\nUpdates from https://github.com/dotnet/arcade\r\n\r\n- Microsoft.DotNet.Arcade.Sdk - 1.0.0-beta.18631.2\r\n\r\nUpdates from https://github.com/dotnet/arcade\r\n\r\n- Microsoft.DotNet.Arcade.Sdk - 1.0.0-beta.19051.1\r\n\r\nUpdates from https://github.com/dotnet/arcade\r\n\r\n- Microsoft.DotNet.Arcade.Sdk - 1.0.0-beta.19052.1\r\n\r\n","Url":"https://github.com/dotnet/cli/pull/10526","RelatedDescription":"Closed or merged PR \"Update dependency files\" (#10526)"},{"Id":"395081277","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2019-01-03T18:33:50","Actor":"dotnet-maestro[bot]","Number":"10532","RawContent":null,"Title":"Update dependency files","State":"closed","Body":"This pull request updates the following dependencies\r\n\r\nUpdates from https://github.com/dotnet/sdk\r\n\r\n- Microsoft.NET.Sdk - 3.0.100-preview.18631.2\r\n\r\nUpdates from https://github.com/dotnet/sdk\r\n\r\n- Microsoft.NET.Sdk - 3.0.100-preview.18631.2\r\n\r\nUpdates from https://github.com/dotnet/sdk\r\n\r\n- Microsoft.NET.Sdk - 3.0.100-preview.19052.1\r\n\r\n","Url":"https://github.com/dotnet/cli/pull/10532","RelatedDescription":"Closed or merged PR \"Update dependency files\" (#10532)"},{"Id":"395490208","IsPullRequest":false,"CreatedAt":"2019-01-03T16:24:02","Actor":"hiyadav","Number":"10533","RawContent":null,"Title":"The process cannot access the file 'C:\\Program Files\\dotnet\\sdk\\NuGetFallbackFolder\\microsoft.aspnetcore.razor.design\\2.1.1\\tools\\Microsoft.AspNetCore.Razor.Language.dll' because it is being used by another process.","State":"closed","Body":"There was a issue opened on Azure DevOps Task repo regarding dotnetcore restore failing with Error: The process cannot access the file 'C:\\Program Files\\dotnet\\sdk\\NuGetFallbackFolder\\microsoft.aspnetcore.razor.design\\2.1.1\\tools\\Microsoft.AspNetCore.Razor.Language.dll' because it is being used by another process.\r\n\r\nCan the customer be helped to restore successfully. \r\n\r\n## Environment data\r\nEnvironment\r\nServer - Azure Pipelines\r\nAccount\r\nhttps://omnia-source.visualstudio.com/Omnia\r\n\r\nBuild\r\nPublish Preview Omnia Nuget And Npm Packages\r\nLatest\r\n\r\nAgent - Hosted\r\nagent queue name:\r\nHosted VS2017\r\nAgent: Hosted Agent\r\n\r\nIssue Description\r\n.net core task\r\ndotnet restore\r\n\r\nTask logs\r\n2018-12-30T10:50:54.3297669Z ==============================================================================\r\n2018-12-30T10:50:54.3297771Z Task : .NET Core\r\n2018-12-30T10:50:54.3297892Z Description : Build, test, package, or publish a dotnet application, or run a custom dotnet command.

As such, the following errors should be either demoted to warnings or not emitted at all from within instance methods of `ref struct` types.\r\n\r\n<code>error CS8170: Struct members cannot return 'this' or other instance members by reference</code>\r\n\r\n<code>error CS8157: Cannot return 'x' by reference because it was initialized to a value that cannot be returned by reference</code>\r\n\r\nThe problem with these (and perhaps others of their ilk), is that they are prone to false-positives. There are numerous cases where special knowledge that the compiler can't see or infer in fact ensures that the escaping `this` is previously, ultimately, or in some other way correctly contained.\r\n\r\nFurthermore, owing to the use limitations, `ref struct` can really only be deployed in pretty advanced situations requiring experts, and these types of developers are likely to have less need or desire for the aggressive static analysis of **CS8170** / **CS8157**, as they currently stand.\r\n","Url":"https://github.com/dotnet/roslyn/issues/32203","RelatedDescription":"Closed issue \"Disable CS8170 and CS8157 (\"escaping this\") for `ref struct` types\" (#32203)"},{"Id":"396279683","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2019-01-06T17:57:39","Actor":"YairHalberstadt","Number":"32206","RawContent":null,"Title":"Update DocComment on UnassignedAddressTakenVariablesWalker","State":"open","Body":"The original Doc Comment was copied from UnassignedVariablesWalker, and so was incorrect.\r\n\r\nSee issue #31483","Url":"https://github.com/dotnet/roslyn/pull/32206","RelatedDescription":"Open PR \"Update DocComment on UnassignedAddressTakenVariablesWalker\" (#32206)"},{"Id":"396212713","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2019-01-06T01:30:06","Actor":"dotnet-bot","Number":"32202","RawContent":null,"Title":"Merge dev16.1-preview1 to dev16.1-preview1-vs-deps","State":"closed","Body":"\nThis is an automatically generated pull request from dev16.1-preview1 into dev16.1-preview1-vs-deps.\n\n``` bash\ngit fetch --all\ngit checkout merges/dev16.1-preview1-to-dev16.1-preview1-vs-deps\ngit reset --hard upstream/dev16.1-preview1-vs-deps\ngit merge upstream/dev16.1-preview1\n# Fix merge conflicts\ngit commit\ngit push merges/dev16.1-preview1-to-dev16.1-preview1-vs-deps --force\n```\n\nOnce all conflicts are resolved and all the tests pass, you are free to merge the pull request.","Url":"https://github.com/dotnet/roslyn/pull/32202","RelatedDescription":"Closed or merged PR \"Merge dev16.1-preview1 to dev16.1-preview1-vs-deps\" (#32202)"},{"Id":"396205033","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2019-01-05T22:17:06","Actor":"agocke","Number":"32201","RawContent":null,"Title":"Synthesize Object.Equals override for records","State":"open","Body":"","Url":"https://github.com/dotnet/roslyn/pull/32201","RelatedDescription":"Open PR \"Synthesize Object.Equals override for records\" (#32201)"},{"Id":"396183663","IsPullRequest":false,"CreatedAt":"2019-01-05T17:25:30","Actor":"SamVanheer","Number":"32200","RawContent":null,"Title":"Expose compiled Assembly instance to user through CSharpScript Script instance","State":"open","Body":"CSharpScript compiles to an assembly in memory. This assembly's `System.Reflection.Assembly` instance can be accessed by returning either the assembly or a type defined in it as a the return value from a script, but there is currently no way to access the instance directly through the `Script` class API.\r\n\r\nThis prevents using scripts as compiled-on-demand assemblies that can otherwise be treated as dynamically loaded assemblies, using Reflection to access its types.\r\n\r\nIdeally the `Script` class should be extended with a `GetCompiledAssembly()` method that provides the instance, and either throws if it hasn't been compiled yet or compiles it just as `RunAsync` and related methods do.\r\n\r\nFrom what i can tell the assembly is created here: https://github.com/dotnet/roslyn/blob/d304f63cbe2ff3eb57fc4fc8a136c3757a703472/src/Scripting/Core/ScriptBuilder.cs#L159\r\n\r\nSo making it accessible directly may require some refactoring first.\r\n\r\n~~However, caching the generated assembly may result in reduced memory usage when the script is executed repeatedly. Since `ContinueWith` leaves the original script untouched there is no need to worry about outdated assemblies being returned.~~\r\n\r\nThe assembly should probably be returned by `ScriptBuilder`'s `CreateExecutor` method and cached in `Script`.\r\n\r\nA good reason to add this is to allow using CSharpScript assemblies with [MEF](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/framework/mef/)","Url":"https://github.com/dotnet/roslyn/issues/32200","RelatedDescription":"Open issue \"Expose compiled Assembly instance to user through CSharpScript Script instance\" (#32200)"},{"Id":"396159696","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2019-01-05T13:00:05","Actor":"dotnet-bot","Number":"32199","RawContent":null,"Title":"Merge master to features/editorconfig-in-compiler","State":"closed","Body":"\nThis is an automatically generated pull request from master into features/editorconfig-in-compiler.\n\n``` bash\ngit fetch --all\ngit checkout merges/master-to-features/editorconfig-in-compiler\ngit reset --hard upstream/features/editorconfig-in-compiler\ngit merge upstream/master\n# Fix merge conflicts\ngit commit\ngit push merges/master-to-features/editorconfig-in-compiler --force\n```\n\nOnce all conflicts are resolved and all the tests pass, you are free to merge the pull request.","Url":"https://github.com/dotnet/roslyn/pull/32199","RelatedDescription":"Closed or merged PR \"Merge master to features/editorconfig-in-compiler\" (#32199)"}],"ResultType":"GitHubIssue"},"CoreRT-Issues":{"Issues":[{"Id":"396739613","IsPullRequest":false,"CreatedAt":"2019-01-08T03:46:39","Actor":"frankzye","Number":"6784","RawContent":null,"Title":"using npgsql but throw Object reference not set to an instance of an object exception","State":"open","Body":"System.NullReferenceException: Object reference not set to an instance of an object . \r\nat Npgsql.Logging.NpgsqlLogManager.GetClassFullName() + 0x64 .    \r\nat Npgsql.NpgsqlConnection..cctor() + 0x53 . \r\n\r\nand I found the following source code:  \r\n`\r\nMethodBase method = frame.GetMethod();  \r\n                declaringType = method.DeclaringType;  \r\n                if (declaringType == null) { . \r\n                    className = method.Name;  \r\n                    break;  \r\n}\r\n`\r\nhow to handle this exception , and when the third class lib using reflection, are there any work around ways?\r\n","Url":"https://github.com/dotnet/corert/issues/6784","RelatedDescription":"Open issue \"using npgsql but throw Object reference not set to an instance of an object exception\" (#6784)"},{"Id":"396710200","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2019-01-08T03:10:45","Actor":"Dotnet-GitSync-Bot","Number":"6783","RawContent":null,"Title":"Mirror changes from dotnet/coreclr","State":"closed","Body":"This PR contains mirrored changes from dotnet/coreclr\n\n\n**Please REBASE this PR when merging**\n\n cc @marek-safar","Url":"https://github.com/dotnet/corert/pull/6783","RelatedDescription":"Closed or merged PR \"Mirror changes from dotnet/coreclr\" (#6783)"},{"Id":"396689793","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2019-01-07T23:24:38","Actor":"marek-safar","Number":"6782","RawContent":null,"Title":"Moves common COM attributes to shared corelib partition","State":"open","Body":"","Url":"https://github.com/dotnet/corert/pull/6782","RelatedDescription":"Open PR \"Moves common COM attributes to shared corelib partition\" (#6782)"},{"Id":"396548672","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2019-01-07T20:09:27","Actor":"Dotnet-GitSync-Bot","Number":"6781","RawContent":null,"Title":"Mirror changes from dotnet/coreclr","State":"closed","Body":"This PR contains mirrored changes from dotnet/coreclr\n\n\n**Please REBASE this PR when merging**\n\n cc @marek-safar","Url":"https://github.com/dotnet/corert/pull/6781","RelatedDescription":"Closed or merged PR \"Mirror changes from dotnet/coreclr\" (#6781)"},{"Id":"396456488","IsPullRequest":false,"CreatedAt":"2019-01-07T11:47:26","Actor":"adamsitnik","Number":"6780","RawContent":null,"Title":"Potential deadlock?","State":"open","Body":"@jkotas I tried to run all the benchmarks from `dotnet/performance` repository for CoreRT (https://github.com/dotnet/performance/pull/218)\r\n\r\nI started all the benchmarks before going to sleep and expected that in the morning I am going to have all the results ready waiting for me.

These dimensions and their potential values create a matrix of overall build configurations. I can specify which element of the matrix to use to configure the build by specifying values for each dimension (e.g. Debug|x86|net46). If I want to perform multiple build passes (multiple elements of the matrix), then I have a few options depending on the dimension(s) I want vary.\r\n\r\nFor TargetFramework, I can specify a set of TargetFramework**s** and the dotnet sdk targets will perform multiple build passes, one for each TargetFramework specified.\r\n\r\nFor Configuration and Platform, I can use Visual Studio's Batch Build feature to select multiple Configurations and/or Platforms.\r\n\r\nFor my own custom \"dimension,\" my only real option is multiple MSBuild invocations from the command line, passing in values for my properties (and this might be a lot of invocations depending on the number of dimensions and number of potential values per dimension).\r\n\r\nIt would be great if the multi-pass build support for TargetFrameworks was generalized into a mechanism that supported multi-pass builds across arbitrary build dimensions. I could imagine this perhaps being expressed as follows:\r\n\r\n```xml\r\n<!-- Define each build dimension. -->\r\n<ItemGroup>\r\n  <BuildDimension Condition=\"'$(Configuration)' == ''\" Include=\"Configuration\">\r\n    <Values>Debug;Release</Values>\r\n  </BuildDimension>\r\n  <BuildDimension Condition=\"'$(Platform)' == ''\" Include=\"Platform\">\r\n    <Values>x86;x64;arm;AnyCPU</Values>\r\n  </BuildDimension>\r\n  <BuildDimension Condition=\"'$(TargetFramework)' == ''\" Include=\"TargetFramework\">\r\n    <Values>net46;netstandard2.0;uap10.0.14393</Values>\r\n  </BuildDefinition>\r\n</ItemGroup>\r\n```\r\n\r\nThe idea would be that a specific value for a build dimension (e.g. Configuration=Debug) could be specified, otherwise multiple passes would be performed for that dimension. I could imagine this showing up in Visual Studio as dropdowns for each build dimension, similar to what we have today for Configuration and Platform. I would also imagine the default output path would be generated by simply combining the values of each dimension (e.g. Debug\\x86\\net46).\r\n\r\nUsually, a build configuration matrix is sparse, so I'd also want to be able to ignore certain elements of the matrix (don't build them). I could imagine this perhaps being expressed as follows:\r\n\r\n```xml\r\n<PropertyGroup>\r\n  <!-- Allow an early out of the inner build loop, which is effectively allowing for a sparse build dimension matrix. -->\r\n  <BuildPassEnabled Condition=\"'$(Platform)' == 'arm' AND '$(TargetFramework)' != 'uap10.0.14393'\">false</BuildPassEnabled>\r\n</PropertyGroup>\r\n```\r\n\r\nGeneralized build dimensions and multi-pass builds are particularly useful when you need to define your own custom build dimensions. For example, when writing code to be consumed by Unity 3D, I have the concept of Unity Players (runtimes) (e.g. Windows Store, Android, iOS, etc.). Depending on the target Player, I might want to include different source files, define different conditional compilation symbols, etc. Further, I might want to define a \"compatibility graph\" in the same way TargetFramework does (e.g. netstandard2.0 is \"compatible with\" net471, so a net471 project can consume a netstandard2.0 project). Taking my Unity 3D example further, different Unity Players support different .NET runtimes. For example, iOS and Android are based on .NET Framework, while Windows Store is based on UWP .NET Core). So ideally I'd want to be able to have UnityIOS and UnityAndroid be \"compatible with\" UnityNetFramework (for example). I could imagine this perhaps being expressed as follows:\r\n\r\n### My common props that *define* the build dimension\r\n\r\n```xml\r\n<ItemGroup>\r\n  <BuildDimensionCompatibility Include=\"UnityEditor;UnityIOS;UnityAndroid\">\r\n    <CompatibleWith>UnityNetFramework</CompatibleWith>\r\n  </BuildDimensionCompatibility>\r\n</ItemGroup>\r\n```\r\n\r\n### Project 1\r\n\r\n```xml\r\n<ItemGroup>\r\n  <BuildDimension Condition=\"'$(UnityPlayer)' == ''\" Include=\"UnityPlayer\">\r\n    <Values>UnityUAP;UnityNetFramework</Values>\r\n  </BuildDimension>\r\n</ItemGroup>\r\n```\r\n\r\n### Project 2\r\n\r\n```xml\r\n<ItemGroup>\r\n  <BuildDimension Condition=\"'$(UnityPlayer)' == ''\" Include=\"UnityPlayer\">\r\n    <Values>UnityUAP;UnityEditor;UnityIOS;UnityAndroid</Values>\r\n  </BuildDimension>\r\n  <!-- This ProjectReference works because UnityEditor/UnityIOS/UnityAndroid are compatible with UnityNetFramework in the same way that net471 and netcore5 are compatible with netstandard2.0 -->\r\n  <ProjectReference Include=\"Project1.csproj\" />\r\n</ItemGroup>\r\n```\r\n\r\nFinally, for all this to be effective, I'd want the same custom build dimension support and compatibility graph support to be part of NuGet (in terms of having build results from multiple build passes in the package and having the right assemblies/content being consumed by the consuming project).\r\n\r\nI feel like a solution like this would drastically simplify scenarios where custom \"build dimensions\" are needed, which in my experience is fairly common, and almost always results in some hacky solution that only one or two people on the team understand.","Url":"https://github.com/dotnet/sdk/issues/2790","RelatedDescription":"Open issue \"Generalize multi-pass build support\" (#2790)"},{"Id":"395918022","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2019-01-04T16:40:57","Actor":"dotnet-maestro[bot]","Number":"2789","RawContent":null,"Title":"Update dependency files","State":"closed","Body":"This pull request updates the following dependencies\r\n\r\nUpdates from https://github.com/dotnet/arcade\r\n\r\n- Microsoft.DotNet.Arcade.Sdk - 1.0.0-beta.19053.2\r\n- Microsoft.DotNet.SignTool - 1.0.0-beta.19053.2\r\n\r\n","Url":"https://github.com/dotnet/sdk/pull/2789","RelatedDescription":"Closed or merged PR \"Update dependency files\" (#2789)"},{"Id":"395727980","IsPullRequest":false,"CreatedAt":"2019-01-03T21:19:05","Actor":"kouvel","Number":"2787","RawContent":null,"Title":"Changes to runtime config options in .csproj are not reflected in .runtimeconfig.json on partial build","State":"open","Body":"Repro:\r\n\r\n```\r\ndotnet new console\r\ndotnet build -c Release\r\n```\r\n\r\nThe `.runtimeconfig.json` file in `bin` has the following contents:\r\n```json\r\n{\r\n  \"runtimeOptions\": {\r\n    \"tfm\": \"netcoreapp3.0\",\r\n    \"framework\": {\r\n      \"name\": \"Microsoft.NETCore.App\",\r\n      \"version\": \"3.0.0-preview-27218-01\"\r\n    }\r\n  }\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nEdit the `.csproj` file and add the following into the `PropertyGroup` element:\r\n```xml\r\n<TieredCompilation>false</TieredCompilation>\r\n```\r\n\r\n```\r\ndotnet build -c Release\r\n```\r\n\r\nThe `.runtimeconfig.json` file in `bin` has the same contents as above.\r\n\r\nExpected contents:\r\n```json\r\n{\r\n  \"runtimeOptions\": {\r\n    \"tfm\": \"netcoreapp3.0\",\r\n    \"framework\": {\r\n      \"name\": \"Microsoft.NETCore.App\",\r\n      \"version\": \"3.0.0-preview-27218-01\"\r\n    },\r\n    \"configProperties\": {\r\n      \"System.Runtime.TieredCompilation\": false\r\n    }\r\n  }\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nWorkaround is to delete `bin` and `obj` folders after updating the `.csproj` and before building.

However, .NET hasn't had a (great) built-in way to deal with JSON. Instead we've relied on [Json.NET] which continues to serve the .NET ecosystem well.\r\n\r\n[Json.NET]: https://www.newtonsoft.com/json\r\n\r\nMoving forward, we plan on making some changes to our JSON support:\r\n\r\n* **We need high-performance JSON APIs**. We need a new set of JSON APIs that are highly tuned for performance by using `Span<T>` and allows for processing UTF-8 directly without having to transcode to UTF-16 `string` instances. Both aspects are critical for our web server Kestrel, where throughput is a key requirement.\r\n\r\n* **Remove dependency from ASP.NET Core to Json.NET**. Today, ASP.NET Core has a dependency on Json.NET. While this provides a tight integration between ASP.NET Core and Json.NET, it also means that application developers cannot freely choose which JSON library they are using. This is also problematic for customers of Json.NET as the version is dictated by the underlying platform. However, Json.NET is frequently updated and application developers often want to -- or even have to -- use a specific version. Thus, we want to remove the dependency from ASP.NET Core 3.0 to Json.NET so that customers can choose which version to use, without fearing they might accidentally break the underlying platform. In addition, this makes it also possible to plug-in an entirely different JSON library.\r\n\r\n* **Provide an ASP.NET Core integration package for Json.NET**. Json.NET has basically become the Swiss Army knife of JSON processing in .NET. It provides many options and facilities that allow customers to handle their JSON needs with ease. We don't want to compromise on the Json.NET support customers are getting today, for example, the ability to configure the JSON serialization via the `AddJsonOptions` extension method. Thus, we want to provide the Json.NET integration as a NuGet package that developers can optionally install so they get all the bells and whistles they get from Json.NET today. The other part of this work item is to ensure we have the right extension points so that other parties can provide similar integration packages for their JSON library of choice.\r\n\r\nBelow are more details around this plan.\r\n\r\n## The need for high-performance JSON APIs\r\n\r\nThe requirements for the .NET stack have changed a bit since the arrival of .NET Core. Historically, .NET has valued usability and convenience. With .NET Core, we've added a focus on performance, and we've made significant investments to serve high performance needs. And the [improvements we made][techempower] in the popular TechEmpower benchmark are a testament to that.\r\n\r\n[techempower]: https://www.techempower.com/blog/2016/11/16/framework-benchmarks-round-13/\r\n\r\nWith .NET Core 2.1, we've added a brand new primitive called [Span\\<T>][span-msdn] that allows us to represent native memory and arrays in a uniform way. With this type, we've also added a set of parsing and encoding APIs that are much more memory efficient without having to resort to unsafe code.\r\n\r\n[span-msdn]: https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/magazine/mt814808.aspx\r\n\r\nPart of the work of minimizing allocations is to avoid having to transcode UTF-8 payloads into UTF-16 strings, purely for parsing reasons. Currently, Json.NET is implemented by reading UTF-16. We need the ability to read (and write) JSON documents directly in UTF-8 because most network protocols (including HTTP) use UTF-8.\r\n\r\nDuring .NET Core 2.1 we've learned that updating our existing APIs to leverage `Span<T>` has limits. While we did add a bunch of overloads that accept spans, we also had to produce brand new APIs that are designed around minimizing allocations and dealing with buffers, which we exposed in `System.Buffers` namespaces. And with `System.IO.Pipelines` we've also added a programming model that enables developers to share buffers without having to deal with lifetime issues.\r\n\r\nBased on these experiences we believe in order to support JSON parsing, we'll need to expose a new set of JSON APIs that are specifically geared for high-performance scenarios.\r\n\r\nYou might wonder why we can't just update Json.NET to include support for parsing JSON using `Span<T>`? Well, James Newton-King -- the author of Json.NET -- has the following to say about that:\r\n\r\n> Json.NET was created over 10 years ago, and since then it has added a wide range of features aimed to help developers work with JSON in .NET. In that time Json.NET has also become far and away NuGet's most depended on and downloaded package, and is the go-to library for JSON support in .NET. Unfortunately, Json.NET's wealth of features and popularity works against making major changes to it. Supporting new technologies like `Span<T>` would require fundamental breaking changes to the library and would disrupt existing applications and libraries that depend on it.\r\n>\r\n> Going forward Json.NET will continue to be worked on and invested in, both addressing known issues today and supporting new platforms in the future. Json.NET has always existed alongside other JSON libraries for .NET, and there will be nothing to prevent you using one or more together, depending on whether you need the performance of the new JSON APIs or the large feature set of Json.NET.\r\n\r\n## Move Json.NET integration into a separate NuGet package\r\n\r\nToday, you cannot use ASP.NET Core without Json.NET because it is a dependency of ASP.NET Core itself. Over the years, we've received feedback that the dependency can conflict with other libraries that have their own dependency on a different version of Json.NET. In the past, we've considered addressing this issue by using a private copy of Json.NET in ASP.NET. However, this would create problems when developers want to configure Json.NET (for instance, in order to control how the serializer behaves when formatting JSON objects).\r\n\r\nMoving forward we'd like to:\r\n\r\n1. Replace the internal usage of Json.NET in ASP.NET Core by the new platform-provided JSON APIs.\r\n\r\n2. Factor the public facing usage of Json.NET into an optional integration package that can be acquired from NuGet.\r\n\r\nSo the existing integration between ASP.NET Core and Json.NET will continue to be supported, but will be moving out of the platform and into a separate package. However, since the integration is then designed to sit on top of the platform, it will also allow customers to update Json.NET to later versions.\r\n\r\nFurthermore, customers who need more performance can also choose to use the new JSON APIs, at the expense of the rich feature set that Json.NET offers.\r\n\r\n## Discussion\r\n\r\nFor a discussion, please go to https://github.com/dotnet/corefx/issues/33115.","Url":"https://github.com/dotnet/announcements/issues/90","RelatedDescription":"Open issue \"The future of JSON in .NET Core 3.0\" (#90)"},{"Id":"368440353","IsPullRequest":false,"CreatedAt":"2018-10-09T23:44:06","Actor":"vivmishra","Number":"89","RawContent":null,"Title":"October 2018 .NET Updates","State":"open","Body":"# October 2018 .NET Updates\r\n\r\nThe following .NET updates were released in October 2018.

This advisory also provides guidance on what developers can do to update their applications to remove this vulnerability.\r\n\r\nMicrosoft is aware of a denial of service vulnerability in .NET Core when System.IO.Pipelines improperly handles requests. An attacker who successfully exploited this vulnerability could cause a denial of service against an application that is leveraging System.IO.Pipelines. The vulnerability can be exploited remotely, without authentication. A remote unauthenticated attacker could exploit this vulnerability by providing specially crafted requests to the application.\r\n\r\nThe update addresses the vulnerability by correcting how System.IO.Pipelines handles requests.\r\n\r\nIf you are using ASP.NET Core 2.1 you will also need to update your ASP.NET version this by following the instructions in the [ASP.NET Core bulletin](https://github.com/aspnet/Announcements/issues/316).\r\n\r\n## Discussion\r\n\r\nDiscussion for this issue can be found at https://github.com/dotnet/corefx/issues/32228\r\n\r\n### <a name=\"mitigation-factors\"></a>Mitigation factors\r\n\r\nThere are no mitigating factors for this vulnerability.\r\n\r\n## <a name=\"affected-software\"></a>Affected software\r\n\r\nAny .NET Core based application that uses the System.IO.Pipelines package with a vulnerable version listed below.\r\n\r\nPackage name | Vulnerable versions | Secure versions\r\n------------ | ------------------- | -------------------------\r\nSystem.IO.Pipelines | 4.5.0 | 4.5.1\r\n\r\n## <a name=\"advisory-faq\"></a>Advisory FAQ\r\n\r\n### <a name=\"how-affected\"></a>How do I know if I am affected?\r\n\r\n#### Applications which use System.IO.Pipelines\r\n\r\nSystem.IO.Pipelines is distributed both in ASP.NET Core 2.1 and separately as a NuGet package. If you are not using Microsoft.AspNetCore.App or .All, you may still be affected if you are referencing the System.IO.Pipelines package.\r\n\r\n##### Direct dependencies\r\n\r\nDirect dependencies are discoverable by examining your `csproj` file. They can be fixed by [editing the project file](#fixing-direct-dependencies) or using NuGet to update the dependency.\r\n\r\n##### Transitive dependencies\r\n\r\nTransitive dependencies occur when you add a package to your project that in turn relies on another package. For example, if Contoso publishes a package `Contoso.Utility` which, in turn, depends on `Contoso.Internals` and you add the `Contoso.Utility` package to your project now your project has a direct dependency on `Contoso.Utility` and, because `Contoso.Utility` depends 'Contoso.Internals', your application gains a transitive dependency on the `Contoso.Internals` package.\r\n\r\nTransitive dependencies are reviewable in two ways:\r\n\r\n* In the Visual Studio Solution Explorer window, which supports searching.\r\n* By examining the `project.assets.json` file contained in the obj directory of your project for `csproj` based projects\r\n\r\nThe `project.assets.json` files are the authoritative list of all packages used by your project, containing both direct and transitive dependencies.\r\n\r\nThere are two ways to view transitive dependencies. You can either [use Visual Studio’s Solution Explorer](#vs-solution-explorer), or you can review [the `project.assets.json` file](#project-assets-json)).\r\n\r\n##### <a name=\"vs-solution-explorer\"></a>Using Visual Studio Solution Explorer\r\n\r\nTo use Solution Explorer, open the project in Visual Studio, and then press Ctrl+; to activate the search in Solution Explorer. Search for the [vulnerable package](#affected-software) and make a note of the version numbers of any results you find.\r\n\r\nFor example, searching for `Microsoft.AspNetCore.Mvc.Core` in an example project that contains a package that takes a dependency on `Microsoft.AspNetCore.Mvc` shows the following results in Visual Studio 2017:\r\n\r\n![Screenshot of search results in Visual Studio 2017](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/796298/25858816/8ecdc2b4-3491-11e7-9363-746804bb9832.png)\r\n\r\nThe search results appear as a tree. In the previous results, you can see that a reference to `Microsoft.AspNetCore.Mvc.Core` version 1.1.2 is discovered.\r\n\r\nUnder the Dependencies node is a NuGet node. Under the NuGet node is the list of packages you have directly taken a dependency on and their versions.\r\nIn screenshot, the application takes a direct dependency on `Microsoft.AspNetCore.Mvc`. `Microsoft.AspNetCore.Mvc` in turn has leaf nodes that list its dependencies and their versions.\r\nThe `Microsoft.AspNetCore.Mvc` package takes a dependency on a version of `Microsoft.AspNetCore.Mvc.ApiExplorer`, that in turn takes a dependency on a version of `Microsoft.AspNetCore.Mvc.Core`.\r\n\r\n##### <a name=\"project-assets-json\"></a> Manually reviewing project.assets.json\r\n\r\nOpen the *project.assets.json* file from your project’s obj directory in your editor. We suggest you use an editor that understands JSON and allows you to collapse and expand nodes to review this file.\r\nVisual Studio and Visual Studio Code provide JSON friendly editing.\r\n\r\nSearch the *project.assets.json* file for the [vulnerable package](#affected-software), using the format `packagename/` for each of the package names from the preceding table. If you find the assembly name in your search:\r\n\r\n* Examine the line on which they are found, the version number is after the `/`.\r\n* Compare to the [vulnerable versions table](#affected-software).\r\n\r\nFor example, a search result that shows `System.IO.Pipelines/4.5.0` is a reference to version 4.5.0 of `System.IO.Pipelines`.\r\n\r\nIf your *project.assets.json* file includes references to the [vulnerable package](#affected-software), then you need to fix the transitive dependencies.\r\n\r\nIf you have not found any reference to any vulnerable packages, this means either\r\n\r\n* None of your direct dependencies depend on any vulnerable packages, or\r\n* You have already fixed the problem by updating the direct dependencies.\r\n\r\n### <a name=\"how-fix\"></a>How do I fix the issue?\r\n\r\n#### <a name=\"fixing-direct-dependencies\"></a>Fixing direct dependencies\r\n\r\nOpen *projectname.csproj* in your editor. If you're using Visual Studio, right-click the project and choose **Edit projectname.csproj** from the context menu, where projectname is the name of your project. Look for `PackageReference` elements. The following shows an example project file:\r\n\r\n```xml\r\n<Project Sdk=\"Microsoft.NET.Sdk.Web\">\r\n  <PropertyGroup>\r\n    <TargetFramework>netcoreapp2.1</TargetFramework>\r\n  </PropertyGroup>\r\n  <ItemGroup>\r\n    <PackageReference Include=\"System.IO.Pipelines\" Version=\"4.5.0\" />\r\n  </ItemGroup>\r\n</Project>\r\n```\r\n\r\nThe preceding example has a reference to the [vulnerable package](#affected-software), as seen by the single `PackageReference` element. The name of the package is in the `Include` attribute.\r\nThe package version number is in the `Version` attribute. The previous example shows a single direct dependency on `System.IO.Pipelines` version 4.5.0\r\n\r\nTo update the version to the secure package, change the version number to the updated package version as listed on the table [previously](#affected-software).\r\nIn this example, update `System.IO.Pipelines` to the appropriate [fixed package number](#affected-software) for your major version. Save the *csproj* file. The example *csproj* now looks as follows:\r\n\r\n```xml\r\n<Project Sdk=\"Microsoft.NET.Sdk.Web\">\r\n  <PropertyGroup>\r\n    <TargetFramework>netcoreapp2.1</TargetFramework>\r\n  </PropertyGroup>\r\n  <ItemGroup>\r\n    <PackageReference Include=\"System.IO.Pipelines\" Version=\"4.5.1\" />\r\n  </ItemGroup>\r\n</Project>\r\n```\r\n\r\nIf you're using Visual Studio and you save your updated *csproj* file, Visual Studio will restore the new package version.\r\nYou can see the restore results by opening the **Output** window (Ctrl+Alt+O) and changing the **Show output from** drop-down list to **Package Manager**.\r\n\r\nIf you're not using Visual Studio, open a command line and change to your project directory. Execute the `dotnet restore` command to restore the updated dependencies.\r\n\r\nNow recompile your application. If after recompilation you see a *Dependency conflict warning*, you must update your other direct dependencies to versions that take a dependency on the updated package.\r\n\r\n#### <a name=\"transitive-dependencies\"></a>Fixing transitive dependencies\r\n\r\nIf your transitive dependency review found references to the [vulnerable package](#affected-software), you must add a direct dependency to the updated package to your *csproj* file to override the transitive dependency.\r\n\r\nOpen *projectname.csproj* in your editor. If you're using Visual Studio, right-click the project and choose **Edit projectname.csproj** from the context menu, where projectname is the name of your project.\r\nLook for `PackageReference` nodes, for example:\r\n\r\n```xml\r\n<Project Sdk=\"Microsoft.NET.Sdk.\">\r\n  <PropertyGroup>\r\n    <TargetFramework>net461</TargetFramework>\r\n  </PropertyGroup>\r\n  <ItemGroup>\r\n    <PackageReference Include=\"ThirdParty.NotUpdatedYet\" Version=\"2.0.0\" />\r\n  </ItemGroup>\r\n</Project>\r\n```\r\n\r\nYou must add a direct dependency to the updated version of the [vulnerable package](#affected-software) by adding it to the *csproj* file.\r\nYou do this by adding a new line to the dependencies section, referencing the fixed version.\r\nFor example, if your search showed a transitive reference to a vulnerable `System.ServiceModel.Http` version, you'd add a reference to the [fixed package number](#affected-software).\r\n\r\n```xml\r\n<Project Sdk=\"Microsoft.NET.Sdk.Web\">\r\n  <PropertyGroup>\r\n    <TargetFramework>net461</TargetFramework>\r\n  </PropertyGroup>\r\n  <ItemGroup>\r\n    <PackageReference Include=\"System.IO.Pipelines\" Version=\"4.5.1\" />\r\n    <PackageReference Include=\"ThirdParty.NotUpdatedYet\" Version=\"2.0.0\" />\r\n  </ItemGroup>\r\n</Project>\r\n```\r\n\r\nAfter you've added the direct dependency reference, save your *csproj* file.\r\n\r\nIf you're using Visual Studio, save your updated *csproj* file and Visual Studio will restore the new package versions.\r\nYou can see the restore results by opening the **Output** window (Ctrl+Alt+O) and changing the **Show output from** drop-down list to **Package Manager**.\r\n\r\nIf you're not using Visual Studio, open a command line and change to your project directory. Execute the `dotnet restore` command to restore the new dependencies.\r\n\r\n#### Rebuilding your application\r\n\r\nFinally you must rebuild your application, test, and redeploy.\r\n\r\n## Other Information\r\n\r\n### Reporting Security Issues\r\n\r\nIf you have found a potential security issue in .NET Core, please email details to secure@microsoft.com.

These packages are decompressed upon installation of the .NET Core SDK. The packages are not currently included in ARM32 distributions due to the time and space cost to decompress the packages. Instead, they will be added to [.NET Core ARM32 Docker images](https://hub.docker.com/r/microsoft/dotnet/), where these costs can be paid as part of image creation.\r\n\r\nThese NuGet packages include content for two purposes:\r\n\r\n- Reference assemblies for .NET Core, for code compilation.\r\n- Pre-compiled assemblies (compiled with [crossgen](https://github.com/dotnet/coreclr/blob/master/Documentation/building/crossgen.md)) for .NET Core, for use in self-contained applications.\r\n\r\nIn both cases, the presence of these packages avoid the need to access remote NuGet feeds for .NET Core assemblies as part of package restore.\r\n\r\nThis change only affects [.NET Core 2.1 SDK ARM32 Docker images](https://hub.docker.com/r/microsoft/dotnet/).

This issue was resolved earlier this year, with the [May 2018 Preview of Quality Rollup](https://blogs.msdn.microsoft.com/dotnet/2018/05/15/net-framework-may-2018-preview-of-quality-rollup/). We recently learned that some applications, including Johnson Controls’ C-CURE 9000 Software, were negatively impacted by this change as this update requires all client and server workstations to be updated simultaneously with the appropriate Microsoft updates. The changes made to .NET Framework 4.7.1 were also integrated into .NET Framework 4.6 and later servicing releases. As a result, this advisory applies to .NET Framework 4.6 and later versions.\r\n\r\nThis advisory is provided so that developers can correctly diagnose this issue and be aware of our guidance. We will continue to update this issue as we have new information to share.\r\n\r\n## Discussion\r\n\r\nPlease share your thoughts on this change and see what others are saying at:\r\n\r\n* [microsoft/dotnet #832](https://github.com/Microsoft/dotnet/issues/832)\r\n\r\n## Guidance\r\n\r\nThis guidance only applies to customers that have experienced this issue.\r\n\r\nWe have released [an update for .NET Framework 4.6](https://blogs.msdn.microsoft.com/dotnet/2018/08/30/net-framework-august-2018-preview-of-quality-rollup/) and later that resolves the issue. **You must deploy the .NET Framework update for this issue to all .NET Framework 4.6+ machines that communicate via serialized objects**. After doing that, cross-machine serialization will work as expected. \r\n \r\nPlease consult your software vendor to understand if this impacts the software you are using.\r\n\r\n## Technical Context\r\n\r\nIn the [May 2018 Preview of Quality Rollup](https://blogs.msdn.microsoft.com/dotnet/2018/05/15/net-framework-may-2018-preview-of-quality-rollup/), we made a change to the internal type CultureAwareComparer to implement ISerializable. We made the change in order to address [issue with serializing/deserializing a CultureAwareComparer](https://github.com/Microsoft/dotnet/blob/master/releases/net471/KnownIssues/521954%20-%20BCL%20CultureAwareComparer%20with%20ignore%20casing%20on%20serialized%20on%20previous%20versions%20of%20.NET%20do%20not%20correctly%20deserialize%20on%20.NET%204.7.1.md).\r\n\r\nThe issue reported was that a type that contains an instance of CultureAwareComparer was not able to correctly serialize and deserialize across different versions of the .NET Framework. There are a few types in .NET Framework that do this, the most commonly impacted one being the Dictionary<TKey, TValue> type.\r\n \r\nThe change to implement the ISerializable interface had unintended side effects when exchanging this type across different machines. We have had a small number of reports from customers who have been affected.\r\n\r\nA common, but not unique way, of exchanging objects across machines is to use WCF in conjunction with a serializer. One of the common serializers being DataContractSerializer. The side-effect of the change prevented data serialized on systems where the type implements ISerializable to correctly deserialize of systems where the type does NOT implement ISerializable. The same is true of the opposite case, that systems where the type does not implement ISerializable will not correctly deserialize data from systems where the type does implement ISerializable.\r\n\r\nWe have an updated fix that we intend to release within the next month that will remove the implementation of the ISerializable interface on the type and use a different internal mechanism for ensuring the cross-version serialization continues to work as expected. This change addresses the break experienced with WCF.\r\n\r\nThe upcoming fix will remove the implementation of the ISerializable interface on the type and use a different mechanism for ensuring the cross-version serialization of that type continues to work.

It may print or log an error message similar to the following one:\r\n\r\n```\r\nThe formatter threw an exception while trying to deserialize the message: \r\nThere was an error while trying to deserialize parameter .

Debian Jessie is no longer a supported operating system for .NET Core. Docker users need to switch to Debian Stretch-based (AKA Debian 9) images to stay in support.\r\n\r\n## Discussion\r\n\r\nPlease share your thoughts on this change and see what others are saying at:\r\n\r\n* [dotnet/dotnet-docker #647](https://github.com/dotnet/dotnet-docker/issues/647)\r\n\r\n## Context\r\n\r\nJessie-based images are currently provided for .NET Core 1.0, 1.1 and 2.0. .NET Core 1.0 and 1.1 expose multi-arch tags, such as `1.0-runtime` and `1.1-sdk`, that support Debian Jessie. When pulled for a Linux Docker daemon (on Linux or Windows), these tags pull Jessie-based images. .NET Core 2.0 supports Jessie, but it is not the default. .NET Core 2.0 multi-arch tags, such as `2.0-runtime` and `2.0-sdk`, pull Debian Stretch-based images, when pulled for a Linux Docker daemon. We made a conscious decision with .NET Core 2.0 to move off of Jessie as the default to avoid this problem, based the Jessie 2018 EOL date. .NET Core 2.1 does not support Jessie, only Stretch.\r\n\r\nWe recently posted about our policy for underlying operating system dependencies with Docker:\r\n\r\n> For each major and minor .NET version, we may take a new major operating system version dependency. As I mentioned earlier, we adopted Debian 9 as the base image for .NET Core 2.0. We stayed with Debian 9 for .NET Core 2.1, since Debian 10 (AKA “Buster”) has not been released. Debian 9 will remain the default base image for .NET Core 2.1 for the life of .NET Core 2.1. **Once we adopt an underlying operating system major version, we will not change it for the life of that given .NET release.**\r\n\r\nSource: https://blogs.msdn.microsoft.com/dotnet/2018/06/18/staying-up-to-date-with-net-container-images/\r\n\r\n## Plan\r\n\r\nWe will continue to re-build .NET Core 1.0 and 1.1 multi-arch tags on top of Jessie for the remaining [supported lifetime of .NET Core 1.0 and 1.1](https://github.com/dotnet/core/blob/master/microsoft-support.md). We will also provide a Stretch-based image for .NET Core 1.1. This tag will look like the following: `1.1-runtime-stretch` or `1.1.9-sdk-stretch`. This is same format that Jessie has used.\r\n\r\nWe will produce Jessie-based images for NET Core 2.0 until October 2018, which is when [.NET Core 2.0 support ends](https://github.com/dotnet/core/blob/master/microsoft-support.md). .NET Core 2.0 multi-arch tags support Debian Stretch, not Jessie, as described above.\r\n\r\nIn summary, .NET Core is no longer supported on Debian Jessie, with Docker or otherwise. We will produce Docker images for Jessie until .NET Core 1.0, 1.1 and 2.0 support ends, respectively, to avoid breaking applications. This aligns with the policy defined above, per [Staying up-to-date with .NET Container Images](https://blogs.msdn.microsoft.com/dotnet/2018/06/18/staying-up-to-date-with-net-container-images/).\r\n\r\n## Affected Repos\r\n\r\n* [microsoft/dotnet](https://hub.docker.com/r/microsoft/dotnet/)\r\n* [microsoft/dotnet-nightly](https://hub.docker.com/r/microsoft/dotnet-nightly/)\r\n* [microsoft/aspnetcore](https://hub.docker.com/r/microsoft/aspnetcore/)\r\n* [microsoft/aspnetcore-build](https://hub.docker.com/r/microsoft/aspnetcore-build/)","Url":"https://github.com/dotnet/announcements/issues/78","RelatedDescription":"Open issue \"Debian Jessie End of Life -- Impact on .NET Core Docker Images\" (#78)"},{"Id":"345028102","IsPullRequest":false,"CreatedAt":"2018-07-26T22:31:32","Actor":"leecow","Number":"77","RawContent":null,"Title":"https://dot.net now using TLS 1.2-only","State":"open","Body":"Earlier today, https://dot.net switched to using TLS 1.2-only.

We have received multiple customer reports of [applications that fail to start or don't run correctly](https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/help/4345913) after installing the July 2018 update. These reports are specific to applications that initialize a COM component and run with restricted permissions.\r\n\r\nWe have stopped distributing the .NET Framework July 2018 updates on Windows Update and are actively working on fixing and re-shipping this month's updates. If you installed the July 2018 update and have not yet seen any negative behavior, we recommend that you leave your systems as-is but closely monitor them and ensure that you apply upcoming .NET Framework updates.\r\n\r\nAs a team, we regret that this release was shipped with this flaw. This release was tested using our regular and extensive testing process. We discovered while investigating this issue that we have a test hole for the specific combination of COM activation and restricted permissions, including impersonation.

They can be fixed by [editing the project file](#direct-dependencies) or using NuGet to update the dependency.\r\n\r\n The `System.Private.ServiceModel` package is not meant to be directly depended on and will not appear in your direct dependency list.\r\n\r\n#### Transitive dependencies\r\n\r\nTransitive dependencies occur when you add a package to your project that in turn relies on another package. For example, if Contoso publishes a package `Contoso.Utility` which, in turn, depends on `Contoso.Internals` and you add the `Contoso.Utility` package to your project now your project has a direct dependency on `Contoso.Utility` and, because `Contoso.Utility` depends 'Contoso.Internals', your application gains a transitive dependency on the `Contoso.Internals` package.\r\n\r\nTransitive dependencies are reviewable in three ways, depending on your [project format](#project-format):\r\n\r\n* In the Visual Studio Solution Explorer window, which supports searching.\r\n* By examining the `project.assets.json` file contained in the obj directory of your project for `csproj` based projects *OR*.\r\n* By examining the `project.lock.json` file contained in the root directory of your project for `project.json` based projects.\r\n\r\nThe `project.assets.json` and `project.lock.json` files are the authoritative list of all packages used by your project, containing both direct and transitive dependencies.\r\n\r\n#### <a name=\"direct-dependencies-vs2017\"></a>Fixing direct dependencies in a csproj based project / Visual Studio 2017\r\n\r\nOpen *projectname.csproj* in your editor. If you're using Visual Studio, right-click the project and choose **Edit projectname.csproj** from the context menu, where projectname is the name of your project. Look for `PackageReference` elements. The following shows an example project file:\r\n\r\n```xml\r\n<Project Sdk=\"Microsoft.NET.Sdk.Web\">\r\n  <PropertyGroup>\r\n    <TargetFramework>netcoreapp2.0</TargetFramework>\r\n  </PropertyGroup>\r\n  <ItemGroup>\r\n    <PackageReference Include=\"System.ServiceModel.Http\" Version=\"4.4.0\" />\r\n  </ItemGroup>\r\n</Project>\r\n```\r\n\r\nThe preceding example has a reference to the [vulnerable package](#affected-software), as seen by the single `PackageReference` element. The name of the package is in the `Include` attribute.\r\nThe package version number is in the `Version` attribute. The previous example shows a single direct dependency on `System.ServiceModel.Http` version 4.4.0.\r\n\r\nTo update the version to the secure package, change the version number to the updated package version as listed on the table [previously](#affected-software).\r\nIn this example, update `System.ServiceModel.Http` to the appropriate [fixed package number](#affected-software) for your major version. Save the *csproj* file. The example *csproj* now looks as follows:\r\n\r\n```xml\r\n<Project Sdk=\"Microsoft.NET.Sdk.Web\">\r\n  <PropertyGroup>\r\n    <TargetFramework>netcoreapp2.0</TargetFramework>\r\n  </PropertyGroup>\r\n  <ItemGroup>\r\n    <PackageReference Include=\"System.ServiceModel.Http\" Version=\"4.4.3\" />\r\n  </ItemGroup>\r\n</Project>\r\n```\r\n\r\nIf you're using Visual Studio and you save your updated *csproj* file, Visual Studio will restore the new package version.\r\nYou can see the restore results by opening the **Output** window (Ctrl+Alt+O) and changing the **Show output from** drop-down list to **Package Manager**.\r\n\r\nIf you're not using Visual Studio, open a command line and change to your project directory. Execute the `dotnet restore` command to restore the updated dependencies.\r\n\r\nNow recompile your application. If after recompilation you see a *Dependency conflict warning*, you must update your other direct dependencies to versions that take a dependency on the updated package.\r\n\r\n#### <a name=\"direct-dependencies-vs2015\"></a> Fixing Direct Dependencies in project.json based project / Visual Studio 2015\r\n\r\nOpen your `project.json` file in your editor. Look for the dependencies section. Below is an example dependencies section:\r\n\r\n``` json\r\n    \"dependencies\": {\r\n      \"Microsoft.NETCore.App\": {\r\n        \"version\": \"1.0.1\",\r\n        \"type\": \"platform\"\r\n      },\r\n     \"Microsoft.AspNetCore.Mvc.Core\": \"1.0.6\",\r\n     \"System.ServiceModel.Http\" : \"4.0.0\"\r\n    }\r\n```\r\n\r\nThis example has three direct dependencies: `Microsoft.NETCore.App`, `Microsoft.AspNetCore.Mvc.Core` and `System.ServiceModel.Http`.\r\n\r\n`Microsoft.NetCore.App` is the platform the application targets, you should ignore this. The other packages expose their version to the right of the package name. In our example, our non-platform packages are version 1.0.1.\r\n\r\nReview your direct dependencies for any instance of the packages and versions listed above. In the example above, there is a direct dependency on a vulnerable package, `System.ServiceModel.Http` version 4.4.0.\r\n\r\nTo update to the fixed package, change the version number to be the appropriate package for your release. In the example, this would be updating `System.ServiceModel.Http` to 4.4.3.\r\n\r\nAfter updating the vulnerable package versions, save your `project.json` file.\r\n\r\nThe dependencies section in our example `project.json` would now look as follows:\r\n\r\n```json\r\n  \"dependencies\": {\r\n    \"Microsoft.NETCore.App\": {\r\n      \"version\": \"1.0.1\",\r\n      \"type\": \"platform\"\r\n    },\r\n    \"Microsoft.AspNetCore.Mvc.Core\": \"1.0.6\",\r\n    \"System.ServiceModel.Http \": \"4.4.3\"\r\n  }\r\n```\r\n\r\nIf you are using Visual Studio and save your updated `project.json` file, Visual Studio will restore the new package version. You can see the restore results by opening the Output Window (Ctrl+Alt+O) and changing the Show output from drop-down list to Package Manager.\r\n\r\nIf you are not using Visual Studio, open a command line and change to your project directory. Execute the `dotnet restore` command to restore your new dependency.\r\n\r\nAfter you have addressed all of your direct dependencies, you must also review your transitive dependencies.\r\n\r\nAfter you've addressed all of your direct dependencies, you must review your transitive dependencies.\r\n\r\n#### Discovering and fixing transitive dependencies\r\n\r\nThere are two ways to view transitive dependencies. You can either [use Visual Studio’s Solution Explorer](#vs-solution-explorer), or you can review [the `project.assets.json` file](#project-assets-json) or the [the `project.lock.json` file](#project-lock-json).\r\n\r\n##### <a name=\"vs-solution-explorer\"></a>Using Visual Studio Solution Explorer\r\n\r\nTo use Solution Explorer, open the project in Visual Studio, and then press Ctrl+; to activate the search in Solution Explorer. Search for the [vulnerable package](#affected-software) and make a note of the version numbers of any results you find.\r\n\r\nFor example, searching for `Microsoft.AspNetCore.Mvc.Core` in an example project that contains a package that takes a dependency on `Microsoft.AspNetCore.Mvc` shows the following results in Visual Studio 2017:\r\n\r\n![Screenshot of search results in Visual Studio 2017](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/796298/25858816/8ecdc2b4-3491-11e7-9363-746804bb9832.png)\r\n\r\nThe search results appear as a tree. In the previous results, you can see that a reference to `Microsoft.AspNetCore.Mvc.Core` version 1.1.2 is discovered.\r\n\r\nUnder the Dependencies node is a NuGet node. Under the NuGet node is the list of packages you have directly taken a dependency on and their versions.\r\nIn screenshot, the application takes a direct dependency on `Microsoft.AspNetCore.Mvc`. `Microsoft.AspNetCore.Mvc` in turn has leaf nodes that list its dependencies and their versions.\r\nThe `Microsoft.AspNetCore.Mvc` package takes a dependency on a version of `Microsoft.AspNetCore.Mvc.ApiExplorer`, that in turn takes a dependency on a version of `Microsoft.AspNetCore.Mvc.Core`.\r\n\r\n##### <a name=\"project-assets-json\"></a> Manually reviewing project.assets.json (csproj/VS2017)\r\n\r\nOpen the *project.assets.json* file from your project’s obj directory in your editor. We suggest you use an editor that understands JSON and allows you to collapse and expand nodes to review this file.\r\nVisual Studio and Visual Studio Code provide JSON friendly editing.\r\n\r\nSearch the *project.assets.json* file for the [vulnerable package](#affected-software), using the format `packagename/` for each of the package names from the preceding table. If you find the assembly name in your search:\r\n\r\n* Examine the line on which they are found, the version number is after the `/`.\r\n* Compare to the [vulnerable versions table](#affected-software).\r\n\r\nFor example, a search result that shows `System.ServiceModel.Http/4.3.0` is a reference to version 4.3.0 of `System.ServiceModel.Http`.\r\n\r\nIf your *project.assets.json* file includes references to the [vulnerable package](#affected-software), then you need to fix the transitive dependencies.\r\n\r\nIf you have not found any reference to any vulnerable packages, this means either\r\n\r\n* None of your direct dependencies depend on any vulnerable packages, or\r\n* You have already fixed the problem by updating the direct dependencies.\r\n\r\nIf your transitive dependency review found references to the [vulnerable package](#affected-software), you must add a direct dependency to the updated package to your *csproj* file to override the transitive dependency.\r\n\r\nOpen *projectname.csproj* in your editor. If you're using Visual Studio, right-click the project and choose **Edit projectname.csproj** from the context menu, where projectname is the name of your project.\r\nLook for `PackageReference` nodes, for example:\r\n\r\n```xml\r\n<Project Sdk=\"Microsoft.NET.Sdk.\">\r\n  <PropertyGroup>\r\n    <TargetFramework>net461</TargetFramework>\r\n  </PropertyGroup>\r\n  <ItemGroup>\r\n    <PackageReference Include=\"ThirdParty.NotUpdatedYet\" Version=\"2.0.0\" />\r\n  </ItemGroup>\r\n</Project>\r\n```\r\n\r\nYou must add a direct dependency to the updated version of the [vulnerable package](#affected-software) by adding it to the *csproj* file.\r\nYou do this by adding a new line to the dependencies section, referencing the fixed version.\r\nFor example, if your search showed a transitive reference to a vulnerable `System.ServiceModel.Http` version, you'd add a reference to the [fixed package number](#affected-software).\r\n\r\n```xml\r\n<Project Sdk=\"Microsoft.NET.Sdk.Web\">\r\n  <PropertyGroup>\r\n    <TargetFramework>net461</TargetFramework>\r\n  </PropertyGroup>\r\n  <ItemGroup>\r\n    <PackageReference Include=\"System.ServiceModel.Http\" Version=\"4.3.2\" />\r\n    <PackageReference Include=\"ThirdParty.NotUpdatedYet\" Version=\"2.0.0\" />\r\n  </ItemGroup>\r\n</Project>\r\n```\r\n\r\nAfter you've added the direct dependency reference, save your *csproj* file.\r\n\r\nIf you're using Visual Studio, save your updated *csproj* file and Visual Studio will restore the new package versions.\r\nYou can see the restore results by opening the **Output** window (Ctrl+Alt+O) and changing the **Show output from** drop-down list to **Package Manager**.\r\n\r\nIf you're not using Visual Studio, open a command line and change to your project directory. Execute the `dotnet restore` command to restore the new dependencies.\r\n\r\n##### <a name=\"project-lock-json\"></a> Manually reviewing project.lock.json (project.json/VS2015)\r\n\r\nOpen the `project.lock.json` file in your editor. We suggest you use an editor that understands json and allows you to collapse and expand nodes to review this file; both Visual Studio and Visual Studio Code provide this functionality.\r\n\r\nIf you are using Visual Studio the `project.lock.json` file is “under” the `project.json` file. Click the right pointing triangle, ▷, to the left of the `project.json` file to expand the solution tree to expose the `project.lock.json` file. The following image shows a project with the `project.json` file expanded to show the `project.lock.json` file.\r\n\r\n![project lock json](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/796298/25858179/f6e01200-348f-11e7-8a77-7176d8dd3f03.png)\r\n\r\nSearch the `project.lock.json` file for the vulnerable packages, using the format `packagename/`, using each of the package names from the table above. If you find any vulnerable assembly name in your search examine the line on which they are found, the version number is after the `/` and compare to the vulnerable versions table above. For example a search result that shows `System.ServiceModel.Http/4.0.1` is a reference to v4.0.1 of `System.ServiceModel.Http`.   If your `project.lock.json` file includes references to any of the package versions shown above then you will need to fix the transitive dependencies.\r\n\r\nIf you have not found any reference to a vulnerable version of `System.ServiceModel.Http` this means none of your direct dependencies depend on any vulnerable packages or you have already fixed the problem by updating the direct dependencies.\r\n\r\nIf your transitive dependency review found references to any of the vulnerable packages you must add a direct dependency to the updated package to your `project.json` file to override the transitive dependency. Open your `project.json` and find the dependencies section. For example:\r\n\r\n``` json\r\n  \"dependencies\": {\r\n    \"Microsoft.NETCore.App\": {\r\n      \"version\": \"1.0.1\",\r\n      \"type\": \"platform\"\r\n    },\r\n    \"Microsoft.AspNetCore.Mvc\": \"1.0.0\"\r\n  }\r\n```\r\n\r\nFor each of the vulnerable packages your search returned you must add a direct dependency to the updated version by adding it to the `project.json` file. You do this by adding a new line to the dependencies section, referring the fixed version. For example, if your search showed a transitive reference to the vulnerable `System.ServiceModel.Http` version 1.0.0 you would add a reference to the appropriate fixed version, 1.0.6. Edit the `project.json` file as follows:\r\n\r\n``` json\r\n  \"dependencies\": {\r\n    \"Microsoft.NETCore.App\": {\r\n      \"version\": \"1.0.1\",\r\n      \"type\": \"platform\"\r\n    },\r\n    \"System.ServiceModel.Http\": \"4.1.2\",\r\n    \"Microsoft.AspNetCore.Mvc\": \"1.0.0\"\r\n  }\r\n```\r\n\r\nAfter you have added direct dependencies to the fixed packages, save your `project.json` file.\r\n\r\nIf you are using Visual Studio save your updated `project.json` file and Visual Studio will restore the new package versions. You can see the restore results by opening the Output Window (Ctrl+Alt+O) and changing the Show output from drop-down list to Package Manager.\r\n\r\nIf you are not using Visual Studio open a command line and change to your project directory. Execute the `dotnet restore` command to restore your new dependencies.\r\n\r\n#### Rebuilding your application\r\n\r\nFinally you must rebuild your application, test, and redeploy.\r\n\r\n## Other Information\r\n\r\n### Reporting Security Issues\r\n\r\nIf you have found a potential security issue in .NET Core, please email details to secure@microsoft.com.

Co-location of images improves image discovery. The .NET Core runtime and SDK images are already co-located. We are adding the ASP.NET Core runtime images to the [microsoft/dotnet](https://hub.docker.com/r/microsoft/dotnet/) repo as a third image type. We are [no longer producing the microsoft/aspnetcore-build image](https://github.com/aspnet/Announcements/issues/298) with .NET Core 2.1.\r\n\r\nThe following three tags are now available at the [microsoft/dotnet](https://hub.docker.com/r/microsoft/dotnet/) repo:\r\n\r\n* `2.1-sdk`\r\n* `2.1-aspnetcore-runtime`\r\n* `2.1-runtime`\r\n\r\n### Environment variables enable new scenarios\r\n\r\nWe added a set of environment variables to .NET Core docker images, for .NET Core 2.1 and later. These environment variables enable more scenarios to work without additional configuration, such as [developing ASP.NET Core applications in a container](https://github.com/dotnet/dotnet-docker/blob/master/samples/aspnetapp/aspnet-docker-dev-in-container.md).\r\n\r\nNew sdk image environment variables ([example](https://github.com/dotnet/dotnet-docker/blob/master/2.1/sdk/bionic/amd64/Dockerfile#L28-L32))\r\n* `ASPNETCORE_URLS=http://+:80`\r\n* `DOTNET_RUNNING_IN_CONTAINER=true`\r\n* `DOTNET_USE_POLLING_FILE_WATCHER=true`\r\n\r\nNew Linux runtime-deps image environment variables ([example](https://github.com/dotnet/dotnet-docker/blob/master/2.1/runtime-deps/alpine3.7/amd64/Dockerfile#L19-L21))\r\n* `ASPNETCORE_URLS=http://+:80`\r\n* `DOTNET_RUNNING_IN_CONTAINER=true`\r\n\r\nNew Windows runtime image environment variables ([example](https://github.com/dotnet/dotnet-docker/blob/master/2.1/runtime/nanoserver-1709/amd64/Dockerfile#L33-L35))\r\n* `ASPNETCORE_URLS=http://+:80`\r\n* `DOTNET_RUNNING_IN_CONTAINER=true`\r\n\r\n### New image variants\r\n\r\nAlpine and ARM32 image variants have been added and are supported as part of the .NET Core 2.1 release. \r\n\r\nFor Alpine, you must [use specific tags to create Alpine-based images](https://github.com/dotnet/dotnet-docker/blob/master/samples/dotnetapp/README.md#build-and-run-the-sample-for-alpine-with-docker), such as `2.1-runtime-alpine`. \r\n\r\nFor ARM32, you can use the regular multi-arch tags, like `2.1-runtime` and `2.1-sdk` if you are building on an ARM32 device. If you are building on another type of machine, you need to use ARM32-specific tags for the runtime images you create, such as `2.1-runtime-bionic-arm32v7` (for Ubuntu 18.04).\r\n\r\n### Related repos\r\n\r\nThe following repos are related to this announcement:\r\n\r\n* [microsoft/aspnetcore](https://hub.docker.com/r/microsoft/aspnetcore/)\r\n* [microsoft/aspnetcore-build](https://hub.docker.com/r/microsoft/aspnetcore-build/)\r\n* [microsoft/dotnet/](https://hub.docker.com/r/microsoft/dotnet/)\r\n","Url":"https://github.com/dotnet/announcements/issues/71","RelatedDescription":"Open issue \".NET Core 2.1 Docker Image Updates\" (#71)"},{"Id":"325815293","IsPullRequest":false,"CreatedAt":"2018-05-23T18:04:46","Actor":"mlacouture","Number":"70","RawContent":null,"Title":"Introducing dotnet-svcutil","State":"open","Body":"# Introducing dotnet-svcutil\r\n\r\nThe Microsoft Windows Communication Foundation (WCF) **dotnet-svcutil** tool is a .NET Core CLI tool that retrieves metadata from a web service on a network location or from a WSDL file, and generates a WCF class containing client proxy methods that you can use to access the web service operations.\r\n\r\nSimilarly to the [Service Model Metadata - svcutil](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/framework/wcf/servicemodel-metadata-utility-tool-svcutil-exe) tool for .NET Framework projects, the **dotnet-svcutil** is a command line tool for generating a web service reference compatible with .NET Core and .NET Standard projects. \r\n\r\nThe **dotnet-svcutil** tool is an alternative option to the [WCF Web Service Reference ](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/core/additional-tools/wcf-web-service-reference-guide)Visual Studio connected service provider which first shipped with Visual Studio 2017 v15.5.

This advisory also provides guidance on what developers can do to update their applications to remove this vulnerability.\r\n\r\nMicrosoft is aware of a denial of service vulnerability that exists when .NET Framework and .NET Core improperly process XML documents. An attacker who successfully exploited this vulnerability could cause a denial of service against a .NET Framework, .NET Core, or .NET native application.\r\n\r\nThe update addresses the vulnerability by correcting how .NET Framework, .NET Core, and .NET native applications handle XML document processing.\r\n\r\nIf your application is an ASP.NET Core application, developers are also advised to update to [ASP.NET Core 2.0.8](https://www.nuget.org/packages/Microsoft.AspNetCore.All/2.0.8).\r\n\r\n## Discussion\r\n\r\nDiscussion for this issue can be found at https://github.com/dotnet/corefx/issues/29578\r\n\r\n### <a name=\"mitigation-factors\"></a>Mitigation factors\r\n\r\n* If an application does not process signed XML, it is not affected by this vulnerability.\r\n* If your application targets .NET Core 1.x or .NET native 1.x, it is not affected as the vulnerable package is not available for these platforms.\r\n\r\n## <a name=\"affected-software\"></a>Affected software\r\n\r\nAny .NET Core, .NET native, or ASP.NET Core based application that uses System.Security.Cryptography.Xml with a version of 4.4.1 or earlier.\r\n\r\nPackage name | Vulnerable versions | Secure versions\r\n------------ | ---------------- | -------------------------\r\nSystem.Security.Cryptography.Xml | ≤4.4.1 |  4.4.2 or later\r\n\r\n## <a name=\"advisory-faq\"></a>Advisory FAQ\r\n### <a name=\"how-affected\"></a>How do I know if I am affected?\r\n\r\n.NET Core has two types of dependencies: direct and transitive. Direct dependencies are dependencies where you specifically add a package to your project, transitive dependencies occur when you add a package to your project that in turn relies on another package.\r\n\r\nFor example, the `Microsoft.AspNetCore.Mvc` package depends on the `Microsoft.AspNetCore.Mvc.Core` package. When you add a dependency on `Microsoft.AspNetCore.Mvc` in your project, you're taking a transitive dependency on `Microsoft.AspNetCore.Mvc.Core`.\r\n\r\nAny application that has a direct or transitive dependency on the [affected package](#affected-software) can be exposed to the vulnerability if it does not meet any of the [mitigation factors](#mitigation-factors).\r\n\r\n### <a name=\"how-fix\"></a>How do I fix the issue?\r\n---\r\n\r\nIf you're targeting ASP.NET Core 2.0 and using the `Microsoft.AspNetCore.All` metapackage:\r\n\r\n* Update its version number to [2.0.8](https://www.nuget.org/packages/Microsoft.AspNetCore.All/2.0.8) to pull in updated packages that update their transitive dependencies to the fixed version of `System.Security.Cryptography.Xml`.\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n.NET Core projects have two types of dependencies: direct and transitive. You must update your projects using the following instructions to address both types of dependency.\r\n\r\n#### Direct dependencies\r\n\r\nDirect dependencies are discoverable by examining your *csproj* file. They can be fixed by [editing the csproj file](#direct-dependencies) or using NuGet to update the dependency.\r\n\r\n#### Transitive dependencies\r\n\r\nTransitive dependencies occur when you add a package to your project that in turn relies on another package. For example, if Contoso publishes a package `Contoso.Utility` which, in turn, depends on `Contoso.Internals` and you add the `Contoso.Utility` package to your project now your project has a direct dependency on `Contoso.Utility` and, because `Contoso.Utility` depends 'Contoso.Internals', your application gains a transitive dependency on the `Contoso.Internals` package.\r\n\r\nTransitive dependencies are reviewable in two ways:\r\n\r\n* In the Visual Studio Solution Explorer window, which supports searching.\r\n* By examining the *project.assets.json* file contained in the obj directory of your project.\r\n\r\nThe *project.assets.json* files are the authoritative list of all packages used by your project, containing both direct and transitive dependencies.\r\n\r\n#### <a name=\"direct-dependencies\"></a>Fixing direct dependencies\r\n\r\nOpen *projectname.csproj* in your editor. If you're using Visual Studio, right-click the project and choose **Edit projectname.csproj** from the context menu, where projectname is the name of your project. Look for `PackageReference` elements. The following shows an example project file:\r\n\r\n```xml\r\n<Project Sdk=\"Microsoft.NET.Sdk\">\r\n  <PropertyGroup>\r\n    <TargetFramework>netcoreapp2.0</TargetFramework>\r\n  </PropertyGroup>\r\n  <ItemGroup>\r\n    <PackageReference Include=\"System.Security.Cryptography.Xml\" Version=\"4.4.1\" />\r\n  </ItemGroup>\r\n</Project>\r\n```\r\n\r\nThe preceding example has a reference to the [vulnerable package](#affected-software), as seen by the single `PackageReference` element. The name of the package is in the `Include` attribute.\r\nThe package version number is in the `Version` attribute. The previous example shows a single direct dependency on `System.Security.Cryptography.Xml` version 4.4.1.\r\n\r\nTo update the version to the secure package, change the version number to the updated package version as listed on the table [previously](#affected-software).\r\nIn this example, update `System.Security.Cryptography.Xml` to a [fixed package number](#affected-software). Save the *csproj* file. The example *csproj* now looks as follows:\r\n\r\n```xml\r\n<Project Sdk=\"Microsoft.NET.Sdk\">\r\n  <PropertyGroup>\r\n    <TargetFramework>netcoreapp2.0</TargetFramework>\r\n  </PropertyGroup>\r\n  <ItemGroup>\r\n    <PackageReference Include=\"System.Security.Cryptography.Xml\" Version=\"4.4.2\" />\r\n  </ItemGroup>\r\n</Project>\r\n```\r\n\r\nIf you're using Visual Studio and you save your updated *csproj* file, Visual Studio will restore the new package version.\r\nYou can see the restore results by opening the **Output** window (Ctrl+Alt+O) and changing the **Show output from** drop-down list to **Package Manager**.\r\n\r\nIf you're not using Visual Studio, open a command line and change to your project directory. Execute the `dotnet restore` command to restore the updated dependencies.\r\n\r\nNow recompile your application. If after recompilation you see a *Dependency conflict warning*, you must update your other direct dependencies to versions that take a dependency on the updated package.\r\n\r\nAfter you've addressed all of your direct dependencies, you must review your transitive dependencies.\r\n\r\n#### Discovering and fixing transitive dependencies\r\n\r\nThere are two ways to view transitive dependencies. You can either [use Visual Studio’s Solution Explorer](#vs-solution-explorer), or you can [review the *project.assets.json* file](#project-assets-json).\r\n\r\n##### <a name=\"vs-solution-explorer\"></a>Using Visual Studio Solution Explorer\r\n\r\nTo use Solution Explorer, open the project in Visual Studio 2017, and then press Ctrl+; to activate the search in Solution Explorer. Search for the [vulnerable package](#affected-software) and make a note of the version numbers of any results you find.\r\n\r\nFor example, searching for `Microsoft.AspNetCore.Mvc.Core` in an example project that contains a package that takes a dependency on `Microsoft.AspNetCore.Mvc` shows the following results in Visual Studio 2017:\r\n\r\n![Screenshot of search results in Visual Studio 2017](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/796298/25858816/8ecdc2b4-3491-11e7-9363-746804bb9832.png)\r\n\r\nThe search results appear as a tree. In the previous results, you can see that a reference to `Microsoft.AspNetCore.Mvc.Core` version 1.1.2 is discovered.\r\n\r\nUnder the Dependencies node is a NuGet node. Under the NuGet node is the list of packages you have directly taken a dependency on and their versions.\r\nIn screenshot, the application takes a direct dependency on `Microsoft.AspNetCore.Mvc`. `Microsoft.AspNetCore.Mvc` in turn has leaf nodes that list its dependencies and their versions.\r\nThe `Microsoft.AspNetCore.Mvc` package takes a dependency on a version of `Microsoft.AspNetCore.Mvc.ApiExplorer`, that in turn takes a dependency on a version of `Microsoft.AspNetCore.Mvc.Core`.\r\n\r\n##### <a name=\"project-assets-json\"></a>Manually reviewing project.assets.json\r\n\r\nOpen the *project.assets.json* file from your project’s obj directory in your editor. We suggest you use an editor that understands JSON and allows you to collapse and expand nodes to review this file.\r\nVisual Studio and Visual Studio Code provide JSON friendly editing.\r\n\r\nSearch the *project.assets.json* file for the [vulnerable package](#affected-software), using the format `packagename/` for each of the package names from the preceding table. If you find the assembly name in your search:\r\n\r\n* Examine the line on which they are found, the version number is after the `/`.\r\n* Compare to the [vulnerable versions table](#affected-software).\r\n\r\nFor example, a search result that shows `System.Security.Cryptography.Xml/4.4.0` is a reference to version 4.4.0 of `System.Security.Cryptography.Xml`.\r\nIf your *project.assets.json* file includes references to the [vulnerable package](#affected-software), then you need to fix the transitive dependencies.\r\n\r\n##### Fixing transitive dependencies\r\n\r\nIf you have not found any reference to any vulnerable packages, this means either\r\n\r\n* None of your direct dependencies depend on any vulnerable packages, or\r\n* You have already fixed the problem by updating the direct dependencies.\r\n\r\nIf your transitive dependency review found references to the [vulnerable package](#affected-software), you must add a direct dependency to the updated package to your *csproj* file to override the transitive dependency.\r\n\r\nOpen *projectname.csproj* in your editor. If you're using Visual Studio, right-click the project and choose **Edit projectname.csproj** from the context menu, where projectname is the name of your project.\r\nLook for `PackageReference` nodes, for example:\r\n\r\n```xml\r\n<Project Sdk=\"Microsoft.NET.Sdk.\">\r\n  <PropertyGroup>\r\n    <TargetFramework>net461</TargetFramework>\r\n  </PropertyGroup>\r\n  <ItemGroup>\r\n    <PackageReference Include=\"ThirdParty.NotUpdatedYet\" Version=\"2.0.0\" />\r\n  </ItemGroup>\r\n</Project>\r\n```\r\n\r\nYou must add a direct dependency to the updated version of the [vulnerable package](#affected-software) by adding it to the *csproj* file.\r\nYou do this by adding a new line to the dependencies section, referencing the fixed version.\r\nFor example, if your search showed a transitive reference to a vulnerable `System.Security.Cryptography.Xml` version, you'd add a reference to the [fixed package number](#affected-software).\r\n\r\n```xml\r\n<Project Sdk=\"Microsoft.NET.Sdk.Web\">\r\n  <PropertyGroup>\r\n    <TargetFramework>net461</TargetFramework>\r\n  </PropertyGroup>\r\n  <ItemGroup>\r\n    <PackageReference Include=\"System.Security.Cryptography.Xml\" Version=\"4.4.2\" />\r\n    <PackageReference Include=\"ThirdParty.NotUpdatedYet\" Version=\"2.0.0\" />\r\n  </ItemGroup>\r\n</Project>\r\n```\r\n\r\nAfter you've added the direct dependency reference, save your *csproj* file.\r\n\r\nIf you're using Visual Studio, save your updated *csproj* file and Visual Studio will restore the new package versions.\r\nYou can see the restore results by opening the **Output** window (Ctrl+Alt+O) and changing the **Show output from** drop-down list to **Package Manager**.\r\n\r\nIf you're not using Visual Studio, open a command line and change to your project directory. Execute the `dotnet restore` command to restore the new dependencies.\r\n\r\n#### Rebuilding your application\r\n\r\nFinally you must rebuild your application, test, and redeploy.\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\nIf you're targeting .NET native for a Universal Windows Platform (UWP) application, you should update your dependencies and republish your application.\r\n\r\nIf you submit an application to the Windows Store with an outdated reference, the store will update the reference automatically, which has the potential for compatibility issues. Thus, we recommend updating your application directly and testing its functionality before resubmitting.\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n## Other Information\r\n\r\n### Reporting Security Issues\r\n\r\nIf you have found a potential security issue in .NET Core, please email details to secure@microsoft.com.
