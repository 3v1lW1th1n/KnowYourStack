On top of that, the actual delete sign is just 50% wide, so in fact the variable is misleading.\r\n\r\n### Steps to Reproduce\r\nSet the `$modal-close-dimensions` variable to anything above 20px and the button will not change size.\r\n\r\n### Expected behavior\r\nThe close button should have the variable set size. \r\n\r\n### Actual behavior\r\nThe close button size does cannot exceed 20px.","Url":"https://github.com/jgthms/bulma/issues/2494","RelatedDescription":"Open issue \"Modal close button variable ($modal-close-dimensions) does not change the size\" (#2494)"},{"Id":"447322550","IsPullRequest":false,"CreatedAt":"2019-05-22T20:14:17","Actor":"amir20","Number":"2493","RawContent":null,"Title":"Version 0.7.5 breaks navbar at 1024px width","State":"open","Body":"<!-- PLEASE READ THE FOLLOWING INSTRUCTIONS -->\r\n\r\n<!-- Choose one of the following: -->\r\nThis is about **Bulma**.\r\n\r\n### Overview of the problem\r\nWhen upgrading from version 0.7.4 to 0.7.5, the navbar no longer shows the burger at 1024px.
