At any moment of the time, only one such block must be visible. I don't think using `v-if` or `is` is a good idea in my case, as recreating such blocks is rather expensive. I decided to use `v-show` instead, but I've noticed that inner components are still being updated on every block (even hidden). Even worse, some of these updates are very computational heavy, so my app is basically wasting CPU clocks on updating hidden elements.\r\n\r\nSimplified example:\r\n\r\n```js\r\n<div id=\"test\" v-show=\"visible\"><p>Number {{ number }}<p></div>\r\n```\r\n\r\n```js\r\nvar vm = new Vue({\r\n    el: '#test',\r\n    data: {\r\n        number: 0,\r\n        visible: true\r\n    }\r\n});\r\n\r\nsetInterval(function() {\r\n    vm.number  ;\r\n}, 10);\r\n```\r\n\r\nHere `<p>` will still be updated even if `visible` is `false`.\r\n\r\n### What does the proposed API look like?\r\nEither make this behavior default or add some attribute to control it (something like `v-freeze`).\r\n\r\n<!-- generated by vue-issues.

I know this will not be merged, in fact I'm gonna close it myself. But I'm publishing this PR for reference for anyone else interested.\r\n\r\nThe initial need was for components, but when reviewing the code I thought the most elegant way to do this was by changing the `resolveAsset()` function to call a user function defined on the `$options` object:\r\n\r\n```\r\ngetComponent(id: string, identifierSpellings: Object): void | Component | AsyncComponent\r\ngetDirective(id: string, identifierSpellings: Object): void | Directive\r\ngetFilter(id: string, identifiesSpellings: Object): void | Filter\r\n```\r\n\r\nThe `identifierSpellings` object has normalized spellings in case the user needs it:\r\n\r\n- raw: the way it was called\r\n- hyphenated\r\n- camelized\r\n- PascalCase\r\n- and a toString() method, which returns the raw version\r\n\r\nThe nice thing about this is that it gives all the power to the user, and enables him to do many things which aren't possible with the current api, and the biggest use case is to **lazily load async components only when they are needed.**\r\n\r\nI know that to submit a decent PR, I'd still need to write tests and documentation... that is the next step.\r\n\r\nA running example can be seen here:\r\n\r\nhttps://unpkg.com/@arijs/vue-generator@0.1.4/outra/pagina/\r\n\r\nMy version is released at:\r\nhttps://unpkg.com/@arijs/vue@2.5.17-beta1.0/\r\nhttps://www.npmjs.com/package/@arijs/vue","Url":"https://github.com/vuejs/vue/pull/8807","RelatedDescription":"Closed or merged PR \"Lazy load for components, filters and directives (fix #8106)\" (#8807)"},{"Id":"360883370","IsPullRequest":false,"CreatedAt":"2018-09-17T17:40:14","Actor":"lichenhao","Number":"8806","RawContent":null,"Title":"vue router lost meta config","State":"closed","Body":"### Version\r\n2.5.17\r\n\r\n### Reproduction link\r\n[https://jsbin.com/sazujuxoba/edit?html,output](https://jsbin.com/sazujuxoba/edit?html,output)\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n### Steps to reproduce\r\ninstall vue@2.5.17\r\ninstall vue-router@3.0.1\r\ndefine a router with meta info\r\ndefine the beforeEach callback and the to.meta is an empty object.\r\n\r\n\r\n### What is expected?\r\nto.meta should be the current definition object \r\n\r\n### What is actually happening?\r\nit's an empty object here. \r\n\r\n---\r\nand the beforeRouteEnter hook not trigger.\r\n\r\n<!-- generated by vue-issues.

Number should be blank and the type undefined.\r\n\r\nClick the button to switch pages but set the number to 10. The number is set and the type is number.\r\n\r\nYou can also confirm that the param is being set in the URL bar.\r\n\r\nNow reload the page (or copy the URL and load it in a fresh tab). The number will be set and display correctly, but the type will be string. You can confirm this in the Vue devtools.\r\n\r\n### What is expected?\r\nOn a fresh load or reload, the type of the \"number\" param should be the same as it was when it was set by Vue. The type should be number.\r\n\r\n### What is actually happening?\r\nOn reload, the type changes to string.\r\n\r\n---\r\nFrankly I don't care which type vue router gives to me. I would prefer the parsing happens automatically, so I get a number, but if I know I'll get a string, I can always call parseInt myself. The important thing is that there is no difference in types between loading from another page vs loading for the first time from a URL. With many more query params of different types it is a pain (and code bloat) to handle the case where any of them can come in as a string or as the expected type.\r\n\r\n<!-- generated by vue-issues.

It provides a few code snippets and assumes you'll understand. The documentation has been the biggest source of my frustration while using Vue since it never actually explains anything.\r\n\r\nFor example, on the Vuex installation page, sandwiched between CDN/package manager installation and building from source, you've put that Vuex needs to be instantiated in a module set up. You've provided zero context for this. Is this in the store? Is this for every file you need to access the store in? More importantly, it shouldn't be on the installation page, let alone sandwiched in between different installation methods. Vue's documentation is riddled with these issues. Unfortunately, I still don't actually know enough about how Vue actually works to be able to contribute to the documentation in any way. If I didn't have to use Vue for the project I am on, I would be using React, Redux, & RxJs and have access to meaningful, better written documentation that bothers to walk you through the set up. If Vue actually wants to gain any real traction, you're going to need to actually show folks how to use and set up your tools.\r\n\r\n<!-- generated by vue-issues.
