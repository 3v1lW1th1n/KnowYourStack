Occasionally, expressions in the program\r\nfor which metadata is extracted may contain sub-expressions which are not\r\nrepresentable in metadata. One such construct is an arrow function.\r\n\r\nThe compiler does not always need to understand such expressions completely.\r\nFor example, for a provider defined with `useValue`, the compiler does not\r\nneed to understand the value at all, only the outer provider definition. In\r\nthis case, the compiler employs a technique known as \"expression lowering\",\r\nwhere it rewrites the provider expression into one that can be represented\r\nin metadata. Chiefly, this involves extracting out the dynamic part (the\r\n`useValue` expression) into an exported constant.\r\n\r\nLowering is applied through a heuristic, which considers the containing\r\nstatement as well as the field name of the expression.\r\n\r\nPreviously, this heuristic was not completely accurate in the case of\r\nroute definitions and the `loadChildren` field, which is lowered. If the\r\nroute definition using `loadChildren` existed inside a decorator invocation,\r\nlowering was performed correctly. However, if it existed inside a standalone\r\nvariable declaration with an export keyword, the heuristic would conclude\r\nthat lowering was unnecessary. For ordinary providers this is true; however\r\nthe compiler attempts to fully understand the ROUTES token and thus even if\r\nan array of routes is declared in an exported variable, any `loadChildren`\r\nexpressions within still need to be lowered.\r\n\r\nThis commit enables lowering of already exported variables under a limited\r\nset of conditions (where the initializer expression is of a specific form).\r\nThis should enable the use of `loadChildren` in route definitions.\r\n\r\n## PR Checklist\r\nPlease check if your PR fulfills the following requirements:\r\n\r\n- [ ] The commit message follows our guidelines: https://github.com/angular/angular/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md#commit\r\n- [ ] Tests for the changes have been added (for bug fixes / features)\r\n- [ ] Docs have been added / updated (for bug fixes / features)\r\n\r\n\r\n## PR Type\r\nWhat kind of change does this PR introduce?\r\n\r\n<!-- Please check the one that applies to this PR using \"x\". -->\r\n\r\n- [ ] Bugfix\r\n- [ ] Feature\r\n- [ ] Code style update (formatting, local variables)\r\n- [ ] Refactoring (no functional changes, no api changes)\r\n- [ ] Build related changes\r\n- [ ] CI related changes\r\n- [ ] Documentation content changes\r\n- [ ] angular.io application / infrastructure changes\r\n- [ ] Other...

I'll explain with an example. \r\n \r\nLet's say I have an Tab Component which contains a basic **\"two tab\"** **mat-tab-nav-bar**.\r\nAlso,  I have two other components which contain my real page contents.\r\n\r\nIn this case, my router configuration would be something like so\r\n```typescript\r\n      {\r\n        path: 'identity',\r\n        component: TabsComponent\r\n        children: [\r\n          {\r\n            path: 'tab1',\r\n            component: Tab1Component\r\n          },\r\n          {\r\n            path: 'tab2',\r\n            component: Tab2Component\r\n          }\r\n        ]\r\n      }\r\n```\r\n\r\nMy TabsComponent has an **@ContentChildren** query with descendants option true.\r\n\r\nTabsComponents template looks like this.\r\n```html\r\n<mat-toolbar>\r\n <!--- actions varible has @ContentChildren('toolbar') decorator -->\r\n  <ng-container *ngTemplateOutlet=\"actions\"></ng-container>\r\n  <mat-toolbar-row>\r\n    <nav mat-tab-nav-bar color=\"accent\">\r\n      <a mat-tab-link routerLink=\"tab1\">Tab1</a>\r\n      <a mat-tab-link routerLink=\"tab2\">Tab2</a>\r\n    </nav>\r\n  </mat-toolbar-row>\r\n</mat-toolbar>\r\n<router-outlet></router-outlet>\r\n```\r\nSo each tab component has an ng-template something like so\r\n```html\r\n<ng-template #toolbar>\r\n  <mat-toolbar-row>\r\n   Content will be projected to anchestor component\r\n  </mat-toolbar-row>\r\n</ng-template>\r\n```\r\n\r\n### Describe the solution you'd like\r\n\r\nContent projection should work as the current content projection works with descendant components.\r\n\r\n### Describe alternatives you've considered\r\n\r\nMy workaround.\r\n\r\nEach tab has an variable named as toolbar which has a @ViewChild('toolbar') decorator. So all tab pages takes their ng-template reference by theirselves.\r\n\r\nSo TabsComponents template looks like this.\r\n\r\n```html\r\n <ng-container *ngTemplateOutlet=\"outlet?.component?.toolbar\"></ng-container>\r\n...\r\n<router-outlet #outlet=\"outlet\"></router-outlet>\r\n```\r\n\r\n\r\nHint: Don't know whether this already solved by ivy.
