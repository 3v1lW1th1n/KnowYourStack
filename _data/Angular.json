Specifically, it's use and the way \"private\" interacts from ts within templates between the default dev and prod builds - it seems like there could be a gap here.\r\n\r\n[This question ](https://github.com/angular/angular/issues/27615) helps illustrate part of the issue, and has been talked about at length in a few more references (and more), [here_1](https://github.com/angular/angular/issues/26393), [here_2](https://github.com/angular/angular/issues/16893).\r\n\r\nWhile these talk more specifically about access methods conflicting with prop names, I wanted to bring up the interaction with templates. Issues [like this one](https://github.com/angular/angular/issues/27615), while they are not a problem with the framework, throwing an error that a property is \"private\" while looking at the template currently requires extra step(s) ([explained more here](https://github.com/angular/angular/issues/11978#issuecomment-255736505)).\r\n\r\nWhile JavaScript (default ng serve / ES5) does not care about \"private,\" tsc (default prod build) does.TS has support for letting the developer know if a private property or method is being used, but I'm not familiar with a way of seeing this in the templates. Developers who are more familiar with Angular may not have an issue here, but using a pattern like this could be a \"nice to have\" for newer/unfamiliar developers, or a timesaving naming/visual pattern when working in templates.\r\n\r\n\r\n## 🔬 Minimal Reproduction\r\n\r\n### What's the affected URL?**\r\nhttps://angular.io/guide/styleguide#properties-and-methods\r\n\r\n### Reproduction Steps**\r\n```\r\nng new test-ng\r\ncd test-ng\r\n```\r\nInside of app.component.ts:\r\n```\r\n  public test = 'test';\r\n  private testPrivate = 'testPrivate';\r\n  private _testPrivate = '_testPrivate';\r\n```\r\nand inside of app.component.html:\r\n```\r\n<div>\r\n  {{test}}\r\n</div>\r\n<div>\r\n  {{testPrivate}}\r\n</div>\r\n<div>\r\n  {{_testPrivate}}\r\n</div>\r\n```\r\n\r\nRunning the default `ng serve` works just fine as expected / noted above, but `ng build --prod` will fail (also as expected). The difference (at least for me) is that with the IDEs I've used, I can immediately tell by looking just at the template that `_testPrivate` probably is private- \r\n\r\n### Expected vs Actual Behavior**\r\n\r\nActual behavior: while it's an agreed upon mistake by the developer, no ahead of time warning for private props/methods in templates, requires additional steps.\r\n\r\nExpected: Can be a range from noting the alternative naming with underscore, adding more detail to the existing info of TS vs JS \"private\", or leave the docs alone and provide/suggest tooling out of the box that catches this at dev time.\r\n","Url":"https://github.com/angular/angular/issues/27760","RelatedDescription":"Open issue \"Clarity and/or discussion on \"private\" property/method naming\" (#27760)"},{"Id":"392678947","IsPullRequest":false,"CreatedAt":"2018-12-19T16:25:39","Actor":"tommueller","Number":"27758","RawContent":null,"Title":"Pattern validation does not work correctly with input type number","State":"open","Body":"### Affected Package\r\n@angular/forms\r\n\r\n\r\n### Is this a regression?\r\nNo, I don't think so.\r\n\r\n### Description\r\nUsing a pattern validator to only allow commas as decimal separator like this:\r\n`Validators.pattern(/^[+-]?[0-9]+(,[0-9]+)?$/);`\r\nis working fine on inputs, as long as the input is not defined as `type=\"number\"`.

There is an array of numbers\r\n2. There is a parent container that generates multiple child items with a ngFor loop using that array.\r\n3. Each item gets its number from the array assigned.\r\n3. Every item has an animation attached to visualize active or inactive states. The parent container has an animation attached to coordinate staggering of the children.\r\n4. When removing an item by modifying the array of numbers the item is removed.\r\n5. This usually works and the item disappears (no animation involved)\r\n\r\nWhen the array contains identical numbers and you remove one of the duplicate numbers you run into a problem. As expected this will cause remaining siblings to move to the left but you will get a list of \"dead\" components— but only from the animation perspective as the child animation have been transitioned to state void while remaining safe & sound in the DOM.

You can see a yellow to green animation at the beginning of the gif loop that's the transition (void => active). After clicking the remove button you will see yellow items. I call them dead. Still in DOM but in state void. Just look at the all yellow numbers after you clicked the remove button. Also look into the console, you will see plenty of state transitions from active to void which is wrong.\r\n\r\n## 🌍  Your Environment\r\n**Angular Version:**\r\nLatest Angular 7, see the stackblitz demo.\r\n\r\n**Anything else relevant?**\r\nHere some related issues I think\r\n#23534\r\n#26078","Url":"https://github.com/angular/angular/issues/27754","RelatedDescription":"Open issue \"State transition to void triggered for animated children while still existing in DOM\" (#27754)"},{"Id":"392588780","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2018-12-19T12:53:58","Actor":"crisbeto","Number":"27753","RawContent":null,"Title":"fix(ivy): change detection strategy not being passed to compiler","State":"open","Body":"Fixes the defined change detection strategy not being passed to the compiler when a component is being compiled.","Url":"https://github.com/angular/angular/pull/27753","RelatedDescription":"Open PR \"fix(ivy): change detection strategy not being passed to compiler\" (#27753)"},{"Id":"392569957","IsPullRequest":false,"CreatedAt":"2018-12-19T12:03:54","Actor":"bengourley","Number":"27752","RawContent":null,"Title":"Provide ngDebugContext in production mode","State":"open","Body":"# 🚀 feature request\r\n\r\n### Relevant Package\r\nThis feature request is for `@angular/core`\r\n\r\n\r\n### Description\r\nI work on the Angular integration for Bugsnag.

Actual times to fetch the documentation JSON files are equal.\r\n\r\n**There are couple of things that might cause this:**\r\n1. Angular documentation uses animations, ReactJS documentation doesn't and sometimes that animation seems sluggish.\r\n1. ReactJS documentation loads documentation page content when you hover on a link side menu link.\r\n\r\nFixing 2. should be somewhat trivial. ReactJS.org is using on hover to trigger service loading hovered page content and when user clicks the link browser navigates to (already loaded) content.\r\n\r\nWhile timing click -> page completely showing is not entirely doable with reasonable effort (using chrome devtools and taking into account time used in processing content) the perceived speed is what matters in the end.\r\n\r\n## 🔬 Minimal Reproduction\r\nCompare documentation navigation UX on https://angular.io vs. https://reactjs.org websites.\r\n\r\n### What's the affected URL?**\r\n<!-- ✍️edit:--> https://angular.io/...\r\n\r\n### Reproduction Steps**\r\n<!-- If applicable please list the steps to take to reproduce the issue -->\r\n<!-- ✍️edit:-->\r\n1.

We have budget sizes configured in the `angular.json`. As with any active project, the bundle size tends to increase over time. That can cause our automated pull request tests to fail on even a small code change if the change adds enough size to go over the max/min threshold (5% in this example).\r\n\r\n\"budgets\": [{\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\"type\": \"bundle\",\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\"name\": \"main\",\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\"baseline\": \"4020kb\",\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\"minimumError\": \"5%\",\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\"maximumError\": \"5%\"\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t},{\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\"type\": \"bundle\",\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\"name\": \"styles\",\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\"baseline\": \"181kb\",\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\"minimumError\": \"5%\",\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\"maximumError\": \"5%\"\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t}]\r\n\r\n\r\nWhen this happens, the error is easy to identify and remedy (thanks for that!). However, this puts us in a tricky situation. \r\n> ng build --prod\r\n  \r\n> Date: 2018-12-19T20:13:36.383Z\r\n> Hash: 9ee44adbae1ca37d967f\r\n> Time: 59917ms\r\n> chunk {0} runtime.ec2944dd8b20ec099bf3.js (runtime) 1.41 kB [entry] [rendered]\r\n> chunk {1} main.2e3d8a71c52f17d81367.js (main) 1.39 MB [initial] [rendered]\r\n> chunk {2} polyfills.f31412eb35fb595ae0a2.js (polyfills) 147 kB [initial] [rendered]\r\n> chunk {3} styles.c38cc6ec26a52983595d.css (styles) 170 kB [initial] [rendered]\r\n> \r\n> ERROR in budgets, maximum exceeded for main.

This could be baked into the `build` command or a new command that would ideally be used before `build`. This would allow your budgets to update organically with your project size but large changes (like adding or removing a third party dependency) would require a manual adjustment to the budget baseline.\r\n\r\n#### Example use:\r\n\r\nAn organization has an `angular.json` file with a configuration that allows for auto updating when the difference in bundle size is less than 5%.\r\n\r\n\"budgets\": [{\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\"type\": \"bundle\",\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\"name\": \"main\",\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\"baseline\": \"4020kb\",\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\"minimumAutoIncrement\": \"5%\",\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\"maximumAutoIncrement\": \"5%\",\r\n                                                                   \"autoIncrement\": \"true\"\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t},{\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\"type\": \"bundle\",\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\"name\": \"styles\",\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\"baseline\": \"181kb\",\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\"minimumError\": \"5%\",\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\"maximumError\": \"5%\",\r\n                                                                   \"autoIncrement\": \"false\" // this would default to false to not break existing usage\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t}]\r\n\r\nUser A works and commits their final change. Before pushing a branch up, they run the optional build command (or a new command) `ng build --update-budget` and then commit the updated `angular.json`. When User B reviews the PR, they would notice that the budget baseline value was adjusted to equal the old budget +/- the delta amount of the code change. Budget sizes that exceed the min/max auto increment configuration would still throw an error and maintain their role as a warning to large bundle size changes.\r\n\r\n### Mention any other details that might be useful\r\n<!-- Please include a link to the repo if this is related to an OSS project. -->\r\n\r\nIncorporating this into version control/continuous integrated environments could be tricky as the Angular-CLI would be modifying versioned files and not the user. \r\n\r\nAn individual solution that uses the [Bundle-Budget plugin](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli/blob/master/packages/angular_devkit/build_angular/src/angular-cli-files/plugins/bundle-budget.ts) to increment the bundle size could be built and added to a company's existing processes.\r\n\r\nFigured it was an interesting enough issue to discuss here.

You can also use the `/* autoprefixer grid: autoplace */` control comment to enable autoplacement directly in your CSS.\n\nIn order to use the new autoplacement feature, you **must define both rows and columns** when declaring the grid template.\n\n```css\n/* Input CSS */\n\n/* autoprefixer grid: autoplace */\n\n.autoplacement-example {\n    display: grid;\n    grid-template-columns: 1fr 1fr;\n    grid-template-rows: auto auto;\n    grid-gap: 20px;\n}\n```\n\n```css\n/* Output CSS */\n\n/* autoprefixer grid: autoplace */\n\n.autoplacement-example {\n  display: -ms-grid;\n  display: grid;\n  -ms-grid-columns: 1fr 20px 1fr;\n  grid-template-columns: 1fr 1fr;\n  -ms-grid-rows: auto 20px auto;\n  grid-template-rows: auto auto;\n  grid-gap: 20px;\n}\n\n.autoplacement-example > *:nth-child(1) {\n  -ms-grid-row: 1;\n  -ms-grid-column: 1;\n}\n\n.autoplacement-example > *:nth-child(2) {\n  -ms-grid-row: 1;\n  -ms-grid-column: 3;\n}\n\n.autoplacement-example > *:nth-child(3) {\n  -ms-grid-row: 3;\n  -ms-grid-column: 1;\n}\n\n.autoplacement-example > *:nth-child(4) {\n  -ms-grid-row: 3;\n  -ms-grid-column: 3;\n}\n```\n\nAutoplacement support in Autoprefixer is currently very limited in what it can do. Please read the  [Grid Autoplacement support in IE ](https://renovatebot.com/gh/postcss/autoprefixer#grid-autoplacement-support-in-ie) section before using this new feature.\n\nThanks to [@&#8203;bogdan0083](https://renovatebot.com/gh/bogdan0083) for implementing the new feature, [@&#8203;Dan503](https://renovatebot.com/gh/Dan503) for documenting it, and [@&#8203;evandiamond](https://renovatebot.com/gh/evandiamond) for coming up with the initial idea.\n\n#### Other Changes\n\n-   Remove some unnecessary warnings for Grid (by [@&#8203;fanich37](https://renovatebot.com/gh/fanich37)).\n\n</details>\n\n---\n\n### Renovate configuration\n\n:date: **Schedule**: \"after 10pm every weekday,before 4am every weekday,every weekend\" in timezone America/Tijuana.\n\n:vertical_traffic_light: **Automerge**: Disabled by config.

Please consider moving AppComponent in C:/dev/prod-build-error/src/app/app.component.ts to a higher module that imports AppModule in C:/dev/prod-build-error/src/app/app.module.ts and AppModule in C:/dev/prod-build-error/src/app/app2.module.ts. You can also create a new NgModule that exports and includes AppComponent in C:/dev/prod-build-error/src/app/app.component.ts then import that NgModule in AppModule in C:/dev/prod-build-error/src/app/app.module.ts and AppModule in C:/dev/prod-build-error/src/app/app2.module.ts.\r\n\r\n### Desired functionality\r\n<!--\r\nWhat would like to see implemented?\r\nWhat is the usecase?\r\n-->\r\nWhat would like to see implemented? - I want to point to different start modules which could contain different imports so I can have bundle which contains different modules (most of which shared between possible app build paths)\r\n\r\nWhat is the usecase? - I am trying to have single code base which will differ only with few modules so I get different bundle containing only the modules that are imported. Let's say I have feature-module-1 and feature-module-2 - the former integrates the application with one external system and the latter with another. These two modules can't (or shouldn't) exists in my bundle together.  I want to create different bundles that contain specific integration with these two different external systems so I have a bundle with \"feature-module-1\" and another one with \"feature-module-2\" (but avoiding the burden of the router - I don't even use it). I am trying to use Angular CLI projects feature (https://github.com/angular/angular-cli/wiki/stories-multiple-apps).\r\nSample configuration:\r\nFull list of modules in a sample application:\r\nfeature-module-1\r\nfeature-module-2\r\napp.module.ts importing feature-module-1 and declaring AppComponent\r\napp2.module.ts importing feature-module-2 and declaring AppComponent\r\n\r\nNow I want to create bundles with the following components:\r\nFirst bundle:\r\nfeature-module-1\r\napp.module.ts\r\n\r\nSecond bundle:\r\nfeature-module-2\r\napp2.module.ts\r\n\r\nBoth bundles will use the shared AppComponent to show content on the screen.\r\n\r\nI was hoping Angular CLI \"multiple apps\" feature (https://github.com/angular/angular-cli/wiki/stories-multiple-apps) is for exactly such scenarios but even if I create new entry like explained in the above link (changing ```architect.build.options.main``` to point to different main.ts / main2.ts that import modules from app.module.ts and app2.module.ts), it still fails with \"...is part of the declarations of 2 modules...\" error. If I don't specify ```--prod``` in build command line parameters it doesn't fail.\r\n\r\n### Mention any other details that might be useful\r\n<!-- Please include a link to the repo if this is related to an OSS project. -->\r\n","Url":"https://github.com/angular/angular-cli/issues/13215","RelatedDescription":"Closed issue \"Building with --prod fails when same component is part of declarations of two modules\" (#13215)"},{"Id":"392076039","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2018-12-18T09:54:16","Actor":"cexbrayat","Number":"13213","RawContent":null,"Title":"feat(@schematics/angular): extend tslint:recommended","State":"open","Body":"Updates the `tslint.json` file to extend to the `tslint:recommended` set.\r\nRemoves the rules that have the same value as the recommended one and explicitely deactivates some rules that are activated in the recommended set, but were not in ours.\r\n\r\nFixes #6179 \r\n\r\ncc @mgechev this is to start the discussion, feedback welcome","Url":"https://github.com/angular/angular-cli/pull/13213","RelatedDescription":"Open PR \"feat(@schematics/angular): extend tslint:recommended\" (#13213)"},{"Id":"391829927","IsPullRequest":false,"CreatedAt":"2018-12-17T18:56:14","Actor":"distributev","Number":"13211","RawContent":null,"Title":"Importing raw html file content","State":"closed","Body":"<!--\r\nIF YOU DON'T FILL OUT THE FOLLOWING INFORMATION YOUR ISSUE MIGHT BE CLOSED WITHOUT INVESTIGATING\r\n-->\r\n### Bug Report or Feature Request (mark with an `x`)\r\n```\r\n- [ x] bug report -> please search issues before submitting\r\n- [ ] feature request\r\n```\r\n\r\n### Command (mark with an `x`)\r\n```\r\n- [ ] new\r\n- [ x] build\r\n- [ ] serve\r\n- [ ] test\r\n- [ ] e2e\r\n- [ ] generate\r\n- [ ] add\r\n- [ ] update\r\n- [ ] lint\r\n- [ ] xi18n\r\n- [ ] run\r\n- [ ] config\r\n- [ ] help\r\n- [ ] version\r\n- [ ] doc\r\n```\r\n\r\n### Versions\r\n<!--\r\nOutput from: `node --version`, `npm --version` and `ng --version`.\r\n  Windows (7/8/10).
