While the polyfills for ES5 browsers are added automatically since some minor versions, we cannot influence them. This is, however, important when using web components b/c in this case we need to load polyfills for ES5 browsers and shims for ES2015+. The latter one is required for ES2015+ browsers if we don't use differential loading and downlevel to ES5. This feature request proposes a solution.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Describe the solution you'd like\r\nWhile it's not the most known feature, we can already define that scripts go into specific additional bundles. The following `extra-polyfills` script would be put into a bundle `extra.js`\r\n\r\n```\r\n\"scripts\":[\r\n  {\r\n    \"input\": \"src/extra-polyfills.ts\",\r\n    \"bundleName\": \"extra\"\r\n  }\r\n]\r\n```\r\n\r\nThis proposal would just add a `type` property telling the CLI for which browsers the bundle is intented:\r\n\r\n```\r\n\"scripts\":[\r\n  {\r\n    \"input\": \"src/extra-polyfill.ts\",\r\n    \"bundleName\": \"extra\",\r\n    \"type\": \"module\"\r\n  }\r\n]\r\n```\r\n\r\nFor the time being, we could go with three values: `all` (all browsers), `module` (ES2015+ browsers), and `nomodule` (ES5 browsers). \r\n\r\nIf we extend the possibilities of differential loading we could use this `type` property to point to more fine-grained information according to the `srcset` property.\r\n\r\nThis approach also solves the problem that specific polyfills have to be loaded in a specific order. E. g. the web component polyfills need to be loaded after the ES5 polyfills (core.js, etc.)\r\n\r\n\r\n### Describe alternatives you've considered\r\n`ng new` could generate own polyfill files like `polyfills-es2015.ts` and `polyfills-es5.ts` and point to it with specific properties in angular.json. However, this is more intrusive, leads to confusion esp. if not needed and is less flexible.","Url":"https://github.com/angular/angular-cli/issues/14168","RelatedDescription":"Open issue \"differential loading of additional (!) polyfills\" (#14168)"},{"Id":"433238806","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2019-04-15T11:49:24","Actor":"alan-agius4","Number":"14166","RawContent":null,"Title":"feat(@angular-devkit/build-angular): deprecate `es5BrowserSupport` op‚Ä¶","State":"open","Body":"‚Ä¶tion in browser builder\r\n\r\nIn future, this will be determined from the list of supported browsers specified in the 'browserslist' file.","Url":"https://github.com/angular/angular-cli/pull/14166","RelatedDescription":"Open PR \"feat(@angular-devkit/build-angular): deprecate `es5BrowserSupport` op‚Ä¶\" (#14166)"},{"Id":"432967701","IsPullRequest":false,"CreatedAt":"2019-04-15T10:09:57","Actor":"RafaelKr","Number":"14157","RawContent":null,"Title":"ng generate doesn't add the component to my module anymore","State":"closed","Body":"<!--üîÖüîÖüîÖüîÖüîÖüîÖüîÖüîÖüîÖüîÖüîÖüîÖüîÖüîÖüîÖüîÖüîÖüîÖüîÖüîÖüîÖüîÖüîÖüîÖüîÖüîÖüîÖüîÖüîÖüîÖüîÖ\r\n\r\nOh hi there! üòÑ\r\n\r\nTo expedite issue processing please search open and closed issues before submitting a new one.\r\nExisting issues often contain information about workarounds, resolution, or progress updates.\r\n\r\nüîÖüîÖüîÖüîÖüîÖüîÖüîÖüîÖüîÖüîÖüîÖüîÖüîÖüîÖüîÖüîÖüîÖüîÖüîÖüîÖüîÖüîÖüîÖüîÖüîÖüîÖüîÖüîÖüîÖüîÖüîÖüîÖüîÖ-->\r\n\r\n\r\n# üêû Bug report\r\n\r\n### Command (mark with an `x`)\r\n<!-- Can you pin-point the command or commands that are effected by this bug? -->\r\n<!-- ‚úçÔ∏èedit: -->\r\n```\r\n- [ ] new\r\n- [ ] build\r\n- [ ] serve\r\n- [ ] test\r\n- [ ] e2e\r\n- [x] generate\r\n- [ ] add\r\n- [ ] update\r\n- [ ] lint\r\n- [ ] xi18n\r\n- [ ] run\r\n- [ ] config\r\n- [ ] help\r\n- [ ] version\r\n- [ ] doc\r\n```\r\n\r\n### Is this a regression?\r\n\r\n<!-- Did this behavior use to work in the previous version? -->\r\nYes, I think it's related to `@angular-devkit/schematics` version `7.3.x`.

Maybe this is simply using an already existing flow. From my point of view, this should be included as functionality, as the nested folder structure strategy seems to be one of the more common approaches.","Url":"https://github.com/angular/angular-cli/issues/14158","RelatedDescription":"Open issue \"Flatten glob \"assets\" to one output folder\" (#14158)"},{"Id":"432952750","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2019-04-14T09:44:09","Actor":"renovate-bot","Number":"14156","RawContent":null,"Title":"build: update inquirer to version 6.3.1","State":"open","Body":"This PR contains the following updates:\n\n| Package | Type | Update | Change | References |\n|---|---|---|---|---|\n| inquirer | dependencies | minor | [`6.2.2` -> `6.3.1`](https://diff.intrinsic.com/inquirer/6.2.2/6.3.1) | [source](https://togithub.com/SBoudrias/Inquirer.js) |\n\n---\n\n### Release Notes\n\n<details>\n<summary>SBoudrias/Inquirer.js</summary>\n\n### [`v6.3.1`](https://togithub.com/SBoudrias/Inquirer.js/compare/inquirer@6.2.2...inquirer@6.3.1)\n\n[Compare Source](https://togithub.com/SBoudrias/Inquirer.js/compare/inquirer@6.2.2...inquirer@6.3.1)\n\n</details>\n\n---\n\n### Renovate configuration\n\n:date: **Schedule**: \"after 10pm every weekday,before 4am every weekday,every weekend\" in timezone America/Tijuana.\n\n:vertical_traffic_light: **Automerge**: Disabled by config.

`Automatically resizing a <textarea>` and the [stackblitz example](https://stackblitz.com/angular/aqdvjmmqomd) should only mention what's actually needed to make it work.\r\n\r\n#### What is the current behavior?\r\nThey mention a whole lot of stuff, **_removing which_** still lets things function! So its not clear why its been put there and its misleading without an explanation.\r\n\r\nExtra stuff in the HTML template:\r\n```\r\n#autosize=\"cdkTextareaAutosize\"\r\n```\r\n\r\nExtra stuff in the component:\r\n```\r\nimport {CdkTextareaAutosize} from '@angular/cdk/text-field';\r\nimport {..., NgZone, ViewChild} from '@angular/core';\r\nimport {take} from 'rxjs/operators';\r\n...\r\n  constructor(private ngZone: NgZone) {}\r\n  @ViewChild('autosize') autosize: CdkTextareaAutosize;\r\n  triggerResize() {\r\n    // Wait for changes to be applied, then trigger textarea resize.\r\n    this.ngZone.onStable.pipe(take(1))\r\n        .subscribe(() => this.autosize.resizeToFitContent(true));\r\n  }\r\n}\r\n```\r\nThat's 4 extra imports, a `viewchild` binding and when I put a `console.log` statement inside either `triggerResize` or the subscribed function ... nothing happens ... meaning the code never runs!
