I wrote the code based on the official document. I believe it can be build successfully.\r\n\r\n### What is actually happening?\r\nWhen I run `npm run build`, an error Property 'pickerMap' does not exist on type 'Vue'.

The only action in our entire application that does not have such effects is our scroll to effect.  As it is the only transition-free state change, it often is jarring to users when it occurs.  Adding a simple scroll effect to the scroll behavior would go a long way to making the user experience for many Vue applications more seamless.\r\n\r\n### What does the proposed API look like?\r\nHonestly I have no idea what this would look like as I have only just begun looking into your docs today.

But right now it can (accidentally) be circumvented with closures, by adding a function to the state.\r\n\r\n```javascript\r\n// Create a closure\r\nconst myFunctionFactory = () => {\r\n\tconst myValues = {\r\n\t\tfoo: 0,\r\n\t};\r\n\r\n\treturn () => {\r\n\t\tmyValues.foo  = 1;\r\n\t\treturn myValues.foo;\r\n\t};\r\n};\r\n\r\n// Get the function inside the closure\r\nconst myFunction = myFunctionFactory();\r\n\r\n// Add the function to the state\r\nVue.set( state, 'myFunction', myFunction );\r\n\r\n// New each time the function is called, a different result is returned\r\nstate.myFunction(); // => 1;\r\nstate.myFunction(); // => 2;\r\nstate.myFunction(); // => 3;\r\nstate.myFunction(); // => 4;\r\n```\r\n\r\nThis can introduce really subtle bugs and also makes time travel unusable.

Having a way to check if the namespace path is already occupied would allow the code to either, register to a different namespace (ick!), unregister and re-register the existing namespace or avoid registration of the namespace altogether. \r\n\r\nThis condition can be easily reproduced by dynamically registering a namespaced module and issuing a hotreload or attempting to register that module more than once to the same path. \r\n\r\nEnd users would not see errors on hot-load or, if for some reason, the code attempts multiple registrations in the same session.\r\n\r\nThe only workaround at this point is to check the private member _modulesNamespaceMap.
