Everything is great and `pathToRegexpOptions` seems to work properly, **however, when using aliases** setting it above the First Component with a strict option in `pathToRegexpOptions` to let the routes with the forward slash at the end to slip to the `First` component, it **now gives an error, see below:**\r\n\r\n**Uncomment the prepared code in `router/index.js` to see that it stops working as intended after the first alias:**\r\n  - `localhost:8080/some/cat/`\r\n  - `localhost:8080/some/cat/cat/`\r\n  - `localhost:8080/some/cat/cat/cat/` => **now it loads the SECOND component whereas it is supposed to load the First**\r\n\r\n<!-- generated by vue-issues.
