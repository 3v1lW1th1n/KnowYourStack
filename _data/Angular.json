Might seem really trivial, but will probably help the newbies.\r\n\r\nThe documentation says:\r\n\r\n> List all the peer dependencies that your library uses in the TypeScript configuration file ./tsconfig.json\r\n\r\nbut does not mention which `tsconfig.json` file. Of the application or the library? \r\n\r\nMost of you are probably thinking \"of the application! duh!?\". But it wasn't clear for me and I kept trying different values in the library tsconfig file for quite some time before finally trying it in the application `tsconfig` file.\r\n\r\nMoreover, shouldn't it be:\r\n\r\n    {\r\n      \"compilerOptions\": {\r\n        // ...\r\n        // paths are relative to `baseUrl` path.\r\n        \"paths\": {\r\n          \"@angular/*\": [\r\n            \"./node_modules/@angular/*\"\r\n          ],\r\n          \"tslib\": [\r\n            \"./node_modules/tslib\"\r\n          ]\r\n        }\r\n      }\r\n    }\r\n\r\nThe `node_modules` folder is in the same folder as the `tsconfig.json`. Unless you're talking about the `tsconfig.app.json` which is in the `src` folder.\r\n\r\nHope my feedback helps :)","Url":"https://github.com/angular/angular/issues/29807","RelatedDescription":"Closed issue \"Using TypeScript path mapping for peer dependencies\" (#29807)"},{"Id":"431198841","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2019-04-10T19:18:31","Actor":"matsko","Number":"29795","RawContent":null,"Title":"perf(ivy): do not use spread operations in styling","State":"closed","Body":"While investigating styling performance regressions, it was discovered\r\nthat a single `fn(...args)` operation was causing a performance hit\r\nbecause the generated es5 `__spread` operation uses `[].concat` and\r\nreads from the `arguments` values (which are not very efficient).

We have big forms with lot of datas, that we modify after form changing on webservice update.\r\nEach web service update change the form, and some automatics propagation change other forms asking for web service propagation and so on ....\r\n```typescript\r\nmyForm.get(\"myValue\").valueChange..subscribe(value =>callAppServiceAndDoSomeStuf())\r\n````\r\nThe problem is than when we change for same value, the valueChange event is fired and event is propagated.\r\nAs you see in set value code in FormControl class: which seems to be the only one updating FormControl value (am I right?), update every change event if change is the same.\r\n````typescript\r\n setValue(value: any, options: {\r\n    onlySelf?: boolean,\r\n    emitEvent?: boolean,\r\n    emitModelToViewChange?: boolean,\r\n    emitViewToModelChange?: boolean\r\n  } = {}): void {\r\n    (this as{value: any}).value = this._pendingValue = value;\r\n    if (this._onChange.length && options.emitModelToViewChange !== false) {\r\n      this._onChange.forEach(\r\n          (changeFn) => changeFn(this.value, options.emitViewToModelChange !== false));\r\n    }\r\n    this.updateValueAndValidity(options);\r\n  }\r\n````\r\nTo fix this I need to add the distinctUntilChanged rxjs operator everywhere, which is quite boring and errorprone, as this may be forgotten.\r\n\r\n### Describe the solution you'd like\r\nI'd like the Set Value of the ControlForm to fire change only if the setted value is distinct of the stored one.\r\nI know this may be tricky and have lot of consequencies. So if this is not possible for reverse compatibility, I would like to have a form option, on formBuilder or as a static angular option, for enabling this behavior.\r\n\r\nWhat do you think ?\r\n\r\n\r\n### Describe alternatives you've considered\r\nuse distinctUntilChanged **everywhere** in your application\r\n","Url":"https://github.com/angular/angular/issues/29804","RelatedDescription":"Open issue \"Do not fire FormControl on change when setting the same value as store one\" (#29804)"},{"Id":"431347198","IsPullRequest":false,"CreatedAt":"2019-04-10T07:31:43","Actor":"BaerMitUmlaut","Number":"29803","RawContent":null,"Title":"Additonal schema with predefined non-angular elements","State":"open","Body":"# 🚀 feature request\r\n\r\n### Relevant Package\r\nThis feature request is for @angular/core\r\n\r\n\r\n### Description\r\nCurrently there are two schemas available to allow non-angular custom elements and attributes:\r\n- CUSTOM_ELEMENTS_SCHEMA - ignores everything unknown\r\n- NO_ERRORS_SCHEMA - allows anythin dash-cased\r\n\r\nHowever, there is no way to limit the allowed elements any further or to specify a number of allowed elements, for example to check for typos.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Describe the solution you'd like\r\nI'd expand the `SchemaMetadata` interface like this:\r\n```ts\r\nexport interface SchemaMetadata {\r\n  name: string;\r\n  tokenValid?: (token: string) => boolean;\r\n}\r\n```\r\nThe functions would check if the given token (element or attribute name) is valid, it's optional for full backwards compatibility (though that's probably not even necessary).

Was not seeing this behavior in CLI 1.2.6 but am seeing it in 7.3.7\r\n\r\n### Description\r\n\r\nI am running lint, test and build simultaneously using the npm concurrently package.  This has always worked in ngcli 1.2.6.   When one of the tasks fails, concurrently issues a SIGTERM to the other tasks (fail fast), and the other tasks should shut down gracefully.  In 7.3.7 this results in an error in `ng test`. \r\n\r\nWhat is making this issue bad for me, is that when running this in a docker build (node:10.15.3-alpine) on a gitlab runner, the docker build just hangs, possibly in an infinite loop.  The gitlab runner never releases.    \r\n\r\nWhen I run the demo from macOS, I do get back to a comment prompt.  I can't explain the discrepancy.\r\n\r\n## 🔬 Minimal Reproduction\r\nThe basic reproduction steps are to use concurrently to run `ng test` and then `process.exit(1)` in another concurrently run task _after_ the tests have started to run.\r\n\r\nPlease run `npm run demo` in this reproduction.  \r\nhttps://github.com/rcollette/ngcli-test-sigterm-demo\r\n\r\nKeep in mind that the timeout in sigterm.js may need to be adjusted.   On my machine 10s was enough time to get the tests started but before they finish.\r\n\r\n## 🔥 Exception or Error\r\nOutput from an actual application build.\r\n<pre>\r\n<code>\r\n> concurrently --kill-others-on-fail \"npm:lint\" \"npm:test:server\" \"npm:build:server\" \r\n\r\n[test:server] \r\n[test:server] > embark3-ui@0.0.0 test:server /build\r\n[test:server] > ng test --code-coverage --source-map --watch=false --progress=false\r\n[test:server] \r\n[lint] \r\n[lint] > embark3-ui@0.0.0 lint /build\r\n[lint] > ng lint --type-check\r\n[lint] \r\n[build:server] \r\n[build:server] > embark3-ui@0.0.0 build:server /build\r\n[build:server] > ng build --progress=false --prod --aot --source-map --es5-browser-support=false\r\n[build:server] \r\n[lint] Linting \"embark3-ui\"...\r\n[lint] \r\n[lint] ERROR: /build/src/app/shared/modals/entitlement/entitlement-modal.component.spec.ts:67:9 - Expected property shorthand in object literal ('{startDate}').\r\n[lint] ERROR: /build/src/app/shared/modals/entitlement/entitlement-modal.component.spec.ts:68:9 - Expected property shorthand in object literal ('{endDate}').\r\n[lint] \r\n[lint] Lint errors found in the listed files.\r\n[lint] Linting \"embark3-ui-e2e\"...\r\n[lint] \r\n[lint] \r\n[lint] All files pass linting.\r\n[lint] npm ERR! code ELIFECYCLE\r\n[lint] npm ERR! errno 1\r\n[lint] npm ERR! embark3-ui@0.0.0 lint: `ng lint --type-check`\r\n[lint] npm ERR!
