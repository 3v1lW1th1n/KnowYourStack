We wanted to present simple-to-read tag lists.  As the repo has grown, the tag list has gotten longer and more complicated. \r\n\r\nThe addition of `arm32v7` to the repo caused us to spend considerable time thinking about repo organization generally. We looked at other approaches and also talked to Docker employees about their long-term plans for `arm32v7` in particular.\r\n\r\nWe considered various options:\r\n\r\n* Split the repo by architecture (this seemed to match what Debian and other official repos were doing). See [debian](https://hub.docker.com/_/debian/) and [arm32v7/debian](https://hub.docker.com/r/arm32v7/debian/). Note how the [Debian GitHub repo](https://github.com/debuerreotype/docker-debian-artifacts) is structured, branching by architecture.\r\n* Split the repo by SDK and Runtime. We've discussed this multiple times but we believe that discoverability would be a significant challenge. Also, other peer development platforms do not segment on the SDK/Runtime boundary.\r\n* Stay the course on the repo structure, but adopt a new (hopefully better) approach for the tag list.\r\n\r\nThere are three main reasons that we adopted a new README style:\r\n\r\n* Multi-arch tags are visually awkward when you have multiple versions of an operating system for a given tag type. For example, the dotnet repo offers both Debian 8 and 9 variants of the `2-sdk` tag. Only one of them can participate in the multi-arch tag while the other variant (in this case Debian 8) is only available with the longer tag name: `2.0.0-sdk-jessie`. The way the bullets in the tag list compose looks odd, as you can see in the following image. It also doesn't communicate the relationship between tags well. <img width=\"724\" alt=\"screen shot 2017-08-13 at 11 14 22 pm\" src=\"https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/2608468/29260189-2f58da84-807d-11e7-868e-7e1f888fd42d.png\">\r\n* A multi-arch-first tag list works well when all OSes offer the same image types, but is poor at showing differences when they don't. The .NET Core offering for `arm32v7` is quite limited currently. We wanted to make that obvious.\r\n* We believe that most users look at the README with a specific OS in mind. We thought that it was best to cater to that, providing a simplified view for a given OS.\r\n\r\nThe downside is that this README style is unique (AFAIK). We've never tried to be novel with our Docker offering, but fit into existing conventions. This is our first significant departure from Docker norms. There is a lot changing in the Docker space, with multi-arch and `arm32v7` being top of the list (as it relates to this topic). As a result, we thought that now was a good time for experimentation based on the conclusion that the existing README style no longer scales to our needs. Our conversations with Docker employees also led us to believe that there are no good established answers to these challenges.\r\n\r\nPlease give us your feedback @ [dotnet/dotnet-docker #275](https://github.com/dotnet/dotnet-docker/issues/275)."},{"Id":"6840048672","Type":"IssuesEvent","CreatedAt":"2017-11-10T22:00:48","Actor":"terrajobst","Repository":"dotnet/announcements","Organization":"dotnet","RawContent":null,"RelatedAction":"reopened","RelatedUrl":"https://github.com/dotnet/announcements/issues/24","RelatedDescription":"Reopened issue \" .NET Standard 2.0 is final\" (#24) at dotnet/announcements","RelatedBody":"## Summary\r\n\r\n[.NET Standard 2.0](https://github.com/dotnet/standard/blob/master/docs/versions/netstandard2.0.md) is final. \r\n\r\nYou can now start producing .NET Standard 2.0 libraries and NuGet packages. Please use the latest [.NET Core 2.0 Preview 2](https://www.microsoft.com/net/core/preview) as it contains many improvements that were necessary to provide a good experience.\r\n      \r\n## Details\r\n\r\n* **Bigger API Surface**: We have more than doubled the set of available APIs from **13k** in [.NET Standard 1.6](https://github.com/dotnet/standard/blob/master/docs/versions/netstandard1.6.md) to **32k** in [.NET Standard 2.0](https://github.com/dotnet/standard/blob/master/docs/versions/netstandard2.0.md). Most of the added APIs are .NET Framework APIs. These additions make it much easier to port existing code to .NET Standard, and, by extension, to any .NET implementation of .NET Standard, such as .NET Core 2.0 and the upcoming version of UWP.\r\n\r\n* **.NET Framework compatibility mode**: The vast majority of NuGet packages are currently still targeting .NET Framework. Many projects are currently blocked from moving to .NET Standard because not all their dependencies are targeting .NET Standard yet. That's why we added a compatibility mode that allows .NET Standard projects to depend on .NET Framework libraries as if they were compiled for .NET Standard. Of course, this may not work in all cases (for instance, if the .NET Framework binaries uses WPF), but we found that [70% of all NuGet packages on nuget.org are API compatible][video] with .NET Standard 2.0, so in practice it unblocks many projects.\r\n\r\n[video]: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iIlQer4LEac\r\n\r\n* **Broad platform support**. .NET Standard 2.0 is [supported on the following platforms](https://github.com/dotnet/standard/blob/master/docs/versions.md):\r\n    - .NET Framework 4.6.1\r\n    - .NET Core 2.0\r\n    - Mono 5.4\r\n    - Xamarin.iOS 10.14\r\n    - Xamarin.Mac 3.8\r\n    - Xamarin.Android 7.5\r\n    - UWP is work in progress and will ship later this year.\r\n\r\n## Tooling Prerequisites\r\n\r\nIn general, make sure you run the latest version of the tooling:\r\n\r\n* **.NET Core SDK**. You always need to install [.NET Core 2.0 Preview 2](https://www.microsoft.com/net/core/preview). This also includes the CLI (`dotnet`) for building packages, so if you only want to use the CLI, you can stop here.\r\n* **Visual Studio**. If you want to use Visual Studio for authoring .NET Standard 2.0 libraries, you also need to install [Visual Studio 2017 15.3](https://www.visualstudio.com/vs/preview/). Make sure to use 15.3 and not an earlier version, as this release addressed a couple of key issues to provide a good experience. If you only need to consume .NET Standard 2.0 libraries, you can do that even in Visual Studio 2015 but you'll need NuGet client 3.6 or higher ([download from Nuget.org/downloads](https://www.nuget.org/downloads))\r\n* **Visual Studio for Mac**. The latest version of [Visual Studio for Mac](https://www.visualstudio.com/vs/visual-studio-mac/) supports building .NET Standard 2.0 libraries. \r\n* **Rider**. The [latest version](https://www.jetbrains.com/rider/download) also has support for .NET Standard 2.0.\r\n\r\nLearn more [by reading the .NET Standard FAQ](http://aka.ms/netstandardfaq).\r\n\r\n## Discussion\r\n\r\nFor discussion, see https://github.com/dotnet/standard/issues/439."},{"Id":"6840048225","Type":"IssuesEvent","CreatedAt":"2017-11-10T22:00:40","Actor":"terrajobst","Repository":"dotnet/announcements","Organization":"dotnet","RawContent":null,"RelatedAction":"reopened","RelatedUrl":"https://github.com/dotnet/announcements/issues/22","RelatedDescription":"Reopened issue \".NET Core Support for macOS High Sierra\" (#22) at dotnet/announcements","RelatedBody":"# .NET Core Support for macOS High Sierra\r\n\r\n## Summary\r\n\r\n.NET Core 1.x and 2.0 do not currently support macOS High Sierra (version 10.13, currently in beta) due to changes in macOS.

More designs will show up over time. These two designs were selected as the initial set since the current behavior for both has received significant feedback.\r\n\r\n- [.NET Core 2+ Naming and Versioning](https://github.com/dotnet/designs/issues/2)\r\n- [.NET Core 2+ Version Binding](https://github.com/dotnet/designs/issues/3)\r\n\r\nA separate repository was created for a few reasons:\r\n\r\n- .NET designs may need to be implemented in multiple repos, including runtime, framework and language repos.\r\n- .NET designs may or may not be specific to .NET Core.\r\n\r\nThanks in advance for your participation in this repository."},{"Id":"6840045368","Type":"IssuesEvent","CreatedAt":"2017-11-10T21:59:57","Actor":"terrajobst","Repository":"dotnet/announcements","Organization":"dotnet","RawContent":null,"RelatedAction":"reopened","RelatedUrl":"https://github.com/dotnet/announcements/issues/10","RelatedDescription":"Reopened issue \"RyuJIT is the x86 JIT in .NET Core 2.0 – Replacing JIT32\" (#10) at dotnet/announcements","RelatedBody":"# RyuJIT is the x86 JIT in .NET Core 2.0 – Replacing JIT32\r\n\r\n## Summary\r\n\r\nThe RyuJIT JIT compiler will be used for all platform combinations for .NET Core 2.0 and beyond. JIT32 will be removed from the product. For .NET Core 1.x, RyuJIT is used for x64 and JIT32 is used for x86 chip support.\r\n\r\nWe intend for RyuJIT to be a 100% functionally compatible replacement for JIT32. RyuJIT has gone through extensive stress testing. This brings the .NET Core 32-bit product behavior much closer to the 64-bit product behavior.\r\n\r\nWe will publish more information on this change later. For now, this is just the announcement.\r\n\r\nNote: Windows is the only supported 32-bit platform for .NET Core 1.x and 2.x.\r\n\r\n### Details:\r\n\r\n- [Make RyuJIT/x86 the default x86 JIT (dotnet/coreclr #8260)](https://github.com/dotnet/coreclr/pull/8260)\r\n\r\n## Impact\r\n\r\n**Open Source** - RyuJIT is open source. JIT32 is not open source.\r\n\r\n**Single JIT Codebase** - There is now a single codebase for the CoreCLR JIT. This helps everyone who is working on platform expansion and who is investing in JIT improvements. An example is Samsung, who is investing in Linux x86 with RyuJIT x86.\r\n\r\n**Performance** - RyuJIT generally takes longer to compile than JIT32, but its optimizer can generate faster code. The performance difference may not be significant, depending on the application. In initial testing with ASP.NET, we found that the difference didn't matter. Please help us make RyuJIT faster! We will continue investing in RyuJIT performance (which often helps all architectures). If you notice performance regressions, we’re very interested to hear your results. Please contact us.\r\n\r\n**Features!** - RyuJIT has more features than JIT32. The feature gap with JIT32 will grow over time. The following features are now available to x86 workloads (due to this change): \r\n- SIMD\r\n- Fast Span&lt;T&gt; support\r\n- Inlining improvements\r\n- Devirtualization\r\n- Significantly better floating point performance\r\n- Better performance with value types (structs)\r\n\r\n**Possible compatibility concerns:** \r\n- floating-point precision\r\n- undefined behaviors (programs that happened to work that had bugs in them) especially around interop, inlining differences (GetCallerAssembly intrinsic).\r\n\r\nPlease test! If an x86 program was working in 1.x, and failing in 2.x, please report it on GitHub or at ryujit@microsoft.com. \r\n\r\nPlease see some of our past [blog posts on RyuJIT](https://blogs.msdn.microsoft.com/dotnet/tag/ryujit/) to learn more about it.\r\n\r\n## Rationale\r\n\r\nRyuJIT is the current and future platform of JIT compilation for .NET. We will use it for all platform combinations going forward. We're  more efficient as a developer community if we have a single codebase to learn, work on and improve."},{"Id":"6840041975","Type":"IssuesEvent","CreatedAt":"2017-11-10T21:59:06","Actor":"terrajobst","Repository":"dotnet/announcements","Organization":"dotnet","RawContent":null,"RelatedAction":"reopened","RelatedUrl":"https://github.com/dotnet/announcements/issues/6","RelatedDescription":"Reopened issue \"Inheritance security rules violated by type: 'System.Net.Http.WebRequestHandler'.

Derived types must either match the security accessibility of the base type or be less accessible.\r\n\r\nDetails in https://github.com/dotnet/corefx/issues/11100\r\nUpdated [System.Net.Http 4.3.1 package](https://www.nuget.org/packages/System.Net.Http/4.3.1) contains a fix and is available on nuget.\r\n\r\n## Impact\r\n\r\nHere's list of technical breaking changes caused by the solution withworkarounds for each.\r\nNote that these new behaviors are specific when running on net46 / Desktop. When you run on .NET Core, the behavior is intact.\r\n\r\n1. `HttpClientHandler.CheckCertificateRevocationList` (introduced in System.Net.Http 4.1)\r\n    * New behavior: Throws `PlatformNotSupportedException`\r\n    * Workaround: Use `ServicePointManager.CheckCertificateRevocationList` instead (impacts the whole AppDomain, not just single `HttpClientHandler` as it did in System.Net.Http 4.1-4.3)\r\n2. `HttpClientHandler.SslProtocols` (introduced in System.Net.Http 4.1)\r\n    * New behavior: Throws `PlatformNotSupportedException`\r\n    * Workaround: Use `ServicePointManager.SecurityProtocol` instead (impacts the whole AppDomain, not just single `HttpClientHandler` as it did in System.Net.Http 4.1-4.3)\r\n3. `HttpClientHandler.ServerCertificateCustomValidationCallback` (introduced in System.Net.Http 4.1)\r\n    * New behavior: Works fine, except that the first parameter of type `HttpRequestMessage` is always `null`\r\n    * Workaround: Use `ServicePointManager.ServerCertificateValidationCallback`\r\n4. HTTP/2.0 support (introduced in System.Net.Http 4.1)\r\n    * New behavior: System.Net.Http (for net46 = Desktop) no longer supports HTTP/2.0 protocol on Windows 10.\r\n    * Workaround: Target System.Net.Http.WinHttpHandler NuGet package instead.\r\n    * Details:\r\n      * HTTP/2.0 support is part of the new CoreFx HTTP stack which on Windows is based on WinHTTP.  The original HTTP stack in .NET Framework 4.6 did not support HTTP/2.0 protocol.  If HTTP/2.0 protocol is needed, there is a separate NuGet package, System.Net.Http.WinHttpHandler which provides a new HttpClient handler. This handler is similar in features to `HttpClientHandler` (the normal default handler for HttpClient) but will support HTTP/2.0 protocol.  When using HttpClient on .NET Core runtime, the WinHttpHandler is actually built-in to HttpClientHandler.  But on .NET Framework, you need to explicitly use WinHttpHandler.\r\n      * Regardless of whether you are running using .NET Framework runtime (with WinHttpHandler) or .NET Core runtime using HttpClientHandler (or WinHttpHandler), there are additional requirements in order to get HTTP/2.0 protocol working on Windows:\r\n        * The client must be running on Windows 10 Anniversary Build (build 14393 or later).\r\n        * The `HttpRequestMessage.Version` must be explicitly set to 2.0 (the default is normally 1.1). Sample code:\r\n\r\n```c#\r\n            var handler = new WinHttpHandler();\r\n            var client = new HttpClient(handler);\r\n            var request = new HttpRequestMessage(HttpMethod.Get, \"http://www.example.com\");\r\n            request.Version = new Version(2, 0);\r\n\r\n            HttpResponseMessage response = await client.SendAsync(request);\r\n```\r\n\r\n## Rationale\r\n\r\nAfter much discussion it was decided the best way forward would be to revert the HttpClientHandler implementation in net46 build of CoreFX back to using original .NET Framework HTTP stack instead of WinHTTP (WinHttpHandler) based stack.\r\n\r\nAdditionally, we will revise the implementation of the new APIs on HttpClientHandler we introduced in 4.1.0.0 OOB package so that it works accordingly for the net46 build.

The plan is to port this to the [official microsoft/dotnet repo]( https://hub.docker.com/r/microsoft/dotnet/) shortly.  The multi-arch feature allows a single tag to be used across multiple machine configurations.  Without this feature each architecture/OS/platform requires a unique tag.  For example, the microsoft/dotnet:1.0-runtime tag is based on Debian and microsoft/dotnet:1.0-runtime-nanoserver if based on Nano Server.  With multi-arch there will be one common microsoft/dotnet:1.0-runtime tag.
