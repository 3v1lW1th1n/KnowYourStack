There are two benefits in my opinion:\r\n1. Start and end phrases are more semantic class names relevant to language direction.\r\n2. I think it is very understandable since the same methodology is used in `flexbox`\r\n\r\n### Final Note\r\nI know it might be a huge change in the syntax but I believe in long run it helps more adoption of the Bulma in more languages.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n","Url":"https://github.com/jgthms/bulma/issues/2347","RelatedDescription":"Open issue \"Better Naming Suggestion for better RTL Support\" (#2347)"},{"Id":"406045856","IsPullRequest":false,"CreatedAt":"2019-02-03T02:41:50","Actor":"purrloftruth","Number":"2346","RawContent":null,"Title":"FR: Add modifier class to allow any arbitrary element to appear closer to a title (not just subtitle)","State":"open","Body":"<!-- PLEASE READ THE FOLLOWING INSTRUCTIONS -->\r\n\r\n<!-- Choose one of the following: -->\r\nThis is about **Bulma**.\r\n\r\n<!-- Is it about Bulma or about the Docs? -->\r\n<!-- Is it a bug/feature/question or do you need help? -->\r\n<!-- If it's a bug, is it a browser bug? -->\r\n\r\n### Overview of the problem\r\n\r\n<!-- UNCOMMENT THE APPROPRIATE LINES -->\r\n\r\nThis is about the Bulma **CSS framework**\r\n<!-- This is about the Bulma **Docs** -->\r\nI'm using Bulma **version** 0.7.2\r\nMy **browser** is: Safari 12.0.2 on macOS Mojave 10.14.2\r\n<!-- This is a **Sass** issue: I'm using version [x.x.x] -->\r\nI am sure this issue is **not a duplicate**.\r\n\r\n### Description\r\n\r\nRight now, when you have a title and a subtitle touching, the subtitle's margin-top will automatically reduce itself so that they are closer together.
