For integration of Vue with existing Tracker-based Meteor apps, one approach how to assure fur compatibility is to implement Tracker on top of observer implementation. This has been proven to work great with 2.x version and it just needed a bit more access to Vue observer internals than what was already available.\r\n\r\nI would suggest that in 3.x there is a simple way to register an alternative Vue observer implementation. In this way 3rd party libraries could extend new Vue observer implementation with additional things and then register it back for Vue to use it.\r\n\r\n### What does the proposed API look like?\r\nIt could be something as simple as `Vue.useReactivity(module)`. It would be on `module`'s author to assure that the alternative implementation is compatible and works well with Vue.\r\n\r\n<!-- generated by vue-issues.

Moment.js is slow and because filters are not cached it is not really usable, especially when rendering lists.\r\n* All other places for formatting text, dates etc. \r\n* Creating computed property for each formatted value (text, date etc) is just a lot of work and unnecessary code to write.\r\n\r\n### What does the proposed API look like?\r\nMake all filters work like computed properties instead of methods.  \r\nOr add different symbol (instead of pipe) to denote filters that are cachable (pure).\r\n\r\n<!-- generated by vue-issues.

I am using angular for another website, with nested routes and parameters, and it has no problem reloading the page correctly.\r\n\r\nI have read on another forum, from a Vue developer, that it is just not possible to achieve a reload with nested routes or params properly.\r\n\r\nCould any one let me know if it can be achieved (keep in mind the website is hosted on a bucket on AWS, so no server trick can be involved). If it can be, how would I do that ?\r\n\r\nThank you in advance.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n","Url":"https://github.com/vuejs/vue-router/issues/2398","RelatedDescription":"Closed issue \"Refresh Page not reloading website\" (#2398)"},{"Id":"361509724","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2018-09-18T22:36:40","Actor":"jnields","Number":"2397","RawContent":null,"Title":"Add access to history state","State":"open","Body":"<!--\r\nPlease make sure to read the Pull Request Guidelines:\r\nhttps://github.com/vuejs/vue/blob/dev/.github/CONTRIBUTING.md#pull-request-guidelines\r\n-->\r\n\r\nThis allows developers access to history.state, which you can use for associating extra data to the URL without updating the visible URL, in history mode.

It provides a few code snippets and assumes you'll understand. The documentation has been the biggest source of my frustration while using Vue since it never actually explains anything.\r\n\r\nFor example, on the Vuex installation page, sandwiched between CDN/package manager installation and building from source, you've put that Vuex needs to be instantiated in a module set up. You've provided zero context for this. Is this in the store? Is this for every file you need to access the store in? More importantly, it shouldn't be on the installation page, let alone sandwiched in between different installation methods. Vue's documentation is riddled with these issues. Unfortunately, I still don't actually know enough about how Vue actually works to be able to contribute to the documentation in any way. If I didn't have to use Vue for the project I am on, I would be using React, Redux, & RxJs and have access to meaningful, better written documentation that bothers to walk you through the set up. If Vue actually wants to gain any real traction, you're going to need to actually show folks how to use and set up your tools.\r\n\r\n<!-- generated by vue-issues.
