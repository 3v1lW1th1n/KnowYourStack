developers are ready they then check in their code to the \"Dev branch\", at present this can still reference a prerelease version.\r\nThe CI runs various tests on this branch which has access to the \"ourproduct\" feed.\r\n\r\nEverything works fine...but now we want to release to our clients, but our tested packages are marked as prerelease...they are immutable.\r\n\r\nI don't want to recompile the packages as different compilers might cause issues.\r\n\r\nSolution:\r\n\r\nSo what if I do not use prerelease package versions....and I have 2 feeds...1 called \"developers\" 1 called \"ourproduct\".\r\nDevelopers only use the \"developers\" feed\r\nCI uses Dev branch and \"ourproduct\" feed\r\n\r\nThe process could now be developers do work, when they are happy to check into \"Dev
