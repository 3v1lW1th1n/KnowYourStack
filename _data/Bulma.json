However, the solution changes the order of elements. The label must be before the icon.\r\n\r\n### Testing Done\r\n\r\nManually tested importing the generated version and also tested with Chrome Developer Tools.\r\n\r\n<!-- BEFORE SUBMITTING YOUR PR, MAKE SURE TO FOLLOW THESE STEPS: -->\r\n<!-- 1.

Reference that issue as well. -->\r\n\r\nI ran into a compiling error with Bulma 0.8.0 when trying to use `inherit` value for the `$text-strong` variable. I found out this is due to breaking changes in commit 0f988eadd9cbca055966e4418a704b85e19999ff in which a lot of default colors have been modified. This particular line was throwing the error when using `inherit` value for `$text-strong`:\r\n\r\n```\r\n$input-placeholder-color: rgba($text-strong, 0.3) !default\r\n``` \r\n\r\nI think we may often use this particular value for the `$text-strong` and `$text-light` variables because there are a lot of cases where a `<strong>` tag in a text should just inherit its parent color. \r\nAlso I think it doesn't really make sense to use the strong text color as default in any other derived variable.\r\n\r\n### Proposed solution\r\n\r\n<!-- Which specific problem does this PR solve and how?  -->\r\n<!-- If it fixes a particular Issue, add \"Fixes #ISSUE_NUMBER\" in your title -->\r\nIn this PR I just put back the old default values, replacing `$text-strong` by `$grey-darker` and `$text-light` by `$grey`. By the way this is what [the docs](https://bulma.io/documentation/form/input/#variables) actually says.\r\n\r\n### Tradeoffs\r\n\r\n<!-- What are the drawbacks of this solution? Are there alternative ones? -->\r\n<!-- Think of performance, build time, usability, complexity, coupling…) -->\r\nThere are still other derived variables which use the `$text-strong` and `$text-light` ones as default. All of these changes have been made in commit 0f988eadd9cbca055966e4418a704b85e19999ff.  \r\nMaybe it could be a better idea to roll back the whole commit but I'm not really sure about that.\r\n\r\n### Testing Done\r\n\r\n<!-- BEFORE SUBMITTING YOUR PR, MAKE SURE TO FOLLOW THESE STEPS: -->\r\n<!-- 1.

Because it has the same height as the element that it wraps, it can only contain the following Bulma elements:\r\n> \r\n> * `input`\r\n> * `select`\r\n> * `button`\r\n> * `icon`\r\n\r\nHowever, in reading the blog post from 2017 where [control was split into field and control in v.04.0](https://bulma.io/2017/03/10/new-field-element/), the examples cover using a `span` inside a control and why I can't have a complex control of HTML elements inside a control element:\r\n\r\n```html\r\n<!-- Before -->\r\n<label class=\"label\">Username</label>\r\n<p class=\"control has-icon has-icon-right\">\r\n  <input class=\"input is-success\" type=\"text\" placeholder=\"Text input\" value=\"bulma\">\r\n  <span class=\"icon is-small\">\r\n    <i class=\"fas fa-check\"></i>\r\n  </span>\r\n  <span class=\"help is-success\">This username is available</span>\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<!-- After -->\r\n<div class=\"field\">\r\n  <label class=\"label\">Username</label>\r\n  <p class=\"control has-icon has-icon-right\">\r\n    <input class=\"input is-success\" type=\"text\" placeholder=\"Text input\" value=\"bulma\">\r\n    <span class=\"icon is-small\">\r\n      <i class=\"fas fa-check\"></i>\r\n    </span>\r\n  </p>\r\n  <p class=\"help is-success\">This username is available</p>\r\n</div>\r\n```\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n### Steps to Reproduce\r\n\r\nNot exactly steps to reproduce, but additional context: I'm asking specifically because I want to use Bulma with Telerik Kendo UI, and Kendo UI translates it's \"`<kendo-dropdownlist>` element into something like the following for an empty dropdown list, and its top-level elements are span and input, which violates the rules in the Bulma documentation HOWEVER everything seems to \"work ok\" - I think this is because the span is actually the floating listbox and therefore not part of the actual layout rules applied by Bulma, but it's been about 3+ years since I last did Web apps:\r\n\r\n```html\r\n<div class=\"field\">\r\n  <label class=\"label\" for=\"Status\" id=\"Status_label\">Status</label>\r\n  <p class=\"control\">\r\n    <span title=\"\" class=\"k-widget k-dropdown\" unselectable=\"on\" role=\"listbox\" aria-haspopup=\"true\" aria-expanded=\"false\" tabindex=\"0\" aria-owns=\"Status_listbox\" aria-labelledby=\"Status_label\" aria-live=\"polite\" aria-disabled=\"false\" aria-busy=\"false\" style=\"\" data-children-count=\"1\">\r\n      <span unselectable=\"on\" class=\"k-dropdown-wrap k-state-default\">\r\n        <span unselectable=\"on\" class=\"k-input\" data-children-count=\"0\"></span>\r\n        <span unselectable=\"on\" class=\"k-select\" aria-label=\"select\" data-children-count=\"0\">\r\n        <span class=\"k-icon k-i-arrow-60-down\"></span>\r\n      </span>\r\n    </span>\r\n    <input id=\"Status\" name=\"Status\" type=\"text\" value=\"\" data-lpignore=\"true\" autocomplete=\"off\" data-role=\"dropdownlist\" style=\"display: none;\">\r\n   </span>\r\n  </p>\r\n</div>\r\n```\r\n\r\n### Expected behavior\r\n\r\nClarify documentation that a control can contain the four elements, or any element that is not directly in the layout of the control element (e.g., floating above as in a pop-up control)\r\n\r\n### Actual behavior\r\n\r\nIt seems to be OK to have spans and other elements, as long as it's not directly in the element's \"has layout\" path.  But, again, it's been 3+ years since I've built a Web app, so I may be overlooking something, especially with Flexbox, as this is my first Flexbox app.\r\n","Url":"https://github.com/jgthms/bulma/issues/2728","RelatedDescription":"Open issue \"[Question] Is the documented limitations for Control correct or is it overly generalized?\" (#2728)"},{"Id":"532198717","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2019-12-03T20:35:38","Actor":"dangowans","Number":"2727","RawContent":null,"Title":"Update links.json","State":"closed","Body":"Adding a link to the list component.\r\n\r\n<!-- PLEASE READ THE FOLLOWING INSTRUCTIONS -->\r\n<!-- DO NOT REBUILD THE CSS OUTPUT IN YOUR PR -->\r\n\r\n<!-- Choose one of the following: -->\r\nThis is a **documentation fix**.\r\nI found a reference to the list documentation through Google, but no link in the Bulma documentation.\r\n\r\n### Proposed solution\r\n\r\nAdd a link in the documentation.\r\n\r\n### Tradeoffs\r\n\r\nNone.\r\n\r\n### Testing Done\r\n\r\nNone.\r\n\r\n### Changelog updated?\r\n\r\nNo.\r\n","Url":"https://github.com/jgthms/bulma/pull/2727","RelatedDescription":"Closed or merged PR \"Update links.json\" (#2727)"},{"Id":"532009001","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2019-12-03T14:05:26","Actor":"jhuettinger","Number":"2726","RawContent":null,"Title":"Navbar improvement","State":"open","Body":"<!-- PLEASE READ THE FOLLOWING INSTRUCTIONS -->\r\n<!-- DO NOT REBUILD THE CSS OUTPUT IN YOUR PR -->\r\n\r\n<!-- Choose one of the following: -->\r\nThis is a **improvement**.\r\n<!-- New feature?

While that's certainly true, it still has some way to go.\r\n\r\nhttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Semantic_HTML.\r\n\r\n@jgthms argues that semantic HTML does not apply to class names. That is simply not the case, as Bulma's classes need to be inside the HTML. \r\n\r\nGood semantic HTML means it should have tags and classes that reflect the structure or meaning of its content, and not its looks. Although the nature of CSS frameworks require us to use classes that represents looks, it doesn't mean we can't use meaningful names or have clean structures.\r\n\r\nIn the the far future, however, we might see CSS frameworks where classes being assigned to perfectly semantic HTML through some middle layer. But for now, let's clean up Bulma.\r\n\r\n- Bulma general requirement of tag inside tag inside tag is one example of it polluting the structure and meaning of the HTML.\r\n\r\n- Class names with unclear meaning such as `is-1`, `is-2` etc. These might need to work in tandem with other classes that provide more meaning, but alone they don't make any sense. Also, we should avoid using numbers where possible and use `small`, `medium`, `big` etc.\r\n\r\n- Another is the use of 90s style tags such as `<strong>`, `<small>`, `<hr>` etc. when these could be classes such as `has-strong-text`, `has-small-text`, `has-horizontal-ruler` etc.\r\n\r\n- Sometimes unclear where classes should be assigned. Directly on the element or through one of its parents? Depending on the situation, sometimes the former works and sometimes the latter. It should work on both.\r\n\r\n- There should be no need for unnecessary repetition of classes such as `navbar-item` when it should be obvious that items within the navbar are just that - items. In addition, in semantic HTML `<ul>` and `<li>` would be the more proper.\r\n\r\nIe. why can't this:\r\n\r\n```\r\n<section class=\"hero is-white\">\r\n  <div class=\"hero-head\">\r\n    <nav class=\"navbar is-transparent\">\r\n      <div class=\"container\">\r\n        <div class=\"navbar-brand\">\r\n          <a href=\"#\" class=\"title navbar-item\">MyLogo</a> <-- Bulma should know this is the logo since its parent's name is \"navbar-brand\"\r\n        </div>\r\n        <div class=\"navbar-menu\">\r\n          <div class=\"navbar-end\">\r\n            <a href=\"#\" class=\"navbar-item\">Link 1</a> <-- Same here, Bulma should know this is a navbar item\r\n            <a href=\"#\" class=\"navbar-item\">Link 2</a>\r\n          </div>\r\n        </div>\r\n      </div>\r\n    </nav>\r\n  </div>\r\n</section>\r\n```\r\n\r\nBe more like this:\r\n```\r\n<section>\r\n  <div class=\"container hero is-white is-transparent\">\r\n    <nav>\r\n      <div class=\"brand is-left\">\r\n        <a href=\"#\" class=\"title\">MyLogo</a> \r\n      </div>\r\n      <ul class=\"menu is-right\">\r\n        <li><a href=\"#\">Link 1</a></li>\r\n        <li><a href=\"#\">Link 2</a></li>\r\n      </ul>\r\n    </nav>\r\n  </div>\r\n</section>\r\n```\r\n\r\nHopefully Bulma, with all its funding and public backing, can make something like this happen in the near future.\r\n\r\nThanks!\r\n\r\n--VVGG\r\n\r\nP.S.
