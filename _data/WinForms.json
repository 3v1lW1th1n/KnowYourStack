The types you mentioned are not added in Core 3.0, we are still finalizing the list of the APIs for Core 3.0, so we'd like to know more about your scenarios. Could you tell us how you are using these types in your app?\r\n\r\nAlso if you haven't done it yet, I would suggest running [Portability Analyzer](https://blogs.msdn.microsoft.com/dotnet/2018/08/08/are-your-windows-forms-and-wpf-applications-ready-for-net-core-3-0/) that will show all APIs in your app that are not yet included in .NET Core 3.0.\n\n---\n\n@jnm2 commented on [Tue Sep 18 2018](https://github.com/dotnet/core-sdk/issues/79#issuecomment-422492997)\n\nHi Olia,\r\n\r\nOur applications depend on DevExpress's End User Report Designer ([docs](https://docs.devexpress.com/XtraReports/10715/create-end-user-reporting-applications/winforms-reporting/end-user-report-designer)). DevExpress built it on top of the System.ComponentModel/IDesignerHost/CodeDOM set of abstractions, very much like the Windows Forms designer itself.\r\n\r\nThis designer ships for our users at runtime (as the name suggests). We've written custom reporting elements that integrate with it. Since DevExpress based the designer heavily on System.Design, our integrations with the report designer are also tied to System.Design. We're hoping that this doesn't keep us from moving to .NET Core.\r\n\r\nIn this report, see especially `DevExpress.XtraReports.v17.2.Extensions.dll` which houses their End User Report Designer: [Portability report for DevExpress dependencies.xlsx](https://github.com/dotnet/core-sdk/files/2393989/Portability.report.for.DevExpress.dependencies.xlsx)\r\n\r\nThat's what DevExpress's code needs. Our code, which merely integrates with DevExpress's report designer, ends up directly using these types:\r\n\r\n<details>\r\n\r\n```\r\nT:System.ComponentModel.Design.CollectionEditor\r\nT:System.ComponentModel.Design.CollectionEditor.CollectionForm\r\nT:System.ComponentModel.Design.ComponentDesigner\r\nT:System.ComponentModel.Design.DesignerActionItem\r\nT:System.ComponentModel.Design.DesignerActionItemCollection\r\nT:System.ComponentModel.Design.DesignerActionList\r\nT:System.ComponentModel.Design.DesignerActionListCollection\r\nT:System.ComponentModel.Design.DesignerActionMethodItem\r\nT:System.ComponentModel.Design.DesignerActionPropertyItem\r\nT:System.ComponentModel.Design.DesignerActionTextItem\r\nT:System.ComponentModel.Design.DesignerActionUIService\r\nT:System.ComponentModel.Design.DesignerActionUIStateChangeEventArgs\r\nT:System.ComponentModel.Design.DesignerActionUIStateChangeEventHandler\r\nT:System.ComponentModel.Design.DesignerActionUIStateChangeType\r\nT:System.ComponentModel.Design.MultilineStringEditor\r\nT:System.ComponentModel.Design.Serialization.CodeDomSerializer\r\nT:System.ComponentModel.Design.Serialization.CodeDomSerializerBase\r\nT:System.ComponentModel.Design.Serialization.DesignerSerializationManager\r\nT:System.Drawing.Design.IToolboxService\r\nT:System.Drawing.Design.ToolboxItem\r\nT:System.Drawing.Design.ToolboxItemCollection\r\nT:System.Windows.Forms.Design.AnchorEditor\r\nT:System.Windows.Forms.Design.Behavior.Behavior\r\nT:System.Windows.Forms.Design.Behavior.BehaviorService\r\nT:System.Windows.Forms.Design.Behavior.ControlBodyGlyph\r\nT:System.Windows.Forms.Design.Behavior.GlyphSelectionType\r\nT:System.Windows.Forms.Design.ControlDesigner\r\nT:System.Windows.Forms.Design.ParentControlDesigner\r\nT:System.Windows.Forms.Design.ScrollableControlDesigner\r\nT:System.Windows.Forms.Design.SelectionRules\r\n```\r\n\r\n</details><br/>\r\n\r\nAnd

I'll get our engineers to look at it and follow up with you.\n\n---\n\n@filipnavara commented on [Tue Sep 18 2018](https://github.com/dotnet/core-sdk/issues/79#issuecomment-422533340)\n\nWe have similar dependencies for our custom WinForms controls too. The missing API set is nearly identical. In our case they are design-time only and we have a build option to strip them out of release builds, so we are still able to run our application on .NET Core 3 alpha today (with some additional fixes discussed in the CoreFX repository issues).\r\n\r\nI suspect this will come up quite often and it has to be addressed in one way or another. I was hoping that this will eventually come later when the WinForms design-time support is brought in later preview. I'm taking a wait-and-see approach on this one, but wanted to express some support that the scenario is probably common. \n\n---\n\n@OliaG commented on [Tue Sep 18 2018](https://github.com/dotnet/core-sdk/issues/79#issuecomment-422544930)\n\nThank you Filip!\r\n@Tanya-Solyanik\n\n---\n\n@lextm commented on [Thu Dec 06 2018](https://github.com/dotnet/core-sdk/issues/79#issuecomment-444999032)\n\nI think `<Reference Include=\"System.Design\" />` should not work by design. There is no GAC for .NET Core, so there is no place to resolve such assemblies.\r\n\r\nIdeally such should come in Windows Compatibility Pack for .NET Core, or Microsoft.WindowsDesktop.App.\n\n---\n\n@jnm2 commented on [Thu Dec 06 2018](https://github.com/dotnet/core-sdk/issues/79#issuecomment-445001142)\n\n@lextm I was thinking System.Design should be part of `<FrameworkReference Include=\"Microsoft.DesktopUI\" />`.\n\n---\n\n@damageboy commented on [Sat Dec 08 2018](https://github.com/dotnet/core-sdk/issues/79#issuecomment-445499240)\n\nSame here...\r\nTrying to test our WinForms stuff in .NET Core 3.0 and hitting up on these missing APIs as part of property-grid related runtime support.\r\n\r\nIn my case the missing types are:\r\n* `CollectionEditor`\r\n* `ObjectSelectorEditor`\r\n\n\n---\n\n@dreddy-work commented on [Sat Dec 08 2018](https://github.com/dotnet/core-sdk/issues/79#issuecomment-445501174)\n\nWe will be taking a look at porting these editors soon. \n\n---\n\n@livarcocc commented on [Sun Dec 09 2018](https://github.com/dotnet/core-sdk/issues/79#issuecomment-445561874)\n\n@dreddy-work should we move this issue to dotnet/winforms?\n\n---\n\n@dreddy-work commented on [Sun Dec 09 2018](https://github.com/dotnet/core-sdk/issues/79#issuecomment-445562090)\n\n@livarcocc , yes please. we will be looking into these coming week.\n\n---\n\n@damageboy commented on [Sun Dec 09 2018](https://github.com/dotnet/core-sdk/issues/79#issuecomment-445562370)\n\nJust to be completely clear. My current issue is simply compiling custom property grid editors that inherit from the said `*Editor` base classes as I have a property grid that presents custom editors @ runtime (not at design time).\r\n\r\nThis is not a VS designer issue, at least as far as I am concerned..\n\n---\n\n@dreddy-work commented on [Sun Dec 09 2018](https://github.com/dotnet/core-sdk/issues/79#issuecomment-445564326)\n\n@damageboy , I understand. When we were porting editors to netcore, our analysis was, the above said editors will be used mostly at the design time and hence prioritized that way. Now that we see runtime usage for these editors, we are discussing to port these editors to net core in the coming weeks.\n\n","Url":"https://github.com/dotnet/winforms/issues/221","RelatedDescription":"Open issue \"How to reference System.Design\" (#221)"},{"Id":"389388140","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2018-12-10T17:10:10","Actor":"AdamYoblick","Number":"220","RawContent":null,"Title":"disable test signing while arcade is looking into issue","State":"closed","Body":"","Url":"https://github.com/dotnet/winforms/pull/220","RelatedDescription":"Closed or merged PR \"disable test signing while arcade is looking into issue\" (#220)"}],"ResultType":"GitHubIssue"}},"RunOn":"2018-12-17T05:31:30.6662828Z","RunDurationInMilliseconds":1040}
