I am working on a solution with 600+ projects, when restore is run without a preexisting src.bld directory, the process takes about 10 minutes.  Restore is being done for .NET Framework 4.6 and UAP 10.0.\r\n\r\nI've pulled the nuget source code and run the restore process from Visual Studio to try to get an idea of what is taking so long.  There seem to be two main culprits, RemoteDependencyWalker.CreateGraphNode() (in RemoteDependencyWalker.cs), and GraphOperations.Analyze() (in GraphOperations.cs) in this case called from RestoreTargetGraph.Create() (in RestoreTargetGraph.cs).  More specifically RemoteDependencyWalker.CreateGraphNode() seems to recursively traverse a dependency graph, and is running 30,000 - 40,000 times when resolving UAP 10.0 dependencies (.NET Framework dependencies do not seem to result in so many calls, frequenty on the order of magnitude of 100).  Each time takes a substantial fraction of a second, and is happening maybe 10 or so times per project.\r\n\r\nI'm still not totally comfortable with what's happening in the code, but I thought I would ask, is this an issue which is known of and is there any possibility or plan to improve perf?  I also noticed that in RuntimeGraph.cs there are a number of comments related to possible perf impacting improvements, would these have any impact on this workload?\r\n\r\nThanks so much in advance for any insight on this!"},{"Id":"6900816174","Type":"IssuesEvent","CreatedAt":"2017-11-24T21:58:26","Actor":"Legends","Repository":"NuGet/Home","Organization":"NuGet","RawContent":null,"RelatedAction":"opened","RelatedUrl":"https://github.com/NuGet/Home/issues/6223","RelatedDescription":"Opened issue \"Cannot install entityframework nuget package\" (#6223) at NuGet/Home","RelatedBody":"## Details about Problem\r\n\r\nNuGet product used (NuGet.exe | VS UI | Package Manager Console | dotnet.exe):\r\n\r\nNuGet Version: 3.4.4.1321\r\n\r\ndotnet.exe --version : 2.0.3\r\n\r\nVS version (if appropriate): VS2017 v15.4.4\r\n\r\nOS version : Win10 v1703 (OS Build 15063.726)\r\n \r\n## Detailed repro steps so we can see the same problem\r\n\r\n\r\nI have deleted all Entityframework references and dependencies \r\n\r\n 1. from the project references, \r\n 2. from the packages.config and \r\n 3. from the packages folder of the solution.\r\n\r\n\r\n    Install-Package EntityFramework -Version 6.1.3\r\n\r\nWhat happens now is, that the entityframework package is added again to the packages folder, but without the dll!\r\n\r\n**Results in this error:**\r\n> Attempting to gather dependency information for package\r\n> 'EntityFramework.6.1.3' with respect to project 'MyApp.Web', targeting\r\n> '.NETFramework,Version=v4.5.2' Gathering dependency information took\r\n> 473,82 ms Attempting to resolve dependencies for package\r\n> 'EntityFramework.6.1.3' with DependencyBehavior 'Lowest' Resolving\r\n> dependency information took 0 ms Resolving actions to install package\r\n\r\n> 'EntityFramework.6.1.3' Resolved actions to install package\r\n> 'EntityFramework.6.1.3' Found package 'EntityFramework 6.1.3' in\r\n> 'C:\\Users\\Admin\\Downloads\\MyAppNET-3.0.3\\MyAppNET-3.0.3\\src\\packages'.\r\n\r\n> Package 'EntityFramework.6.1.3' already exists in folder\r\n> 'C:\\Users\\Admin\\Downloads\\MyAppNET-3.0.3\\MyAppNET-3.0.3\\src\\packages'\r\n\r\n> Install failed.

As we [announced](https://blog.nuget.org/20170907/Changes-to-NuGet-dot-org-service-management-and-performance-improvements-in-China.html) two weeks ago, the NuGet.org service is now a part of Microsoft. The NuGet open source codebase (both the NuGet gallery and the NuGet client) will remain open source and continue as .NET Foundation supported projects under the same terms as before.\r\n\r\nWe encourage you to read the full [Terms of Use](https://www.nuget.org/policies/Terms) and [Privacy Statement](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkId=521839), as well as the [blog post](https://blog.nuget.org/20170907/Changes-to-NuGet-dot-org-service-management-and-performance-improvements-in-China.html) about the changes. For your convenience, below is a quick summary.\r\n\r\nThere are no changes to the way you publish and consume packages from NuGet.org. The Terms of Use and Privacy Statement have been updated to reflect the change in ownership, as well as how Microsoft will process the data collected, and manage copyright and trademark infringement notices.\r\n\r\nOur goal is to provide an agile and reliable global service, and we remain fully committed to ensuring a healthy and open ecosystem around NuGet.
