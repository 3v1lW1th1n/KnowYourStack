This causes the `.is-expanded` modifier to do nothing on controls within the `.field`, which is undesirable.\r\n\r\nThis behavior makes `.field`s fullwidth in `.panel-block`s, which allows `.is-expanded` to have the intended effect.\r\n\r\n### Tradeoffs\r\n\r\nNone that I can think of, as fields without any `is-expanded` controls will behave the same as before.\r\n\r\n### Testing Done\r\n\r\nYes, rebuilt and confirmed it behaves as described. If a `.field` does not have any `.control.is-expanded` children, it displays the same. If it does have an expanded child, it displays with the full width of the panel.\r\n\r\n### Changelog updated?\r\n\r\nYes.\r\n","Url":"https://github.com/jgthms/bulma/pull/2587","RelatedDescription":"Open PR \"Fix `is-expanded` modifier for fields in panel blocks (Fixes #2501)\" (#2587)"},{"Id":"476617718","IsPullRequest":false,"CreatedAt":"2019-08-05T05:20:37","Actor":"scheinercc","Number":"2586","RawContent":null,"Title":"Expose $column-gap var in documentation","State":"closed","Body":"I guess this could go somewhere here: https://bulma.io/documentation/columns/basics/ ?\r\nhttps://github.com/jgthms/bulma/blob/a413a7086a36dbfe57bf4d62c7ee2f4e63377484/sass/grid/columns.sass#L1","Url":"https://github.com/jgthms/bulma/issues/2586","RelatedDescription":"Closed issue \"Expose $column-gap var in documentation\" (#2586)"},{"Id":"476608305","IsPullRequest":false,"CreatedAt":"2019-08-04T23:59:32","Actor":"laszukdawid","Number":"2585","RawContent":null,"Title":"What sass file contain?","State":"open","Body":"<!-- PLEASE READ THE FOLLOWING INSTRUCTIONS -->\r\n\r\n<!-- Choose one of the following: -->\r\nThis is about **the Docs**.\r\n\r\n### Overview of the problem\r\n\r\n<!-- UNCOMMENT THE APPROPRIATE LINES -->\r\n\r\nThis is about the Bulma **CSS framework**\r\nThis is about the Bulma **Docs** \r\n\r\n### Description\r\n\r\nDocs keep on saying \"Import only what you need from Bulma\" but I cannot find any explanation what files contain what. Not only I'm unable to find in the doc a list of files in the package but it also seems that some components consist of more than a single file, e.g. `tile` is not only in the `bulma/sass/grid/tiles.sass` (which also I'd expect from the doc to be rather in `layout` instead of `grid`.\r\n\r\nMaybe that's obvious to people who are working with sass all the time but tbh as a new person, to me this is a major blocker. There are a plenty other css frameworks. I still don't know what to do in this case, so I'm going with the most popular answer on the internet which is to include `@import 'bulma/bulma.sass';` in each `sass` file for each component.\r\n\r\n### Expected behavior\r\n\r\nAn explanation on which files to include when using certain components.\r\n","Url":"https://github.com/jgthms/bulma/issues/2585","RelatedDescription":"Open issue \"What sass file contain?\" (#2585)"},{"Id":"476545227","IsPullRequest":false,"CreatedAt":"2019-08-04T11:59:49","Actor":"farshad-sadri","Number":"2584","RawContent":null,"Title":"Adding Flex Display Helpers ","State":"open","Body":"<!-- PLEASE READ THE FOLLOWING INSTRUCTIONS -->\r\n\r\n<!-- Choose one of the following: -->\r\nThis is about **Bulma**.\r\n\r\n<!-- Is it about Bulma or about the Docs? -->\r\n<!-- Is it a bug/feature/question or do you need help? -->\r\n<!-- If it's a bug, is it a browser bug? -->\r\n\r\n### Overview of the problem\r\n\r\n<!-- UNCOMMENT THE APPROPRIATE LINES -->\r\n\r\nThis is about the Bulma **CSS framework** .

This PR adds support for all a tag psuedo-classes along with utility classes to emulate their functionality for testing purposes.

Are there alternative ones? -->\r\n<!-- Think of performance, build time, usability, complexity, coupling…) -->\r\nThe main tradeoff is whether these styles should be applied by default, as some users do not want to have to override these styles once in place. I believe that placing this enhancement behind a flag eliminates this issue.\r\n\r\n### Testing Done\r\n\r\nDid a test builds with the flag off and on. Verified that no additional css is rendered when the flag is off, and the expected css is rendered when it is on.\r\n\r\n<!-- BEFORE SUBMITTING YOUR PR, MAKE SURE TO FOLLOW THESE STEPS: -->\r\n<!-- 1.
