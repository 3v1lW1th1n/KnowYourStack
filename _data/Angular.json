navigate to foo.com/123/child/child2 inside Child1Component.\r\nI was thinking child module is apart from app module and it's lazy loaded so this code will be working correctly.\r\n\r\n>child2.component.ts\r\n```typescript\r\n...\r\nconstructor(private router: Router) {}\r\n\r\n...\r\nthis.router.navigate(['child/child2']);\r\n...\r\n```\r\n\r\nBut once I launched the application, it is navigated to foo.com/child/child2.\r\nI was expecting foo.com/123/child/child2.\r\n\r\nIf I make these changes, it's working as expected.\r\n>child2.component.ts\r\n```typescript\r\n...\r\nprivate parentId;\r\nconstructor(private router: Router, private route: ActivatedRoute) {\r\n

parentId from the URL inside the component and navigate using it.\r\nBut I don't like this approach because it's not scalable.\r\nIf I change the Route Param name or add some more routing params, I have to update the child components for routing as well.\r\n\r\nIs there any better approach for handling routing in child components defined on child module

In @ngtools/webpack is it still emit all files or just blocked? If it is emitting is it possible to see all files?\r\n\r\nI think it takes a lot of time for the step\r\nAngularCompilerPlugin._make: 67271.619ms. \r\nDo you have any idea how can we improve this time? \r\nIs it possible to add more logs to see what actually consuming AngularCompilerPlugin?\r\n\r\n### Describe the solution you'd like\r\nAdd more logs for AngularCompilerPlugin initial step to find which task takes more time.\r\n","Url":"https://github.com/angular/angular-cli/issues/15987","RelatedDescription":"Closed issue \"@ngtools/webpack build do not wait until AngularCompilerPlugin._make finish like in angular-cli\" (#15987)"},{"Id":"515851785","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2019-11-01T01:04:43","Actor":"clydin","Number":"16004","RawContent":null,"Title":"fix(@angular-devkit/build-angular): allow missing i18nFile option when using i18nLocale","State":"open","Body":"Improves support for the deprecated i18n options when used with Ivy.","Url":"https://github.com/angular/angular-cli/pull/16004","RelatedDescription":"Open PR \"fix(@angular-devkit/build-angular): allow missing i18nFile option when using i18nLocale\" (#16004)"},{"Id":"515793739","IsPullRequest":false,"CreatedAt":"2019-10-31T22:41:14","Actor":"ShawnOzark","Number":"16003","RawContent":null,"Title":"Add interface to cover UpdateRecorderBase's \"apply\" method","State":"open","Body":"<!--üîÖüîÖüîÖüîÖüîÖüîÖüîÖüîÖüîÖüîÖüîÖüîÖüîÖüîÖüîÖüîÖüîÖüîÖüîÖüîÖüîÖüîÖüîÖüîÖüîÖüîÖüîÖüîÖüîÖüîÖüîÖ\r\n\r\nOh hi there! üòÑ\r\n\r\nTo expedite issue processing please search open and closed issues before submitting a new one.\r\nExisting issues often contain information about workarounds, resolution, or progress updates.\r\n\r\nüîÖüîÖüîÖüîÖüîÖüîÖüîÖüîÖüîÖüîÖüîÖüîÖüîÖüîÖüîÖüîÖüîÖüîÖüîÖüîÖüîÖüîÖüîÖüîÖüîÖüîÖüîÖüîÖüîÖüîÖüîÖüîÖüîÖ-->\r\n\r\n\r\n# üöÄ Feature request\r\n\r\n\r\n### Command (mark with an `x`)\r\n<!-- Can you pin-point the command or commands that are relevant for this feature request? -->\r\n<!-- ‚úçÔ∏èedit: -->\r\n```\r\n- [ ] new\r\n- [ ] build\r\n- [ ] serve\r\n- [ ] test\r\n- [ ] e2e\r\n- [x] generate\r\n- [ ] add\r\n- [ ] update\r\n- [ ] lint\r\n- [ ] xi18n\r\n- [ ] run\r\n- [ ] config\r\n- [ ] help\r\n- [ ] version\r\n- [ ] doc\r\n```\r\n\r\n### Description\r\nCurrently when writing schematics, the `HostTree` expects an `UpdateRecorderBase` for it's `commitUpdate(...)` function.

with parcel or some other bundler. \r\n\r\nWebpack is old \r\n\r\n- On a frequent basis webpack gets out of sync with the current state of the project and will fall behind 1 or N (yes it really can be unlimited in how far back) builds. You're then coding while working with a \"phantom build\" or \"ghost build\" a served state of the app which is 1 or N compiles behind what you currently have on disk / in your IDE. this is impossible to flag/debug. You must be aware this can happen and remember to think about it constantly when something iffy is happening (old state of the code clearly on page / not expected behavior) and react by killing all npm instances on your PC and compiling from scratch.\r\n\r\nWorst part about this is that it can sometimes be chimeric : a little of the current state a little of an old state. which leads to truly aberrant behavior.\r\nYou can waste a lot of time debugging your code over this when in reality your code was 100% correct.\r\n- Speaking of time, webpack is very slow. If you use rollup, parcel or another solution on your angular cli project, initial compilation will be super-fast by comparison and the following re-compilations even more so.\r\n- Webpack has loads of complicated config. Parcel for one has NO config. with that being a possibility why are we trudging on with a dated config-heavy solution?\r\n\r\n\r\n### Describe the solution you'd like\r\n\r\nParcel would do nicely but I would also be happy with [rollup](https://rollupjs.org/guide/en/) or [pika](https://www.pika.dev/about/) \r\n","Url":"https://github.com/angular/angular-cli/issues/15981","RelatedDescription":"Closed issue \"Integrate Parcel üì¶üöÄ\" (#15981)"},{"Id":"514409049","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2019-10-30T05:26:42","Actor":"renovate[bot]","Number":"15979","RawContent":null,"Title":"build: update pacote to version 10.1.1","State":"open","Body":"This PR contains the following updates:\n\n| Package | Type | Update | Change |\n|---|---|---|---|\n| [pacote](https://togithub.com/npm/pacote) | dependencies | major | [`9.5.8` -> `10.1.1`](https://renovatebot.com/diffs/npm/pacote/9.5.8/10.1.1) |\n\n---\n\n### Release Notes\n\n<details>\n<summary>npm/pacote</summary>\n\n### [`v10.1.1`](https://togithub.com/npm/pacote/compare/v10.1.0...v10.1.1)\n\n[Compare Source](https://togithub.com/npm/pacote/compare/v10.1.0...v10.1.1)\n\n### [`v10.1.0`](https://togithub.com/npm/pacote/compare/v10.0.0...v10.1.0)\n\n[Compare Source](https://togithub.com/npm/pacote/compare/v10.0.0...v10.1.0)\n\n### [`v10.0.0`](https://togithub.com/npm/pacote/compare/v9.5.9...v10.0.0)\n\n[Compare Source](https://togithub.com/npm/pacote/compare/v9.5.9...v10.0.0)\n\n### [`v9.5.9`](https://togithub.com/npm/pacote/compare/v9.5.8...v9.5.9)\n\n[Compare Source](https://togithub.com/npm/pacote/compare/v9.5.8...v9.5.9)\n\n</details>\n\n---\n\n### Renovate configuration\n\n:date: **Schedule**: \"after 10pm every weekday,before 4am every weekday,every weekend\" in timezone America/Tijuana.\n\n:vertical_traffic_light: **Automerge**: Disabled by config.

Any user selection can be meaningful, not only when the selected option changes.\r\n\r\nA concrete use case is when you are implementing a \"smart\" control that switches from a simple label to an actual select when you click on it and then switches back to a simple label when a selection is made (possibly confirming the currently selected option).\r\n\r\nWithout the requested feature, the mat-select element will remain visible each time the user confirms the currently selected option, thus breaking the kind of UX that I described.\r\n","Url":"https://github.com/angular/components/issues/17534","RelatedDescription":"Open issue \"mat-select should have a \"selectionMade\" output\" (#17534)"},{"Id":"513602569","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2019-10-28T23:30:49","Actor":"Splaktar","Number":"17532","RawContent":null,"Title":"docs(cdk/platform): remove header in example from TOC","State":"closed","Body":"`h2`s aren't anchored or added to the TOC.\r\n\r\nFixes extra TOC entry here for `Platform Information:` from the example\r\n<img width=\"1111\" alt=\"Screen Shot 2019-10-28 at 15 59 42\" src=\"https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/3506071/67724336-fb20f900-f99b-11e9-90e5-410e912054e3.png\">\r\n","Url":"https://github.com/angular/components/pull/17532","RelatedDescription":"Closed or merged PR \"docs(cdk/platform): remove header in example from TOC\" (#17532)"}],"ResultType":"GitHubIssue"}},"RunOn":"2019-11-01T05:30:07.5272835Z","RunDurationInMilliseconds":2663}
