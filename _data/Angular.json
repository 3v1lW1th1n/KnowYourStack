Angular's DI also helps put that logic into your components. \r\n\r\nWhile it's pretty good, it is a unique style of DI and has limitations. Limitations like a lack of dependency inversion. We depend on concrete implementations, and as a result there is a testing suite built by the Angular team to facilitate this.\r\n\r\n_What I **love**, and I mean absolutely **love**_ about Angular is how phenomenal its templating syntax is. I'm not joking, it's honestly the most ergonomic expression of presentational concerns I have ever worked with.\r\n\r\nWhat I dislike is that when I write an application, it's an Angular application.

There are two cases shown here:\r\n1) with a fieldset getting disabled (thus unfocusing the button) straight up on the parent component, which works fine\r\n2) fieldset buried inside a 'disabler' component, wrapping around its ng-content to disable stuff that it is wrapped around. This causes expression changed error, even though change detection is similarly triggered by HostListener on focusout when button gets disabled \r\n\r\n<!--\r\nIf StackBlitz is not suitable for reproduction of your issue, please create a minimal GitHub repository with the reproduction of the issue.\r\nA good way to make a minimal reproduction is to create a new app via `ng new repro-app` and add the minimum possible code to show the problem. \r\nShare the link to the repo below along with step-by-step instructions to reproduce the problem, as well as expected and actual behavior.\r\n\r\nIssues that don't have enough info and can't be reproduced will be closed.\r\n\r\nYou can read more about issue submission guidelines here: https://github.com/angular/angular/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md#-submitting-an-issue\r\n-->\r\n\r\n## üî• Exception or Error\r\n<pre><code>ExpressionChangedAfterItHasBeenCheckedError\r\n</code></pre>\r\n\r\n\r\n## üåç  Your Environment\r\n\r\n**Angular Version:**\r\n<pre><code>7+\r\n</code></pre>\r\n\r\n**Anything else relevant?**\r\n<!-- ‚úçÔ∏èIs this a browser specific issue?

I tried just doing this with a \"hello world\" app and the problem is not there (obviously that would have been caught), so it's something about my application's structure or additional libraries or something that confuses the 8.2 compiler.\r\n\r\nWhile the app is not huge, it's not trivial, and I can't make it public on github.  I don't really know where to begin to try to pare it down.  and just reverting to 8.1.3 of the cli removes the issue.  Is there any way to maybe turn on a debug log or something of that nature so I could provide info on what the cli is doing when it consumes all that memory? I turned on --verbose, but the output doesn't look significantly different than 8.1.3 and it doesn't continue to output anything once the incremental compile is done even though the memory use is continuing to grow.\r\n\r\nOtherwise, I guess I can start chopping bits out and see if there is something obvious that makes the problem go away.\r\n\r\n\r\n## üî• Exception or Error\r\n<pre><code>\r\n<!-- If the issue is accompanied by an exception or an error, please share it below: -->\r\n<!-- ‚úçÔ∏è-->\r\n#\r\n# Fatal error in , line 0\r\n# Fatal process out of memory: Zone\r\n#\r\n#\r\n#\r\n#FailureMessage Object: 00000024574F9F00\r\n</code></pre>\r\n\r\n\r\n## üåç Your Environment\r\n<pre><code>\r\n<!-- run `ng version` and paste output below -->\r\n<!-- ‚úçÔ∏è-->\r\nAngular CLI: 8.2.1\r\nNode: 12.6.0\r\nOS: win32 x64\r\nAngular: 8.2.1\r\n... animations, cli, common, compiler, compiler-cli, core, forms\r\n... language-service, platform-browser, platform-browser-dynamic\r\n... router, service-worker\r\n\r\nPackage                            Version\r\n------------------------------------------------------------\r\n@angular-devkit/architect          0.802.1\r\n@angular-devkit/build-angular      0.802.1\r\n@angular-devkit/build-optimizer    0.802.1\r\n@angular-devkit/build-webpack      0.802.1\r\n@angular-devkit/core               8.2.1\r\n@angular-devkit/schematics         8.2.1\r\n@angular/cdk                       8.1.2\r\n@angular/material                  8.1.2\r\n@angular/material-moment-adapter   8.1.2\r\n@angular/pwa                       0.802.1\r\n@ngtools/webpack                   8.2.1\r\n@schematics/angular                8.2.1\r\n@schematics/update                 0.802.1\r\nrxjs                               6.5.2\r\ntypescript                         3.5.3\r\nwebpack                            4.38.0\r\n</code></pre>\r\n\r\n**Anything else relevant?**\r\n<!-- ‚úçÔ∏èIs this a browser specific issue?

dependency to core.\r\n\r\nIt would have been nice for the CLI to understand my intentions and either perform the right commands for me, or guide me to the docs site or upgrade site to help me correct

However, when doing \".clear()\", it did not kill of any \"not yet displayed\" announcements.\r\n\r\nThis is particularly painful when cleaning up unittets, as the announcements would appear after the \"liveAnnouncer.clear()\" \"snackBar.dismiss()\" calls in our afterEach.\r\n\r\nYou‚Äôll notice that in the unittests, you were manually calling \"ngOnDestroy()\", probably to work around said issue. Just calling \".clear()\" is fine now, and will also be fine to clients.","Url":"https://github.com/angular/components/pull/16725","RelatedDescription":"Open PR \"fix(a11y): unable to clear pending message using clear method\" (#16725)"},{"Id":"478696590","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2019-08-08T21:30:01","Actor":"mmalerba","Number":"16724","RawContent":null,"Title":"Update MDC to latest alpha","State":"open","Body":"before this change: https://mmalerba-demo1.firebaseapp.com/mdc-chips\r\nafter this change: https://mmalerba-demo2.firebaseapp.com/mdc-chips","Url":"https://github.com/angular/components/pull/16724","RelatedDescription":"Open PR \"Update MDC to latest alpha\" (#16724)"},{"Id":"478683125","IsPullRequest":false,"CreatedAt":"2019-08-08T20:54:47","Actor":"Ardzii","Number":"16723","RawContent":null,"Title":"Accordion while looping over an FormArray","State":"open","Body":"#### Reproduction\r\n\r\nUse StackBlitz to reproduce your issue: stackblitz.com/edit/angular-42gobh \r\nSteps to reproduce:\r\n1.
