I believe this is a result of the NuProj participating in Package Restore dependency chains of projects with multiple target frameworks. The repository that reproduces the issue can be found here: \r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/TheXenocide/Xamarin-Forms-Labs\r\n\r\nI have tried a variety of experiments and was unable to get rid of all errors, though the state of the head of the repository is actually buildable, but not obviously. \r\n\r\nOpening the solution in Visual Studio on Windows will show a list of NU1201 errors and building will fail to restore packages, but if you use MSBuild /t:Restore on the command line even though it reports 100 errors related to target framework compatibility issues, the packages do successfully restore and then the entire solution can be built in visual studio (all assemblies compile, all nupkgs are generated, and our Directory.Build.targets customization automatically copies the packages the C:\\Packages (by default). The Visual Studio error pane shows 24 errors, but the Output window says Build Successful. Note that NuGet.exe restore does not work, only MSBuild /t:Restore successfully makes the solution buildable.\r\n\r\nOpening the solution in Visual Studio for Mac has some different oddities, but it feels like they may be related to our use of the \"MSBuild.Sdk.Extras\" NuGet SDK to allow us to use the new project format with our platform-specific Xamarin libraries (it doesn't think there's a \"Debug\" build target), but interestingly I'm able to use the MSBuild command line to both restore and build, each without any errors. Just for reference, I did try going back to the previous project format for the Android and iOS projects without using MSBuild.Sdk.Extras and, while Visual Studio for Mac got along with the projects better, this did not solve my package restore issues.\r\n\r\nAt first glance the obvious solution seems like I should just change TargetFrameworkVersion in each of the NuProj files to match the libraries they consume. I tried many varieties of this (TargetFramework netstandard2.0 in many cases, I tried TargetFrameworks to multi-target the NuProj, etc.) none of which work or seem necessary since the NuProj isn't actually producing a platform-dependent output itself; it infers  across all projects it references. In the end, no variety of TargetFramework(s) for my NuProj's worked as well as leaving them at the default TargetFrameworkVersion and just dealing with the fake errors on windows.\r\n\r\n## Software Versions\r\n\r\nNuGet.Build.Packaging Version: 0.2.2\r\n\r\nWindows:\r\n**MSBuild Version:** 15.7.179.6572\r\n**NuGet.exe Version:** 4.6.2.5055\r\n**Visual Studio Version:** 15.7.2\r\n**NuGetizer-3000 Version:** 0.2.6\r\n**OS Version:** Windows 10 x64 v1703 (15063.1088)\r\n\r\nMac OS:\r\n**MSBuild Version:** Microsoft (R) Build Engine version 15.6.0.0 (xplat-master/ca830585 Sun Mar 25 19:24:09 EDT 2018) for Mono\r\n**Visual Studio Version:** Visual Studio for Mac (Community) 7.5.2 (build 40)\r\n**OS Version:** macOS High Sierra 10.13.5"},{"Id":"7798541768","Type":"IssuesEvent","CreatedAt":"2018-06-08T18:30:55","Actor":"nkolev92","Repository":"NuGet/Home","Organization":"NuGet","RawContent":null,"RelatedAction":"closed","RelatedUrl":"https://github.com/NuGet/Home/issues/6704","RelatedDescription":"Closed issue \"Discovery of plugins\" (#6704) at NuGet/Home","RelatedBody":"Discovery of plugins...how do we discover the plugin in MsBuild/nuget.exe"},{"Id":"7798529684","Type":"IssuesEvent","CreatedAt":"2018-06-08T18:28:20","Actor":"TheXenocide","Repository":"NuGet/Home","Organization":"NuGet","RawContent":null,"RelatedAction":"opened","RelatedUrl":"https://github.com/NuGet/Home/issues/7010","RelatedDescription":"Opened issue \"NuGetizer NuProj inconsistent between Mac and Windows\" (#7010) at NuGet/Home","RelatedBody":"Visual Studio for Mac appears to have built-in support for .nuproj projects, but the projects generated by each are inconsistent.
