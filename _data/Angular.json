We cannot simply clean a single entry-point to a package. I think this is actually reasonable. Entry-points that have not been processed with be left untouched anyway by the cleaning. And if you have one entry-point that is outdated then you would want to fix all other outdated ones in the package anyway.\r\n\r\nOne thing this doesn't do is guarantee that, after you have run ngcc, that all packages in the `node_modules` folder are clean. Only those that would have been processed by ngcc are cleaned. But since we will now always clean on every run of ngcc, if there are any packages that were not cleaned on the one run of ngcc (because they were not needed) they will just get cleaned up they are needed. (The use case here is CLI).\r\n\r\nOne thing that we might need to check with the CLI team is whether they need to track changes to files due to the clean up.

So jest-preset-angular can only care about the `jest` part.\r\nI have discussed with the owner of `jest-preset-angular` in this PR https://github.com/thymikee/jest-preset-angular/pull/340.\r\n\r\nThis PR will add the basic support, and I will add the `fakeTimer` support in the following up PRs.","Url":"https://github.com/angular/angular/pull/35080","RelatedDescription":"Open PR \"feat: support jest\" (#35080)"},{"Id":"558022268","IsPullRequest":false,"CreatedAt":"2020-01-31T09:45:39","Actor":"elca-lan","Number":"35078","RawContent":null,"Title":"[Ivy] Incompatibility of Esm2015ReflectionHost with libraries compiled with NGCC","State":"open","Body":"# 🐞 bug report\r\n\r\n### Affected Package\r\nThe issue is caused by @angular/compiler-cli\r\n\r\n### Is this a regression?\r\nSort of. ~~It is a regression if you happen to upgrade from a < 3.7 to a >= 3.7 version of TypeScript~~\r\nIt did work with Angular 6 and it also worked with previous Angular 9 rc's (I'm pretty sure that rc.7 still worked).\r\n\r\n### Description\r\nThis was _very_ tricky to track down. The problem expressed in the form that the compiler complains when running ngcc on some of the project libraries that \"selector/template has to be a string\". This happened for cases where we use a constant from another package as the selector or template for a @Component annotation.\r\n\r\nA lot of debugging of the build process and some guesswork resulted in the following findings:\r\n* In essence, the Esm2015ReflectionHost is not capable of resolving expressions of the form `MyClass.MyPublicStaticStringProperty`... in _some situations_.\r\n* In the cases where it fails, the `reflectMember` check for `isPropertyAccess` simply does not work anymore because the syntax kind of the node is something completely unexpected.\r\n* In `getMembersOfClass` method, the nodes of `symbol.implementation.exports` for public static properties are of syntax kind `PropertyDeclaration` when \"normally\" (when things work), they are of kind `PropertyAccessExpression`\r\n* In the end, it all breaks down in the `StaticInterpreter.accessHelper` method because it ends up returning a `Reference` instead of the resolved string constant. This then triggers various extremely unhelpful downstream errors.\r\n\r\n\r\n## 🔬 Minimal Reproduction\r\nI don't have a minimal reproduction right now since I'm not sure how I can \"build\" this situation from scratch, but as soon as I find one, I will add it here. See my next issue comment for reproduction.\r\n\r\nAn \"abstraction\" of the code I am working with contains a component in a library in the \"packages\" directory\r\n```\r\n@Component({\r\n    selector: SharedConstants.SecondSelector,\r\n    template: `<div>...</div>`,\r\n})\r\nexport class SharedDerivedComponent extends BaseComponent {\r\n}\r\n```\r\nThis is referencing a constant from another library in the \"packages\" directory\r\n```\r\nexport declare class SharedConstants {\r\n    static readonly SecondSelector = \"lib-shared-derived\";\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\n## 🔥 Exception or Error\r\nSome of the messages that result from this are:\r\n<pre><code>\r\nNG1010: selector must be a string\r\n</code></pre>\r\n\r\n<pre><code>\r\nNG1010: template must be a string\r\n</code></pre>\r\n\r\n<pre><code>\r\nNG1006: Two incompatible decorators on class\r\n</code></pre>\r\n\r\n\r\n## 🌍  Your Environment\r\n\r\n**Angular Version:**\r\n<pre><code>\r\nAngular CLI: 9.0.0-rc.11\r\nNode: 10.16.0\r\nOS: win32 x64\r\n\r\nAngular: 9.0.0-rc.11\r\n... animations, cli, common, compiler, compiler-cli, core, forms\r\n... language-service, localize, platform-browser\r\n... platform-browser-dynamic, router\r\nIvy Workspace: Yes\r\n\r\nPackage                            Version\r\n------------------------------------------------------------\r\n@angular-devkit/architect          0.900.0-rc.11\r\n@angular-devkit/build-angular      0.900.0-rc.11\r\n@angular-devkit/build-ng-packagr   0.900.0-rc.11\r\n@angular-devkit/build-optimizer    0.900.0-rc.11\r\n@angular-devkit/build-webpack      0.900.0-rc.11\r\n@angular-devkit/core               9.0.0-rc.11\r\n@angular-devkit/schematics         9.0.0-rc.11\r\n@ngtools/webpack                   9.0.0-rc.11\r\n@schematics/angular                9.0.0-rc.11\r\n@schematics/update                 0.900.0-rc.11\r\nng-packagr                         9.0.0-rc.7\r\nrxjs                               6.5.4\r\ntypescript                         3.7.5\r\nwebpack                            4.8.3\r\n</code></pre>\r\n","Url":"https://github.com/angular/angular/issues/35078","RelatedDescription":"Open issue \"[Ivy] Incompatibility of Esm2015ReflectionHost with libraries compiled with NGCC\" (#35078)"},{"Id":"558017762","IsPullRequest":false,"CreatedAt":"2020-01-31T09:37:03","Actor":"Raza27630","Number":"35077","RawContent":null,"Title":"Uncaught SyntaxError: Unexpected token '<'  error after redirect to Angular PWA site after every new deployment","State":"open","Body":"# 🐞 bug report\r\n@angular/pwa\r\n\r\n### Description\r\nAfter every new deployment on production environment, we are facing Unexpected token error after being redirected from Authentication server\r\n\r\n\r\n## 🔬 Minimal Reproduction (Error Screenshot)\r\n\r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/56454429/73528622-85528080-4415-11ea-82c7-95ae8d2850ef.png)\r\n\r\n\r\n## 🔥 Exception or Error\r\n<pre><code>\r\nUncaught SyntaxError: Unexpected token '<'\r\n</code></pre>\r\n\r\n\r\n## 🌍  Your Environment\r\nAngular v8\r\nBrowser: Chrome: Version 73.0.3683.103 (Offizieller Build) (64-Bit)\r\n","Url":"https://github.com/angular/angular/issues/35077","RelatedDescription":"Open issue \"Uncaught SyntaxError: Unexpected token '<'  error after redirect to Angular PWA site after every new deployment\" (#35077)"},{"Id":"557995286","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2020-01-31T08:52:02","Actor":"krishnakenche","Number":"35076","RawContent":null,"Title":"docs(core): describe your change...","State":"open","Body":"Without square brackets for each selector in multiple selectors scenario is not working.

With View Engine (VE), both in Angular 8 and 9, the main bundle effectively only included what was required to render the shell:\r\n\r\n* Core framework,\r\n* Auth back-end,\r\n* Angular Material sidenav and toolbar,\r\n* Shell components.\r\n\r\nOnce Ivy is enabled, it includes additional code. E.g., in one application, we get those two source-map-explorer results:\r\n\r\n![Captura de pantalla de 2020-01-30 09-41-47](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/14163866/73437456-a8652d80-434c-11ea-943c-06cd59a25c8c.png)\r\n![Captura de pantalla de 2020-01-30 09-41-49](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/14163866/73437458-a8652d80-434c-11ea-8358-60b6b9e166c9.png)\r\n\r\nIn other app, the result is also bigger main bundles. In particular, it adds all the `@Injectable({providedIn: 'root})` services that are provided in a data-access internal library:\r\n\r\n![Captura de pantalla de 2020-01-30 10-45-15](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/14163866/73440039-e8c6aa80-4350-11ea-9ea3-cf3afea9f727.png)\r\n![Captura de pantalla de 2020-01-30 10-51-58](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/14163866/73440040-e8c6aa80-4350-11ea-9fba-40b51d545b4e.png)\r\n\r\n## 🔬 Minimal Reproduction\r\n<!--\r\nSimple steps to reproduce this bug.\r\n\r\nPlease include: commands run (including args), packages added, related code changes.\r\n\r\nIf reproduction steps are not enough for reproduction of your issue, please create a minimal GitHub repository with the reproduction of the issue. \r\nA good way to make a minimal reproduction is to create a new app via `ng new repro-app` and add the minimum possible code to show the problem. \r\nShare the link to the repo below along with step-by-step instructions to reproduce the problem, as well as expected and actual behaviour.\r\n\r\nIssues that don't have enough info and can't be reproduced will be closed.\r\n\r\nYou can read more about issue submission guidelines here: https://github.com/angular/angular-cli/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md#-submitting-an-issue\r\n-->\r\nThe issue is in a proprietary mono-repo of front-ends. We can provide access in Bitbucket or Github private repositories if necessary. To generate the bundles, we used\r\n\r\n```\r\nng build <project-name> --prod --source-map --localize=false\r\n```\r\n\r\nAnd only changed the tsconfig.json to set `angularCompilerOptions.enableIvy =

But the result is not stable.\r\n\r\n`caniuse-lite` has its own data in json file in npm package.  Both `build-angular` and `browserslist` have `caniuse-lite`.\r\nSince dependencies of `browserslist` is incremental like `caniuse-lite \"^1.0.30001017\"` and `caniuse-lite` of `build-angular` is fixed, the judgment result of `BuildBrowserFeatures` can change even if the source code of the repository is the same.\r\nModern browsers are updated frequently, so Angular-cli may not be updated in time.\r\n\r\nFor example:\r\n\r\nbuild-angular@0.803.23 includes \"caniuse-lite\": \"1.0.30001019\".\r\nThis version don't have the information of android chrome 79.\r\n`last 2 versions` on the `browserslist` can return 79-78.\r\nBuildBrowserFeatures.isFeatureSupported('es6-module') returns false, because featureStatus for android chrome 79 is undefined.\r\n\r\n### Describe the solution you'd like\r\n\r\nThe package.json of `@angular-devkit/build-angular` changes version dependencies of `caniuse-lite` incrementally like \"^1.0.0\".\r\n\r\n### Describe alternatives you've considered\r\n\r\nMake the `caniuse-lite` included in the browserlist exactly match the` caniuse-lite` of the build-angular.\r\n\r\n1. Point the version of `caniuse-lite` in resolutions.\r\n2. Remove `caniuse-lite` in package.json, use dependiecies of package.json in browserlist.\r\n\r\n\r\nOr, change the logic of `BuildBrowserFeatures.isFeatureSupported`.\r\nIt may be better to find the lowest supported version and judge the version with an inequality sign. If using `caniuse-api`, it can be easily. But impact on polyfill creation, etc. cannot be fully determined.","Url":"https://github.com/angular/angular-cli/issues/16790","RelatedDescription":"Open issue \"Make the version strategy of caniuse-lite incremental\" (#16790)"}],"ResultType":"GitHubIssue"},"material2-Issues":{"Issues":[{"Id":"558606777","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2020-02-01T22:19:00","Actor":"devversion","Number":"18365","RawContent":null,"Title":"fix(ng-add): do not overwrite version range specified in `ng add`","State":"open","Body":"The CLI inserts requested dependencies into the `package.json` before\r\n`ng add` schematics run.

The way the dragging sequence works is that the drop list keeps track of its items via `ContentChildren` and it registers itself with them once they're picked up by the `QueryList`. If an item doesn't have a container when the drag sequence is started, it is considered a \"standalone\" drag.\r\n\r\nThis becomes a problem with transplanted views (e.g. ones created by `cdk-table`) that use OnPush where we could end up in a situation where the items aren't picked up during the first pass, but when the user starts dragging, we trigger change detection and the `QueryList` is updated, but at that point it's too late, because we've already started the dragging sequence with a different set of information.\r\n\r\nThese changes work around the issue by assigning the container manually again through the drag directive.\r\n\r\nA couple of notes:\r\n* This is a second iteration of the fix. I went with this approach, because it doesn't require hacky timeouts and triggering change detection again. See the origin approach here: https://github.com/angular/components/commit/22afc3723258e6431b4603d96442daaffaa02f22\r\n* It's difficult to capture this in a test, because we'd have to duplicate half of the logic from `CdkTable` and we might still not be able to get the same change detection timing due to `TestBed`.\r\n\r\nFixes #18341.","Url":"https://github.com/angular/components/pull/18356","RelatedDescription":"Open PR \"fix(drag-drop): error when dragging items inside transplanted views with OnPush change detection\" (#18356)"},{"Id":"558178676","IsPullRequest":false,"CreatedAt":"2020-01-31T19:12:35","Actor":"fetis","Number":"18353","RawContent":null,"Title":"ng-template inside MatAutocomplete doesn't work","State":"closed","Body":"#### Reproduction\r\n\r\nhttps://stackblitz.com/edit/angular-wwwm2h\r\n\r\nSteps to reproduce:\r\n1.
