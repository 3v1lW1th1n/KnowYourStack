Since NGC by default tries to resolve referenced\r\nresources on initialization of the underlying TS program, it can result in unexpected\r\nmigration failures due to missing resource files.\r\n\r\nThis is especially an issue since the CLI wraps the `AngularCompilerProgram` with\r\nspecial logic (i.e. to support SCSS preprocessing etc.). We don't have all of this since\r\nwe instantiate a vanilla NGC program.\r\n\r\nThe solution to the problem is to simply treat resource requests as valid, and returning\r\na fake content. The migration is not dependent on templates or stylesheets.. so it's the\r\nsimplest and most robust solution.\r\n\r\nFixes #32826 \r\n\r\nNote: happy to update the commit message to `fix`, but I'm not sure if we want to list in the changelog. The migration is not officially running yet, and it would rather confuse people in the changelog I guess.","Url":"https://github.com/angular/angular/pull/32953","RelatedDescription":"Closed or merged PR \"refactor(core): undecorated-classes-with-di migration should ignore referenced resources\" (#32953)"},{"Id":"501389769","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2019-10-02T21:53:48","Actor":"devversion","Number":"32954","RawContent":null,"Title":"refactor(core): ensure all migrations work in version 9 with ivy enabled by default","State":"closed","Body":"* See individual commit descriptions for details.","Url":"https://github.com/angular/angular/pull/32954","RelatedDescription":"Closed or merged PR \"refactor(core): ensure all migrations work in version 9 with ivy enabled by default\" (#32954)"},{"Id":"501737994","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2019-10-02T21:32:34","Actor":"Goodwine","Number":"32974","RawContent":null,"Title":"docs(core): Document TestBed.get deprecation","State":"open","Body":"It was replaced by TestBed.inject, documenting such change.\r\n\r\n## PR Checklist\r\nPlease check if your PR fulfills the following requirements:\r\n\r\n- [x] The commit message follows our guidelines: https://github.com/angular/angular/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md#commit\r\n- [N/A] Tests for the changes have been added (for bug fixes / features)\r\n- [x] Docs have been added / updated (for bug fixes / features)\r\n\r\n\r\n## PR Type\r\nWhat kind of change does this PR introduce?\r\n\r\n<!-- Please check the one that applies to this PR using \"x\". -->\r\n\r\n- [ ] Bugfix\r\n- [ ] Feature\r\n- [ ] Code style update (formatting, local variables)\r\n- [ ] Refactoring (no functional changes, no api changes)\r\n- [ ] Build related changes\r\n- [ ] CI related changes\r\n- [x] Documentation content changes\r\n- [ ] angular.io application / infrastructure changes\r\n- [ ] Other...
