Since installing the Preview, NuGet.exe always picks version '16.0.218.25180' regardless of which Developer Command Prompt I use.  This seems similar to some issues reported in the past with previous Visual Studio Preview versions but I haven't found any reports yet for VS 2019.\r\n\r\nThis is specifically causing problems when trying to restore packages from the VS 2017 Developer Command Prompt for projects that use MSBuild variables like`$(MSBuildExtensionsPath32)` along with `$(VisualStudioVersion)` to compose paths.  The main offender of this is `Microsoft.WebApplication.targets`.  Since I'm using a VS 2017 Developer Command Prompt, `%VisualStudioVersion%` is \"15.0\" so `$(VisualStudioVersion)` is 15.0.  But since NuGet is picking MSBuild 16.0, variables like `$(MSBuildExtensionsPath32)` are things like `C:\\Program Files (x86)\\Microsoft Visual Studio\\2019\\Preview\\MSBuild`.  Combining these two paths leads to paths that don't exist, causing the project file to be invalid, causing the restore to fail.\r\n\r\nI've tried using NuGet 4.8.1, 4.9.1, and the latest version of the 5.0.0 preview (1.5718) and they all have this issue when run from the VS 2017 Developer Command Prompt:\r\n```\r\n>nuget-4.8.1-latest.exe help\r\nNuGet Version: 4.8.1.5435\r\n<snip>\r\n\r\n>nuget-4.8.1-latest.exe restore MyProj.csproj\r\nMSBuild auto-detection: using msbuild version '16.0.218.25180' from 'C:\\Program Files (x86)\\Microsoft Visual Studio\\2019\\Preview\\MSBuild\\Current\\bin'.\r\nMyProj.csproj(384,11): error MSB4226: The imported project \"C:\\Program Files (x86)\\Microsoft Visual Studio\\2019\\Preview\\MSBuild\\Microsoft\\VisualStudio\\v15.0\\WebApplications\\Microsoft.WebApplication.targets\" was not found.

Examples of this might be some additional downloads, extraction of embedded resources or pre-generation of immutable stuff (i.e. generating some `obj`-style code that never changes for a given shipped package (i.e. Xamarin/Java bindings for libraries, etc.).\r\n\r\nA potential solution would be to introduce a native MSBuild mechanism by which package authors, through the same build targets they can currently provide, can expose a target to run after nuget restore completed, like so:\r\n\r\n```xml\r\n<Target Name=\"DoSomeExpensiveFirstTimeThing\" \r\n        AfterTargets=\"AfterRestore\"\r\n        Inputs=\"$(MSBuildThisFileDirectory)\\..\\lib\\ref\\MyLib.dll\"\r\n        Outputs=\"$(MSBuildThisFileDirectory)\\..\\obj\\**\\*.cs\">\r\n…\r\n</Target>\r\n```\r\n\r\nThe benefits of this approach are many, among them:\r\n\r\n1. Supported in IDEs and command line restores as well\r\n2. No need for additional knowledge for package authors: plain MSBuild that works just as if you provided a target to run `AfterBuild`\r\n\r\nThe actual implementation of this could go in the main [Restore](https://github.com/NuGet/NuGet.Client/blob/dev/src/NuGet.Core/NuGet.Build.Tasks/NuGet.targets#L106) targets, where it could simply be a call to:\r\n\r\n```\r\n   <MSBuild Projects=\"$(MSBuildProjectFullPath)\" Targets=\"AfterRestore\" Properties=\"ForceEval=$([System.Guid]::NewGuid().ToString())\" />\r\n```\r\n\r\nwhere the actual `AfterRestore` would be declared simply as an empty target for the purposes of others to add `AfterTargets` or `BeforeTargets` to:\r\n\r\n```xml\r\n<Target Name=\"AfterRestore\" />\r\n```\r\n\r\nThe `ForceEval` property above should force MSBuild evaluation of the project again, which this time would include the targets provided by the restored nuget packages (if any), and run the `AfterRestore` target along with any package-provided targets that run before/after it.\r\n\r\n\r\nWe could use this mechanism in Xamarin packages that need to download additional files from sources we cannot distribute with our packages, such as additional Google-provided jar files and Android SDK files, native bindings or what-not :)\r\n"},{"Id":"8730322843","Type":"IssuesEvent","CreatedAt":"2018-12-10T23:05:37","Actor":"jmarolf","Repository":"NuGet/Home","Organization":"NuGet","RawContent":null,"RelatedAction":"opened","RelatedUrl":"https://github.com/NuGet/Home/issues/7616","RelatedDescription":"Opened issue \"Please contribute back to APEX proper\" (#7616) at NuGet/Home","RelatedBody":"In [nuget.client](https://github.com/NuGet/NuGet.Client/tree/dev/test/NuGet.Tests.Apex/NuGet.Tests.Apex/Apex) there are several useful test fixtures that other teams will need to copy in order to use.
